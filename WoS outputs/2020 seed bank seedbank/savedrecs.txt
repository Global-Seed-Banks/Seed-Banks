However, it remains unclear how genetic variation of ex situ plant collections reflects diversity of wild source populations. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the genetic representativeness of ex situ populations by comparing genetic diversity (i.e., AR, allelic richness; H-e, expected heterozygosity; PPB, percent polymorphic bands; and SWI, Shannon-Winner index), inbreeding coefficient (F-IS), and genetic differentiation between ex situ plant collections and their wild source populations. Genetic diversity (i.e., H-e, PPB, and SWI) was significantly lower in ex situ populations than their wild source populations, whereas genetic differentiation between ex situ and wild populations (ex-situ-wild F-ST), but not that among ex situ populations, was significantly higher than among wild populations. Outcrossing species, but not those with mixed mating system, had significantly lower genetic diversity in ex situ populations and significantly higher ex-situ-wild F-ST. When the collection size for ex situ conservation was >= 30 or 50, PPB, H-e, and ex-situ-wild F-ST were not significantly different between ex situ and wild populations, indicating a relatively high genetic representativeness. Collecting from the entire natural distribution range and mixing collections from different sources could significantly increase the genetic representativeness of ex situ populations. Type of ex situ conservation (i.e., planting or seed bank) had no effect on genetic representativeness. The effect size of H-e decreased and the effect size of ex-situ-wild F-ST increased as the duration of ex situ conservation increased. Our results suggest that current ex situ plant collections do not effectively capture the genetic variation of wild populations. Low genetic representativeness of ex situ populations was caused by both initial incomplete sampling from wild populations and genetic erosion during ex situ conservation. We emphasize that it is necessary to employ more thorough sampling strategies in future collecting efforts and to add new individuals where needed.				ming xi, jiang/E-6344-2017	ming xi, jiang/0000-0002-9719-3093; Wei, Xinzeng/0000-0002-5084-9390												0888-8892	1523-1739				FEB	2021	35	1					12	23		10.1111/cobi.13617		DEC 2020					WOS:000603487800001	32840007

WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) is one of the most difficult annual weeds to control in cultivation systems worldwide, especially in temperate regions. The widespread use of herbicides in the past two decades has selected resistant biotypes of ryegrass in crops in Southern Brazil. Ryegrass seeds are dormant when disseminated and germination can be staggered over time (crop-growing season). Knowledge of the germination behavior of seeds from herbicide-resistant plants has been little studied, but it would be very useful in integrated weed management. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the dynamics of the soil seed bank of two biotypes of L. multiflorum, one glyphosate-resistant and the other glyphosate-susceptible, under a no-tillage system. The treatments were arranged in a bifactorial scheme, using seeds from biotypes (glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible) with monthly periods of removal from field (one to 12 months). Seeds of each biotype were placed on the soil surface and covered with soil and straw to simulate no-till conditions. The percentage of germinated, dormant, and dead seeds was evaluated every 30 days. The ryegrass seed bank of glyphosate-susceptible and glyphosate-resistant biotypes was reduced to 11 and 15% of dormant seeds, respectively, at the end of 12 months. However, there was no variation in germination, dormancy, and seed mortality between susceptible and glyphosate-resistant ryegrass. Seeds of glyphosate-resistant biotype and susceptible showed germination behavior with similar dynamics in the soil over a period of 12 months.				; Silveira, Diogenes Cecchin/V-7277-2017	Schaeffer, Afonso Henrique/0000-0001-9671-8081; Silveira, Diogenes Cecchin/0000-0001-6653-4839												1444-6162	1445-6664				MAR	2021	21	1					3	10		10.1111/wbm.12218		DEC 2020					WOS:000601093600001

However, how NPP responds to sand burial in combination with changed precipitation regimes is still unclear. We conducted a field experiment with simultaneous sand burial and enhanced precipitation treatments to test the responses of both aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) in a semiarid desertified steppe in North China. The results showed that sand burial significantly affected the community ANPP but had no significant effects on the community BNPP. Sand burial increased the ANPP of rhizome grass and decreased the ANPP of perennial herbs, bunchgrass and annual herbs, with no significant effects on legume herbs, while enhanced precipitation did not significantly affect the community ANPP and BNPP or the ANPP of all five plant functional types (PFTs). Sand burial combined with enhanced precipitation mediated the vertical allocation of BNPP in the community. There are multiple significant relationships between the ANPP of different PFTs and the BNPP among the different soil layers. These findings will be conducive to understanding the consequences of grassland desertification under the background of climate change, with corresponding implications for grassland management and vegetation restoration in semiarid desertified areas.

Light sensitivity changes during dormancy induction in Polygonum aviculare L. seeds: development of a predictive model of annual changes in seed-bank light sensitivity in relation to soil temperature	WEED RESEARCH												Seeds of weed species require light to terminate dormancy and give way to germination. It is documented that sensitivity to light in Polygonum aviculare seeds increases during dormancy release. However, it is not known whether this sensitivity is lost during dormancy induction. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify the changes in dormancy level of P. aviculare seeds during secondary dormancy induction as measured by changes in sensitivity to light in relation to soil temperature. Polygonum aviculare seeds were stratified at 5oC until obtaining a minimum dormancy level. The seeds were then induced into secondary dormancy by burying them in pots containing soil which were stored at 10, 15, 20 and 25oC for different time-periods. Polygonum aviculare seeds were exhumed periodically, exposed to different light treatments (Pfr/Ptotal-pythochrome = 0.76, 0.03 and 7.6 x 10(-4)) or darkness, and incubated at 15oC to test germination. Our results showed that the high sensitivity to light acquired during dormancy release and decreased during dormancy induction at a rate that was temperature-dependent. These changes in sensitivity to light were quantified as a function of the accumulation of thermal-time over a base-temperature of 7.9oC during dormancy induction and were coupled with previous thermal-time index established for the dormancy release process. Both thermal-time indices allowed us to develop a model for the prediction of cyclic changes in sensitivity to light in relation to the thermal environment experienced by the seeds during burial. This model constitutes a valuable tool for predicting weed emergence in the field and to design management practices accordingly.

J	Gijsman, F; Vitt, P				Gijsman, Finote; Vitt, Pati			Seed size and capitulum position drive germination and dormancy responses to projected warming for the threatened dune endemic Cirsium pitcheri (Asteraceae)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Among coastal plant species at risk from rapid environmental changes is the North American Great Lakes dune endemic Cirsium pitcheri. Despite being listed as federally threatened, little is known about how C. pitcheri seed attributes influence germination and dormancy-break patterns in the context of climate change. Following a previous work where we found differences in the number and weight of C. pitcheri seeds among capitulum positions and study sites, here we examine the effects of seed attributes (capitulum position, seed weight, and site of origin) on the proportion and timing of C. pitcheri seed germination under temperature treatments that simulate projected warming in the Great Lakes (20/10, 25/10, and 30/10 degrees C day/night). Our results demonstrate that C. pitcheri produces diverse cohorts of seeds with seed attributes that significantly influence the timing and probability of germination over a 3-year soil seed bank. Cirsium pitcheri seed germination proportions were highest at 20 degrees C and decreased successively at 25 and 30 degrees C. Seeds from terminal capitula also had higher germination proportions and took longer to germinate than those from secondary capitula. Lastly, the effect of seed weight on germination probability depended on site of origin and capitulum position, with all effects varying in size and significance over time. Ultimately, our results highlight the considerable differences in germination patterns exhibited by seeds from different capitulum positions and sites of origin and provide insight into the dormancy-break patterns that C. pitcheri might experience under predicted temperature rise in the Great Lakes region of North America.

Thus, we hypothesized that below-ground, diversity is less affected by increased competition during land-use change compared to above-ground. Location Species-rich, oligotrophic grasslands in the Zelezne hory Mts, eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic. Methods We quantified above- and below-ground plant richness (roots and rhizomes, seed and bud bank) in grasslands subjected to seven years of experimental abandonment and fertilization. We used conventional species identification to measure richness above-ground and 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) gene to measure richness of roots and rhizomes; additionally, we used the shoot emergence method to measure soil seed and bud bank richness. Results While above-ground richness decreased with abandonment and fertilization, below-ground richness remained less affected or even increased compared to the control (traditional mowing). Overall, compared to above-ground the proportion of plant species found only below-ground as roots and rhizomes increased, particularly in the abandonment with fertilization treatment. Conclusions Below-ground plant diversity could potentially buffer against biodiversity losses during short-term land-use change. Our findings highlight that measuring the complete plant species diversity improves our understanding of processes that underlie plant diversity and coexistence and refine predictions of vegetation responses to biodiversity threats.

Dispersal and recruitment limitations in secondary forests	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Aims Secondary forests are expanding rapidly in tropical regions and could play an important role in conserving native biodiversity and stabilising global climate. The recovery rate of plant communities in secondary forests varies considerably due to mechanisms associated with seed dispersal and recruitment dynamics. We explored these mechanisms along a chronosequence of tropical secondary forests in an agricultural landscape that was extensively cleared. Location We explored these mechanisms along a chronosequence of secondary forests in tropical Australia. Methods We used selected plant traits to characterise plant species and compared community composition between demographic stages (i.e. soil seedbank, understorey and overstorey) and forest age categories. We collected soil samples to assess seedbank composition and used quadrants and transects to assess understorey and overstorey plant community composition at each site. Results For all demographic stages, we found that young (4-12 years) and intermediate-aged forests (16-20 years) were dominated by early successional, small-seeded species and traits associated with disturbed forests. In old secondary forest (23-34 years) some traits associated with late successional stages were present (e.g. large seeds, trees). However, the traits and species composition of mature forests remained distinct from all secondary forests. Across the chronosequence, forest age and demographic stage were significant factors in discriminating species and trait composition between forest sites. We found clear plant community similarities within demographic stages, despite the forest age differences. This suggests stronger limitations to dispersal and recruitment between demographic stages than between forest ages. Conclusions Our results show that secondary forests in this region assemble slowly with dispersal and recruitment limitations constraining their recovery. Although a successional transition in species and plant traits composition along the chronosequence is clear, similarities to mature forests remain low. The slow recovery of late successional and large-seeded species in these secondary forests suggests that active restoration of such species may be necessary if we want to enhance the capacity of these forests to conserve native biodiversity.

Despite the profound benefits obtained, anthropogenic disturbances are hindering its development. On the other hand, to ensure the sustainability of herbaceous species, communities and governments have been putting efforts in managing herbaceous species through the establishment of area exclosure (AE). Thus, the main importance of this research paper is to provide information about the role of AE on the restoration of herbaceous species. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of restoration on the herbaceous species following AE established on communal grazing land (CGL). A total of 124 and 73 quadrats of 1x1m(2) size were laid down at 50 m intervals along parallel transects at AE and CGL, respectively, and data were analyzed by t-test unequal variances using R-software. AE displayed higher plant species richness and diversity than the CGL and showed a significant difference (p<0.001). Similarly, the AE had significantly (p< 0.001) higher forage biomass than the CGL. In general, herbaceous species diversity index and species richness were significantly (p< 0.001) higher in the AE compared to the CGL. The study concluded that effective AE has the potential to enhance the restoration of herbaceous species and hence forage productivity.																	2096-4129	2332-8878				DEC 16	2020	6	1							1829993	10.1080/20964129.2020.1829993							WOS:000587328900001

In our study, we observed variations in wetland soil fauna on the shores of Lake Taihu, China. We examined the relationships between fauna and major environmental factors, and looked at the short-and long-term changes in reed wetlands under restoration and in the natural reed lakeshore. Outcomes: We identified 93 groups of soil fauna in different wetlands and found significant differences in the lakeshore wetlands' soil fauna assemblages, depending on the length of the restoration period. By analyzing the soil fauna community evenness, dominance, number of taxa, and diversity, we found minimal seasonal variation in the soil fauna community diversity and abundance. The abundance of soil fauna in the sites under restoration decreased with depth below the soil surface. The reed restoration was obvious in the succession of the soil fauna groups in the long-term site. Although the restoration had an overall positive long-term effect on the soil fauna communities, there were no obvious short-term changes in the number of individuals. Conclusion: The study explored various potential measures to restore soil fauna in the Lake Taihu wetland and developed a theoretical basis for restoring the lakeshore wetland ecosystem.

Seed bank as a persistent problem in matrix population models: From uncertainty to certain bounds	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Errors in the construction of matrix population models may lead to erroneous conclusions from modeling case studies, and neglecting the seed bank as a stage in the stage-structured model is a kind of 'persistent problem' common to many models of plant species. The problem arises due to uncertainties in the seed-related parameters that cannot be reliably estimated from empirical data. We investigate the consequences that including a seed bank into the underlying life cycle graph may have on lambda(1), the dominant eigenvalue of the calibrated matrix in the "no-seeds" model. Vital rates of that model were calibrated on a time series of data of the 'identified individuals' type gained in our former, 11-year case study on a local population of Androsace albana, a short-lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths. The calibration has resulted in 10 successive population projection matrices expressed in rational numbers, with a variety of lambda 1s distant from 1 by various amounts in both directions. To include the seed bank, we propose an integer-valued formalism with the following three unknown S-related parameters: S(t), the number of dormant seeds able to germinate at the current year of observation, t; S-p(t), the number of seeds produced this year, and S-m(t), the total number of seeds lost this year for various reasons. These preserve the rational form of all the other vital rates and holding the calibration equations true in the integer numbers, too. Some observable traits of A. albana plants help establish certain finite ranges of the three S-related parameters, and they enable finding the ensuing ranges of model outcomes by merely enumerating all the feasible triples. In this way, we get answers to pertinent questions about the lambda(1) of the seed model vs. its "no-seeds" counterpart and give a mathematical explanation of what we have obtained. An important conclusion is that the seed bank can principally not change the population growth into decline, nor vice versa, within the feasible ranges of parameters.																	0304-3800	1872-7026				DEC 15	2020	438								109284	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109284							WOS:000595067700011						
J	Dairel, M; Fidelis, A				Dairel, Mariana; Fidelis, Alessandra			The presence of invasive grasses affects the soil seed bank composition and dynamics of both invaded and non-invaded areas of open savannas	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												One of the major threats to tropical savannas globally is the invasion by alien grasses. In systems frequently disturbed, individuals can be recruited from the seed bank, and areas under natural regeneration can be more easily invaded when exotic newcomers are in the system, including the presence of invasive propagules in the soil seed bank. This study analyzed the dynamics of the soil seed bank in invaded and non-invaded areas of open savannas elucidating the potential of grass regeneration from the seed bank. Soil samples were collected in areas with different invasive grasses: Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R.D.Webster - synonym Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf, Melinis minutiflora Beauv. and areas with native vegetation. Soil seed bank was assessed using two techniques: seed counting and seedling emergence. Dominant species in each area influenced the seed bank composition, showing the highest densities from April to September. In invaded areas, the seed bank was composed mainly of invasive grasses that contributed to 98% (670 +/- 382 seeds.m(-2)) of total seeds. In non-invaded areas, the soil seed bank presented the highest density (65%, 135 +/- 38 seeds.m(-2)) of native species. However, the presence of invasive grasses was significant, with 35% of the total seeds belonging to U. brizantha. Although non-invaded areas have a higher potential for regeneration by native grasses, the presence of invasive grasses in the seed bank is an indication that the invasive species is already in the system and changes in the aboveground cover could accelerate the invasion process. Early management efforts towards establishing and/or established invasive species before seed dispersal could help reduce the soil seed bank load and should be carried out to control and avoid the establishment of African grasses, since they can dominate the seed bank in non invaded areas if they are present in neighboring areas, affecting the dynamics of plant communities.

Resilience of a native soil seed bank in a floodplain lake subjected to cropping, grazing and extended drought	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Ephemeral floodplain lakes are an integral component of inland wetland ecosystems and experience highly variable hydrology and prolonged dry periods. Although wetland soil seed banks are highly resilient to drought and floods, anthropogenic land use may add an additional stress. Understanding the recovery potential of wetland soil seed banks to different historical land uses helps manage and prioritise environmental water. In this study we explored the resilience of the wetland plant community in an ephemeral floodplain lake (Ita Lake, NSW, Australia). We collected soil samples during an extended dry phase (10 years) from two distinct zones within the lake, one of which was subjected to historical grazing and the other to lakebed ploughing and cropping. The samples were inundated under multiple inundation regimes to assess soil seed bank response. We found that the soil seed bank was viable, indicating a level of resilience not previously recorded for some plant species, namely Ricciocarpus natans, Chara spp., Nitella spp., Alternanthera denticulata and Eleocharis acuta. Although the results highlight the resilience of ephemeral wetland plant communities, intensive land uses such as ploughing and cropping will limit the availability of seeds to germinate, and the inundation regime will influence species composition and the subsequent likelihood of restoration.

A very straightforward method to keep Galinsoga infestations under control is by targeting the Galinsoga seedbank. To identify cropping systems able to reduce the seedbank size in vegetable-based cropping systems, the relationships between the seedbank size of Galinsoga species and prevailing soil/crop management practices and pedo-hydrological conditions were investigated. Hereto, the seedbank of the 0-20 cm topsoil layer was sampled in 50 organic vegetable fields and analysed according to the seedling emergence method. Field history data were collected for the past 5 years, and physical, chemical and microbial soil quality was determined. Galinsoga quadriradiata was the most frequent and abundant Galinsoga species in the weed seedbank. The genus Galinsoga was present in 90% of the soil weed seedbanks of organic vegetable fields but displayed wide variation in abundance. Smallest Galinsoga seedbanks were found in fields that were predominantly tilled with non-inversion implements or rotationally ploughed, and continuously cropped with competitive crops during the entire growing season (April 15-November 15). Contrary to G. quadriradiata, seedbank size of G. parviflora was closely related to soil organic carbon content and sand fraction. Remarkably, soils with a low level of easily plant-available phosphorus and concomitant high activity of arbuscular mycorrhizae had smaller G. quadriradiata seedbanks. To reduce Galinsoga infestations, fields should preferably be tilled without soil inversion, fertilised with organic amendments with low content of readily plant-available phosphorus and cropped with competitive crops all season long.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				FEB	2021	61	1					55	67		10.1111/wre.12457		DEC 2020					WOS:000598274100001						
J	Tamura, A				Tamura, Atsushi			Potential for soil seed banks to drive vegetation changes in windswept Sasa grasslands in eastern Japan	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Windswept Sasa grasslands are stable communities but may have the potential to change into other vegetation such as forests through germination of the soil seed bank. I investigated the compositions of the vegetation and soil seed banks in two windswept Sasa grasslands in the Tanzawa Mountains, eastern Japan: Ryugababa (RGB) and Fudonomine (FDM). Tall tree and sub-tall tree seedlings were present in both grasslands but were below a dense cover of Sasa hayatae. The number of buried viable seeds was estimated as 2831 seeds m(-2) comprising 39 species at RGB and 5786 seeds m(-2) comprising 58 species at FDM, 70% of which were graminoids and 5-23% of which were sub-tall trees at both sites. Most sub-tall tree seeds were Weigela decora, which forms windswept scrub forests around Sasa grasslands. No seedlings of S. hayatae germinated from any of the soil seed bank samples. A habitat type analysis of the soil seed banks showed that the "other" type (species that are infrequent or do not belong to a particular plant association) had the highest relative dominance (approximately 70%), followed by windswept scrub forest (13-25%) at both sites. Sorensen's similarity index between the vegetation and soil seed bank was low (39.6% in RGB and 47.1% in FDM), possibly because the dense Sasa cover prevents seedlings from germinating and growing. These results suggest that the soil seed banks in windswept Sasa grasslands have different species compositions from the vegetation and consequently have the potential to cause a shift to W. decora scrub forest.

Nonetheless, the biogeographic patterns of bacterioplankton and roles of AT and RT in community structuring and functional composition remain uncertain in large rivers. Here, we employ the Yangtze River, which is the third-longest river in the world, as model system. By using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tool of Tax4Fun, the geographical patterns of bacterioplanktonic taxonomic and predicted functional communities are investigated, and the relative importance of abundant and rare subcommunities in community structuring are explored. Results showed a clear spatial variation that the bacterioplanktonic communities of upper, middle and lower reaches of the river are significantly different from each other. Besides, the Three Gorges Dam exhibited impact on the bacterioplankton of upper reach whose community is relatively closer to that of the Poyang Lake. Both the abundant and rare subcommunities showed spatial variation along the river, which is similar to the total bacterioplanktonic community. The rare subcommunity comprised a majority of community diversity with 23.6% of the total sequences and 94.2% of the total OTUs. The rare subcommunity contributes a major part (56.8%) versus abundant subcommunity (16.3%) of the spatial variation of the total community. In addition, the non-RT exhibits more interactions with RT than with themselves, and all of the 33 keystone species are belonged to RT. Hence, the RT is critical for community structuring and assembling. By contrast, no obvious spatial effect was observed for the predicted functional community. The predicted functions of abundant and rare subcommunities are consistent with that of total community, despite their contrasting community composition. In summary, the rare subcommunity show significantly impact on the community structure and assembling, and play an important role in predicted function as 'seed bank' in the Yangtze River.

The propagule doesn't fall far from the tree, especially after short-interval, high-severity fire	ECOLOGY												Subalpine forests that historically burned every 100-300 yr are expected to burn more frequently as climate warms, perhaps before trees reach reproductive maturity or produce a serotinous seedbank. Tree regeneration after short-interval (<30-yr) high-severity fire will increasingly rely on seed dispersal from unburned trees, but how dispersal varies with age and structure of surrounding forest is poorly understood. We studied wind dispersal of three conifers (Picea engelmannii, Abies lasiocarpa, and Pinus contorta var. latifolia, which can be serotinous and nonserotinous) after a stand-replacing fire that burned young (<= 30 yr) and older (>100 yr) P. contorta forest in Grand Teton National Park (Wyoming, USA). We asked how propagule pressure varied with time since last fire, how seed delivery into burned forest varied with age and structure of live forest edges, what variables explained seed delivery into burned forest, and how spatial patterns of delivery across the burned area could vary with alternate patterns of surrounding live forest age. Seeds were collected in traps along 100-m transects (n = 18) extending from live forest edges of varying age (18, 30, and >100 yr) into areas of recent (2-yr) high-severity fire, and along transects in live forests to measure propagule pressure. Propagule pressure was low in 18-yr-old stands (similar to 8 seeds/m(2)) and similarly greater in 30- and 100-yr-old stands (similar to 32 seeds/m(2)). Mean dispersal distance was lowest from 18-yr-old edges and greatest from >100-yr-old edges. Seed delivery into burned forest declined with increasing distance and increased with height of trees at live forest edges, and was consistently higher for P. contorta than for other conifers. Empirical dispersal kernels revealed that seed delivery from 18-yr-old edges was very low (<= 2.4 seeds/m(2)) and concentrated within 10 m of the live edge, whereas seed delivery from >100-yr-old edges was >4.9 seeds/m(2) out to 80 m. When extrapolated throughout the burned landscape, estimated seed delivery was low (<49,400 seeds/ha) in >70% of areas that burned in short-interval fire (<30 yr). As fire frequency increases, immaturity risk will be compounded in short-interval fires because seed dispersal from surrounding young trees is limited.

Rice blast caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is a devastating disease that affects rice yields and grain quality, resulting in substantial economic losses annually. Because the fungus evolves rapidly, the resistance conferred by most the single blast-resistance genes is broken after a few years of intensive agricultural use. Therefore, effective resistance breeding in rice requires continual enrichment of the reservoir of resistance genes, alleles, or QTLs. Seed banks represent a rich source of genetic diversity; however, they have not been extensively used to identify novel genes and alleles. Results We carried out a large-scale screen for novel blast-resistance alleles in 1883 rice varieties from major rice-producing areas across China. Of these, 361 varieties showed at least moderate resistance to natural infection by rice blast at rice blast nurseries in Enshi and Yichang, Hubei Province. We used sequence-based allele mining to amplify and sequence the allelic variants of the major rice blast-resistance genes at the Pi2/Pi9 locus of chromosome 6 from the 361 blast-resistant varieties, and the full-length coding region of this gene could be amplified from 107 varieties. Thirteen novel Pi9 alleles (named Pi9-Type1 to Pi9-Type13) were identified in these 107 varieties based on comparison to the Pi9 referenced sequence. Based on the sequencing results, the Pi2/Pi9 locus of the 107 varieties was divided into 15 genotypes (including three different genotypes of Pi9-Type5). Fifteen varieties, each representing one genotype, were evaluated for resistance to 34 M. oryzae isolates. The alleles from seven varieties with the highest resistance and widest resistance spectra were selected for transformation into the susceptible variety J23B to construct near-isogenic lines (NILs). These NILs showed resistance in a field test in Enshi and Yichang, indicating that the seven novel rice blast-resistance tandem-repeat regions at the Pi2/Pi9 locus of chromosome 6 could potentially serve as a genetic resource for molecular breeding of resistance to rice blast. Conclusions The thirteen novel Pi9 alleles identified in this study expand the list of available of blast-resistance alleles. Seven tandem-repeat regions of the Pi2/Pi9 locus from different donors were characterized as broad-spectrum rice blast-resistance fragments; these donors enrich the genetic resources available for rice blast-resistance breeding programs.

The amounts of sexual and asexual reproduction differ within some species relying on geographic location and environmental factors. Here, we studied the reproductive strategies of different geographic Zostera japonica populations, S1 and S2 at Swan Lake lagoon (SLL), and H1 and H2 at Huiquan Bay (HQB), in northern China. The duration of flowering at SLL was longer than at HQB, whereas flowering initiation at HQB occurred earlier than at SLL. In addition, the timing of seed maturation at HQB occurred earlier than at SLL. The allocation to sexual reproduction at SLL was greater than at HQB. The maximum potential seed production was greatest at S1 (22228.52 +/- 8832.46 seeds.m(-2)), followed by S2 (21630.34 +/- 9378.67 seeds.m(-2)), H2 (7459.60 +/- 1779.33 seeds.m(-2)), and H1 (2821.05 +/- 1280.57 seeds.m(-2)). The seasonal changes in total shoot density and biomass were small at HQB. There was a relatively large number of overwintering shoots at HQB because of the higher average temperature during winter. The allocation to sexual reproduction was lower than at SLL, and no seedlings were observed at HQB during our study. Thus, the population of Z. japonica at HQB was maintained by asexual reproduction. Compared with HQB, the biomass of overwintering shoots at SLL was less than 30 g dry weight.m(-2). The Z. japonica at SLL relied on asexual and sexual reproduction to maintain the population. The results show the necessity of understanding local reproductive strategies before starting restoration and management projects. The study provides fundamental information and guidance for the conservation and restoration of seagrass beds.

Dominant drivers of plant community assembly vary by soil type and time in reclaimed forests	PLANT ECOLOGY												Information on plant community assembly mechanisms is limited on forest reclamation sites after mining in the Canadian boreal forest. We assessed the change in plant community composition after Year 2 and Year 5 on species-rich forest floor mineral mix (FFMM) and species-poor peat mineral mix (PMM) reclamation soils by examining assembly mechanisms, i.e., seed bank, seed rain, biotic dispersal, vegetative expansion, and competition. Initial plant cover and diversity were greater on FFMM due to non-native species originating from the seed bank, which had 5x more seeds in the FFMM. By Year 5, both soil types had approximately 40% cover and 80 species richness due to the addition of wind and biotic-dispersed species and were characterized by a shift towards native species. Native forbs using vegetative reproduction expanded up to 2 m from FFMM into PMM. At Year 5 competition does not seem to have a large role in the structuring of the vegetation community. Overall, multiple factors were involved in structuring plant communities on reclamation sites, but we observed a general convergence between plant communities on different soil types in a relatively short period of time.

Revisiting the 'bank of microscopic forms' in macroalgal-dominated ecosystems	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Theoretical ecological models, such as succession and facilitation, were defined in terrestrial habitats, and subsequently applied to marine and freshwater habitats in intertidal and then subtidal realms. One such model is the soil seed bank, defined as all viable seeds (or fruits) found near the soil surface that facilitate community restoration/recovery. "Banks of microscopic forms" have been hypothesized in aquatic habitats and recent work from aquaculture has highlighted dormancy in algal life cycle stages. To reinvigorate the discussions about these algal banks, we discuss differences in life cycles, dispersal, and summarize research on banks of macroalgal stages in aquatic ecosystems that may be easier to explore with modern advances in molecular technology. With focus on seminal work in global kelp forest ecosystems, we present a pilot study in northern California as proof of concept that Nereocystis luetkeana and Alaria marginata stages can be detected within kelp forests in the biofilm of rocks and bedrock using targeted primers long after zoospore release. Considering the increased interest in algae as an economic resource, [blue] carbon sink, and as ecosystem engineers, the potential for "banking" macroalgal forms could be a mechanism of resilience and recovery in aquatic populations that have complex life cycles and environmental cues for reproduction. Molecular barcoding is becoming an important tool for identifying banks of macroalgal forms in marine communities. Understanding banks of macroalgal stages, especially in deforested habitats with intense disturbance and grazer pressure, will allow researchers and marine resource managers to facilitate this natural process in recovery of the aquatic system.

Among environmental factors, animal disturbances deserve special consideration. In this study we test the hypothesis that disturbances resulting from the burrowing activity of Ctenomys affect plant emergence (sexual and asexual) in the south of the cold Puna desert. Richness and abundance of seedlings and sprouts growing in areas disturbed or undisturbed by Ctenomys were recorded at the beginning and at the end of the vegetative season. In general terms, the activity of Ctenomys does not affect richness of emerging species, but does have a significant influence on the type of emergence. Analyses between areas revealed that seedling emergence was significantly higher than sprout emergence in areas showing Ctenomys activity, whereas no significant differences were found between types of emergence in undisturbed areas. Although vegetative emergence was important, plant emergence from seeds appears to be relevant to the recolonization of areas disturbed by Ctenomys.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				DEC	2020	101	6					1601	1608		10.1093/jmammal/gyaa118							WOS:000634890900017

Nucleation increases understory species and functional diversity in early tropical forest restoration	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Degraded tropical forests that were converted into pastures dominated by exotic grasses are a challenge for restoration due to arrested succession. Nucleation is a suitable strategy to restore such abandoned pastures as it can overcome seed and site limitation, and would foster the recovery of structural, functional, and species diversity. To explore the outcomes of different nucleation techniques in terms of richness, functional diversity, resource offer, and species and trait composition during the first year after implementation in an abandoned pasture in the tropical Andes, we conducted a field experiment with four nucleation treatments established in 1m(2) subplots, i.e. natural regeneration (control), seed rain transfer, seed bank transfer, and pre-grown plant mats. Number of species, functional diversity, proportion of natives, flowering and fruiting were response variables of the nucleation treatments and time since restoration using linear mixed-effects models. Species and trait composition trajectories over time were depicted with NMDS. Species richness and functional diversity of understory vegetation increased over time and with nucleation, being significantly higher by the final survey. Seed bank transfer introduced most species to the area in comparison to natural regeneration. Functional diversity, proportion of native, flowering, and fruiting species changed with time albeit with no differences among treatments. Species and trait composition showed convergence over time, which stresses the strong influence of environmental filtering in early restoration of abandoned pastures. Although positive aspects of planting trees and shrubs cannot be neglected, we argue that the incorporation of (several) more sophisticated nucleation techniques is beneficial for restoration of tropical forests.

Amendments Activate Soil Seed Bank in Greenhouse Study, Indicating Potential for Improved Restoration Outcomes	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												The potential for soil seed banks to contribute to effective habitat restoration is not well understood, but seed bank activation could offer a cost-effective solution for vegetation establishment of degraded sites. Our study site had been affected by deforestation and aeolian contamination from copper smelting, resulting in significant erosion and large unvegetated patches. To evaluate the potential value of soil seed bank activation for restoring intermountain grasslands and mountain forests, we set up a greenhouse-scale seed bank experiment to test the effect of nutrient amendments previously utilized in field trials in the study area. We also tested the effect of native seed augmentation on diversity. Our results showed that the tested soils had a significant seed bank as 16 volunteer plant species emerged, of which ten were native and six were non-native. Nutrient amendments did not affect grass seedling numbers, but one treatment (the addition of biofertilizer) increased forb numbers. All treatments, except synthetic fertilizer increased the total aboveground biomass of the emerging seedlings. Native seed augmentation increased grass and forb seedling numbers, but, the impact of nutrient amendments changed with seed augmentation, and certain nutrient treatments even reduced seedling emergence. While biofertilizer combined with mycorrhizae did not affect grass or forb seedling numbers, it did increase plant biomass. Activating soil seed banks with nutrient additions may be a feasible approach for ecological restoration. However, there are significant differences among treatments. Further studies would be necessary to reveal the specific effects of nutrient addition on soil seed bank activation, especially in field settings.																	1543-4060	1543-4079				DEC	2020	38	4					228	236		10.3368/er.38.4.228							WOS:000620345500009

Musa acuminata Colla, the most important banana crop wild relative, is distributed in tropical and subtropical Asian and Pacific rainforests and colonizes disturbed sites. The role of temperature in stimulating/inhibiting germination to detect disturbance when canopy gaps are formed is not well known. We assessed seed germination thermal requirements of three subspecies of M. acuminata using nine seed accessions which had been stored in the Millennium Seed Bank. Diurnally alternating temperature cycles were almost completely essential for germination compared with constant temperatures. Germination was optimal when the upper temperature of a diurnal cycle was at 35 degrees C; the lower temperature of the cycle was less important. Subspecies occurrence coordinates were used to extract climate temperature data which were then compared against the temperature requirements for germination from our experiment results. Maximum temperatures of the warmest month across subspecies ranges were close to but below optimal germination temperatures, as were diurnal ranges, suggesting soil-warming at the micro-climate level following gap creation is important for M. acuminata seed germination. Additionally, pre-treatment for 3 months at 60% relative humidity at constant 25 degrees C improved germination from 14 +/- 10 (mean, standard deviation) to 41 +/- 29% suggesting a period in the soil seed bank under the canopy may increase sensitivity to alternating temperature cycles. Overall viability was low (49 +/- 28%), and considerable variance was caused by the different accessions. Germination remained somewhat inconsistent.

These structural and functional shifts are often assumed to impact wildlife but this has rarely been measured directly. Likewise, evaluation of weed removal programs rarely considers benefits to fauna, thereby limiting information that could inform management decisions. We used an experimental approach to test the impacts of removing invasive buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), a globally significant invader of dryland systems, on reptiles, a prominent component of the Australian desert fauna. A combination of mechanical and herbicide treatment was applied to replicate plots in areas that had been invaded for at least two decades and changes to ground cover and plant and reptile assemblages were monitored over six years and compared to still-invaded control plots. Following treatment, native plants re-established without the need for reseeding or planting, especially during a period of high rainfall, when positive effects on reptiles also became apparent. The abundance and species richness of reptiles increased at all plots during the mesic period, but less so in control plots, and remained higher at treated plots thereafter, although this was only significant at some times. Post-treatment 27 of 36 species were captured more frequently in treated plots and only four species, all with very low captures, were captured more often in invaded control plots. This consistent trend among species suggests negative impacts of buffel grass on reptiles are likely caused by broad factors such as reduced prey or habitat diversity. Together with concurrent research at the same sites, our results provide experimental evidence that removing buffel grass from heavily invaded areas, even at small scales, benefits a variety of native flora and fauna. Until landscape-scale options are available, restoration of smaller areas within buffel-invaded landscapes can help to pre serve native seed banks and adult plants, reduce fire impacts, and provide patches of favourable habitat for fauna. The creation of 'islands' of restored native vegetation deserves further consideration as an effective intervention that could help to achieve short and long-term conservation goals in grass-invaded dryland ecosystems.

(eelgrass)	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Seagrass meadows are recognized as critical and among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. There is an urgent need to develop techniques to restore and preserve these vital coastal ecosystems. So far little work has been done to develop effective long-term storage methods for desiccation sensitive seagrass seeds. In the present study, we developed a long-term seed storage method for desiccation sensitive seagrass seeds using Zostera marina L. as model species. During the storage, Z. marina seeds from the 0 degrees C treatments had lower seed loss percentages and high seed vigor, compared to the 4 degrees C treatments. Salinity significantly influenced seed vigor after storage. Seeds stored at a salinity of 40-50 psm had the highest vigor. Wet storage at a salinity of 40-50 psm and 0 degrees C was the optimal long-term storage condition, considering factors such as seed loss percentage, seed germination percentage, and seed germination value during or after the long-term storage. By controlling temperature and salinity, we could store Z. marina seeds for ca. 17 months because the collection of the seeds from reproductive shoots and maintain low seed losses and high seed vigor. The findings revealed the optimal conditions for long-term storage of desiccation sensitive Z. marina seeds and provided a useful reference for the establishment of Z. marina seed banks. Our results could also provide information to support Z. marina seagrass meadow restoration efforts using seeds. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Habitats after Salvage Logging	FORESTS												After wildfires, emergency actions and post-fire management are implemented to mitigate fire damage. Salvage logging is a tool often applied to burned stands, but despite being a post-fire forest management tool to restore ecosystem functions, its ecological effects remain poorly understood. In the Mediterranean Basin, where land use and land-use change are bringing about changes in drought periods and fire regimes, optimal treatments should be included in adaptive management in order to increase resilience and reduce vulnerability. In July 2012, a mid- to high-burn severity fire burned almost 7000 ha of an Aleppo pine forest (Pinus halepensis Mill.) in southeastern Spain. Five years later (late spring 2017), we designed an experimental study to monitor four stand categories on a burn severity basis (unburned mature stands, low-burn severity stands, and high-burn severity stands) and a salvage logging operation carried out 6 months after the fire in high-burn severity areas. We set 60 circular plots (15 in each treatment scenario) and 180 linear transects (3 per plot, 45 per scenario) to check the ecological facilitation of pine trees and snags (canopy size and/or perch effect). We estimated plant alpha diversity (floristic richness, abundance and dominance indices) and post-fire plant recovery (pine recruitment and adaptive traits). Fire depleted the system's diversity, but in low-severity burning areas some basic functions remained intact (e.g., soil protection). We found that high-burn severity very negatively impacted ecosystem functions through the removal of duff and litter leaving unprotected soil. Collecting wood reduced pine regeneration and growth, which was considerable in the areas that suffered high-burn severity. The burned snags did not appear to act as perches resulting in seed dispersal. Obligate seeders were determined to be an efficient strategy for facing high-severity fires, whereas resprouters response showed no clear burn severity pattern despite being present in all the scenarios. Therefore, salvage logging did not affect the recovery of some ecosystem properties/features (such as plant total cover or litter cover), although retaining dead pines facilitated pine regeneration. Thus, leaving snags in areas affected by high-burn severity in ecosystems mainly modelled by fires is proposed. However, the ecosystem response could be widely variable and influenced by local abiotic factors, so restoration might not be as effective as in the current proposal.

Natural Re-Sowing with Herbicides and Plant Growth Regulators	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) is the main winter weed of crops in Southern Brazil. High competitiveness, adaptability, widespread resistance to herbicides and seed dormancy make the plant a permanent problem. Herbicides, as well as plant growth regulators, can be used as a management option for ryegrass seed production, however there is no consensus among authors at which stage of the plant the application is most effective. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the production and physiological quality of ryegrass seeds in response to the application of herbicides and plant growth regulators in three stages of plant development (inflorescence emergence, flowering and fruit development). Each treatment consisted of applying two different doses of each of the active ingredients: ammonium glufosinate, clethodim, glyphosate, iodosulfuron-methyl, paraquat and 2,4-D (herbicides); ethephon and trinexapac-ethyl (plant growth regulators), still an untreated control, totaling 17 treatments for each stage of development. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, with three replications. The variables evaluated were: seed production (kg ha(-1)), thousand seed weight (g), viability (%), germination (%), first germination count (%), dormant seeds (%) and dead seeds (%). The ryegrass seed production reduced 100% with clethodim, glyphosate, ammonium glufosinate or paraquat applied in the inflorescence emergence or flowering stages. In the fruit development stage, all treatments (herbicides and plant growth regulators) caused deleterious effects on seed production, the greatest effect occurred with paraquat (95%). Paraquat, ammonium glufosinate and clethodim affected the physiological quality of the seeds when applied in fruit development stage. This research demonstrated that the application of herbicides in the ryegrass reproductive stage decreases its seedbank replenishment (natural re-sowing), with the potential to harm its progeny.

Impact of Water Level on Species Quantity and Composition Grown from the Soil Seed Bank of the Inland Salt Marsh: An Ex-Situ Experiment	LAND												The near elimination of inland salt marshes in Central Europe occurred throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and the currently remaining marshes exist in a degraded condition. This work examines the impact of groundwater level on the growth of plants from a seed bank obtained from a degraded salt marsh in proximity to still existing one through an ex-situ experiment. An experimental tank was set up with the sample seed bank experiencing differing levels of water level. There were 1233 specimens of 44 taxa grown from the seed bank, of which 5 species were abundant, and 10 species are considered as halophytes. Only Lotus tenuis from halophytes was more abundant, and only five species of halophytes were represented by more than three individuals. The water level has a significant impact on the number of species (based on linear regression analysis) as well as species distribution among different water level treatments (a non-metric multidimensional analysis (nMDS) followed by linear regression). The results show a strong negative relationship between the average water level and the number of species. The water level did not affect the species composition of halophytes, but differences in individual species abundances were found among the halophytes. The species Bupleurum tenuissimum, Crypsis schoenoides, Melilotus dentatus, and Plantago maritima grew on the drier and non-inundated soils. Tripolium pannonicum, Spergularia maritima, and Lotus tenuis grew on both wet and dry soils. Trifolium fragiferum and Bolboschoenus maritimus were found in places with water stagnant at the soil level. Pulicaria dysenterica grew in inundated soil.

J	Nam, KH; Han, SM				Nam, Kyong-Hee; Han, Sung Min			Seed Germination of Sunflower as a Case Study for the Risk Assessment and Management of Transgenic Plants Used for Environmental Remediation in South Korea	SUSTAINABILITY												In South Korea, the safety management of living modified organisms (LMOs) is regulated by seven government agencies depending on their use, and the Ministry of Environment is in charge of LMOs to manage environmental remediation and effects on natural ecosystems. This study aimed to develop appropriate research tools to determine the factors affecting the invasiveness of transgenic plants used for environmental remediation. We examined the persistence of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as a candidate by comparing the seed viability at different controlled temperatures and soil depths (ranging from 0 to 30 cm). The germination characteristics of seeds significantly differed between cultivars and temperatures. The field trials indicated that seeds buried at a depth of 30 cm mostly decayed within three weeks, whereas those buried at 0 cm persisted for eight weeks but decayed after sixteen weeks, implying a significant interaction between burial depth and seed persistence. At all soil depths, no dormant seeds were detected over one week after burial. These results suggest that sunflower seeds could not be successfully established under our experimental conditions. Since seeds on the soil surface demonstrated the highest rates of germination, such seeds may require particularly careful management to prevent unintended effects on ecosystems.																		2071-1050				DEC	2020	12	23							10110	10.3390/su122310110							WOS:000597608600001

While previous research has demonstrated considerable small-scale variation in seagrass abundance and structure, studies teasing apart local from large-scale variation are scarce. We determined how different biogeographic scenarios, under varying environmental and genetic variation, explained variation in the abundance and structure (morphology and biomass allocation), epiphytes and sexual reproduction intensity of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa. Regional and local-scale variation, including their temporal variability, contributed to differentially explain variation in seagrass attributes. Structural, in particular morphological, attributes of the seagrass leaf canopy, most evidenced regional seasonal variation. Allocation to belowground tissues was, however, mainly driven by local-scale variation. High seed densities were observed in meadows of large genetic diversity, indicative of sexual success, which likely resulted from the different evolutionary histories undergone by the seagrass at each region. Our results highlight that phenotypic plasticity to local and regional environments need to be considered to better manage and preserve seagrass meadows.

J	Vinograd, A; Zaady, E; Kigel, J				Vinograd, Arie; Zaady, Eli; Kigel, Jaime			Abandoned corrals: colonization and vegetation recovery of ephemeral habitats in silvo-pastoral systems	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Management of silvo-pastoral systems in planted and natural forests in semi-arid Mediterranean regions often employs seasonal night corrals for animal protection. This management system changes the spatial distribution of animal excreta, resulting in a net transfer of soil mineral resources and their accumulation in the corrals. After abandonment, corrals are colonized by ruderal species, becoming focal sources for their spread in the forest. We aimed to implement a rational management of seasonal sheep corrals based on a better understanding of the vegetation processes occurring in abandoned corrals, in order to alleviate their negative impact in the forest. Methods Relationships between temporal changes in the vegetation, the soil seed-bank and levels of soil nutrients were studied in a chronosequence of abandoned sheep corrals and compared with nearby reference plots in planted Eucalyptus forests grazed by sheep in the semi-arid North-Western Negev, Israel. The region has a bi-seasonal Mediterranean climate, with high dominance of annual species in the grazing range. Important Findings Abandoned sheep corrals were colonized by seeds of ruderals originating in older abandoned corrals. Subsequent successional changes occur at a slow rate, driven by the depletion of soil resources in the abandoned corrals, and were still in progress 20 years after abandonment. Ruderals were gradually replaced, first by taller grasses and followed by short grasses, but most forbs and particularly geophytes did not recover during this period. Recovery of the original herbaceous vegetation in the corrals was through seed dispersal from the surrounding vegetation, not from the original soil seed-bank remaining in the corrals after abandonment. Ruderal species in the grazed, planted forests behave as patch-tracking metapopulations. Their persistency depends on constant creation of new corrals compensating for the gradually dwindling populations in older abandoned corrals, and on the availability of dispersal vectors.																	1752-9921	1752-993X				DEC	2020	13	6					722	731		10.1093/jpe/rtaa062							WOS:000593099700007

BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Earleaf acacia (Acacia auriculiformis A.Cunn. ex Benth) is a fast-growing, evergreen tree from Australia that was introduced into the United States as an ornamental plant, but it has become a serious plant invader in Florida, USA. Spread of this invasive tree has accelerated in recent years and current control efforts do not meet conservation or land management needs. Our objective was to review and summarize available information to determine if pursuing classical biological control for earleaf acacia is warranted. Feasibility studies such as this identify pitfalls and conflicts before a project begins, increasing the likelihood that biological control efforts will be successful. This review compiles a list of non-target species based on their geographic overlap with the weed invasion and their relatedness to A. auriculiformis. Feasibility is also determined based on other criteria including conflicts of interest and availability of potential biological control agents. We also present a report from our initial explorations for natural enemies in the native range of Australia. Eighty-nine arthropod and one pathogen species have been identified feeding on earleaf acacia in the native range. Several of the arthropods found have the potential to be host specific and impactful. Few potential conflicts of interests were identified. These findings paired with the high-risk assessment for invasion and lack of sustainable and effective control methods, supports our conclusion that earleaf acacia is a promising target for classical biological control.

The arable flora is one of the species groups that suffered the steepest declines in European cultural landscapes. Despite their fundamental importance in agroecosystems as the basis of the food web, few studies have tested the effectiveness of different agri-environment measures on the arable flora in replicated field trials over several consecutive years. In a four-year participative project with the farmers, we recorded the effects of four agri-environment measures, namely conservation field margins (CFM), annual fallow strips (fallows), alternately managed biennial flower strips (AFS), and perennial flower strips (PFS), on the species richness, plant cover and composition of the non-crop vegetation in 67 intensively managed arable fields in Northwest Germany. Compared to conventionally managed field edges, all measures led to a large increase in total plant cover (median values across measures and years: 68.5 vs. 9.5 %) and doubling of species richness (21 vs. 9 species per plot), promoting not only generalist species but also the typical arable flora (17 vs. 7 species, 56.5 vs. 8 % cover). Of the 207 plant species recorded during sampling, 43 (including 16 typical arable species) were solely found in measures. All measures promoted forbs more than graminoids, while annual species benefited especially from CFM and fallows. The overall effects on diversity and cover remained stable over the 3-yr implementation period but were significantly influenced by interannual weather fluctuation. Spillover effects of the measures into adjacent conventionally managed crops were not detectable. We conclude that, if well-managed, all tested measures can have a positive effect on the native arable flora even in long-term intensively farmed landscapes. However, especially CFM and the annual fallows are particularly effective in naturally restoring and maintaining arable plant diversity. The limited occurrence of 1/4 of typical arable plant species on less than four fields indicates severely impoverished soil seed banks in intensive farmland. Therefore, the re-introduction of native, rare arable plant species through seed mixtures should be considered in order to promote local diversity and save local populations of these species.

J	Blath, J; Tobias, A				Blath, Jochen; Tobias, Andras			Invasion and fixation of microbial dormancy traits under competitive pressure	STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS												Microbial dormancy is an evolutionary trait that has emerged independently at various positions across the tree of life. It describes the ability of a microorganism to switch to a metabolically inactive state that can withstand unfavourable conditions. However, maintaining such a trait requires additional resources that could otherwise be used to increase e.g. reproductive rates. In this paper, we aim for gaining a basic understanding under which conditions maintaining a seed bank of dormant individuals provides a "fitness advantage" when facing resource limitations and competition for resources among individuals (in an otherwise stable environment). In particular, we wish to understand when an individual with a "dormancy trait" can invade a resident population lacking this trait despite having a lower reproduction rate than the residents. To this end, we follow a stochastic individual-based approach employing birth-and-death processes, where dormancy is triggered by competitive pressure for resources. In the large-population limit, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition under which a complete invasion of mutants has a positive probability. Further, we explicitly determine the limiting probability of invasion and the asymptotic time to fixation of mutants in the case of a successful invasion. In the proofs, we observe the three classical phases of invasion dynamics in the guise of Coron et al. (2017, 2019). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To gain in-depth understandings on how biological invasion affects the natural recovery potential of native vegetation, this study focused on the soil seed banks of reed (Phragmites australis) communities with different degrees of Alternanthera philoxeroides invasion. The soil seed banks were germinated under three light conditions (shading, natural light and supplementary light) and three water level conditions (immersed, 3 cm water flooded and 30 cm water flooded). The effects of the different degrees of A. philoxeroides invasion, light conditions, and water levels on the soil seed bank germination of reed communities were compared and analyzed. Our studies revealed that A. philoxeroides invasion had remarkable impacts on the soil seed banks of wetland reed communities during less than three years and water level and light had interaction on the effect of invasion. Under the supplementary light treatment, the number of germinating species in the non invasive soil seed bank (average 3.78 species/box) was significantly higher than that in the seriously invasive soil seed bank (average 2.22 species/box)(N = 9, P <= 0.05)). Under immersed treatments, A. philoxeroides invasion significantly reduced the seedling density (from average 905 seedlings/m(2) without invasion to average 363 seedlings/m2 with mild invasion and 313 seedlings/m(2) with severe invasion, N = 9, P <= 0.05) and the species richness (from average 4.33 species /box without invasion to average 3.11 species/ box with mild invasion and 3.11 species/ box with severe invasion, N = 9, P <= 0.05) of reed community soil seed banks. Under 30 cm water flooded treatment, the dominance index of the soil seed bank with severe invasion was significantly higher than that with mild invasion. Shading and flooding inhibited the seed germination from soil seed bank. We also discovered that A. philoxeroides invasion reduced the seedling density of the light-requiring species and the terrestrial species, such as E. crusgalli, which finally impairing the natural seed recovery potential of reed communities. These findings showed new lights on the invasion plant management and the native vegetation restoration.																	0098-8472	1873-7307				DEC	2020	180								104196	10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104196							WOS:000579447700001

Viability of recalcitrantAraucaria angustifoliaseeds in storage and in a soil seed bank	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Araucaria angustifolia(Bertol.) Kuntze is a representative species of the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in the Atlantic Forest Biome of Brazil. The development of a germplasm conservation protocol for long-term seed bank storage is compromised for this species, as it is sensitive to desiccation. Furthermore, in situ establishment of a soil seed bank in its natural habitat may be limited. This study evaluates the storability of two provenances ofA. angustifoliaseeds and their behavior in an artificial soil seed bank in two forest environments (understory and edge). Results show that both seed provenances may be stored at 5 degrees C for approximately 12 months, retaining high viability. The subsequent decrease in germination was associated with a reduction and an increase in seed water content, as well as with increased electrical conductivity. In the understory environment, seed viability was above 85% for the first 60 days, and at the end of the experiment (270 days), seedlings emerged. However, at the forest edge, there was a total loss of seed viability after 120 days associated with a reduction in water content and high predation. It is concluded, therefore, that short-term storage ofA. angustifoliaseeds is possible in a cold room, which is fundamental to supply seed demand outside the production period. Forest cover conservation is important for regeneration and conservation of the species.

Weeds now dominate most of these ecosystems, resulting in the loss of ecosystem services, reduced carrying capacity for farmers, and reduction of habitat for native plants and animals. This paper reviews the literature relating to temperate grassland restoration efforts across the globe, noting which techniques and combinations have been used successfully to reduce weed dominance and promote native recruitment and establishment. This review concludes that, using a combination of four restoration techniques, provided the highest level of success, with the caveat that, ongoing weed management should be budgeted for in all projects. There is no single optimal method for restoration and weed control, with success depending on specific site conditions and the scope and aims of particular projects. However, any form of target plant transfer was observed to significantly enhance the restoration's success and reduce exotic plant biomass. There is clearly a need for an increase in long-term monitoring of restoration projects in order to make more confident assumptions.

J	DeMalach, N; Kigel, J; Sternberg, M				DeMalach, Niv; Kigel, Jaime; Sternberg, Marcelo			The soil seed bank can buffer long-term compositional changes in annual plant communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Ecological theory predicts that the soil seed bank stabilizes the composition of annual plant communities in the face of environmental variability. However, long-term data on the community dynamics in the seed bank and the standing vegetation are needed to test this prediction. We tested the hypothesis that the composition of the seed bank undergoes lower temporal variability than the standing vegetation in a 9-year study in Mediterranean, semi-arid and arid ecosystems. The composition of the seed bank was estimated by collecting soil cores from the studied sites on an annual basis. Seedling emergence under optimal watering conditions was measured in each soil core for three consecutive years, to account for seed dormancy. In all sites, the composition of the seed bank differed from the vegetation throughout the years. Small-seeded and dormant-seeded species had a higher frequency in the seed bank than in the standing vegetation. In contrast, functional group membership (grasses vs. forbs) did not explain differences in species frequency between the seed bank and the vegetation after controlling for differences between grasses and forbs in seed mass and seed dormancy. Contrary to predictions, the magnitude of year-to-year variability (the mean compositional dissimilarity between consecutive years) was not lower in the seed bank than in the vegetation in all sites. However, long-term compositional trends in the seed bank were weaker than in the vegetation in the Mediterranean and semi-arid sites. In the arid site where year-to-year variability was highest, no long-term trends were observed. Synthesis. The effect of the seed bank on the temporal variability of the vegetation in annual communities depends on site conditions and time-scale. While the year-to-year variability of the seed bank is similar to the vegetation, the soil seed bank can buffer long-term trends.

Quantifying the relationship between soil seed bank and plant community assemblage in sites harboring the threatened Ivesia webberi in the western Great Basin Desert	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions The soil seed bank is an important ecosystem component that can be pivotal for long-term persistence of many plant species, especially after disturbances followed by the invasion of alien weeds. However, many Great Basin Desert perennials produce relatively few viable seeds, while large areas of the Great Basin are currently invaded by alien weeds. This could result in dissimilarity in floristic composition between the above-ground vegetative community and the soil seed bank, causing abrupt plant community shifts following disturbance. Therefore, we asked what is the relationship in the floristic composition between the above-ground communities and the soil seed bank in sites where the threatened Ivesia webberi occurs? Location The Great Basin Desert, United States. Methods We used Dice-Sorensen's similarity index to estimate similarity between the standing vegetation and the soil seed bank. Redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were used to quantify the relationship between the total abundance of the sampled above-ground flora and the soil seed bank, accounting for effects of spatial processes and environmental variables describing climate, soils, and vegetation in the 10 sites. Results Findings reveal high dissimilarity in species assemblage and abundance between the above-ground plant communities and the soil seed bank. Most of the dominant native plant species sampled in the standing vegetation were absent in the soil seed bank, and the soil seed bank was dominated by invasive alien weeds. Conclusions Divergence in the floristic composition between the above-ground communities and the soil seed bank in Ivesia webberi habitat indicates low resilience and high risk of native species loss following perturbation. Post-disturbance succession in these plant communities may be largely dominated by invasive annual species; therefore, reduction of invasive species and native plant seeding may be necessary to sustain the ecological legacies of the desert ecosystem.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Predicting changes in the abundance of species over time is a central goal of conservation ecology. Typically, demographic data are used to parameterise models which describe population dynamics. Vital rates of plants vary across a species' distribution, yet most demographic estimates are spatially constrained. Banksia ornata (Proteaceae), a widespread serotinous obligate-seeding shrub in southern Australia, has previously had a fire management model developed based on demographic data derived from a chronosequence in one part of the species' range. We asked: are demographic data collected from a limited geographic range robust for developing population dynamic models that are applied across the broader species' range? How much variation exists in the demography of species across their range and does this matter for estimating fire return intervals necessary for species persistence? We examine site-to-site variation in the pyrodemography of six populations of B. ornata encompassing its geographic range. We documented changes in population density, time to first reproduction and canopy seed bank accumulation in stands varying in age from 0.5 to 55 years. We model year of maximum seed production on demographic parameters such as population starting density and survival rate. Density, primary juvenile period, rates of mortality and seed bank accumulation varied across populations. Primary juvenile period varied across populations (from 6 to <20 years), while time to maximum seed production was estimated to take 34-39 years after fire. Hence, the fire intervals that correspond to minimising extinction risk (due to variation in primary juvenile periods) diverge moreso among populations than the fire intervals that produce (on average) the highest maximum seed production with respect to time since fire. Demographic data collected at different locations in a species' range are likely valuable for building realistic species response models to disturbance, providing underlying assumptions about key transitions, such as mortality rate, are made explicit.																	1442-9985	1442-9993				APR	2021	46	2					315	323		10.1111/aec.12981		NOV 2020					WOS:000591907500001

Prokaryotic abundance and leucine incorporation were consistently higher in the H + L-DOM niche than in the L-DOM and CONTROL treatments, suggesting a different interaction with each DOM fraction and the disruption of the structural DOM continuum by ultrafiltration, respectively. Rhodobacterales (Alphaproteobacteria) and Flavobacteriales (Bacteroidetes) were particularly enriched in L-DOM and closely related to the colored DOM (CDOM) fraction, indicating the tight link between these groups and changes in DOM aromaticity. Conversely, some other taxa that were rare or undetectable in the original bacterial community were enriched in the H + L-DOM treatment (e.g., Alteromonadales belonging to Gammaproteobacteria), highlighting the role of the rare biosphere as a seed bank of diversity against ecosystem disturbance. The relationship between the fluorescence of protein-like CDOM and community composition of populations in the H + L-DOM treatment suggested their preference for labile DOM. Conversely, the communities growing on the L-DOM niche were coupled to humic-like CDOM, which may indicate their ability to degrade more reworked DOM and/or the generation of refractory substrates (as by-products of the respiration processes). Most importantly, L- and/or H + L-DOM treatments stimulated the growth of unique bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), suggesting the potential of environmental selection (i.e., changes in DOM composition and availability), particularly in the light of climate change scenarios. Taken together, our results suggest that different size-fractions of DOM induced niche-specialization and differentiation of mesopelagic bacterial communities.																	1664-302X					NOV 20	2020	11								586148	10.3389/fmicb.2020.586148							WOS:000595407300001	33329457

Impact of river dynamics on the genetic variation of Gypsophila repens (Caryophyllaceae): a comparison of heath forest and more dynamic gravel bank populations along an alpine river	PLANT BIOLOGY												Alpine rivers are, despite anthropogenic water flow regulation, still often highly dynamic ecosystems. Plant species occurring along these rivers are subject to ecological disturbance, mainly caused by seasonal flooding. Gypsophila repens typically grows at higher altitudes in the Alps, but also occurs at lower altitudes on gravel banks directly along the river and in heath forests at larger distances from the river. Populations on gravel banks are considered non-permanent and it is assumed that new individuals originate from seed periodically washed down from higher altitudes. Populations in heath forests are, in contrast, permanent and not regularly provided with seeds from higher altitudes through flooding. If the genetic structure of this plant species is strongly affected by gene flow via seed dispersal, then higher levels of genetic diversity in populations but less differentiation among populations on gravel banks than in heath forests can be expected. In this study, we analysed genetic diversity within and differentiation among 15 populations of G. repens from gravel banks and heath forests along the alpine River Isar using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). Genetic diversity was, as assumed, slightly higher in gravel bank than in heath forest populations, but genetic differentiation was, in contrast to our expectations, comparable among populations in both habitat types. Our study provides evidence for increased genetic diversity under conditions of higher ecological disturbance and increased seed dispersal on gravel banks. Similar levels of genetic differentiation among populations in both habitat types can be attributed to the species' long lifetime, a permanent soil seed bank and gene flow by pollinators among different habitats/locations.																	1435-8603	1438-8677				JAN	2021	23	1					205	211		10.1111/plb.13195		NOV 2020					WOS:000590589200001	33058499

Ecological succession in areas degraded by bauxite mining indicates successful use of topsoil	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Brazilian ironstone outcrops (cangas) are nutrient-poor stressful habitat dominated by slow-growing woody species with high biodiversity and unique evolutionary history. Mining has produced great impacts on this ecosystem. Spontaneous regeneration of abandoned canga mined areas has not been observed. One of the active methods most widely used for ecological restoration in environments where soil has been lost or severely degraded is topsoil transposition due to the physical, chemical, and microbiological improvement of the substrate, in addition to the seed bank. Thus, plant succession was monitored for 40 months after topsoil transposition in a canga area degraded by aluminum mining, without any other type of management. A completely randomized design with 70 permanent plots (1 x 1 m) was used. Annual phytosociological surveys were carried out and floristic and vegetational spectra were constructed with the life-forms proposed by Raunkiaer. Floristic composition was compared with a reference site. Overall, 105 species were identified. Both flora and vegetation changed over time, increasing resemblance to the reference areas. The floristic and vegetational spectra after 4 years of topsoil deposition are similar to pristine ones. The vegetation spectrum showed an increase in the dominance of phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes, while therophytes reduced their proportion. The early successional stage is dominated by weeds, like in other canga restoration studies, but did not impede the native species regeneration. Cangas's species recruited well from transposed topsoil. Unlike other studies with fertilized topsoil, our findings show the efficiency of topsoil transposition to provide initial conditions for the ecological restoration of this ecosystem.

J	Ruwanza, S				Ruwanza, Sheunesu			Vegetation and soil recovery following Eucalyptus grandis removal in Limpopo Province, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												South African terrestrial ecosystems are invaded by hundreds of alien plant species, and large-scale clearing based on the passive restoration assumption that cleared areas will recover unaided is underway. This study assessed the recovery of vegetation and soil properties, three years following Eucalyptus grandis clearing using fell-and-removal and fell-and-stackburn methods at Zvakanaka Farm in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The main aim was to ascertain the extent of vegetation and soil recovery, as well as determining which clearing methods facilitate passive vegetation and soil restoration. Results indicate significantly (p < 0.001) lower native species diversity, cover and composition in cleared than in uninvaded sites. However, the recorded low species diversity and composition in cleared sites were more pronounced in the fell-and-stackburn than in the fell-and-removal sites. Measured soil physical properties varied, with compaction being higher in fell-and-removal, whereas soils were more repellent in fell-and-stackburn sites. The study concludes that vegetation and soil recovery, following E. grandis clearing, is complex and involves several interacting factors, which are linked to invasion history and intensity. Therefore, for vegetation and soil properties to recover, following E. grandis removal, the clearing programme should consider active restoration techniques, for example soil manipulation and native plant seeding.					ruwanza, sheunesu/0000-0002-4731-0394												0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2021	59	1					241	252		10.1111/aje.12822		NOV 2020					WOS:000590114700001

Best served deep: The seedbank from salvaged topsoil underscores the role of the dispersal filter in restoration practice	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Globally, ecological restoration is required to restore degraded landscapes and to contribute to biodiversity conservation. Ecological theory suggests that manipulating dispersal, abiotic and biotic filters limiting plant re-establishment will improve restoration outcomes. Here, we manipulated spread depth of soil containing a salvaged soil seedbank (dispersal filter), soil compaction (abiotic filter) and herbivore grazing (biotic filter) in a topsoil transfer experiment to test their effects on restoration success. Location: Banksia woodland of the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia. Methods: Topsoil (upper similar to 7 cm) with its seedbank was removed from a donor site (20 ha) of recently cleared native vegetation and transferred to six recipient restoration sites (16 ha). Deep (10 cm thick) and shallow (5 cm thick) layers of topsoil were applied in a fully factorial experiment, with and without soil ripping and fencing, respectively. We analysed emergence, survival and functional types (alien/native, life form, fire response) of all vascular plant species for two consecutive years after topsoil transfer. Results: The most successful restoration treatment was deep topsoil with a mean density of 14.3 m(-2) native perennial germinants in year one and 7.3 m(-2) in year two. Application of deep topsoil increased native seedling emergence by 34% and decreased weed density by 21% compared with shallow topsoil. Overall seedling survival across the two-year period was unaffected by filter treatments (range 0.6%-5%). After two years, the resulting plant community was 6%-38% weed species and of native perennial species, 12%-48% were capable of resprouting. Conclusions: Manipulation of the dispersal filter alone, that is deep topsoil application, can lead to near-equivalent native species number emerging on restoration sites as compared to pre-cleared woodland. However, more research is required to test additional restoration tools to improve survival of biodiverse plant communities. For example, targeted herbicide application coupled with soil ripping to improve weed management and native seedling establishment.

Crantz and congenic species	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS												The potential for wide-scale adoption of genetically engineered (GE) Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz in North America has raised ecological concerns of gene flow to its weedy relatives. The objectives of this study were to determine the pollen longevity, flowering phenology and seedbank persistence of C. sativa and congenic species. Percent pollen germination of all Camelina species was reduced with increasing temperature and exposure time. Pollen germination was not observed for all taxa after 72 h between 20-40 degrees C. Weather conditions had a significant effect on pollen longevity. Under cloudy conditions, all taxa pollen had a longer period of longevity (half-life: 0.6-0.8 h) than sunny conditions (0.3-0.4 h). Under both conditions, C. sativa, Camelina alyssum (Mill.) Thell., and Camelina microcarpa Andrz. Ex DC. pollen had a longer period of longevity than Camelina hispida var. grandiflora (Boiss.) Hedge, Camelina laxa C. A. Mey, and Camelina rumelica Velen., but pollen germination was not observed after 5 h exposure. The flowering phenology of C. sativa, C. microcarpa, and C. alyssum behaved similarly, which was different from C. hispida, C. laxa, and C. rumelica. Flowering synchrony among taxa was observed, facilitating pollen-mediated gene flow among taxa. Seeds of C. sativa, C. alyssum, and C. microcarpa did not exhibit dormancy in the soil, but the germination ability of C. sativa throughout the growing season raises the ecological concerns of gene flow from C. sativa volunteers. This new information on pollen longevity, flowering phenology, and seedbank persistence will be helpful for creating containment and coexistence strategies between GE and Non-GE C. sativa, isolating field trials, and managing GE C. sativa volunteers associated weed problems.

Thus, adapting forestry practices to improve seedling establishment is of prime importance to maintain sustainable forest management. In the coastal dune forests of maritime pine in SW France, regeneration failure after clear-cutting has greatly increased in the last decades. The aim of this study was to quantify the different stages involved in the regeneration process (seed rain, germination, survival), and to assess the impact of harvesting methods (partial cutting vs. clear-cutting) and of the use of direct seeding (seeding vs. no seeding) on these stages. We established five trials located in areas with contrasting regeneration statuses (of which two sites were in an area characterized by chronic regeneration failure), and we investigated the effect of the harvesting method and the use of direct seeding in a factorial design. We monitored the seed rain, germination and first-year survival for three years. Due to the transient nature of the seed bank, we found that the seed rain of the previous year was the only possible seed source for tree regeneration, and it increased with the proximity and size of surrounding mature trees. Nonetheless, seed rain did not limit regeneration in these stands. In fact, germination was the bottleneck stage of the regeneration process in all sites because it was short-lived and consequently exposed to failure in case of unfavourable conditions. Once established, seedling death was mainly due to summer drought. Clear-cutting without seeding resulted in severe regeneration failures in 4 out of 5 sites, with the most severe in the failure area. Direct seeding increased seedling emergence only in the first year, while partial cutting had a longer-lasting effect by providing a regular seed supply over several years. Partial cutting also decreased biotic and abiotic stresses through microhabitat modification under the tree canopy, resulting in a higher number of germinations and greater seedling survival. This positive effect was more pronounced in the two sites within the failure area, suggesting that conditions were more stressful in this part of the forests. Consequently, we recommend avoiding clear-cutting in favour of partial cutting in all parts of these forests, and ensuring the maintenance of sufficient forest cover to promote regeneration. Direct seeding could be used in addition to partial cutting to maximize the chances of success, but only in areas where natural regeneration is low.

Here we collected data over 3 years (2016-2018) in the episodic wetland outflow channel (Aluize), Banhine National Park, in which the system state changed from dry to wet to dry. Field sampling included vegetation records, small-scale vegetation zoning, the seed bank and water and soil quality. The same main plant species were found in both dry and wet conditions across the riverbed of the outflow channel. We found only very few diaspores of plants in the soil after prolonged drought. In the subsequent flooded state, we examined very dense vegetation on the water surface, which was dominated by the gramineous species Paspalidium obtusifolium. This species formed a compact floating mat that was rooted to the riverbed. The Cyperaceae Bolboschoenus glaucus showed high clonal growth in the form of root tubers, which likely serve as important food reservoir during drought. Soil and water analyses do not indicate a limitation by nutrients. We outline how resident people may change the plant community structure with an increasing practice of setting fire to the meadows in the dried-up riverbed to facilitate plant regrowth as food for their livestock.

By analyzing soil chemistry and vegetation across abandonment dates spanning two millennia, we bring to light a persisting signature of Roman, eighteenth century and modern corrals on present-day ecosystems. Community composition and species-richness reflect time after abandonment of sheep stables and are linked to long-term persistence of eutrophication from historical sheep concentrations. Our data highlight changes in vegetation that persist two millennia after human impacts ceased. Small-scale pastoral legacies from Roman times continue to have significant impacts on present-day herbaceous plant communities. Our findings point to a need for greater consideration of persisting eutrophication in dry grasslands and of the conservation value of these long-term legacies.

The resilience of weed seedbank regulation by carabid beetles, at continental scales, to alternative prey	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Carabids are generalist predators that contribute to the agricultural ecosystem service of seedbank regulation via weed seed predation. To facilitate adoption of this ecosystem services by farmers, knowledge of weed seed predation and the resilience of seedbank regulation with co-varying availability of alternative prey is crucial. Using assessments of the seedbank and predation on seed cards in 57 cereal fields across Europe, we demonstrate a regulatory effect on the soil seedbank, at a continental scale, by groups formed of omnivore, seed-eating (granivore+omnivore) and all species of carabids just prior to the crop-harvest. Regulation was associated with a positive relationship between the activity-density of carabids and seed predation, as measured on seed cards. We found that per capita seed consumption on the cards co-varied negatively with the biomass of alternative prey, i.e. Aphididae, Collembola and total alternative prey biomass. Our results underline the importance of weed seedbank regulation by carabids, across geographically significant scales, and indicate that the effectiveness of this biocontrol may depend on the availability of alternative prey that disrupt the weed seed predation.

Lutz; Otte, Annette			Seed bank offers potential for active restoration of mountain meadows	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The nitrogen-fixing legume Lupinus polyphyllus invaded semi-natural mountainous grasslands across Europe during the last decades. This invasion resulted in degraded habitats through changes in the structure and function of the mountain meadow vegetation. In our study, we analyzed (1) the effects of increasing cover of L. polyphyllus on the seed bank of mountain meadows, and (2) the potential of the seed bank of these stands for active restoration of mountain meadows in terms of species composition and number. We conducted a seed bank analysis on 84 plots with increasing cover of L. polyphyllus in three mountain-meadow types of the Rhon Biosphere Reserve, Germany. Seedlings from 119 species germinated from the seed bank samples, including 17 Red List species but only a few seedlings of L. polyphyllus. The species composition of the seed bank matched distinct patterns of the three meadow types, but differed from the species composition of the current aboveground vegetation in a nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination. While the influence of L. polyphyllus on the current vegetation was visible, no effects on the seed bank were apparent. L. polyphyllus had no influence on total seed density, seed density of typical mountain-meadow species, or species numbers in the seed bank. Only the seeds of the Red List species were significantly related to the cover of L. polyphyllus. We conclude that the seed bank offers potential for active restoration of species-rich mountain meadows, but species absent from the seed bank have to be added by other measures.

In this geographical area, some studies have shown that soil characteristics may influence the presence and/or the level of infestation of some parasitic weeds, but none have been conducted on R. fistulosa. Based on surveys conducted in northern Togo over two years in 66 lowland rice fields, we characterised the level of infestation of R. fistulosa as well as physico-chemical characteristics of soils. We highlighted that fields with medium-to-high levels of infestation of R. fistulosa (more than 5 plants per m(2)) were mainly characterised by a coarser soil texture, a higher potassium content and a higher pH, while fields without R. fistulosa were characterised by a lower proportion of silt content. In contrast, the level of infestation of R. fistulosa appeared only marginally influenced by soil organic carbon and nitrogen in our study. Considering these results, options to modify the main physico-chemical characteristics of soils that influence the level of infestation of R. fistulosa are likely difficult to implement. In order to continue rice production in these lowland fields, we suggest several measures to better manage R. fistulosa seedbank and development.

Incorporating environmental factors to describe wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) seedling emergence and plant phenology	WEED SCIENCE												Wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) is a weed found globally in agricultural systems. The facultative winter annual nature of this plant and high genetic variability makes modeling its growth and phenology difficult. In the present study, R. raphanistrum natural seedbanks exhibited a biphasic pattern of emergence, with emergence peaks occurring in both fall and spring. Traditional sigmoidal models were inadequate to fit this pattern, regardless of the predictive environmental variable, and a corresponding biphasic model (sigmoidal + Weibull) was used to describe emergence based on the best parameters. Each best-fit chronological, thermal, and hydrothermal model accounted for at least 85% of the variation of the validation data. Observations on phenology progression from four cohorts were used to create a common model that described all cohorts adequately. Different phenological stages were described using chronological, thermal, hydrothermal, daylength-dependent thermal time, and daylength-dependent hydrothermal time. Integrating daylength and temperature into the models was important for predicting reproductive stages of R. raphanistrum.

Seed predation can result in a large number of seed losses, thus contributing to weed biocontrol. Earthworms are important predators of seeds and seedlings and affect seeds and seedling survival after gut passage. A study was conducted to assess the ability of Pheretima guillelmi (Kinberg) to ingest and digest the seeds and seedlings of 15 main farmland weed species. Pheretima guillelmi ingested the seeds and seedlings of each weed species tested. The percentages of seeds and seedlings ingested were 96.7% to 100% and 21.7% to 94.2%, respectively. Pheretima guillelmi showed greater ingestion of seeds than seedlings for each species and digested the seeds and seedlings of each weed species tested to varying extents. The percentages of seeds and seedlings digested were less than 15% irrespective of the weed species. Passage through the gut of P. guillelmi affected the survival of seeds and seedlings.

In contrast to seed ingestion, ingestion of seedlings by P. guillelmi was fatal to individuals of all weed species; no seedlings survived passage through the gut. Our results indicate that predation of weed seeds and seedlings by P. guillelmi probably depletes the soil weed seedbank and that the introduction of P. guillelmi into fields is a potential strategy for weed biocontrol in farmland.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				NOV	2020	68	6					639	645		10.1017/wsc.2020.65							WOS:000639434300010						
J	Zheng, YR; Rong, S; Wei, D; Yan, W				Zheng Yarong; Rong, Sun; Wei, Deng; Yan, Wang			Correlation between Riparian Plant Communities and Plantpropagule Banks in Dicun Stream	JOURNAL OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY												In order to understand the species composition, quantity and spatial distribution of both typical shrub communities and their plant propagule bank and their relationship with aboveground plant communities along mountain river, Dicun stream, which was the source of the Jiulong River in the west of Fujian Province, was chosen to study. The seed germination method was used to identify the species of the propagules and the Jaccard similarity index to analyze the similarity between the aboveground plant community and its plant propagules. The results showed that: (1) The number of species in the aboveground communities of the Dicun stream was larger than that of the propagules. (2) The shrub community contained 76 plants belonging to 25 families and 64 genera, and 33 plants belonging to 14 families and 32 genera were found in the propagules. (3) The density of the propagule bank decreased with increasing soil depth, the seeds in the propagule bank were mainly distributed in the shallow soil 0.5 cm, and the number of seeds in the upper layer were 57.8% of the total number of seeds. The Jaccard similarity index of the shrub community in the Dicun Stream Basin was between 0.167 and 0.467, and the similarity between adjacent plots was relatively high, but the similarity between interval plots was relatively low. (4) The number of species shared by the propagules and the aboveground communities in the survey plot was low, the similarity was low, and there was no significant correlation between the density of the propagule bank and the density of aboveground communities. In summary, there were various reasons for the differences between the density and composition of propagules. The difference between the seed bank and the existing community could have been because the seeds in the propagule bank were not all from the existing community, but were from the long-term accumulation of different succession stages.																	1063-455X	1934-936X				NOV	2020	42	6					498	507		10.3103/S1063455X20060120							WOS:000613489100009

Based on the averaged results of the extent and time of stagnation of the water, along the transect four habitat moisture zones were distinguished (dry, periodically moist, moist, and wet). In eighteen study plots we analysed flora, soil seed bank, and contents of Ca, Mg, K, Mn, Fe and pH of the soil. The analysed closed depression is characterised by high variability in moisture conditions and in the physical and chemical properties of the soil. The most important factors affecting the diversity of the vegetation cover and seed bank were the duration of water stagnation and the content of Fe and Mn in the soil. The lowest plant species richness and the smallest seed resources were determined for the wet zone of the depression. An increase in the habitat moisture level was accompanied by a decline in the floristic similarity between the vegetation cover and the seed bank.																	1505-2249					NOV	2020	68	3					195	210		10.3161/15052249PJE2020.68.3.002							WOS:000595599800002

Charles; Xu, Lan; Wu, Yajun			Breeding Alfalfa for Semiarid Regions in the Northern Great Plains: History and Additional Genetic Evaluations of Novel Germplasm	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Yellow-flowered alfalfa (Medicago sativa subsp. falcata) (also known as sickle medic) has been the cornerstone for breeding alfalfa for dual grazing and hay production in the semiarid regions of the northern Great Plains in the US and Canada. Most, if not all, of the cultivars developed for the northern Great Plains during the 20th century, had parentage tracing back to introductions by Niels Ebbesen Hansen that were obtained from expeditions to Russia, primarily the province of Siberia, on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture during the early 1900s. The M. falcata genome contains alleles for high levels of drought-tolerance, winter hardiness, and tolerance to grazing, but is generally deficient for commercial seed production traits, such as non-shatter, compared with common alfalfa (M. sativa). A naturalized population, tracing to USDA plant introductions to Perkins County South Dakota by N.E. Hansen in early 1900, and subsequently, facilitated by the determined seed increase and interseeding of a population by a local rancher, Norman 'Bud' Smith, has shown highly desirable in situ characteristics for improving rangelands in the northern Great Plains. This includes adequate seed production to build a seed bank in the soil for natural seedling recruitment and population maintenance/expansion and support the production of a commercial seed source. This review documents the seminal events in the development of cultivars to date and describes novel germplasm with potential for new cultivars in the future.

AGRONOMY-BASEL												In Europe, conservation agriculture (CA) is currently challenged by higher weed pressure, potential glyphosate ban and reduced crop yield. Based on preliminary results and a critical analysis, we provide insights on how to assess the effect of introducing different levels of tillage intensity, after a long-term CA sequence, on weed communities and crop yield. The experiment compared three types of fallow management (ploughing (CT), reduced tillage (RT), no-till with glyphosate (NT)) on four fields after 17 years of no-plough, which ended with 7 years of CA. The introduction of tillage proved to be a major driver of weed communities before weeding (density, richness and composition) in winter wheat. Weed density and species richness before weeding was greatest in RT, intermediate in CT and lowest in NT. The number of grains per ear and crop yield increased with tillage intensity (+11% for RT, +31% for CT). We provide avenues for future research through detailed methods and key references. Differences in winter wheat productivity were possibly related to enhanced soil structure and increased mineralisation of soil organic matter. Potential benefits of occasional ploughing will depend on the density and composition of the newly upwelled weed seedbank, which will need to be assessed before implementing tillage. From a multicriteria perspective, the long-term benefits associated with CA could largely exceed short-term yield increases associated with occasional tillage. Future studies will need to characterize the impact of occasional tillage operations on the long-term multiperformance of CA systems.

Burning is a common method for managing, but its feasibility to control the seed bank of conifers has not been investigated. This project shows that the burning of logged conifer trees will often eliminate seeds of lodgepole pine, mugo pine and Sitka spruce, even when the seeds were placed into a depth of five centimeters in the soil. The effect on seeds depends on the fuel load and the fire conditions (e.g., dryness, wind, and temperature). If the seeds were exposed to a high temperature, the seeds were not able to germinate afterward. The temperature was about 80 degrees C for all species. If the sum of temperatures based on temperature records every 30 s exceeded between 12,000 and 14,000 degrees C no seeds were able to germinate. The relationship between the mean temperature of the burns and the germination rate at seeds placed in various soil depths was modelled. Findings should be interpreted cautiously as each depth-species combinations were not replicated in space or time due to practical constraints.

A 5-year study was carried out in a Mediterranean environment (Sicily, south Italy) to (1) quantify cover crop biomass production and (2) evaluate the effects on weed soil seed bank, aboveground biomass, species richness, species composition and associations between communities. Cover crop treatments included subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) and spontaneous flora, both with and without burying dead mulch into the soil, compared to a conventional management treatment. Weed biomass was significantly reduced by subterranean clover, contrariwise to spontaneous flora, with season-dependent results. Cover crop biomass, which ranged from 44 to more than 290 g DW m(-2), was negatively correlated to weed biomass. Moreover, subterranean clover decreased the size of the soil seed bank and species richness. Based on relative frequency, a low similarity was found between the conventional management and cover crop treatments. In addition, no significant differences in species composition across treatments were observed, whereas principal component analysis highlighted some associations. The results suggest that subterranean clover cover cropping is a good option for weed management in Mediterranean agroecosystems.

Diversity of Plants in Thickets of Invasive Sorbaria sorbifolia: Differences in the Effect on Aboveground Vegetation and Seed Bank	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The diversity of aboveground vegetation of the herb-dwarf shrub layer and seedlings from the soil seed bank in the thickets of invasive shrub Sorbaria sorbifolia was evaluated in urbanized forests of the city of Yekaterinburg (the Middle Urals, Russia). Geobotanical releves and identification of seedlings from the soil seed bank were performed in different forest communities: thickets of invasive S. sorbifolia, thickets of native Rubus idaeus, and in forest communities without S. sorbifolia and R. idaeus. The effect observed in the presence of S. sorbifolia was as follows: the abundance of aboveground vegetation in the herb-dwarf shrub layer was lower by a factor of 10-20 or more; the taxonomic richness of the herb-dwarf shrub layer in the releve (alpha-diversity), by a factor of 6-8; and the total number of species recorded in the community group (gamma-diversity), by a factor of 3. The disappearance of species under S. sorbifolia was selective. Relatively light-loving and relatively dry-loving species disappeared first, while more shade-loving and moisture-loving species were relatively resistant. The taxonomic richness and abundance of seedlings from the soil seed bank did not change depending on the abundance of S. sorbifolia. Approximately half of the identified seedling taxa were typical forest plants, while the others were only specific for the seed bank and did not occur in the vegetative state. It is concluded that the influence of S. sorbifolia on the vegetation of subordinate layers is due primarily to the direct competitive and habitat-transforming effect of the living S. sorbifolia phytomass.																	1067-4136	1608-3334				NOV	2020	51	6					518	527		10.1134/S1067413620060090							WOS:000591987800002

Genetic Patterns and Climate Modelling Reveal Challenges for Conserving Sclerolaena napiformis (Amaranthaceae s.l.) an Endemic Chenopod of Southeast Australia	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Sclerolaena napiformis is a perennial chenopod endemic to southeast Australia. Human-mediated habitat loss and fragmentation over the past century has caused a rapid decline in abundance and exacerbated reduced connectivity between remnant populations across three disjunct regions. To assess conservation requirements, we measured the genetic structure of 27 populations using double digest RADseq). We combined our genetic data with habitat models under projected climate scenarios to identify changes in future habitat suitability. There was evidence of regional differentiation that may pre-date (but also may be compounded) by recent habitat fragmentation. We also found significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance when comparing sites across regions. Overall, S. napiformis showed low genetic diversity and a relatively high proportion of inbreeding/selfing. Climate modelling, based on current occupancy, predicts a reduction in suitable habitat for S. napiformis under the most conservative climate change scenario. We suggest that the best conservation approach is to maximise genetic variation across the entire species range to allow dynamic evolutionary processes to proceed. We recommend a conservation strategy that encourages mixing of germplasm within regions and permits mixed provenancing across regions to maximise genetic novelty. This will facilitate shifts in genetic composition driven by individual plant fitness in response to the novel environmental conditions this species will experience over the next 50 years.

Over a decade monitoring Fiji's seagrass condition demonstrates resilience to anthropogenic pressures and extreme climate events	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Seagrass are an important marine ecosystem of the Fiji Islands. We confirm six seagrass species from the archipelago and defined five broad categories of seagrass habitat. We report, with high confidence, seagrass meadows covering 59.19 km(2) of Fiji's shallow water habitats from literature and this study. Long-term monitoring of seagrass abundance, species composition, and seed banks at eight sentinel sites, found no long-term trends. Examination of key attributes that affect seagrass resilience identified meadows as predominately enduring and dominated by opportunistic species which had moderate physiological resistance, and high recovery capacity. We examined threats to Fiji's seagrass meadows from extreme climatic events and anthropogenic activities using a suite of indicators, identifying water quality as a major pressure. Based on these findings, we assessed existing protections in Fiji afforded to seagrass and their services. This understanding will help to better manage for seagrass resilience and focus future seagrass research in Fiji.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV	2020	160								111636	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111636							WOS:000587627100001	33181923

The impact of grazing on seed quantity has been well studied; however, the impact of grazing on seed quality has received less attention, despite its role in determining the longevity of a seed bank. Here, we examined the impact of ungulate grazing on seed quality in plants, using two grazing-intolerant grassland species (Hemerocallis dumortieri var. esculenta and Geranium yesoense var. nipponicum). We found that grazing reduced seed length and weight, while increasing the germination rate. These changes in seed quality induced by grazing could reduce the persistence of seed banks and would thus seem to be an important mechanism involved in the impact of ungulate grazing on plant population dynamics.

Buffering effects of soil seed banks on plant community composition in response to land use and climate	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Climate and land use are key determinants of biodiversity, with past and ongoing changes posing serious threats to global ecosystems. Unlike most other organism groups, plant species can possess dormant life-history stages such as soil seed banks, which may help plant communities to resist or at least postpone the detrimental impact of global changes. This study investigates the potential for soil seed banks to achieve this. Location Europe. Time period 1978-2014. Major taxa studied Flowering plants. Methods Using a space-for-time/warming approach, we study plant species richness and composition in the herb layer and the soil seed bank in 2,796 community plots from 54 datasets in managed grasslands, forests and intermediate, successional habitats across a climate gradient. Results Soil seed banks held more species than the herb layer, being compositionally similar across habitats. Species richness was lower in forests and successional habitats compared to grasslands, with annual temperature range more important than mean annual temperature for determining richness. Climate and land-use effects were generally less pronounced when plant community richness included seed bank species richness, while there was no clear effect of land use and climate on compositional similarity between the seed bank and the herb layer. Main conclusions High seed bank diversity and compositional similarity between the herb layer and seed bank plant communities may provide a potentially important functional buffer against the impact of ongoing environmental changes on plant communities. This capacity could, however, be threatened by climate warming. Dormant life-history stages can therefore be important sources of diversity in changing environments, potentially underpinning already observed time-lags in plant community responses to global change. However, as soil seed banks themselves appear, albeit less, vulnerable to the same changes, their potential to buffer change can only be temporary, and major community shifts may still be expected.

Forest patch size predicts seed bank composition in urban areas	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions As urban areas expand around the world, understanding how to restore and maintain forests within the urban environment becomes increasingly important. Given that a comprehensive understanding of regeneration dynamics is critical to designating appropriate management interventions we ask the following: how does regeneration, vis-a-vis the buried seed bank, vary in heterogenous urban forests? And, can forest patch size be used to predict regeneration and consequent management interventions? Location Vacant lots and public parks throughout New Haven, CT, USA. Methods We sampled buried seed banks in 131 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes ranging from large intact parks (95-126 ha), to small parks (1-19 ha), and vacant lots (0.05-0.65 ha). We collected soil samples from the surface mineral soil and stratified them over sand in a greenhouse over a period of five months to record germination. Results By examining seed bank floristics in a range of forest patch sizes we found that species composition, nativity, and dominance of specific functional groups shifted with patch size representing a spectrum of urbanization within just one city. Seed bank floristics in large parks more closely resembled results from seed bank studies in rural forests with over 85% native germinants on average. In contrast, vacant lots were dominated by non-native germinants and more ruderal species indicative of earlier successional stages. Seed banks in small parks were variable and in some cases were more similar to large parks or vacant lots. Conclusions Our findings suggest that large parks in urban areas may be largely self-sustaining whereas smaller parks may require more intensive management for site rehabilitation, especially in early states of succession. Furthermore, our results confirm the highly heterogenous nature of urban forest patches and call for more systematic sampling of urban areas to capture this variation and improve management prescriptions and outcomes.

Seeding is not always necessary to restore native early successional plant communities	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration of native early successional plant communities in the eastern United States is a conservation priority because of declining populations of associated plants and wildlife. Restoration typically involves seeding native species and is often fraught with problems including weedy competition, expensive seed, and slow establishment. Pairing seed bank response with strategic herbicide applications may be an alternative approach for restoring these plant communities. We compared early successional plant communities established by seeding (SD) paired with selective herbicide use to natural revegetation (NR) from the seed bank paired with selective herbicide use at 18 locations that were previously row-crop or tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) fields in Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky, the United States. We did not detect differences in species diversity and richness, coverage of non-native grasses and forbs, or number and coverage of native flowering forbs by season between NR and SD treatments at tall fescue or fallow crop sites. Species evenness was greatest in NR and coverage of native-warm-season grasses in SD. Species richness and coverage of native forbs were least in untreated tall fescue units (CNTL). More flexibility to use herbicides with NR reduced coverage of sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) in NR units compared to SD units at tall fescue sites. NR was 3.7 times cheaper than seeding. Land managers should consider using an NR approach to establish native early successional plant communities.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2020	28	6					1485	1494		10.1111/rec.13249		OCT 2020					WOS:000581437500001

Burial effects on seed germination and seedling emergence of two halophytes of contrasting seed size	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background Germination and especially emergence can decrease significantly with depth. Aim Our main goal was to examine the effects of sand burial depth on seed germination and seedling establishment of two halophytes, Spartina densiflora and Atriplex portulacoides, with contrasted fruit traits. Methods The effects of sand burial to depths of 0 to 6 cm on seed germination and seedling establishment were studied in a greenhouse experiment. Sediment erosion/accretion dynamics were also recorded at a salt marsh colonised recently by both species. Results Germination percentage for both halophytes was higher at a depth of 1 cm than at the surface, and decreased gradually with increasing depth below 1 cm. Emergence of seedlings was similar between 1 and 3 cm (ca. 20-60 %) for both species. The highest seedling survival rates (ca. 100 %) were recorded for seeds sown at a depth of 2 cm for S. densiflora and between 1 and 3 cm for A. portulacoides. Recorded erosion and accretion rates was large enough to modify germination and establishment patterns in both halophytes. Conclusions Spartina densiflora showed higher germination rates than A. portulacoides at greater depths, which seemed to be related to its growth form.

As these grasslands have been used as rangelands for centuries, human management (grazing; fire regimes) is one of their main ecological and evolutionary drivers, along with the Mediterranean climate. Despite EU conservation policy, damage to such grasslands still occurs and efficient ecological restoration is needed. This article reviews restoration constraints, effective techniques, and research perspectives for restoring them in the light of their ecological characteristics. Major restoration constraints specifically include (1) a poor contribution of the internal (seed bank) and external (seed rain) species pools, and (2) low establishment of some perennial species. The latter may be the result of the low seed quantity or quality of perennial species, stochastic or extended droughts, high soil nutrient content that may lead to competition (e.g. between weed and target species), inappropriate grazing management or fire regimes leading to shrub encroachment, or the death of target species seedlings in early stages of restoration. Successful restoration techniques include seeding, transplanting, hay transfer, and timely soil transfer, all of which have to be adapted to regional plant phenology and to local Mediterranean climate. They must be combined with appropriate grazing or fire management. Their success may depend on years with particular rainfall amounts or patterns or on particular target plant species. We discuss research perspectives contributing to a better understanding of seed dispersal, seedling recruitment, and soil processes and suggest the benefits of using ecosystem engineer species.

J	White, L; Catterall, C; Taffs, K				White, Laura; Catterall, Claudia; Taffs, Kathryn			Fire can promote germination, recruitment and seed bank accumulation of the threatened annual grass Arthraxon hispidus	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Disturbance plays an important role in plant life history strategies and has been documented as both enhancing and threatening populations of the vulnerable grass Arthraxon hispidus (Thunb.) Makino (hairy jointgrass) on the NSW north coast. Mechanical disturbance (slashing) is often used in A. hispidus conservation management, but many Australian plants are adapted to fire-based disturbance regimes. In this study we undertook a field burning experiment, along with soil seed bank sampling and germination trials, to explore how fire influences A. hispidus population dynamics in terms of plant recruitment and seed bank fluctuations. We found that winter burning strongly promoted A. hispidus spring germination without entirely depleting the residual seedbank. Although drought affected our field study population, burning also led to increased adult cover and substantial seed bank replenishment the following autumn. Exposure to a smoke treatment almost doubled the germination rate of A. hispidus seeds in nursery trials. Our study suggests that appropriate burning regimes can help to maintain this species in the landscape, by both structural and chemical mechanisms, by enhancing plant recruitment and facilitating seed bank accumulation. However, some A. hispidus plants also successfully germinated, established, and reproduced in unburnt plots during our study, suggesting that populations of this species can persist without disturbance in some habitats, such as native wetland communities. We found that A. hispidus has a multi-year seed longevity and a persistent seed bank, providing the species a degree of resilience in the event of unpredictable disturbance regimes and climatic anomalies.

Insights From Acacia longifolia in Portugal	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Biological invasions are among the major contemporary threats to biodiversity. Biocontrol has a long history as a safe and effective strategy for the control of invasive species in several world regions, yet the life history and ecological requirements of biocontrol agents are often poorly understood. Species distribution models and assessments of niche overlap and dynamics constitute a way to quantify and compare ecological niches and are widely used for predicting biological invasions. While these tools can also be valuable to predict the effectiveness of biocontrol programs and anticipate whether biocontrol agents can establish on areas targeted for control, they remain underutilized for this purpose. In this work, species distribution models and comparisons of niche dynamics are used to predict the success of the ongoing biocontrol program for Acacia longifolia in Portugal, and potentially along the Mediterranean Basin, using the Australian gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, previously released in South Africa. Niches of both the invasive plant and the biocontrol agent were found to be highly similar and to remain conserved through the introduction process. Distribution models identify suitable climatic areas for A. longifolia in 19% of the Mediterranean Basin and predict successful establishment of T. acaciaelongifoliae in 41% of the suitable area for A. longifolia, despite excluding a few locations where very recent establishment occurred. These results allow us to quantify the risk of future A. longifolia invasion and potential success of biocontrol, as well as establish a comparative framework for similar programs being considered in other regions of the world dealing with A. longifolia invasions.

Seed banks are crucial to vegetation regeneration in degraded karst ecosystems characterized by a discontinuous distribution of soil and seasonal drought stress. However, the dynamics of seed banks across one complete series of secondary succession and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We selected eight typical stages during secondary succession, conducted aboveground vegetation survey and collected 960 soil samples in the Guiyang karst landscape of China. Seed density, species richness and plant life forms in seed banks were determined via the germination method. The results indicated that the seed density in seed banks before and after field seed germination was significantly different among most succession stages. Community succession had impacts on the seed density of seed banks before and after field seed germination. Seed density ranged from 1,042 seedlings.m(-2) in evergreen broadleaf forests to 3,755 seedlings.m(-2) in the herb community, which was a relatively high density. The seed density and similar species composition between the seed banks and vegetation declined with succession from early to later stages. Species richness in seed banks was highest in middle succession stages and increased with increasing species richness of aboveground vegetation. The species richness of the five life forms in the seed banks showed different variations across these succession stages. The conservation of diverse aboveground vegetation can maintain the diversity of seed banks for restoration.					wang, zhenhong/0000-0002-7829-8834												2167-8359					OCT 19	2020	8								e10226	10.7717/peerj.10226							WOS:000579332800006	33133785

Davies, Richard			The effect of heat and smoke on the soil seed banks of heathlands on permanent freshwater swamps	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												In South Australia,Swamps of the Fleurieu Peninsulaare critically endangered due to past vegetation clearance and changes in hydrology, but still contain a high diversity of threatened plant species. This vegetation community provides habitat for 82 threatened ground-stratum plant species, including the nationally critically endangered subshrubHibbertia tenuiswhich is endemic to these swamps. With infrequent burning, native ferns and taller shrubs outcompete these species. We conducted glasshouse trials to determine the potential of fire to regenerate threatened and other swamp plant species. Soil samples from eight swamps were used in germination trials with half of each sample treated with heat plus smoke, and half left untreated. Samples were spread onto trays (n = 188), and seedling emergence was recorded for twelve months. Emergence was dominated by native species (2649 seedlings m(-2)) compared to exotics (675 seedlings m(-2)). In total, 48 native and 25 introduced species germinated, with 21% of germinated native species absent from the above-ground vegetation. The dominant native fernGleichenia microphylladid not emerge from any soil samples, indicating that recovery likely lags behind that of ground-strata species, giving them time to establish and set seed before being outcompeted. Thirty-four rare or threatened species germinated, including five species absent from above-ground vegetation. Of all native species that emerged, only five were confined to heat plus smoke treatments, suggesting most species will regenerate without fire if overstorey competition is reduced. However, seedling emergence of native shrubs/subshrubs more than doubled with the fire treatment. Of particular importance,H. tenuisshowed an 18-fold increase in germination when treated with heat plus smoke. This study supports the utility of ecological burns as a management tool to regenerate threatened plant species in long-undisturbed peaty heathlands on permanent swamps.

Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) eradication in arid central Australia enhances native plant diversity and increases seed resources for granivores	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliarisL.) is a drought-adapted invasive plant that has become a serious environmental weed in many arid and semi-arid systems. This paper examined whether eradication of buffel grass infestations: (i) increases frequency, richness and diversity of native vegetation and seed bank pools; and (ii) improves availability of seed resources for granivores. Location Alluvial ironwood/corkwood woodlands in arid central Australia. Methods We assessed differences in floristic and seed bank composition between buffel-infested sites and sites where buffel grass had been eradicated ca. 12 years previously. Plant species frequency data from nested-quadrat sampling were amalgamated into plant functional groups to examine their relationship to buffel treatment. A seed flotation method was employed to: (i) assess seed bank composition of functional groups at eradicated vs. infested sites; and (ii) test whether the mass of seeds available for granivores was higher at buffel-free sites. Results Buffel-eradicated sites supported richer and more diverse vegetation and seed banks across all functional groups except perennial grasses. The effect was strongest for perennial forbs, annual/short-lived forbs, and annual/short-lived grasses. The overall mass of seeds of non-buffel grass species was ca. 10-fold higher at buffel-removed sites. Numbers of seeds of species in the 0.001-0.009 9 g and 0.000 1-0.000 99 g size classes, both of which contain species with seeds consumed by granivores, were ca. 20- and 14-fold higher respectively at buffel-removed sites. Conclusions Buffel grass removal at localised scales provides islands of habitat with improved opportunities for native plant re-establishment and abundant foraging resources for granivores. Future research must disentangle the relative importance of dispersal vs. residual seed banks for community restoration after buffel grass invasion. Extended delays in eradication could allow seed bank reserves to deteriorate to a state that no longer permits regeneration.

Grazing livestock increases both vegetation and seed bank diversity in remnant and restored grasslands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Restoring grasslands is of great importance to biodiversity conservation to counteract widespread, ongoing losses of plant species diversity. Using source populations in remnant habitats and increasing functional connectivity mediated by grazing animals within and between habitats can benefit grassland restoration efforts. Here we investigate how grazing contributes to vegetation and seed bank diversity and composition in remnant and restored grassland communities in fragmented landscapes. Location Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We investigated the effects of the presence or absence of grazing animals as potential elements of functional connectivity on grassland species composition in both the vegetation layer and in the seed bank. Species inventory and seed bank sampling were carried out in 2 m x 2 m plots in remnant grassland habitats and adjacent restored grasslands on former arable fields. Results Species composition varied between remnant and restored grasslands, with management-dependent species more common in remnant grasslands. Remnant habitats with active grazing management contained a higher number of species in both the vegetation and seed bank compared to restored grasslands, but grazing reduced dispersal limitation from higher distance to source populations for specialist species. Where grazing was absent fewer plant species occurred in both the vegetation and in the seed bank. Conclusion Our results show that grazing livestock play a key role in facilitating both spatial and temporal dispersal in fragmented grasslands. This results in increased species diversity in the vegetation and the seed bank of grazed grasslands compared to those maintained by mowing only. Functional connectivity provided by grazing management increases the possibility for species establishment from both the below-ground seed bank and the surrounding landscape, thus increasing the resilience of plant communities against disturbances or climatic changes.

Legacy effects of leguminous green manure crops on the weed seed bank in organic crop rotations	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Leguminous green manure crops are important for accumulating nitrogen by means of biological nitrogen fixation and for building up soil fertility in organic arable cropping systems. Whole-year green manure crops are also known to deplete the soil weed seed bank, e.g. by decaying and predation, but there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the legacy effect after termination of the green manure crop. This study sampled soil for weed seed bank assessment upon termination of a two-year leguminous green manure crop and then one, two and three years afterwards. The samples were taken from two five-year crop rotations (2011-2015) in a long-term organic crop rotation experiment in Denmark. One rotation (O2) had a two-year green manure crop followed by three years of annual cash crops, and the other rotation (O4) consisted only of annual cash crops, with four crop sequences in both rotations represented every year. In general, the weed seed bank of rotation O2 was 54 % lower than O4, with 5475 seeds m(-2) versus 11,967 seeds m(-2). Similarly the aboveground amount of weed biomass in O2 was lower than in O4 over the course of the five years. The legacy effect of the green manure crop showed a negative exponential rise in weed seed numbers with the increase in years after termination of the green manure crop. A biennial leguminous green manure crop can mitigate weed problems in organic annual crops. This effect adds to the benefits of including nitrogen fixing leys in crop rotations with limited access to animal manures.

Enhancing seed conservation in rural communities of Guatemala by implementing the dry chain concept	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Seed conservation in rural communities of low- and middle-income countries located in tropical areas is particularly problematic, due to high relative humidity that promotes insect and fungal infestations and leads to rapid losses in seed viability. Seed conservation in those areas is affected by unreliable power supplies that do not allow the use of dehumidifying and refrigeration systems recommended for the long-term storage of seeds. We tested the dry chain, i.e., initial seed drying with a reusable desiccant in the form of zeolite beads followed by seed conservation in hermetic containers, in rural communities of Guatemala (Huehuetenango Department). In this region, a network of community seed reserves (CSRs) has been established to provide a safety backup for seed and to conserve local agrobiodiversity. Using a local maize variety in three communities, we compared the dry chain with the seed conservation methodology employed in the CSRs (i.e., undried seeds in hermetic flasks) as well as with seed conservation in open storage, both in the local CSR and in a farmer's granary. Seed conserved using the dry chain treatment maintained very high seed viability (> 80%) throughout the whole experiment (6 months) and reduced fungal and insect infestations (< 3%). In the other treatments, the viability declined significantly to an average of 52% non-viable and 19% infested seeds after 6 months of storage. The dry chain was demonstrated to be an excellent solution for enhancing seed conservation in biodiversity hotspots of tropical areas as well as for improving seed security for farmers.

Revealing hidden plant diversity in arid environments	ECOGRAPHY												Estimating total plant diversity in extreme or hyperarid environments can be challenging, as adaptations to pronounced climate variability include evading prolonged stress periods through seeds or specialized underground organs. Short-term surveys of these ecosystems are thus likely poor estimators of actual diversity. Here we develop a multimethod strategy to obtain a more complete understanding of plant diversity from a community in the Atacama Desert. We explicitly test environmental DNA-based techniques (eDNA) to see if they can reveal the observed and 'hidden' (dormant or locally rare) species. To estimate total plant diversity, we performed long-term traditional surveys during eight consecutive years, including El Nino and La Nina events, we then analyzed eDNA from soil samples using high-throughput sequencing. We further used soil pollen analysis and soil seed bank germination assays to identify 'hidden' species. Each approach offers different subsets of current biodiversity at different taxonomic, spatial and temporal resolution, with a total of 92 taxa identified along the transect. Traditional field surveys identified 77 plant species over eight consecutive years. Observed community composition greatly varies interannually, with only 22 species seen every year. eDNA analysis revealed 37 taxa, eight of which were 'hidden' in our field surveys. Soil samples contain a viable seed bank of 21 taxa. Soil pollen (27 taxa) and eDNA analysis show affinities with vegetation at the landscape scale but a weak relationship to local plot diversity. Multimethod approaches (including eDNA) in deserts are valuable tools that add to a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity in such extreme environments, where using a single method or observations over a few years is insufficient. Our results can also explain the resilience of Atacama plant communities as 'hidden' taxa may have been active in the recent past or could even emerge in the future as accelerated global environmental change continues unabated.

We analyzed the current state and conservation gaps of the native species preserved in the Seed Base Bank (SBB) of the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA), the main curator of Chile's plant genetic resources. Our analysis showed that 3,040 seed accessions of native species are preserved in the SBB, corresponding to 1,256 species, which represents 26.9% of the Chilean flora. The area with the largest number of accessions collected corresponds to the northern and central parts of the country, indicating that there has been a bias in terms of concentrating efforts on the continental regions and ignoring other important geographical regions of Chile, such as those located in the insular territory. A quarter of the threatened plants belonging to the Chilean flora are not currently conserved in the SBB, as they are vascular species without seeds, which cannot be protected in the long term under the traditional conditions of a seed bank. Additional collection and research efforts are required to increase the collection of native species in the SBB, especially threatened and endemic species.																		2578-4854				NOV	2020	2	11							e292	10.1111/csp2.292		OCT 2020					WOS:000584015100001						
J	Laspina, NV; Batlla, D; Benech-Arnold, RL				Veronica Laspina, Natalia; Batlla, Diego; Luis Benech-Arnold, Roberto			Dormancy cycling is accompanied by changes in ABA sensitivity in Polygonum aviculare seeds	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Polygonum aviculare seeds show high levels of primary dormancy (PD). Low winter temperatures alleviate dormancy and high spring temperatures induce seeds into secondary dormancy (SD), naturally establishing stable seedbanks cycling through years. The objective of this work was to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in PD expression and release, and in SD induction in these seeds, and the extent to which abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) are part of these mechanisms. Quantification of endogenous ABA both prior to and during incubation, and sensitivity to ABA and GAs, were assessed in seeds with contrasting dormancy. Expression analysis was performed for candidate genes involved in hormone metabolism and signaling. It was found that endogenous ABA content does not explain either dormancy release or dormancy induction; moreover, it does not seem to play a role in dormancy maintenance. However, dormancy modifications were commonly accompanied by changes in ABA sensitivity. Concomitantly, induction into SD, but not PD, was characterized by a increased PaABI-5 and PaPYL transcription, and a rise in GA sensitivity as a possible counterbalance effect. These results suggest that dormancy cycling in this species is related to changes in embryo sensitivity to ABA; however, this sensitivity appears to be controlled by different molecular mechanisms in primary and secondary dormant seeds.																	0022-0957	1460-2431				OCT 7	2020	71	19					5924	5934		10.1093/jxb/eraa340							WOS:000577075400019	32706878

We tested the usability of seed accessions of the Pannon Seed Bank for reintroduction with the aim to restore sandy grassland in Hungary. Seeds of 10 native sandy grassland species were seeded in the year of collection and after one or two years of storage. The establishment was estimated by counting seedlings along seeded transects for two vegetation seasons. This study produced the first numerical estimate we know about of native sand grassland species emergence in the field. A low establishment of the tested species was found, ranging from 0.002 to 8%. Within this range,Dianthus serotinushad the highest establishment, whileFestuca vaginata, which was sown as matrix species, performed only medium establishment. The short-term storage (1 or 2 years) of seeds had no significant effect, except forF. vaginata, where seed storage had a positive effect on reintroduction success. The year of seeding had the highest influence on recruitment. Four species were found to emerge over two years instead of only the first year. Based on our results, the weak seed yield of certain years and the low supply of native seeds in the market can be mitigated by using stored seeds. It is recommended to use multi-year, scheduled seeding to reduce the negative impacts of particularly dry years and to increase the restoration success.

Using spatial models to identify refugia and guide restoration in response to an invasive plant pathogen	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												The global spread of invasive plant pathogens is increasing, putting natural forests and ecosystem services under threat. Spatial data can quantify range non-overlap between invasive pathogens and their hosts to identify existing and potentially restorable refugia to enable 'escape' from the pathogen. In 2017, myrtle rustAustropuccinia psidiiwas detected in New Zealand. New Zealand has 27 native woody and liana species in the plant family susceptible to the disease (Myrtaceae), many of which are ecosystem dominants and economically important. Spatial methods were used to compare the current New Zealand distribution of myrtle rust with the modelled distributions of its potential native hosts. To guide management and set priorities for conservation of at-risk species, areas of potential refugia where a Myrtaceae species is predicted to occur outside the pathogen range were identified under two myrtle rust distribution scenarios. Myrtle rust will thrive in New Zealand's warmer regions. Many native Myrtaceae are distributed within this area, but several species occur extensively outside the core range of the disease. Species distributed in cooler southern regions will be best placed to persist in refugia. Myrtaceae species with specific habitat requirements and narrow geographical ranges in warmer (northern) areas are likely to require ex situ or active in situ management. Even widely distributed species will benefit from the restoration of suitable habitat that supports multiple species outside the myrtle rust range. Synthesis and applications. Spatial data can be used to identify refugia and restoration opportunities, and thus inform landscape-level management responses to invasive pathogens. This approach can guide decisions over where to implement in situ (e.g. fungicide spraying) versus ex situ (e.g. seed banking, botanic gardens) management efforts.

This study aims to verify the effects of dormancy overcoming on germination of four tree species and the ability of 12 tree species to form seed banks for restoration use. Our results showed wide variation of species' germination rates. Overcoming dormancy enhanced germination for Dirnorphandra moths, Hyrnenaea stigonocarpa, and Peltophorurn dubiurn and decreased it for Copaifera langsdorffii, but was only cost-effective for H. stigonocarpa. Regarding the ability to form seed banks, only H. stigonocarpa and Cecropia pachystachya germinated and live seedlings of Terminalla corrugata were found after being buried for six months, thus forming a transient seed bank. Despite the fact that overcoming dormancy may optimize germination after direct seeding, maintaining dormancy mechanisms of species that can form seed banks could be essential for species establishment over time in restoration areas. Hence, our key decision criteria based on seed costs and seed and labor availability would be useful for the seeding actions of restoration practitioners.

However, there is not much that describes one by one the yield of collected seed, the morphological and storage properties, as well as the specific method of extraction to maintain optimal seed viability. The seed exploration activity aimed to increase the variety of seeds collection for the Seed Bank storage function in Purwodadi BG and to provide complete information about the collected seed. This research was conducted on April 15-27, 2019 in Alas Purwo National Park, Banyuwangi, East Java. The method used was an explorative method consisting of fruits and seeds collection in the field, plant identification, seed extraction and temporary storage of seeds before being transferred to the Seed Bank of the Purwodadi Botanical Gardens. Fruit and seed characterization was described as descriptively based on direct observation. The Seed characters observed were included the number of weight, length, width, the thickness of seeds. The method of extracting each seed is documented and recorded, especially those that require special handling. Among 45 collected seed most of them were shrub, which are dominated by Annonaceae, Moraceae, and Rubiaceae, families. Based on the seed storage behavior, most of the seed were orthodox, this was possible in 14 days of trip for the seeds to maintain their viability, as evidenced by the germination rate above 75% at most of collected seeds. Some seeds had special characteristics in their extraction because of the different morphological properties of the seeds and fruits. Most of the seeds obtained from nearshore ecosystem were easy to extract because the seeds were quite dry.																	1811-9506	2218-3973				OCT-DEC	2020	17	4					2825	2835									WOS:000616582900029

On the basis of the results of this study, we clarified implementation strategies for a potential management tactic for Palmer amaranth and V. dahliae in chile pepper: mustard seed meal (MSM). The objectives were to (1) determine MSM effects on Palmer amaranth seedbanks under different moisture levels, (2) measure glucosinolate degradation in soil hydrated to saturation and field capacity, and (3) determine the effects of decreasing moisture availability on MSM control of Palmer amaranth and V. dahliae. To address objective 1, seedbanks with and without MSM were hydrated to levels expected to both inhibit and promote germination (flooded, saturated, -0.03, -0.6 MPa, respectively). For objective 2, soil columns with MSM were held at different moisture levels and sampled over time. For objective 3, Palmer amaranth seeds were incubated with and without MSM, and with polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions comprising a range of water potentials (0, -0.03, -0.6, -1.0, and -2.0 MPa). These PEG solutions were also used to hydrate MSM in agar plates with plugs of V. dahliae. All experiments were performed in growth chambers with temperatures and light conditions conducive to Palmer amaranth germination and V. dahliae mycelial growth. MSM-induced mortality in Palmer amaranth seedbanks was greater in soil at field capacity than in saturated soil and flooded soil; however, rates of glucosinolate degradation were greatest in saturated soil. Decreasing water availability progressively decreased the efficacy of MSM on Palmer amaranth because MSM was ineffective on nongerminated seeds. When incubated with PEG solutions with water potentials of 0, -0.03, and -0.6 MPa, MSM stopped growth of V. dahliae; however, MSM-induced control of V. dahliae was reduced by water potentials of -1.0 and -2.0 MPa. The results of this study indicate soils hydrated to field capacity maximize MSM-induced control of Palmer amaranth and V. dahliae.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the seed distribution of these species on the forest floor before and after seed dispersal; and seedling emergence, survival, and growth during the rainy season after dispersal of seeds. There were no remaining viable seeds of these species in the seedbank before seed dispersal. The average numbers of seeds after seed dispersal were 188 seed m(-2) in a 30 m radius around M. urundeuva, 9 seed m(-2) in a 10 m radius around H. impetiginosus, and 5 seed m(-2) in a 20 m radius around A. cearensis. The distance of seed dispersal reached 30, 20, and 10 m for M. urundeuva, H. impetiginosus, and A. cearensis trees, respectively, due to differences in tree height, seed weight, forest density, and wind intensity. Seedling emergence was observed during 4 (M. urundeuva) and 9 (H. impetiginosus and A. cearensis) weeks. High mortality predominated at the beginning and end of the rainy season for M. urundeuva and A. cearensis, respectively, while practically all H. impetiginosus seedlings survived. M. urundeuva showed the highest mortality but had higher number of established seedlings than the other species. Seedling survival peaked around 5 m from the tree base. Seedling recruitment and natural regeneration of these trees are assured in the Caatinga site evaluated.

Restoration practitioners try to overcome these challenges through seeding and site preparation treatments. In the McDowell Sonoran Preserve, Scottsdale, Arizona, the focus for restoring old roads was on seeding, cactus transplants, and soil treatments (either ripping or adding soil from nearby construction areas). Here we evaluated the success of these restoration sites 5-8 y after project completion. We compared vegetation and ground cover on eight roads that received a combination of these restoration treatments with adjacent reference areas. Plant cover was similar between the restoration and reference plots, but plant composition was different. The restoration plots contained more cacti due to cactus transplants, whereas the reference areas contained more shrub cover. The number of native plant species was greater in the reference areas than in the restoration plots. Seeding treatment had little effect, with only five of 11 seeded species appearing in plots, and only one species, Bouteloua aristidoides, appeared in both treatments that included seeding. Although cacti may have contributed to overall plant cover, they did not appear to aid establishment of other plants. Our findings suggest more interventions are likely required for the restoration and reference plant communities to converge in arid environments. We suggest considering multiple seeding treatments that will maximize the potential for ideal germination conditions and additional local interventions that may help accumulate litter and protect seeds.																	0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	2020	184	2					129	148		10.1637/0003-0031-184.2.129							WOS:000585001000001

Conservation biology studies have focused on the measurement of this variation to establish demographic parameters, diversity levels and population structure to design the appropriate conservation strategies. However, in ex situ conservation approaches, the main objective is to guarantee the characteristics of the conserved material (phenotype and epi-genetic). We review the use of the Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) technique to detect changes in the DNA methylation patterns of plant material conserved by the main ex situ plant conservation methods: seed banks, in vitro slow growth and cryopreservation. Comparison of DNA methylation patterns before and after conservation is a useful tool to check the fidelity of the regenerated plants, and, at the same time, may be related with other genetic variations that might appear during the conservation process (i.e., somaclonal variation). Analyses of MSAP profiles can be useful in the management of ex situ plant conservation but differs in the approach used in the in situ conservation. Likewise, an easy-to-use methodology is necessary for a rapid interpretation of data, in order to be readily implemented by conservation managers.				Gonzalez-Benito, M.

Disturbed forests may or may not recover by themselves in a certain period of time. However, it is still unclear as to what parameters can be used to reasonably predict the potential for self-recovery of human-disturbed forests. Here, we combined seed rain, soil seed bank, and seed emergence experiments to evaluate the potential for self-recovery of a highly disturbed, tropical, mixed deciduous forest in northeastern Thailand. Our results show a limited potential for self-recovery of this forest due to low seedling input and storage and an extremely high mortality rate during the drought period. There were 15 tree species of seedlings present during the regeneration period in comparison with a total number of 56 tree species in current standing vegetation. During the dry season, only four tree seedling species survived, and the highest mortality rate reached 83.87%. We also found that the correspondence between the combined number of species and composition of plant communities obtained from seed rain, soil seed bank, and seedling emergence experiments and the standing vegetation was poor. We clearly show the temporal dynamics of the seed rain and seedling communities, which are driven by different plant reproductive phenology and dispersal mechanisms, and drought coupled with mortality. We conclude that this highly disturbed forest needs a management plan and could not recover by itself in a short period of time. We recommend the use of external seed and seedling supplies and the maintenance of soil water content (i.e., shading) during periods of drought in order to help increase seedling abundances and species richness, and to reduce the mortality rate.

The genetic diversity of many crops is well represented in ex situ seed banks and the number of seed collections of wild species is growing. However, approaches beyond conventional seed banking are needed for some species. Cryobiotechnology, including cryopreservation (i.e. ultra-cold temperature) and the in vitro technologies that support it, offers the potential for conserving these species, securing germplasm for future restoration of species that are declining in the wild. Cryopreservation has been demonstrated as a safe and effective method for conserving desiccation tolerant short-lived seeds, zygotic embryos, dormant buds, spores, pollen, shoot tips, somatic embryos, gametophytes, and algae, with a growing number of studies indicating that viability can be maintained over at least 2-3 decades, including a recent study in this laboratory. Instituting the use of long-term cryopreservation on a broad scale, supported by in vitro technologies, is of immediate importance to stem the loss of species diversity, and this can be accomplished by building on the expertise and infrastructure that has developed over the past 30 years. Here we review the application of cryobiotechnologies to a variety of plant tissues in order to highlight their potential and to call for a global effort to broaden ex situ conservation beyond conventional seed banking.

Tree Community Composition and Dispersal Syndrome Vary with Human Disturbance in Sacred Church Forests in Ethiopia	FORESTS												Research Highlights: Variations in species composition across church forests in northern Ethiopia were driven more by variations in human disturbance and community forest management than forest size. The degree of human disturbance acted as an environmental filter that selected for weedy, exotic, and wind-dispersed species regardless of forest size. Background and Objectives: Forest fragmentation can profoundly influence the long-term persistence of forests on the landscape. Habitat fragmentation can increase edge effects and limit dispersal between forest patches. In the South Gondar Administrative Zone in northern Ethiopia, many of the remaining forests are small sacred church forests governed by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church. Materials and Methods: We examined the drivers of woody plant species composition across 46 church forests in this region, including the influence of elevation, forest size, distance between forests, human disturbance, the presence of a wall, and the importance of local/individual community forest management at the Woreda level. We also examined how dispersal syndromes are influenced by increasing distance between forests and the extent of human disturbance within forests. Results: We found that elevational zone, distance between forests, the degree of human disturbance and Woreda had the greatest effect on species composition. Forest size and the presence of a wall were not significant drivers of species composition in these forests. Conclusions: We propose connecting forests through corridors or scattered trees to increase dispersal between forests, and greater on-the-ground protection efforts to restrict people and cattle from leaving the main trails within sacred forests				Mekonnen, Amare Bitew/AAC-1961-2021	Mekonnen, Amare Bitew/0000-0002-9637-2460; Tsegay, Berhnau/0000-0002-9209-351X; Baez, Mabel/0000-0001-6946-9833													1999-4907				OCT	2020	11	10							1082	10.3390/f11101082							WOS:000582845600001

This study aimed to identify characteristics of the SSB, its relationship with aboveground vegetation (AGV), and its significance for restoration of vegetation in West African savanna-woodlands. Data were collected from two long-term factorial experiments established in 1992 in Burkina Faso to examine the long-term ecological effects of grazing, early fire, selective tree cutting on savanna-woodland ecosystem. A total of 1920 soil samples were taken from three soil layers (i.e. 0-3 cm, 3-6 cm and 6-9 cm) and the SSB was assessed using the seedling emergence technique. The emerged seedlings were dominated by non-woody taxa. Only two woody species that were Flueggea virosa and Mitragyna inermis emerged, showing that woody species feature little in the SSB. The SSB density and richness decreased significantly with soil depth. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination indicated a lack of correspondence between the AGV and SSB. The results suggest site-specific responses to disturbance also following long-term disturbance, the SSB will be ineffective in regenerating the remnant vegetation of West African savanna-woodlands. Hence, ensuring the resilience of West African savanna woodland ecosystems will require targeted introductions (i.e. planting and seeding) of indigenous species and a reduction in on-going disturbances.

Seed banks are a genetic repository that effectively preserve taxa of conservation interest, and they hold knowledge about the biology and germination ecophysiology of the taxa they preserve. The main goals of this study were to investigate the germination requirements for H. scrughi, to evaluate the seed viability after eight years of long-term conservation and to suggest an efficient protocol for germination. Seeds stored at -25 degrees C in the seed bank were tested at temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C and 25/10 degrees C. Base temperature (T-b) and thermal time (theta(50)) for germination were estimated. Seeds of H. scrughi germinated over a wide range of temperatures, responding positively to high temperatures and 25/10 degrees C. T-b was estimated at 4.92 degrees C, and theta(50) was estimated at 198.27 degree days. The high viability detected in seeds of H. scruglii allows us to suggest the use of seeds stored in a seed bank when fresh material for plant propagation is scarce. Our results provide new and useful baseline information for implementing conservation and multiplication strategies for this endangered medicinal plant.

Viable weed seed density and diversity in soil and crop productivity under conservation agriculture practices in rice-based cropping systems	CROP PROTECTION												Viable weed seed density and diversity in soil were assessed in an experiment that comprised two types of crop rotation [rice-wheat and rice-maize], two crop residue management (without residue and with residue), and four tillage techniques: conventional tillage (CT) transplanted puddled rice (TPR) - CT wheat/maize (CTTPR-CT), unpuddled transplanted rice - zero tillage (ZT) wheat/maize (UPTPR-ZT), ZT transplanted rice (ZTTPR) - ZT wheat/maize (ZTTPR-ZT), and ZT dry seeded rice (ZTDSR) - ZT wheat/maize (ZTDSR-ZT). The aim was to investigate the density and community composition of viable weed seed in soil in UPTPR-ZT, ZTTPR-ZT, and ZTDSR-ZT systems with and without crop residue, using the seedling germination method. The soil seed density was assessed in 2013-14 and 2014-15 after 4th and 5th year crop cycles established on a sandy loam soil of Patna, India. Total viable seed density was the highest for Cyperus iria L. irrespective of the treatment in both years. Rice-wheat system recorded 4% higher (mean of two years) seed density over the rice-maize system. Residue management practices did not differ for total viable seed density in both years. The ZTDSR-ZT, UPTPR-ZT, and ZTDSR-ZT systems resulted in significantly higher Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, and evenness indices compared to the CTTPR-CT system. Total viable seed density was the lowest for ZTDSR-ZT compared to the remaining tillage practices in both years. The sequence for Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees emergence was ZTTPR-ZT > ZTDSR-ZT > UPTPR-ZT > CTTPR-CT in 2014-15 (P < 0.05), signifying the more dominance of mono-cotyledons in ZT systems. The density of total aboveground weed density (no. m(-2)) was higher in ZTDSR-ZT in 2013-14 and lower in 2014-15 compared with remaining tillage techniques at 65 days after sowing. Thus, higher aboveground weed density in ZTDSR-ZT system minimized the soil seed density over time. Complete ZT-based practices (ZTDSR-ZT, ZTTPR-ZT) with crop residue significantly enhanced the grain yield of component crops over the CTTPR-CT. Thus, it implies that exhaustion of soil seedbank in ZTDSR-ZT system after 5 years can reduce the aboveground weed infestation and attain the higher grain yield compared to the CTTPR-CT system.																	0261-2194	1873-6904				OCT	2020	136								105210	10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105210							WOS:000556166500004

CROP PROTECTION												Prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) has become an increasing problem in cereals and lucerne pastures in southern New South Wales, Australia. A better understanding of the biology is needed for improved control. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine dormancy status among L. serriola populations, to evaluate environmental factors affecting seed germination and to determine field emergence patterns. Among 76 L. serriola seed samples collected between 2015 and 2018, more than 59% of the samples had little or no innate dormancy, with germination greater than 80%. However, a further tetrazolium test showed that 42 samples collected in the summer season of 2015-16 differed in their dormancy status, with high levels of initial dormancy up to 75.6% in some populations. Lactuca serriola germinated from 10 C to more than 35 C, with the optimum temperatures being 15-25 C. Light stimulated the germination of L. serriola, while the germination was completely suppressed at 80-110 mM of NaCl. Lactuca serriola germinated well under a range of acidic and alkaline conditions. L. serriola predominately emerged (40-52%) from the soil surface, however, limited emergence also occurred from beyond 5-cm burial depth (up to 1.5%). Emergence in a standing crop was 10 times less than that in a bare soil. L. serriola populations from high and low rainfall zones had similar seasonal emergence patterns in the field, with 69% emergence in late autumn and early winter, 22-26.8% in late winter, 1.4-2.4% in spring in the first year after sowing, little or limited emergence in the second and third year. These results suggest that L. serriola can colonise wide geographical areas. Controlling the autumn and winter cohorts is important to stop seed set. If the seed set is completely prevented, L. serriola can be managed over a minimum of two years due to the relatively short-lived seed life.																	0261-2194	1873-6904				OCT	2020	136								105222	10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105222							WOS:000556166500007

To better understand the pattern and regeneration potential of seed banks on tropical coral islands, we measured en-vironmental factors and the species composition, and species richness of soil seed banks and vegetation along a gradient from the center to the edges on East Island in the South China Sea. The results showed that the simi-larity between the species composition of vegetation and seed banks increased from the center to the edge. In the center, species richness in both vegetation and seed banks was positively correlated with soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. At the edge, species richness in both vegetation and seed banks was po-sitively correlated with soil pH. Our results indicate that plant communities contributed little to the seed banks in the center of the island and evidently played a minor role in vegetation regeneration at that location. Plant communities near the edge, in comparison, showed a greater potential for regeneration from seed banks. Conservation and management practices along the center-to-edge gradient should be designed in accordance with the differences in plant communities and soil seed banks at different locations on the gradient.				刘, 芳延/AAO-8535-2021; Cai, Hongyue/AAG-3659-2021	刘, 芳延/0000-0002-5155-1916; Hui, Dafeng/0000-0002-5284-2897												1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2020	117								106689	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106689							WOS:000555555100005

Environmental factors driving seed dormancy and germination in tropical ecosystems: A perspective from campo rupestre species	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Campo rupestre is a mountain tropical landscape occurring in Brazil. It is considered one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world and a major center of endemism. This review addresses the particularities and crucial roles that environmental signaling plays in germination, longevity, and dormancy cycles of seeds of tropical species from campo rupestre vegetation. It also addresses how microhabitats can influence the hormonal and biochemical control of seed germination, longevity and dormancy, as well as how the interaction between soil humidity and temperature can modulate the acquisition and overcoming of secondary dormancy, affecting dormancy cycles of important groups of campo rupestre species. The available data show that most species of campo rupestre produce small seeds that germinate in a wide range of temperatures, require light to germinate and are able to form long-term persistent soil seed banks. Special attention should be given to seeds of Velloziaceae, which germinate in the dark at high temperatures with germination mediated mainly by abscisic acid, and to seeds of Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae, which have cyclical dormancy in fine synchrony with the seasonally of campo rupestre. Seasonal water availability, along with temperature, has shown to play a critical role in annual dormancy cycles, with the dynamics of gibberellins and abscisic acid levels driving the acquisition of secondary dormancy. This information is essential for understanding interactions between seeds and the environment and will provide useful contributions to the conservation and maintenance of campo rupestre vegetation and the preservation of this unique ecosystem.

However, gaining an understanding of these processes represents a major challenge. In this study, we examined variations in the bud bank demographics of dune vegetation and the role of vegetation, soil properties, and disturbance in determining the size and composition of bud bank during the stabilization processes from active to fixed sand dunes. We investigated bud bank size and composition, vegetation characteristics, and soil properties in the interdune lowlands of active and fixed sand dunes in Inner Mongolia, China. We found that sand dune fixation increased bud bank density. Soil properties were determined to be the primary factors affecting bud bank in the interdune lowlands of an active dune, whereas vegetation density was the most important factor affecting bud bank in the interdune lowlands of a fixed sand dune. Among the different bud types, we found that rhizome and root-sprouting buds were dependent to a greater extent on soil moisture content in the interdune lowlands of active dunes, while in the interdune lowlands of fixed dunes, rhizome and root-sprouting buds had a greater dependence on soil total carbon. In contrast, filler buds tended to be more related to vegetation density, whereas no evidence showed there was a prominent influence of any factor on collar buds. The mechanisms (vegetation, stress, and disturbance) affecting bud bank demographics are modified by sand dune fixation. The responses of different bud types to environmental factors differ in the interdune lowlands of both active and fixed sand dunes.

Are successful adaptations for colonisation shared by phylogenetically related species? Location Czech Republic, Central Europe. Methods We used two indices of plant species' colonisation ability (developed from an extensive dataset of dated successional series for 1,531 plant species of the Czech Republic): index of colonisation potential (ICP), which is corrected for mass effect (species' frequency in the landscape acquired from Czech National Phytosociological Database, accounting for more common colonisation events of frequent species), and index of colonisation success (ICS), which is solely based on actual species frequencies in disturbed habitats. We also used preferences for successional age (median of age of sites that species had colonised). We correlated these indices with plant functional traits for three functional groups (woody species, non-woody perennial polycarpic, and non-woody monocarpic species) either considering the phylogenetic history of a species or not. Results Woody species were the best colonisers and had the highest preferences for late-successional stages. Non-woody monocarpic species had a higher ICP than polycarpic species while their ICS were comparable. The best predictor of colonisation ability of both monocarpic and polycarpic non-woody species was canopy height, indicating importance of competition. Other successful colonisers were species with seed traits promoting dispersal (low seed mass or low seed terminal velocity). We did not find traits suitable for adverse biotic conditions (high specific leaf area, SLA), low canopy height) to be important. Successional age preference of species was indicated mainly by seed traits (seed mass, seed longevity), which highly corresponded with species' phylogenetic history. Conclusions Colonisation of disturbed sites is limited by seed dispersal and competitive interactions rather than an adverse abiotic environment.

J	Brandao, EAF; Santos, TD; Rist, S				Brandao, Emily Aparecida Ferreira; Santos, Thiago da Rocha; Rist, Stephan			Family Farmers' Perceptions of the Impact of Public Policies on the Food System: Findings From Brazil's Semi-Arid Region	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												The global narrative on food sustainability revolves around the need to improve food security, right to food, environmental performance, social-ecological resilience, reducing poverty, and inequality. Such principles were guiding a food policy shift for addressing the needs of family farmers, taking place in Brazil. However, how these policies were seen from the point of view of family farmers has not yet been investigated sufficiently. Consequently, this paper presents the results of an assessment of how food policies have impacted the food system in terms of production practices, market structure, land access, and food security, through the perception of family farmers. Our study concerns the semi-arid part of the state of Bahia (Brazil), in which rainfed food systems prevail. The perception of family farmers on the food policies related to credit, public procurement, technology, knowledge, and land access showed three main results: (1) concerning production practices, there was an increase in crop diversification (formerly collected wild plants are currently cultivated) and the dissemination of agro-ecological techniques (organic matter as a fertilizer and seed bank). However, credit is limited, not being translated into significant investments in the production process; (2) with regard to market structure, the public food procurement programs created a specific market for farmers assuring to provide reliable and stable income and trade through economies of scale. The negative factor regarding public food procurement programs is the dependence of farmers from institutional markets organized by the government; (3) food security was increased, due to the stable income, but the lack of policies directed at on-farm autonomy makes production for self-consumption difficult to be achieved. Also, the legal basis for land access does not meet the expectations and needs of farmers, placing them in a position of vulnerability to land grabbing. We conclude that the new food public policies had positive impacts, through a double strategy, consisting in first, the improvement of individual food system activities, and second, interconnecting single food system activities in such a way that they create synergies among them, in view of basic principles of sustainable food systems.																		2571-581X				SEP 29	2020	4								556732	10.3389/fsufs.2020.556732							WOS:000576861700001

L.; Siqueira, Marinez F.; Durigan, Giselda			Effectiveness and costs of invasive species control using different techniques to restore cerrado grasslands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Invasion by exotic grasses is a severe threat to neotropical grasslands conservation and a major challenge for their restoration. To restore fire-prone cerrado grasslands in southeastern Brazil, which have been massively invaded by the African grassUrochloa decumbens, we tested prescribed fire, herbicides, and hoeing, by themselves or in different combinations. Techniques were compared using ecological indicators (decreasing invasive and increasing native vegetation cover and richness) and cost-effectiveness. All treatments, except fire alone, were similarly effective in controlling the invasive grass, which was reduced to less than 5% cover after 2 years. However, only hoeing was effective in recovering both ground cover and richness of the native vegetation, which was the restoration goal. Despite not changing ground cover by native vegetation or alien grasses, fire was successful as a complementary technique, by depleting the seed bank of the invasive grass by 40%. Hoeing preceded by fire and followed by a grass-selective herbicide was the most cost-effective, requiring US$40 per hectare to increase native ground cover by one percentage point compared to US$93 per hectare if only hoeing. Despite the low cost and efficacy of glyphosate application for controlling the invasive grass, it must be followed by reintroducing the native ground cover through active restoration. If the restoration target is to recover both structure and richness of the native vegetation without planting, hoeing is the best solution to control alien grasses.				pilon, natashi/L-2087-2014; Ferreira de Siqueira, Marinez/I-9205-2012; Durigan, Giselda/B-9657-2012	pilon, natashi/0000-0001-7985-5842; Ferreira de Siqueira, Marinez/0000-0002-6869-0293; Durigan, Giselda/0000-0003-0693-3154												1061-2971	1526-100X				APR	2021	29			1	SI					10.1111/rec.13219		SEP 2020					WOS:000573213200001

They are common in coastal environments and may thus threaten island biodiversity. While their effects are well known on soils, plant communities and associated fauna, the effects ofCarpobrotuscontrol on vegetation recovery are poorly documented. The aim of the paper is to describe plant community trajectories afterCarpobrotusremoval. Location Bagaud: a 58-ha Mediterranean island, southern France. Methods Carpobrotusand its litter were removed in 2011-2012. Follow-up controls of germinations and resprouts were carried out from then on. Plant communities were surveyed every year two years before and seven years afterCarpobrotusremoval: on two ca. 0.5-ha sites (one coastal and one inland) and in three native plant communities used as potential references. Differences in resprouts, vegetation parameters, and Bray-Curtis similarity indices between years were tested. Plant community dynamics was studied through a non-metric multidimensional scaling and two recovery indices. Results The removal ofCarpobrotusand its litter led to the recovery of diverse native plant communities. To preventCarpobrotusreturn and ensure success, follow-up controls were necessary for a period of at least seven years, but the amount of work decreased with time. The plant community recovering on the coastal site quickly reached a composition and structure similar to that of non-invaded coastal vegetation, although some slow-growing native species remain underrepresented (e.g.,Crithmum maritimumandLimonium pseudominutum). The plant community recovering on the inland site was still very different from the surrounding matorral vegetation because of its slow colonization dynamics, particularly in the presence of competitive herbaceous species. Conclusion Both sites now provide diverse native plant communities with a more diversified composition and structure (plant heights, litter, bare ground patches) than the plant communities which used to be associated withCarpobrotusmats.

Over the last 30 years, considerable progresses have been made in the development of both methods that are currently considered as ex situ conservation strategies, complementary to traditional seed banks and in-field clonal collections. Efficient protocols were developed for the conservation of a large number of crops, including strategically-important vegetables, such as garlic, artichoke, asparagus, cassava, Jerusalem artichoke, mint, potato, sweet potato, chicory, taro, thyme and yam. As a consequence, more than 45,000 accessions of vegetable crops are maintained in 22 genetic resources conservation centers (biobanks), located in 16 countries and 6 continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, North and South America). Approximately 4/5 of these accessions are maintained in vitro by means of slow growth storage of shoot cultures, but cryopreservation is also constantly growing, with almost 8300 vegetable accessions being stored in liquid nitrogen at - 196 degrees C.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				NOV	2020	29	13					3495	3532		10.1007/s10531-020-02051-0		SEP 2020					WOS:000572697900001

We used peat cores from twoSphagnumdominated peatlands, a low- (780 m a.s.l.) and a high-elevation (1480 m a.s.l.) site to test the hypotheses that spore concentration, accumulation rate, germinability and longevity are lower at a high-elevation peatland than those at lower elevation due to the assumed climatic limitations at high elevation. Along the cores,Sphagnumspores were extracted, burial time of spores was dated and spore germinability was tested layer by layer.Sphagnumspore concentration, accumulation rate and germinability were greater at the high-elevation peatland than at the low-elevation site. Both peatlands had long-term persistentSphagnumspore banks with a predicted longevity (the burial time when 1% spores are viable) ofc. 390 and 140 years for the low- and high-elevation sites, respectively. Our study suggests thatSphagnum, the ecological engineer of peatlands, by regulating spore production and longevity can maintain relatively constant spore banks which may be of great importance in population regeneration and persistence in a changing world.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				OCT	2020	28	5					825	835		10.1007/s11273-020-09752-x		SEP 2020					WOS:000572297200001						
J	Kaundun, SS				Kaundun, Shiv Shankhar			Syngenta's contribution to herbicide resistance research and management	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												The evolution of weed resistance to herbicides is an ever-increasing problem that affects crop yield and food production. In Syngenta, we believe that this difficult and complex issue can be most efficiently addressed through a deep understanding of the evolutionary dynamics and mechanism of resistance. A profound knowledge of resistance is key to developing the next generation of resistance-breaking compounds with existing or novel herbicide sites of action. We use a multidisciplinary laboratory-based, glasshouse and field biology approach to study herbicide resistance and provide strong science-based solutions to delay the onset and manage resistance. We have developed and implemented simple early-season resistance detection methods to allow farmers make an informed decision for effective weed control. We have built mechanistic, individual-based computer models to design profitable, long-term sustainable weed management programs. Our zero tolerance approaches employ herbicides with different sites of action, applied in mixtures and sequences, to minimise the risk of resistance evolution. Weeds are targeted at the right growth stage with optimal herbicide formulation and spray technology for maximising weed control and depleting the seed bank. We are promoting the use of competitive crop varieties and other nonchemical methods for an integrated weed management strategy. We have a global web of external collaborations for studying and managing herbicide resistance. We are committed to farmers' education and training on herbicide resistance, and regularly share our methods and findings via conferences and peer-reviewed scientific publications for the benefit of the wider weed science community and field practitioners.

Mexico is one of the most floristically rich countries in the world. Despite significant contributions made on the understanding of its unique flora, the knowledge on its diversity, geographic distribution and human uses, is still largely fragmented. Unfortunately, deforestation is heavily impacting this country and native tree species are under threat. The loss of trees has a direct impact on vital ecosystem services, affecting the natural capital of Mexico and people's livelihoods. Given the importance of trees in Mexico for many aspects of human well-being, it is critical to have a more complete understanding of their diversity, distribution, traditional uses and conservation status. We aimed to produce the most comprehensive database and catalogue on native trees of Mexico by filling those gaps, to support their in situ and ex situ conservation, promote their sustainable use, and inform reforestation and livelihoods programmes. Methods. A database with all the tree species reported for Mexico was prepared by compiling information from herbaria and reviewing the available floras. Species names were reconciled and various specialised sources were used to extract additional species information, i.e. endemic status, threat status, availability in seed collections, reports on plant uses and conservation actions currently in place. With this information, a comprehensive catalogue of native trees from Mexico was redacted. Available georeferenced records were used to map each species distribution and perform spatial analyses to identify gaps of information and priority areas for their conservation and exploration. Results. Mexico has at least 2,885 native tree species, belonging to 612 genera and 128 families. Fabaceae is the most represented family and Quercus the most represented genus. Approximately 44% of tree species are endemic to the country. The southern part of the country showed the highest values of species richness. Six hundred and seventy-four species have at least one documented human use. In terms of conservation assessment, ca. 33% of species have been assessed by either the IUCN Red List (919) or the National protection catalogue "NORMA Oficial Mexicana NOM-059" (29) or both (45). Additionally, 98 species have been included in the CITES listing for protection. In terms of existing conservation efforts, 19% of species have ex situ protection in seed banks, while protected areas overlap with all the identified peaks of species richness, except for those in the states of Veracruz and Chiapas. This work constitutes a key milestone for the knowledge, management, and conservation of the Mexican native trees. The two areas with high density of tree species identified in Veracruz and Chiapas represent two priority areas for tree conservation in Mexico, where integrated in situ and ex situ conservation efforts should be focused.

To evaluate the effect of storage and litter addition, physical (microstructure) and chemical (fertility) properties were assessed in stored (3-months) and non-stored topsoils. Twelve months after transposition, regardless of the storage time, soil fertility and microstructure were improved, due to the mechanical work of plant roots recruited from topsoil seed bank or rain, and decomposition of pre-existing plant fragments.

In recent years, the renewed interest in coppice wood products increased the need of a solid knowledge on the most suitable restoration practices of overaged coppices. In this context, a key issue is assuring a qualitative and abundant seed regeneration of the chestnut tree (Castanea sativa Miller) in order to substitute overaged stools. Open questions still exist however on the role of the standards (trees released after coppicing) and, in particular, on their interaction with the post-coppicing establishment of seed regeneration. In order to clarify these aspects, we applied different coppicing systems in overaged chestnut coppices so as to create a gradient of residual coverage ranging from full coverage left (no intervention) to simple coppicing (all trees cut, no standards released). The impact of different treatments on chestnut regeneration has been then assessed through field surveys in the second and fifth year post-coppicing, respectively. Chestnut seed regeneration promptly and abundantly established to guarantee the replacement of dead stools also in the simple coppicing. The post-coppicing pulse of chestnut seed regeneration mostly originated from the existing annual seed bank and it was concentrated in the first two years after the intervention, whereas seed inputs by standards or by adult trees at the forest edge played a secondary or negligible role from the third postcoppicing year onwards. Thus, the presence of standards did not benefit regeneration. Rather, it displayed a marked depressive effect on the growth rate of young chestnut seedlings and, under significant shading conditions, enhanced the establishment of shade-tolerant tree species. From a silvicultural point of view, simple coppicing of overaged chestnut coppices represents a valuable management option combining a rapid establishment of natural seed regeneration of chestnut with the resprout and development of the most vigorous stools.

All theories and models have been formulated based on studies on winter annuals, although half of the world deserts have summer annuals. We conducted an experiment to quantify the response of summer annual communities located along an altitudinal gradient (proxy for aridity gradient) to simulated precipitation levels. We expected to find increasingly lower germination fractions (more conservative) as we moved from the highest (less arid) area to the lowest (more arid) area, and also higher germination thresholds in the more arid end of the gradient. The experiment was implemented with two variables: altitude (2900, 3150, 3400 and 3600 m a.s.l.) and simulated precipitation (20, 40, 60, and 80 mm). The full generalized linear model showed that the number of seedlings was related to precipitation, altitude, and their interaction. The number of seedlings was positively related to the precipitation: more seedlings germinated in the less arid sites, and their slopes were steeper, suggesting stronger effects of precipitation in less arid areas. These results supported our first prediction: seed banks from the drier area tend to have more conservative germination responses. We also found a plastic behavior in all four altitudes. Our results show that summer-annuals may utilize both survival strategies as a way to cope with environmental uncertainty.

J	Schneider, B; Zilli, F; Facelli, F; Campana, M				Schneider, Berenice; Zilli, Florencia; Facelli, Florencia; Campana, Mirta			Factors Driving Seed Bank Diversity in Wetlands of a Large River Floodplain	WETLANDS												Soil seed banks serve as reservoirs of taxonomic and genetic diversity and can buffer the effect of perturbations on plant communities, and thus are critical for community resilience. We studied the relationship of seed bank abundance and richness with different hydrological attributes, evaluated beta diversity patterns among wetlands in the Middle Parana River floodplain, and experimentally explored soil seed bank germination after a drought period. Seed abundance was positively related to drought intensity and, along with richness, negatively related to drought and flood frequency. Turnover and balanced variation in abundance greatly contributed to the total beta diversity probably associated with the environmental heterogeneity of the floodplain; nestedness had a lower contribution probably associated with different dispersal abilities of species. Germination behavior varied between rooted and free-floating plants. In conclusion, the soil seed banks studied are highly variable among habitats; drought and flood frequency, and drought intensity are related with the seed banks abundance and richness; and the germination responses after a drought phase differ among broad ecological groups of wetland plants.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2020	40	6					2275	2286		10.1007/s13157-020-01355-9		SEP 2020					WOS:000566325300003

Rice (genusOryza) is one of the most important crops in the world, supporting half of the world's population. Breeding of high-yielding and quality cultivars relies on genetic resources from both cultivated and wild species, which are collected and maintained in seed banks. Unfortunately, numerous seeds are mislabeled due to taxonomic issues or misidentifications. Here, we applied the phylogenomics of 58 complete chloroplast genomes and two hypervariable nuclear genes to determine species identity in rice seeds. Twenty-oneOryzaspecies were identified. Conspecific relationships were determined betweenO. glaberrimaandO. barthii,O. glumipatulaandO. longistaminata,O. grandiglumisandO. alta,O. meyerianaandO. granulata,O. minutaandO. malampuzhaensis,O. nivaraandO. sativasubsp.indica, andO. sativasubsp.japonicaandO. rufipogon.DandLgenome types were not found and theHgenome type was extinct. Importantly, we evaluated the performance of four conventional plant DNA barcodes (matK,rbcL,psbA-trnH, and ITS), six rice-specific chloroplast DNA barcodes (psaJ-rpl33,trnC-rpoB,rps16-trnQ,rpl22-rps19,trnK-matK, andndhC-trnV), two rice-specific nuclear DNA barcodes (NP78 and R22), and a chloroplast genome super DNA barcode. The latter was the most reliable marker. The six rice-specific chloroplast barcodes revealed that 17% of the 53 seed accessions from rice seed banks or field collections were mislabeled. These results are expected to clarify the concept of rice species, aid in the identification and use of rice germplasms, and support rice biodiversity.																	0167-4412	1573-5028				FEB	2021	105	3					215	228		10.1007/s11103-020-01054-3		SEP 2020					WOS:000565844900001	32880855

Trade-off between seed dispersal in space and time	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Seed movement and delayed germination have long been thought to represent alternative risk-spreading strategies, but current evidence covers limited scales and yields mixed results. Here we present the first global-scale test of a negative correlation between dispersal and dormancy. The result demonstrates a strong and consistent pattern that species with dormant seeds have reduced spatial dispersal, also in the context of life-history traits such as seed mass and plant lifespan. Long-lived species are more likely to have large, non-dormant seeds that are dispersed far. Our findings provide robust support for the theoretical prediction of a dispersal trade-off between space and time, implying that a joint consideration of risk-spreading strategies is imperative in studying plant life-history evolution. The bet-hedging patterns in the dispersal-dormancy correlation and the associated reproductive traits have implications for biodiversity conservation, via prediction of which plant groups would be most impacted in the changing era.

J	Hahn, D; Sallenave, R; Pornaro, C; Leinauer, B				Hahn, Daniel; Sallenave, Rossana; Pornaro, Cristina; Leinauer, Bernd			Managing cool-season turfgrass without herbicides: Optimizing maintenance practices to control weeds	CROP SCIENCE												Bans on the use of synthetic herbicides require innovative management approaches to maintain the attractiveness and usability of turfgrass swards. Such measures should include the use of locally adapted cultivars that germinate and establish quickly, resulting in the densest possible stands. Additionally, a number of turfgrasses have been reported to produce allelopathic substances that inhibit common turfgrass weeds. Mowing heights should be set to achieve maximum weed suppression while still providing acceptable quality for desired use. Sustainable turfgrass management programs have led to a reduction in fertilizer inputs; however, without the availability of herbicides, fertilization regimes need to be re-examined. The literature suggests that broadleaf weeds are reduced but never fully controlled when more N is applied; therefore, finding a balance between what is needed and what is environmentally safe and sustainable is critical. Organic herbicides include plant pathogens from the fungus Phoma and strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Both can be used to control several weeds common to turfgrasses. Acetic acid has also been shown to have herbicidal activity; however, it has limited residual activity, and its efficacy remains questionable on mature weeds. Thermal weed control can be used to sterilize a seedbank or spot treat existing weeds. Future turfgrass breeding programs could focus on understanding and enhancing the allelopathic potential of turfgrasses to outcompete weeds more effectively. Furthermore, more research should be directed at assessing the competitiveness of certain turfgrasses against weeds within the limitations of producing turfgrass areas of acceptable aesthetics and playing quality.

Rich), in greenhouse	AGRONOMIA MESOAMERICANA												Introduction. The pine extract may have herbicidal activity to other plants, affecting seed emergence. Objective. To evaluate the pre-emergent effect of a Pinus sp. extract in a greenhouse. Materials and methods. Two experiments were carried out in the K greenhouse of the Fabio Baudrit Moreno Agricultural Experimental Station (EEAFBM), Universidad de Costa Rica, the first in July and the second between September and October 2018. In the first one, the pre-emergent effect of pine extract, with and without added adherent to the spraying broth, on Arthraxon quartinianus (A. Rich.) and a seed bank containing different species were evaluated; in the second experiment the pre-emergent effect of pine on Amaranthus sp., Ischaemum rugosum Salisb., rice (Oryza sativa), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and a seed bank was evaluated. For both experiments, a 15 % formulation of pine extract (3.75 kg a.i. ha(-1)) was sprayed. In both experiments, the number of seedlings emerged was counted, in the first experiment it was recorded at nine days after spraying (das) and in the second at 17 das. Results. The pre-emergent effect on broad-leaved species was not significant, but it was for A. quartinianus (A. Rich.) (p=0,0009). The adherent reduced the effect of the pine extract on A. quartinianus (A. Rich.) (p=0,0116) and other species (p=0,0398). There was an increase in the germination of weeds coming from the seed bank, 121 % for broad-leaved species in general, 92 % for Amaranthus sp. (p=0,013). Besides, the adherent increased the germination of rice seeds by 34 % (p<0,0001). Conclusions. In a greenhouse there was only a significant pre-emergent effect of pine for the weed A. quartinianus (A. Rich.). The pine extract increased the germination of several species.																		2215-3608				SEP-DEC	2020	31	3					773	779		10.15517/am.v31i3.39361							WOS:000611100600018						
J	Cuello, N; Lopez-Marsico, L; Rodriguez, C				Cuello, Noelia; Lopez-Marsico, Luis; Rodriguez, Claudia			Field burn versus fire-related cues: germination from the soil seed bank of a South American temperate grassland	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Fire and grazing are large-scale disturbances that shape the structure and function of open habitats. In temperate grasslands of southern South America, fire is used as a management tool to control tussock grasses and improve forage quality. In this study, we examined if fire and two of its components (heat and smoke) affect germination from the soil seed bank of a temperate grassland in Uruguay. Soil samples were extracted from a recently burned site and from an adjacent area that had not been burned for at least 4 years. The latter was subjected to four treatments: (1) heat shock, (2) smoke, (3) heat shock and smoke and (4) control. The samples were placed in a germination chamber and germination was recorded for 140 days. Field burn was the treatment that differed most from the control. This treatment produced a significant increase in density and richness of germinants and the germination peak preceded those of the remaining treatments. The three treatments involving fire-related cues did not affect the seedling richness and density, but the germination of some individual species was enhanced by some of them, mainly those in which the seeds were smoked. Our results show that fire and its components stimulate the germination of some species of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, contrary to what had been observed previously in the region. We also suggest that, unlike Mediterranean-type systems, other fire cues, alone or in combination with heat and smoke, may promote germination after a fire event.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				SEP	2020	30	3					206	214	PII S0960258520000288	10.1017/S0960258520000288							WOS:000612776000005

For the first aim, five major online databases as well as widely scattered literature sources were consulted; for the latter, the PlantSearch facility of Botanic Gardens Conservation International was used, followed by communication with domestic institutions. The examination of the extent of the ex-situ conservation of endemic plants of the Mediterranean part of northern Morocco (n=94 taxa) showed that only six of them are conserved in one conservatory, four arboretums and 18 botanic gardens of 10 countries, totalling only 25 accessions, with 40% of these in UK institutions. The threatened and near threatened flora of northern Morocco (Mediterranean coast and Rif region) is estimated at 64 taxa; only five of these are preserved ex-situ, among which only Abies marocana and Rhodanthemum hosmariense are assessed as effectively conserved. For the endemic flora of Tunisia which is estimated at 83 taxa, we have found only one taxon (Calendula suffruticosa subsp. suffruticosa) conserved ex-situ. With scarce evaluations made to date, the threatened endemic flora of Tunisia is limited to one taxon only (Rumex tunetanus). This study presents comprehensive and evaluated lists of the endemic plant taxa found in the studied countries/regions, indicating that consensus is compromised among the widely used taxonomic/phytogeographical online sources. Additionally, it is suggested that more coordinated efforts are needed to conserve the plant heritage of these countries, through integrated management, species-prioritisation, restoration of populations of threatened taxa, inclusion of threatened species in national lists of protected species, and establishment of seed banks focused on the wild flora.

Landscape factors driving the spread of the invasive grass, Hymenachne amplexicaulis, among wetlands in a Florida subtropical grazing land	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Wetlands embedded in agroecosystems provide vital ecosystem services (i.e., freeze protection, water retention, nutrient cycling, biodiversity support). However, they are particularly susceptible to invasion by nonnative species. West Indian marsh grass [Hymenachne amplexicaulis (Rudge) Nees] is a major wetland invader in Florida. Despite the documented consequences of H. amplexicaulis invasions, the landscape factors influencing the spread of this species are poorly understood. In this study, we asked whether landscape factors associated with wetland isolation, connectivity, and land management influence the presence of H. amplexicaulis among wetlands embedded in pastures. We recorded the presence or absence of H. amplexicaulis in 158 seasonal wetlands embedded in different pasture types (semi-natural vs. intensively managed). Wetland area, isolation from neighboring wetlands, isolation from the nearest source ditch, and connectivity were determined using a geographic information system (GIS). We related landscape factors to H. amplexicaulis using generalized linear models and model selection based on the second-order Akaike information criterion. Hymenachne amplexicaulis was first detected at the study site in the early 2000s. By 2018, we observed this species in 66% of the surveyed wetlands. The likelihood of observing H. amplexicaulis was higher in wetlands embedded in semi-natural pastures and higher in less isolated wetlands, especially when connected to a ditch. These results indicate that H. amplexicaulis spreads both overland (during seasonal flooding) and via the ditch network. Future work is needed to understand whether seeds or stolons are the primary invasion propagule and whether the species forms a persistent seed bank that could slow down restoration efforts. Additionally, further research is required to understand the ecological impact of this highly invasive plant in Florida wetlands.

Simulated Photovoltaic Solar Panels Alter the Seed Bank Survival of Two Desert Annual Plant Species	PLANTS-BASEL												Seed bank survival underpins plant population persistence but studies on seed bank trait-environment interactions are few. Changes in environmental conditions relevant to seed banks occur in desert ecosystems owing to solar energy development. We developed a conceptual model of seed bank survival to complement methodologies using in-situ seed bank packets. Using this framework, we quantified the seed bank survival of two closely related annual desert plant species, one rare (Eriophyllum mohavense) and one common (Eriophyllum wallacei), and the seed bank-environment interactions of these two species in the Mojave Desert within a system that emulates microhabitat variation associated with solar energy development. We tracked 4860 seeds buried across 540 seed packets and found, averaged across both species, that seed bank survival was 21% and 6% for the first and second growing seasons, respectively. After two growing seasons, the rare annual had a significantly greater seed bank survival (10%) than the common annual (2%). Seed bank survival across both species was significantly greater in shade (10%) microhabitats compared to runoff (5%) and control microhabitats (3%). Our study proffers insight into this early life-stage across rare and common congeners and their environmental interactions using a novel conceptual framework for seed bank survival.

The purpose of our nine-year research project (2010-2018) was to evaluate the dependence of weed-species richness and their selected ecological aspects on stands of energy-plant species, and varieties in energy-tree and -grass plantations in conditions of Central Europe, on the basis of a case study. The permanent research plots were established in plantations containing two varieties of willow (Tordis and Inger), one poplar variety (Pegaso), and one clone ofMiscanthus x giganteus. This evaluation included the species composition of understory flora, habitat preferences of different species, life cycle, life forms, ecological demands, and the harmfulness of these weed-species. The ground flora of energy plantations is predominantly composed of synanthropic plants of a weedy character with differences in species composition among different energy-tree and -grass species and varieties. The total number of vascular plant species was 98. The highest number of species (58) was recorded in the Tordis and Inger willow varieties, and the lowest was observed in the Pegaso poplar variety (45). Perennial species prevailed by their share, 10 of which were found in all four research plots. Therophytes and hemicryptophytes prevailed. Most species have high light requirements and are typical for mild-to-warm suboceanic areas, demanding freshly moist alkalic soils that are medium-to-rich in mineral nitrogen. Fifty percent of all observed species are considered weeds in Slovakia. The "very dangerous" category represented 46.94% of weeds, the "less dangerous" category 51.02%, and the "nondangerous" category represented 2.04% out of 49 species. The biggest share of "very dangerous weeds" was found in the poplar stand (38.78%), less in willow (32.65% and 28.57%), and the least in miscanthus stands (26.53%). The weeds of the Tordis variety were relatively poorly influenced by specific environmental conditions, and the weeds of the Inger variety were mainly defined by the soil reaction. Weeds in the undergrowth of bothMiscanthusxgiganteusand poplar trees (Pegaso) had the greatest affinity to mineral nitrogen content and temperature requirements.

Management of Infection by Parasitic Weeds: A Review	PLANTS-BASEL												Parasitic plants rely on neighboring host plants to complete their life cycle, forming vascular connections through which they withdraw needed nutritive resources. In natural ecosystems, parasitic plants form one component of the plant community and parasitism contributes to overall community balance. In contrast, when parasitic plants become established in low biodiversified agroecosystems, their persistence causes tremendous yield losses rendering agricultural lands uncultivable. The control of parasitic weeds is challenging because there are few sources of crop resistance and it is difficult to apply controlling methods selective enough to kill the weeds without damaging the crop to which they are physically and biochemically attached. The management of parasitic weeds is also hindered by their high fecundity, dispersal efficiency, persistent seedbank, and rapid responses to changes in agricultural practices, which allow them to adapt to new hosts and manifest increased aggressiveness against new resistant cultivars. New understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms behind the processes of germination and haustorium development, and behind the crop resistant response, in addition to the discovery of new targets for herbicides and bioherbicides will guide researchers on the design of modern agricultural strategies for more effective, durable, and health compatible parasitic weed control.

Studies were conducted in 2016 and 2017 in a long-term (36-yr) grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor(L.) Moench ssp.bicolor] experiment at Texas A&M University, College Station, to determine the impact of long-term no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) systems on weed species dynamics. Higher densities of johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense(L.) Pers.], prostrate spurge [Chamaesyce humistrata(Engelm. ex A. Gray) Small], waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus(Moq.) Sauer], and henbit (Lamium amplexicauleL.) were recorded in the NT system compared with the CT system. Further, the NT system showed greater weed diversity (Shannon-Wiener index,H= 0.8) and species richness (S= 6.2), compared with the CT system (H= 0.6,S= 4.2). Seedling emergence of some dominant weed species was also delayed in the NT system. In the CT system, 50% emergence ofS. halepense(8.5 C base temperature) and waterhemp (10 C base temperature) occurred at 59 and 63 growing degree days (GDD), respectively, whereas 68 and 75 GDD, respectively, were required in the NT system. Further, a greater proportion (61%) of the viable seedbank was present at the top 5 cm of the soil in the NT system compared with the CT system (46%). Overall, findings from this 36-yr-long tillage experiment have revealed that the NT system had greater weed densities (especially of the perennial weedS. halepense) and a high proportion of weed seeds (particularly small-seeded annuals) on the topsoil layer, corroborating some earlier reports that were based on short-term investigations. Findings indicate that growers transitioning to NT systems should be mindful of potential shifts in weed species dominance and develop appropriate management tactics.

Germination and emergence of common beggar's-tick (Bidens alba) seeds at two different stages of afterripening as affected by environmental factors	WEED SCIENCE												Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of various environmental factors and burial depth on germination and seedling emergence of common beggar's-tick [Bidens alba(L.) DC.] seeds at two different stages of afterripening. MatureB. albaseeds were stored at 4 C for 3 to 5 mo (new seed lot) and 13 to 15 mo (old seed lot) until experiment initiation. Germination exponentially decreased with increasing moisture stress. Germination rate decreased from 87 +/- 2.9% to 13 +/- 6.1% as osmotic potential decreased from 0 to -0.5 MPa and was completely inhibited at osmotic potentials below -0.83 MPa. A large portion of the new seeds tested positively photoblastic, but seeds that had afterripened for 1 additional year were partially desensitized to the light requirement. New and old seeds still germinated to a greater percentage in the presence of light than under continuous dark at temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 C. Both new and old seeds germinated over a range of temperatures from 5 to 35 C, but the optimum temperatures for germination was 15 to 30 C in the presence of light. Regardless of seed lot, seedling emergence was the greatest when seeds were sown at the soil surface. Seedling emergence was abruptly reduced when burial depth was 1 cm or greater. Based on these results, we conclude that shallow cultivation could effectively suppress this population ofB. albafrom emerging when incorporated into an integrated control strategy. The information obtained in this research identifies some important factors that facilitate the widespread presence ofB. albain Florida and may contribute to weed management programs.

J	Harrington, TB				Harrington, Timothy B.			Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) germination and growth responses to light: implications for logging debris retention after forest harvesting	WEED SCIENCE												Scotch broom [Cytisus scoparius(L.) Link] is a large nonnative, leguminous shrub that threatens native plant communities by rapidly invading recently disturbed sites, competing vigorously for soil water and nutrients, and imparting soil legacy effects that inhibit native plants. In the Pacific Northwest, logging debris retention after forest harvesting prevents or slowsC. scopariusinvasions. A series of studies were conducted to determine potential mechanisms by which logging debris modifies the light environment to limit germination and growth ofC. scoparius. In laboratory studies, seed germination did not vary significantly (P > 0.05): (1) between presence and absence of light for several temperature regimes, (2) when exposed to red (660-nm wavelength) versus far-red (730-nm wavelength) light, and (3) across a range of red/far-red light (R/FR) ratios. These results indicate that modification of the light environment by logging debris or plant canopies has little or no influence onC. scopariusgermination. In a study to simulate effects of variable mass of logging debris, "heavy" debris (2 kg m(-2)) caused biologically relevant reductions in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and R/FR relative to conditions under "light" debris (1 kg m(-2)).Cytisus scopariusgermination did not differ significantly between simulated heavy and light debris; however, values of seedling root and shoot biomass under heavy debris were 16% and 71% of those observed under light debris, respectively. These results indicate that heavy debris limits biomass ofC. scopariusseedlings, particularly roots, by reducing both PPFD and R/FR, which increases seedling vulnerability to summer drought or other stressors. Retention of heavy logging debris after forest harvesting has potential application on sites likely to be invaded byC. scoparius, as well as those sites with seedbanks containingC. scoparius.

Alternative performance targets for integrating cover crops as a proactive herbicide-resistance management tool	WEED SCIENCE												Intensified cover-cropping practices are increasingly viewed as a herbicide-resistance management tool but clear distinction between reactive and proactive resistance management performance targets is needed. We evaluated two proactive performance targets for integrating cover-cropping tactics, including (1) facilitation of reduced herbicide inputs and (2) reduced herbicide selection pressure. We conducted corn (Zea maysL.) and soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merr.] field experiments in Pennsylvania and Delaware using synthetic weed seedbanks of horseweed [Conyza canadensis(L.) Cronquist] and smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridusL.) to assess winter and summer annual population dynamics, respectively. The effect of alternative cover crops was evaluated across a range of herbicide inputs. Cover crop biomass production ranged from 2,000 to 8,500 kg ha(-1)in corn and 3,000 to 5,500 kg ha(-1)in soybean. Experimental results demonstrated that herbicide-based tactics were the primary drivers of total weed biomass production, with cover-cropping tactics providing an additive weed-suppression benefit. Substitution of cover crops for PRE or POST herbicide programs did not reduce total weed control levels or cash crop yields but did result in lower net returns due to higher input costs. Cover-cropping tactics significantly reducedC. canadensispopulations in three of four cover crop treatments and decreased the number of large rosettes (>7.6-cm diameter) at the time of preplant herbicide exposure. Substitution of cover crops for PRE herbicides resulted in increased selection pressure on POST herbicides, but reduced the number of large individuals (>10 cm) at POST applications. Collectively, our findings suggest that cover crops can reduce the intensity of selection pressure on POST herbicides, but the magnitude of the effect varies based on weed life-history traits. Additional work is needed to describe proactive resistance management concepts and performance targets for integrating cover crops so producers can apply these concepts in site-specific, within-field management practices.

J	Buss, J; Pinno, BD; Quideau, S				Buss, Jennifer; Pinno, Bradley D.; Quideau, Sylvie			A comparison between reclamation stockpile and boreal forest seed banks and plant communities	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Soil stockpiles are essential to the reclamation of large- and small-scale mining and other industrial sites. However, stockpiling soils can lead to the degradation of seed banks. This study examines the diversity, composition, depth of seed storage, and relationships between the aboveground and seed bank plant communities in stockpiles and compares them to the nearby boreal forest. The seed bank and aboveground vegetation sampled at eight stockpiles and six mature forest sites were near Fort McMurray (57.337 degrees N, 111.755 degrees W) and Cold Lake (54.695 degrees N, 110.730 degrees W), Alberta, Canada. Seed bank samples were taken from the forest floor (LFH) and depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, >50 cm. Aboveground vegetation cover was also estimated at these locations. The seed bank composition was determined using the seedling emergence method in a greenhouse. Stockpile seed banks had higher seedling abundance and species richness than nearby forested sites but were dominated by grasses and non-native forbs. Most seeds germinated from the surface layer, with 92% of seeds germinating from the LFH layers in the forested sites, and 68% from the 0 to 5 cm layer in the stockpiles. Mature forest sites had more similar aboveground and seed bank communities than the stockpiles. Overall, integrating information on seed bank and aboveground plant communities would improve reclamation decisions, rather than relying on aboveground vegetation alone.

Oats hay supplementation to yak grazing alpine meadow improves carbon return to the soil of grassland ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Supplementation of livestock feed is a common strategy for improving animal production in pasture-based systems worldwide. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, however, the grassland ecosystem is fragile and therefore sensitive to disruption by external forces. We therefore investigated the effects of supplementing yaks feed with oats hay on animal production, forage biomass, and carbon return in litter and dung as well as the effects on soil organic carbon stock. Two grazing systems-native grazing, or grazing with hay supplementation-were established in 2010. For the native grazing system, yaks were rotationally grazed in two paddocks (3.3 yaks/ha) with each 15 days during the warm season (July through October) and 20 days during the cold season (November through June). The hay supplementation system was the same as the native system except that each yak also received oats hay (1.5 kg/day, dry matter basis) during the cold season. For each system, yak growth, forage biomass of the pasture, carbon return from litter and dung to soil, and soil organic carbon stock were measured from 2010 to 2014. The yaks supplemented with oats hay had greater growth performance compared with non supplemented animals, thereby providing economic benefits for herdsmen. With respect to carbon cycling, supplementation increased carbon return in litter and dung and consequently reduced the soil carbon stock loss. The results indicate that supplementation with oats hay positively impacted forage production and carbon cycling in alpine meadows and thus may help remediate degraded soils and improve grassland utilization on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Strong Legacy Effects of Prior Burn Severity on Forest Resilience to a High-Severity Fire	ECOSYSTEMS												Legacy effects from one disturbance may influence successional pathways by amplifying or buffering forest regeneration after the next disturbance. We assessed vegetation and tree regeneration in non-serotinous Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contortavar.murrayana) stands after a 1984 wildfire which burned with variable severity and again after a high-severity subsequent fire in 2012. The legacy effects of the 1984 fire were amplified; seedlings and saplings were abundant in areas initially burned at low severity (1267 stems ha(-1)) despite high reburn severity, but regeneration was low in areas twice burned at high severity (31 stems ha(-1)). Our results suggest that the severity of the 1984 fire may have influenced post-2012 tree regeneration by creating variable fuel loading, which may have affected soils, litter cover and shade after the 2012 fire and therefore affected seedling establishment and survival. A canopy seed bank of unburnt cones from trees killed by the 2012 fire potentially contributed to a strong effect of prior burn severity on regeneration after the 2012 fire despite a lack of serotinous or resprouting tree species, although the influence of this canopy seedbank was likely limited to the year following the fire. Our results suggest that a low- to moderate-severity fire increases forest resilience relative to a high-severity fire even when the next fire burns at high severity.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				JUN	2021	24	4					774	787		10.1007/s10021-020-00548-x		SEP 2020					WOS:000565122600001

The risk of such unintended effects is assessed in order to establish whether a particular use can be approved, possibly in combination with mitigation measures. In Europe, the risk of herbicide treatment to NTTPs is assessed on the basis of tier 2 studies done under controlled conditions in greenhouses. Following the concept of a tiered testing approach, higher tier field studies under more realistic conditions could be used to refine the risk assessment. No current guideline for conducting higher tier NTTP field studies is available. We developed an NTTP higher tier field study method done on an experimental plant community established by sowing of a seed mixture. The setup was optimized in 3 pilot field studies and subsequently used for a definitive study testing effects of the herbicide iofensulfuron-sodium. Results show that the method can be regarded as a suitable higher tier option for assessing effects of herbicides on NTTPs. Growth of species from the soil seed bank cannot be avoided and has to be carefully considered when evaluating results. Adaptations of the study design may be necessary when testing different herbicides. Community-level endpoints were at the same level as single-species endpoints. Results of the field study were compared to standard greenhouse study results for the same herbicide. No observed effect rates (NOERs) in the field were about a factor of 10 higher and show that the current tier 2 risk assessment for NTTPs can be regarded as protective in this case. Whether the present field study design and the assessed endpoints can be used in higher tier risk assessment of NTTPs depends on selection of the specific protection goal and requires further discussion.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;16:691-705.

Ex-situ conservation of wheat genetic resources from Saudi Arabia	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Wheat (Triticum L.) is one of the major food crops of the world, and an important component of food security. The aim of this study was to collect and preserve seeds of wheat growing in eight regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Al-Qassim, Asir, Al-Taif, Najran, AL-Baha, Jazan, Al-Madinah and Wadi Al-Dawasir) where wheat has been cultivated since ancient times. Sixty-one accessions/samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum) were collected and placed in dry storage (ex-situ conservation) at -18 degrees C (i.e. permanent storage). The accessions of local wheat have the ability to grow under harsh environmental conditions such as (high temperature, drought and salinity). Most of these samples were collected directly from farms, but a few were collected from markets. The most important criteria for ex-situ conservation is that seeds need to have a low moisture content (MC) and a high percentage viability. Seed MC was measured for all 61 accessions by the oven-drying method and seed viability was tested in three ways: percentage of germination, tetrazolium chloride testing, and X-ray radiography. The seed MC of the 61 accessions was uniformly very low (0.10-0.12%), and 97 to 100% of the seeds were viable. Thus, all 61 wheat accessions collected in this study have the initial requirements to remain viable for long periods of time in ex-situ conservation in the gene seed bank. (C) 2020 The Authors.

J	Moreau, D; Pointurier, O; Nicolardot, B; Villerd, J; Colbach, N				Moreau, Delphine; Pointurier, Olivia; Nicolardot, Bernard; Villerd, Jean; Colbach, Nathalie			In which cropping systems can residual weeds reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Weeds are often solely considered with a negative viewpoint, but they may also provide services for agroeco-systems. Especially, the residual weed flora that is tolerated by integrated crop protection may contribute to a reduction of nitrate leaching and soil erosion during the summer and autumn fallow. To date, the determinants underlying these environmental weed benefits are largely unknown. The present study developed new indicators to account for the potential beneficial role of annual weed flora to reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion at the field scale, and then calculated them from the outputs of a weed dynamics model. The aim was to analyse which cropping systems facilitate residual weed flora to reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion, while minimizing negative weed impacts on crop production. When developing the indicators, the potential weed-based reduction of nitrate leaching was considered to increase with both the growth of the weed flora and the weed species potential to take up nitrogen; the potential weed-based reduction of soil erosion was assumed to increase with soil cover by weeds when soil cover by cash crops was low. Our simulation study included 259 arable cropping systems (covering a wide range of herbicide and tillage intensity, with each cropping system simulated over 28 years and repeated 10 times with 10 different weather series) in which the dynamics of 25 annual weed species was simulated. Simulations showed that the cropping systems promoting a high potential weed-based reduction of nitrate leaching were generally also those with a high potential weed-based reduction of soil erosion, pointing to a compatibility between these benefits provided by the weed flora. However, the cropping systems promoting these environmental benefits were generally also those that presented the highest crop yield losses. Tillage and crop rotation were identified as the cultural techniques with the greatest influence on the potential weed-based reduction of nitrate leaching and soil erosion, while herbicides had a more limited effect. Most of the studied cropping systems (representing "real situations" in which farmers or experimenters make the decisions about crop rotations and cultural techniques) tended to favour low crop yield losses rather than high weed-based environmental benefits. Interestingly, a few systems achieved both objectives. Systems that achieved relatively low crop yield losses and high weed-based environmental benefits mainly combined infrequent superficial tillage operations, with a low proportion of winter crops in the rotation and a very low tillage depth. Finally, only a few weed traits determined the role of the weed flora to potentially reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion. They were seed traits (seed lipid content, seed area per weight and seed coat thickness), driving the early and fast appearance of the weed canopy after weed seed shed. This suggests that, for annual weed species, a high weed flora potential to reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion is not restricted to specific weed species able to take up nitrogen and cover soil. Thus, our simulation study indicates that such a high potential to reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion could therefore be reached in very different agroecosystems in terms of weed seed bank.

J	Liu, GD; Sun, JF; Tian, K; Yang, HS				Liu, Guodong; Sun, Jinfang; Tian, Kun; Yang, Hongsheng			Effects of dam impoundment on the soil seed bank in a plateau wetland of China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Dam impoundment, which rapidly changes hydrologic regimes and greatly alters aquatic environments, plays a critical role in the seed germination and seedling growth of wetland plants, especially influencing their seed banks. In this study, a soil seed bank experiment was carried out along a water level gradient for the Lake Lashi wetland in the Northwest Yunnan Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect, driver and dynamic mechanism of dam impoundment on the soil seed bank of plateau wetlands using partial least squares (PLS) regression and chaotic dynamic methods. The results showed that the soil seed bank had significant differences in seed density, species composition, and water ecotype of the plant species between the flood zone (perennially flooded area, seasonally flooded area, and flood plain area) and nonflood zone (control area) in the plateau wetland. The seed bank density was obviously lower in the perennially flooded area and higher in the seasonally flooded area and flood plain area, with values that were 39.88%, 153.53%, and 146.47% that of the control area, respectively. After dam impoundment, the number of plant species gradually increased; however, the dominance of the dominant species became less obvious, and the species diversity indices decreased significantly, e.g., by 15.47% for the Simpson diversity index and 72.39% for the Shannon Wiener diversity index. Our study showed that dam impoundment has made the Lake Lashi wetland complex chaotic ecosystem switch between order and disorder through self-organization and that the species composition of the soil seed bank continuously experienced self-adaptation. These results provide a reference for scientific evaluations of the effects of dam impoundment on wetland ecosystems and provide guidance for the protection and management of plateau wetland ecosystems.																	0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 1	2020	269								110790	10.1016/j.icarus.2020.110790							WOS:000541757200022	32561003

Since the 1950s its size has declined due to land development, between 1986 and 2016 nearly 6072 km(2) (57.5% of the area) was lost due to farm land expansion. Since the Wetland for Grain project in 2003, efforts have been made to improve marsh area for animal habitat and ecological protection. A key management concern is prioritizing areas for wetland restoration in scientific planning and polices making. In this study, the natural wetland restoration potentials were evaluated based on land-use change trajectory, seed bank viability and watershed sustainability and restorability. The annual land use maps from 1986 to 2016 were reconstructed using CLUE-S model with land use maps in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016, which were interpreted from Landsat TM/ETM images. Seed bank viability was determined by field sampling in wetland and farm land with different reclamation years and germination in lab. Sub-catchment was chosen as sustainability analysis unit, which was quantified by the impacts of wetland on peak flow reduction. The watershed restorability was performed with the factors of wetland degradation degree, seed bank viability, and the percentage of wetland to watershed area (PWW) with different restoration years. The results indicated that reclaimed wetland with a time since last development (TLD) of <15 years had a higher recovery potential and accounted for 39.2% of the lost wetland. Seventeen sub-catchments with a total area of 2177 km(2) of farmland could be planned for restoration, which could support more than half of the sub-catchments in the study area. Priority areas were identified for short-, mid- and long-term restoration planning. The results can support the scientific planning demands of various restoration goals in the study area, and provide a new method for wetland restoration.

Seed Reserve Hot Spots for the Sub-Tropical SeagrassHalodule wrightii(Shoal Grass) in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Halodule wrightii(shoal grass) is a dioecious seagrass with a widespread tropical and subtropical distribution. Like all seagrass species,H. wrightiihas the ability to expand asexually through rhizome elongation and to reproduce sexually through seed. To better understandH. wrightiisexual recruitment dynamics in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we investigated seed bank densities at 815 sites from south Texas to the Florida Panhandle.H. wrightiiseed reserves were spatially variable across the region, with seed densities ranging from 0 to 5290 seeds m(-2). Spatial analysis revealed clusters of high seed densities ("hot spots") in Upper Laguna Madre, TX, and Santa Rosa Sound, FL, and clusters of low seed densities ("cold spots") in Lower Laguna Madre and Aransas Bay, TX. Hot spots were dominated byH. wrightii, whereas cold spots were dominated byThalassia testudinum(turtle grass). We frequently found intact seed coat halves, suggesting germination; however, we also encountered broken seed coat pieces, characteristic of seed predation. Genotypic surveys within and adjacent to seed hot spots revealed genetically diverse adult populations 6 years post seed bank sampling. Our data show thatH. wrightiiseed reserves are heterogeneous across the northern Gulf of Mexico and that the factors driving variation in seed bank density, viability, and germination remain poorly understood. Information on the spatial heterogeneity ofH. wrightiiseed densities has relevance for seagrass management, including targeting meadows with high levels of reproductive effort for protection or designation as marine reserves.

Germination responses to winter warm spells and warming vary widely among woody plants in a temperate forest	PLANT BIOLOGY												Winter underpins key ecological processes, such as dormancy loss and seedling emergence. Enhanced warm spells, together with warming are occurring and will continue in the future. The consequences of these climate phenomena on germination were investigated among co-occurring woody plants, whose seeds are bird-dispersed in autumn and require cold stratification for spring emergence. Seeds from nine common southeastern USA plants were collected in autumn. We verified that seeds of the study species required cold stratification for dormancy loss. We then examined the following aspects in the laboratory or field: effect of warm spells during cold stratification on germination, effect of a warm spell during winter on seed survival and germination phenology, and effect of warming from autumn dispersal through winter dormancy loss on timing of germination. While no consistent effects of warm spells were found in the laboratory on quantity of germination, warm spells advanced spring field germination for several species. Some species germinated during cold stratification and during warm spells, especially extreme spells, in the laboratory. In the field, about half ofLonicera maackiiseedlings that emerged with a warm spell died by late winter. With warming from autumn through spring, laboratory germination shifted from spring to predominately autumn for some species. With precocious germination during warm spells or germination phenology shifts, two scenarios are possible. Seedlings may die during winter, reducing the size of the soil seed bank and number of emergents, or they would survive in warmer winters, which would give them a competitive advantage over spring-emerging seedlings.				; Jastrzebowski, Szymon/U-8138-2018	Hidayati, Siti Nur/0000-0001-6979-8477; Jastrzebowski, Szymon/0000-0003-1239-4847												1435-8603	1438-8677				NOV	2020	22	6					1052	1061		10.1111/plb.13152		AUG 2020					WOS:000562558900001	32594604

LIMNOLOGY												Insufficient knowledge about ecology of weed macrophytes from a large-scale perspective narrows the necessary decision-making for biodiversity conservation. The present study aimed to assess the occurrence frequency ofEgeria densain lotic and lentic/semi-lotic environments from a Brazilian dammed river, as well as to quantify the attributed explanation (pure or combined) by limnological and spatial variables on species occurrence frequency. Between 2006 and 2010, we repeatedly visited sample points classified as lotic (45) or lentic/semi-lotic environments (23) to collect data on species occurrence and limnological variables. We also generated spatial variables derived from latitude and longitude of sample points.E.densashowed a recurrent occurrence in the sample points classified as lentic/semi-lotic. Both spatial variables (16) and limnological variables (total phosphorus, nitrate, nitrite, transparency and turbidity) significantly contributed to explaining the species occurrence frequency. Forty-nine percent of the occurrence frequency variation was accounted purely by spatial variables. However, less than five percent of occurrence frequency variation was accounted purely by limnological variables. The several dams placed along the river determined the lentic/semi-lotic environments formation and regulated the dispersion processes of individuals ofE. densa, consequently causing a recurrent occurrence of this species in particular environmental classes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sorption-desorption process of aminocyclopyrachlor in soils with the addition of three aged organic materials from sugar cane and their transport via leaching. Sugar cane straw (12 t/ha), filter cake (90 t/ha) and vinasse (200 m(3)/ha) were added to a clayey soil 15, 30 and 60 days before herbicide application. Sorption and desorption were evaluated by the batch equilibrium method. For leaching assessments, the materials were applied to the soil surface. Sorption was relatively low in all treatments (K-d = 0.17-0.41 L/kg), although significantly higher in soil without organic material addition. A negative correlation between herbicide sorption and increased soil base saturation was observed, indicating competition for sorption sites. With the addition of vinasse, 71% of the herbicide reached the leachate, while <50% reached the leachate in the other treatments. Aminocyclopyrachlor availability was not reduced with organic material addition to the soil, which may be favourable for weed control. However, the presence of vinasse leads to the risk of leaching to deeper soil layers than the seed bank.

Methods The study sites were Dongjiu Bridge (DJ), Linji Bridge (LZ), and Birishen Mountain Scenic Spot (RB) in Gongbu Nature Reserve, Southeast Tibet, China. Species composition and distribution pattern of the underground seed bank inP.densataforest were analyzed. Germination data and field investigations were used to examine the similarities between aboveground vegetation and underground seed banks, and their responses to the environment. Results There were 47 species belonging to 27 families in the underground seed bank of theP. densataforest. Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Labiatae, and Poaceae were dominant, accounting for 40.4% of the total number of families. Underground seed density was 2,114, 1,952, and 1,141 seeds/m(2)in DJ, LZ, and BR, respectively. The percentage of different life-forms in each sampling location was shown to be perennial herbs > shrubs > annual herbs > trees > subshrubs. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Simpson's dominance index of each sample showed that species decreased with higher elevation, while the Pielou evenness index showed the opposite trend. Elevation, slope position, slope aspect, and slope were positively correlated with the Pielou evenness index and negatively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Simpson's dominance index. The Sorensen index, comparing the similarity between the underground seed bank and aboveground vegetation of DJ, LZ, and BR was 0.46, 0.35, and 0.31, respectively. Conclusion The underground seed bank ofP. densataforest has high seed density and high species richness, but there was little similarity between aboveground vegetation and underground seed bank. Elevation and slope position had a great influence on the uniformity of species distribution.																	2045-7758					SEP	2020	10	17					9214	9222		10.1002/ece3.6603		AUG 2020					WOS:000560742900001	32953056

Recovery Dynamics of the SeagrassZostera marinaFollowing Mass Mortalities from Two Extreme Climatic Events	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The marine angiosperm,Zostera marina, utilizes both asexual and sexual reproduction to grow, persist, and recover in dynamic environments. Sexual reproduction could be increasingly important forZ. marinapopulation resilience to extreme weather events resulting from climate change. In the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, a warming event in 2005 and unprecedented rainfall in combination with warming in 2018 led to large-scaleZ. marinadeclines. We compare the survival and demographic characteristics of recoveringZ. marinapopulations following these declines to identify the demographic mechanisms driving population recovery. Mean bottom cover in recovering populations was higher in 2019 than 2006, despite lower adult survival, because seedling abundance was significantly higher. Seedlings contributed significantly more to total shoot abundance than adult clones in 2019. Adult clone survival was lower in 2019 in regions that showed greater variation in temperature and salinity. Shifts in adult clone survival and seedling abundance in recovering populations in the Chesapeake Bay suggest thatZ. marinahas two complementary demographic mechanisms for recovery: the seed bank produced from the previous year's flowering and the rapid growth and reproduction of surviving adults. The relevance of reproductive forms or life stages to recovering populations may depend on the severity of the decline in adult survival and the supply of propagules that could facilitate recovery. If climate change increases the frequency of extreme events in the Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere, perennialZ. marinapopulations may be increasingly dependent on the previous years' flowering and recruitment from seed.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2021	44	2			SI		535	544		10.1007/s12237-020-00816-y		AUG 2020					WOS:000560983400001

Using environmental and geographic data to optimize ex situ collections and preserve evolutionary potential	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Maintenance of biodiversity through seed banks and botanical gardens, where the wealth of species' genetic variation may be preservedex situ, is a major goal of conservation. However, challenges can persist in optimizingex situcollections if trade-offs exist among cost, effort, and conserving species evolutionary potential, particularly when genetic data are not available. We evaluated the genetic consequences of population preservation informed by geographic (isolation by distance [IBD]) and environmental (isolation by environment [IBE]) distance forex situcollections for which population provenance is available. We used 19 genetic and genomic data sets from 15 plant species to assess the proportion of population genetic differentiation explained by geographic and environmental factors and to simulateex situcollections prioritizing source populations based on pairwise geographic distance, environmental distance, or both. Specifically, we tested the impact prioritizing sampling based on these distances may have on the capture of neutral, functional, or putatively adaptive genetic diversity and differentiation. Individually, IBD and IBE explained limited population genetic differences across all 3 genetic marker classes (IBD, 10-16%; IBE, 1-5.5%). Together, they explained a substantial proportion of population genetic differences for functional (45%) and adaptive (71%) variation. Simulatedex situcollections revealed that inclusion of IBD, IBE, or both increased allelic diversity and genetic differentiation captured among populations, particularly for loci that may be important for adaptation. Thus, prioritizing population collections based on environmental and geographic distance data can optimize genetic variation capturedex situ. For the vast majority of plant species for which there is no genetic information, these data are invaluable to conservation because they can guide preservation of genetic variation needed to maintain evolutionary potential within collections.

J	Bellin, N; Groppi, M; Rossi, V				Bellin, Nicolo; Groppi, Maria; Rossi, Valeria			A model of egg bank dynamics in ephemeral ponds	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Resting life stages (e.g. dormant seeds and resting eggs) have important implications for ecological and evolutionary processes. In this study, we simulated the impact of different environmental scenarios on the dynamics of resting eggs that make up an "egg bank" of a common fresh water ostracod, Heterocypris incongruens (Crustacea). Our goal was to investigate how the persistence and the wind-mediated spatial distribution of the species in vernal temporary ponds on Lampedusa Island (Southern Italy) were affected. A general model for selection on seed germination in unpredictable environments was used to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics. Metapopulation dynamics were simulated using Levin's and Hanski's models assuming three generalized spatial patterns of pond distribution (random, aggregated along the main wind direction, evenly spaced along the main wind direction) and two dispersion processes (random walk and wind shear). We applied global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (GSUA) to the models. We estimated the egg bank growth rate based on 30-year simulations under present climatic conditions, and assuming a 2 degrees C rise in winter temperature under global climate change. Hatching rate and deterioration rate were the most important input factors for the dynamics of the egg bank. In warmer winter conditions, the probability that a pond water balance is positive, a reliable hydroperiod estimation, was the most important factor in the egg bank simulation dynamics. Regular distribution of ponds along the wind gradient and wind shear, had the highest dispersal and colonizing potential, considering the percentage of empty ponds reached (60 %). Levins' model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 % of colonized ponds while Hanski's model predicted values between 0 and 20 %. In Hanski's model the rescue effect increased the probability of occupied ponds. Potential colonizing resting eggs and extinction rate were positively and negatively correlated to the percentage of colonized ponds, respectively. Our simulations can be generalized to aquatic invertebrate taxa that inhabit temporary ponds, have egg banks, colonize habitats using few propagules and disperse passively by wind.

Current outlook and future research needs for harvest weed seed control in North American cropping systems	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												Harvest weed seed control (HWSC) comprises a set of tools and tactics that prevents the addition of weed seed to the soil seed bank, attenuating weed infestations and providing a method to combat the development and spread of herbicide-resistant weed populations. Initial HWSC research efforts in North America are summarized and, combined with the vast area of crops suitable for HWSC, clearly indicate strong potential for this technology. However, potential limitations exist that are not present in Australian cropping systems where HWSC was developed. These include rotations with crops that are not currently amenable to HWSC (e.g. corn), high moisture content at harvest, untimely harvest, and others. Concerns about weeds becoming resistant to HWSC (i.e. adapting) exist, as do shifts in weed species composition, particularly with the diversity of weeds in North America. Currently the potential of HWSC vastly outweighs any drawbacks, necessitating further research. Such expanded efforts should foremost include chaff lining and impact mill commercial scale evaluation, as this will address potential limitations as well as economics. Growers must be integrated into large-scale, on-farm research and development activities aimed at alleviating the problems of using HWSC systems in North America and drive greater adoption subsequently.

ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												The weed soil seedbank is of interest in agroecosystems as a major source of weed infestation in fields and as a reservoir of plant and seed-feeder diversity. A seedbank is a characteristic of annual plants and has been the focus of numerous studies, as it reflects the past aboveground vegetation and is the reservoir of the future vegetation. Therefore, it potentially can be used to evaluate the past, present and future annual weed communities. The goal of this paper was to provide guidelines to help researchers to do a weed seedbank survey. Through a qualitative review of 60 weed seedbank articles, we investigate why and how the seedbank has been studied in agronomy. It shows that seedbank studies have been performed to address the following four major objectives: (a) the assessment of weed management practices on weed communities; (b) the relationship between seedbank and aboveground vegetation; (c) the study of composition and diversity of seedbank in a given area; and, (d) the quantification of seedbank as a food resource for wildlife. Because the analysis highlighted a wide range of methodologies to estimate the seedbank, we critically reviewed them. We show that the selected methodology strongly affects the seedbank estimate. Nevertheless, in our sample of research articles, the analysis revealed that the choice of the methodology was not always justified in terms of achieving a particular scientific goal, but was often determined by the resources available for the experiment (e.g., workload). While studying the soil seedbank remains of interest for scientists (proved by the amount of recent publications), it is time consuming and requires considerable botanical skill. Innovative methods of estimation are scarce and novel methodological developments are needed to increase the quality and reliability of the data obtained.

The seed bank is a crucial resource for vegetation restoration; however, the effects of grazing disturbance on density and richness of seed banks and consequences on restoration of degraded wetlands are unclear. Methods We selected six alpine wetlands along a degradation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau for study. The structural equation model was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of soil moisture on transient and persistent seed banks through soil physicochemical factors and vegetation. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to explore the role of seed banks in alpine wetland vegetation regeneration. Results A decrease in soil moisture directly increased richness and density of the transient seed bank. However, decreased soil moisture indirectly decreased density of transient and increased richness and density of the persistent seed bank though soil pH and richness and abundance of vegetation. The similarity between the seed bank and vegetation increased with wetland degradation. Slope of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between transient seed bank and vegetation was higher than that for the persistent seed bank and vegetation. Conclusions Transient seed banks remained almost constant under grazing disturbance, which favours persistent seed bank formation. Transient and persistent seed banks were determined by aboveground vegetation and soil environment, respectively. Seed banks provide strong resistance and resilience to degradation of wetland ecosystems, while persistent seed banks play a more important role than transient seed banks in restoration of degraded alpine wetlands.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				FEB	2021	459	1-2					93	107		10.1007/s11104-020-04632-y		AUG 2020					WOS:000556642900006

A Global Review ofLigustrum Lucidum(OLEACEAE) Invasion	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Ligustrum lucidumis a highly invasive East Asian tree that successfully colonizes several subtropical and temperate areas around the world. Its invasion capacity results from a widespread human use mostly in urban and periurban settings, very abundant fruit and seed production, small bird-dispersed fruits, high germination rates, resprouting capacity, fast growth rates, low herbivory levels and tolerance to a wide range of light, temperature and soil. All these traits contribute to its ability to rapidly increase in abundance, alter biodiversity, landscape ecology and limit its management. This paper reviews the current knowledge onL. lucidumwith particular focus on its uses, distribution, invasiveness, ecological and economic impacts and control measures. Most relevant aspect of the review highlight the negative ecological impacts ofL. lucidum,its potential to continue expanding its range of distribution and the need of further studies on the eco-physiology of the species, economic impact and social perception of its invasion and early warning systems.

An essential step towards a valuable conservation is the validation of germination. This study presents a germination screening of seeds from 255 species of the European Eastern Alps, which were to be stored at the Millennium Seed Bank (Kew, UK). The final germination percentage (FGP) was determined using a standard protocol in the laboratory. Species were classified according to species rarity, plant community, occurrence at elevation belts, bedrock types, as well as CSR strategies, and further, seed mass was examined. We could not find statistically significant differences of FGP within these classes, but 74.9% of all tested species germinated using the standard protocol, and half of them had FGP >= 20.1-100%. A treatment with gibberellic acid enhanced the germination in half of the species to which this treatment was applied. Common families in alpine regions, i.e. Asteraceae, Poaceae and Saxifragaceae were highlighted in terms of their germination behaviour. The results provide an evaluation of the application of standard protocols to a broad Alpine species pool on the one hand, and on the other hand, provide ecological insights of the species tested. Germination is not only one of the most important events of the reproductive cycle of plants but could also be a key feature in species' responses to changing environmental conditions.

Little is known about the diversity of plants in urban stormwater ponds and the vegetation composition is often influenced by sowing and planting. We analysed the re-colonisation of the vegetation in an urban stormwater pond, which was reconstructed to improve water retention. Specifically, we studied if the soil seed bank has the potential for re-colonising the pond. We analysed the standing vegetation from the year before until 2 years after reconstruction of a stormwater pond in Hamburg, Germany. Further, we analysed the soil seed bank in the year before and in the second year after reconstruction of the stormwater pond. We found 74 species in the soil seed bank in 2015 and 2017 withJuncusspp. andEpilobiumspp. being the most dominant taxa. Our results indicate that urban stormwater ponds have the potential for re-colonisation out of seed bank and, thus, sowing is not a necessary management action in the reconstruction process.

J	Spicer, RA; Farnsworth, A; Su, T				Spicer, Robert A.; Farnsworth, Alexander; Su, Tao			Cenozoic topography, monsoons and biodiversity conservation within the Tibetan Region: An evolving story	PLANT DIVERSITY												The biodiversity of the Himalaya, Hengduan Mountains and Tibet, here collectively termed the Tibetan Region, is exceptional in a global context. To contextualize and understand the origins of this biotic richness, and its conservation value, we examine recent fossil finds and review progress in understanding the orogeny of the Tibetan Region. We examine the deep-time origins of monsoons affecting Asia, climate variation over different timescales, and the establishment of environmental niche heterogeneity linked to topographic development. The origins of the modern biodiversity were established in the Eocene, concurrent with the formation of pronounced topographic relief across the Tibetan Region. High (>4 km) mountains to the north and south of what is now the Tibetan Plateau bounded a Paleogene central lowland (<2.5 km) hosting moist subtropical vegetation influenced by an intensifying monsoon. In mid Miocene times, before the Himalaya reached their current elevation, sediment infilling and compressional tectonics raised the floor of the central valley to above 3000 m, but central Tibet was still moist enough, and low enough, to host a warm temperate angiosperm-dominated woodland. After 15 Ma, global cooling, the further rise of central Tibet, and the rain shadow cast by the growing Himalaya, progressively led to more open, herb-rich vegetation as the modern high plateau formed with its cool, dry climate. In the moist monsoonal Hengduan Mountains, high and spatially extensive since the Eocene but subsequently deeply dissected by river incision, Neogene cooling depressed the tree line, compressed altitudinal zonation, and created strong environmental heterogeneity. This served as a cradle for the then newly-evolving alpine biota and favoured diversity within more thermophilic vegetation at lower elevations. This diversity has survived through a combination of minimal Quaternary glaciation, and complex relief-related environmental niche heterogeneity. The great antiquity and diversity of the Tibetan Region biota argues for its conservation, and the importance of that biota is demonstrated through our insights into its long temporal gestation provided by fossil archives and information written in surviving genomes. These data sources are worthy of conservation in their own right, but for the living biotic inventory we need to ask what it is we want to conserve. Is it 1) individual taxa for their intrinsic properties, 2) their services in functioning ecosystems, or 3) their capacity to generate future new biodiversity? If 2 or 3 are our goal then landscape conservation at scale is required, and not just seed banks or botanical/zoological gardens.

For this species, the major bottleneck for long-term survival has been recognized to be recruitment failure. In this study, we investigated the seed release strategy ofP. palinuri, by using field observations and laboratory experiments. We hypothesized that repetitive cycles of wet/dry conditions and external wax removal could be the environmental triggers of capsule dehiscence. Data showed that capsules treated with wet/dry cycles dehisced within 75 days, while none subjected to constant dry conditions dehisced. Once dehisced, capsules repetitively closed when made wet, and opened again upon drying. Seeds ofP. palinurican remain on plant up to 2 years, over which time capsules reclose when rained upon and reopen upon drying, highlighting the first reported occurrence of serotiny in aPrimulaspecies. Serotiny allowsP. palinurito face the dry season, by avoiding capsule dehiscence during the summer dry period and delaying seed release until the beginning of fall, when water availability in the soil is generally no longer a limiting factor.

We aim to understand the role of seed banks as potential buffers against climatic uncertainty determined by climate change. Methods We examined germination strategies of 18 common species present along an aridity gradient. Data were obtained from soil seed banks germinated during nine consecutive years from arid, semi-arid, Mediterranean and mesic Mediterranean ecosystems. At the semi-arid and Mediterranean sites, rainfall manipulations simulating 30% drought and 30% rainfall increase were applied. Germination strategies were tested under optimal irrigation conditions during three consecutive germination seasons to determine overall seed germinability in each soil sample. Changes in germination strategy were examined using a novel statistical approach that considers the climatic and biotic factors that may affect seed germinability. Important Findings The results showed that dominant species controlled their germination fractions by producing seeds with a different yearly germination fraction probability. The amount of rainfall under which the seeds were produced led to two major seed types with respect to germinability: high germinability, seeds leading to transient seed banks, and low germinability, seeds leading to persistent seed banks. We conclude that differential seed production among wet and dry years of both seed types creates a stable balance along the aridity gradient, enabling the soil seed bank to serve as a stabilizing mechanism buffering against rainfall unpredictability. Additionally, we present a general model of germination strategies of dominant annual species in Mediterranean and arid ecosystems that strengthens the notion of soil seed banks as buffers against climatic uncertainty induced by climate change in the region.

Methods In this study, Stipa breviflora, the dominant species in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, was used to analyse its reproductive individual characteristics and seed traits as well as the soil seed bank and spatial patterns under heavy- grazing and no- grazing treatments. Important Findings The results showed that the number of reproductive branches positively affected the number of vegetative branches. The analysis of the soil seed bank showed that the density of S. breviflora seeds beneath reproductive S. breviflora individuals was significantly higher than that in bare land. The seed density was also significantly negatively correlated with the seed characteristics and the soil seed bank in bare land. The spatial distribution of S. breviflora was aggregated under heavy grazing. Our results suggest that under heavy grazing, reproductive activity plays a key role in resource allocation. Stipa breviflora evolved the ecological strategy of nearby diffusion by regulating the morphological characteristics of the seeds, which promotes a positive spatial correlation between the juvenile and adult populations at a small scale, thus leading to the formation of 'safe islands'.					wenting, liu/0000-0003-2440-618X												1752-9921	1752-993X				AUG	2020	13	4					489	498		10.1093/jpe/rtaa036							WOS:000574426300013

The ex situ conservation of fifty-seven Sicilian common bean landraces was carried out at the "Living Plants Germplasm Bank" at Ucria (Messina, Italy), founded by the Nebrodi Regional Park, together with the "Sicilian Plant Germplasm Repository" of University of Palermo (SPGR/PA). To assess the germplasm genetic diversity, nineteen morphological traits and eight Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were used. Genetic distances among landraces were calculated to construct a clustering tree by using unweighted pair group method arithmetic (UPGMA). Seed germplasm diversity of Sicilian common bean varied from 80.7% to 93.3%, based on six seed descriptors and six leaf, flower, and pod descriptors, respectively, while cluster genetic analysis depicted a clear separation among all the 57 landraces. Principal coordinates (PCoA) and STRUCTURE analyses showed a prevalent rate of admixture between Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools in Sicilian common bean collection, confirming its heterogeneity. The observed high level of diversity evidenced the needs to adopt accurate criterion to plan a definitive ex situ germplasm collection to share agrobiodiversity with local farmers and to avoid any further loss of genetic resources in rural and protected areas.

Nonchemical annual bluegrass (Poa annua) management in zoysiagrass via fraise mowing	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Continued reliance on chemical methods for controlling annual bluegrass has resulted in many populations evolving resistance to PRE and POST herbicides, particularly in warm-season turfgrass species such as zoysiagrass. Soil seedbank management is critically important when managing herbicide-resistant weeds. Fraise mowing (also spelled fraze, frase, and fraize) is a new turfgrass cultivation practice designed to remove aboveground biomass while allowing turf to regrow vegetatively. We hypothesized that this process would remove annual bluegrass seed and therefore be a mechanical means of controlling annual bluegrass in turfgrass. Zoysiagrass field plots were fraise-mowed in June 2015 only, June 2016 only, June 2015 and June 2016, or left untreated. The fraise mower was configured to remove the uppermost 25 mm of plot surface (i.e., 15-mm verdure and 10-mm soil). Annual bluegrass infestation was quantified in April following fraise mowing via grid count. Soil cores (10.8 cm diameter) were extracted from each plot after grid count data were collected to assess effects of fraise mowing on the soil seedbank. Moreover, replicated subsamples (7.6 L) of debris generated during fraise mowing were collected to better understand weed seed content removed during the fraise mowing process. Fraise mowing in June offered a slight reduction (24%) in annual bluegrass cover the following April. Whereas 28% of the seed in fraise-mowing debris consisted of annual bluegrass, there was no difference in the quantity of annual bluegrass seed remaining in the soil seedbank among fraise-mowed and non-fraise-mowed plots. Although fraise mowing may help to temporarily reduce existing annual bluegrass infestations via mechanical removal, the frequency and depth we studied did not effectively reduce the seedbank. Fraise mowing is a useful tool for providing mechanical suppression of annual bluegrass but it is not a replacement for properly timed herbicide applications.

Evaluation of Preemergence and Postemergence Herbicide Programs on Weed Control and Weed Seed Suppression in Mississippi Peanut (Arachis hypogea)	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Weed control and reducing weed seed deposition to the soil seedbank is a challenging issues for Mississippi peanut producers. Research was established during 2017 and 2018 at the Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville, Mississippi, to evaluate herbicide programs for weed control and reducing weed seed production in Mississippi peanut production. Treatments were combinations of acetochlor, clethodim, flumioxazin, lactofen, paraquat, andS-metolachlor with their respective adjuvants if needed. Treatments were applied PRE, two to three weeks after emergence (EPOST), and/or four to five weeks after emergence (MPOST). All treatments included a PRE application followed by (fb) application of EPOST and/or MPOST application. Flumioxazin PRE fb lactofen plus clethodim MPOST provided greater than or equal to (>=) 88% control of barnyardgrass, hemp sesbania, Palmer amaranth, pitted morningglory, and prickly sida. Additionally, this treatment reduced total weed seed production 88% compared to the nontreated control. Flumioxazin PRE fb lactofen plus clethodim EPOST fb acetochlor MPOST provided similar weed control and peanut yield as flumioxazin PRE fb lactofen plus clethodim MPOST. This treatment reduced total weed seed production 93%. Treatments containing PRE, EPOST, and MPOST herbicide applications provided the best season-long control of weeds and weed seed suppression in Mississippi peanut.																		2073-4395				AUG	2020	10	8							1058	10.3390/agronomy10081058							WOS:000564640300001

Limited Effects of Long-Term Repeated Season and Interval of Prescribed Burning on Understory Vegetation Compositional Trajectories and Indicator Species in Ponderosa Pine Forests of Northeastern Oregon, USA	FORESTS												Fire exclusion has dramatically altered historically fire adapted forests across western North America. In response, forest managers reduce forest fuels with mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning to alter fire behavior, with additional objectives of restoring forest composition, structure, and ecosystem processes. There has been extensive research on the effects of fuel reduction and restoration treatments on trees, fuels, regeneration, and fire behavior; but less is known about how these treatments influence understory vegetation, which contains the majority of vascular plant diversity in many dry conifer forests. Of particular interest is how understory vegetation may respond to the season and interval of prescribed burning. The season and interval of prescribed burning is often determined by operational constraints rather than historical fire regimes, potentially resulting in fire conditions and burn intervals to which native plants are poorly adapted. In this study, we examined how understory vegetation has responded to season and interval of prescribed burning in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon, USA. Using over a decade (2002-2015) of understory vegetation data collected in stands with different intervals (5 versus 15 year) and seasons (spring versus fall) of prescribed burning, we quantified how season and interval of prescribed burning has influenced understory vegetation compositional trajectories and indicator species over time. Season of prescribed burning resulted in different understory communities and distinct trajectories of understory composition over time, but interval of burning did not. Indicator species analysis suggests fall burning is facilitating early seral species, with native annual forbs displaying ephemeral responses to frequent burning, while invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increased in abundance and frequency across all treatments over time. These findings indicate that understory vegetation in these ecosystems are sensitive to seasonality of burning, but the responses are subtle. Our findings suggest season and interval of prescribed burning used in this study do not result in large changes in understory vegetation community composition, a key consideration as land managers increase the pace and scale of prescribed fire in these forests.

Months or years of seed collection, conditioning, storage, and cultivation can be wasted if seeding operations are not carefully planned, well executed, and draw upon best available knowledge and experience. Although diverse restoration scenarios present different challenges and require different approaches, there are common elements that apply to most ecosystems and regions. A seeding plan sets the timeline and details all operations from site treatments through seed delivery and subsequent monitoring. The plan draws on site evaluation data (e.g. topography, hydrology, climate, soil types, weed pressure, reference site characteristics), the ecology and biology of the seed mix components (e.g. germination requirements, seed morphology) and seed quality information (e.g. seed purity, viability, and dormancy). Plan elements include: (1) Site treatments and seedbed preparation to remove undesirable vegetation, including sources in the soil seed bank; change hydrology and soil properties (e.g. stability, water holding capacity, nutrient status); and create favorable conditions for seed germination and establishment. (2) Seeding requirements to prepare seeds for sowing and determine appropriate seeding dates and rates. (3) Seed delivery techniques and equipment for precision seed delivery, including placement of seeds in germination-promotive microsites at the optimal season for germination and establishment. (4) A monitoring program and adaptive management to document initial emergence, seedling establishment, and plant community development and conduct additional sowing or adaptive management interventions, if warranted. (5) Communication of results to inform future seeding decisions and share knowledge for seed-based ecological restoration.

J	Guene-Nanchen, M; D'Amour, N; Rochefort, L				Guene-Nanchen, Melina; D'Amour, Noemie; Rochefort, Line			Adaptation of restoration target with climate change: the case of a coastal peatland	BOTANY												As a rise in sea level is expected with climate change, peat-extracted peatlands located in coastal zones are more vulnerable to saltwater intrusion. Seawater contamination may prevent revegetation of typical bog species (e.g., Sphagnum, ericaceous shrubs) generally intolerant to saline conditions. Spontaneous revegetation was studied in a 27-year post-extracted bog that has been contaminated with seawater in New Brunswick (Eastern Canada). This study aimed (i) to evaluate spontaneous plant regeneration on saline but still acidic, organic soil; and (ii) to relate the recolonized vegetation patterns to the main environmental conditions. Of the seven plant communities found in the sea-contaminated bog, none were typical of bogs, and Sphagnum mosses were poorly represented. Plants communities and chemical properties were rather representative of salt marsh ecosystems (Le., Carex paleacea, Sporobolus michawcianus, Empetrum nigrum, Myrica gale; neutral pH and nutrient-rich, namely P, Mg, and NH4+). Areas with low levels of spontaneous revegetation were associated with harsh chemical conditions (i.e., acid pH, high electrical conductivity, and nutrient-poor). Considering the aggravating factors that will persist with climate change, restoration of coastal bogs contaminated with seawater should aim to re-establish salt marsh ecosystems, given that spontaneous revegetation patterns and chemical conditions clearly do not allow the establishment of bog plant communities.																	1916-2790	1916-2804				AUG	2020	98	8					439	448		10.1139/cjb-2020-0050							WOS:000557348100003

Among the various conservation strategies, the Park developed a useful way to increase ex situ collections through a nursery chain and selling/giving indigenous species to the local people and community also for ornamental purposes. To date, more than 500 individuals of indigenous species are given every year.

Until mining activity ceases and restoration can take place, seed banking is one of the strategies to be considered for the conservation of these metallophytes of which 32 are strict endemics. In the tropics, however, many species have recalcitrant (desiccation-sensitive) seeds, making them unsuitable for longterm conservation. This study aimed at characterising the seed storage behaviour of 14 taxa of concern from metalliferous tropical grasslands in order to determine their storability in ex situ seed banks. Germination tests of 38 populations from 9 different sites were undertaken on fresh seeds and after 6, 12, 24 and 96 months in drycold conditions. The vast majority (93 %) of the sampled species exhibited high seed viability (> 75 %). For each taxon studied, there was no significant decline in seed viability during storage. In general, seeds germinated faster after 8 years of storage. This study provides evidence that seed desiccation-tolerance is common among the metallicolous species of Katanga. This highlights their ability to be stored under dry-cold conditions, which opens the way for ex situ conservation programs in seed banks.

J	Hitchcock, A; Williams, J; Cowell, C				Hitchcock, Anthony; Williams, Jenny; Cowell, Carly			Lessons learned as Erica turgida is returned	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Erica turgida, a small unassuming pink bushy heath species was listed as 'Extinct in the Wild' in 1996. It was last seen in habitat at Kenilworth Racecourse by South African botanist, Elsie Esterhuizen who made an herbarium collection and gave material for propagation to Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden. It once occurred in small patches on the lowlands around the city of Cape Town now commonly known as the Cape Flats. However, colonial agricultural settlements, and more recently industrial development and urban expansion, have led to the decline and ultimate loss of this species in the wild. Erica turgida has since then been kept from extinction by Kirstenbosch horticulturists and the Millennium Seed Bank Project. Fortuitously, a second collection was found in the collections of the Belvedere Palace Garden in Vienna and returned to South Africa in 2001. Its re-introduction to the remaining conserved natural areas of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, a Critically Endangered vegetation type, proved challenging as it is a relatively short-lived species and no definitive record exists of its preferred niche habitat. Early attempts to reintroduce Erica turgida at Kenilworth Racecourse Conservation Area and Rondevlei Nature Reserve failed however limited success has been achieved at Tokai which is under the management of the South African National Parks. This paper shows how over a period of 30 years this Erica species has been propagated from cuttings, planted in numerous micro habitats and monitored for survival and recruitment. General protocols for placement of plants and timing of restoration have also been developed and are explained in this paper. This work has contributed towards the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation targets 4, 5, 7, 8, 14 and 16 for the South African National Biodiversity Institute and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.																	1617-1381	1618-1093				AUG	2020	56								125858	10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125858							WOS:000556148300011

Horse grazing is already known to be effective in increasing plant diversity and maintaining herbaceous vegetation, creating different types of patches and thus ensuring spatial heterogeneity. On an artificial embankment at the Donzere-Mondragon hydroelectric facility in the Rhone Valley, extensive grazing by a rustic horse (Konik-Polski) was introduced several years ago to control shrub encroachment and to enhance plant grassland diversity. Vegetation monitoring surveys over a five-year period (2014-2018) showed that horse grazing maintained patches of open and short grasslands and increased species-richness, in particular of annual species, some of which have heritage value. In contrast, overly-low grazing pressure led to the dominance of an unpalatable perennial grass (Brachypodium phoenicoides) at the expense of the annual species that significantly enhance the forage value of the most heavily grazed patches. Horse grazing also had a positive impact on the permanent seed bank of the soil, increasing its heterogeneity and the density of viable seeds. Extensive horse grazing thus appears to be a relevant management tool to preserve the diversity and the forage quality of the most open and short grasslands. Nevertheless, grazing pressure here remained too low to allow restoration of grasslands already colonised by woody species. Combining different livestock species might be a better alternative to pure horse grazing, to increase heterogeneity and diversity. Our results are discussed in relation to extensive horse grazing on artificial ecosystems, such as the embankments bordering rivers and canals.

Secondary invasion and weedy native species dominance after clearing invasive alien plants in South Africa: Status quo and prognosis	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Clearing invasive alien plants often facilitates secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance instead of native biodiversity recovery. Secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance in turn can present significant barriers to restoration by hindering the recovery of key native species. The problem of secondary invasion and weedy native species dominance is ubiquitous and well appreciated globally, but poorly understood in the context of restoration ecology in South Africa. This study uses a two-pronged approach - a literature review plus an expert workshop - to evaluate the knowledge on secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance after clearing invasive alien plants in South Africa. Focus is placed on the definition, habits, biomes, target invaders, factors leading to, effects and management of secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance. Results suggest that secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance are often observed after clearing target invaders but is seldom reported, focused on, identified by name and/or correctly defined. The occurrence of secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance is not biome specific and is mediated by factors such as soil physico-chemical legacies of target invaders, availability of propagules in the soil seed bank and surrounding areas, and side effects of the technique used to clear target invaders. Ferns, grasses, herbs, sedges, shrubs, and trees can be secondary invaders and/or weedy native species. Few or no management interventions currently target secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance in South Africa. Given the paucity of knowledge on secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance in South Africa, there is clearly a need for more research. Practitioners should integrate the management of secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance with their overall invasive alien plant clearing efforts. Relevant steps should be taken to include mechanisms and incentives of dealing with secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance in the policy on invasive alien plants in South Africa.

In this study, new approaches were presented on how the understory plant functional group diversity and composition changed after land abandonment in Zagros oak forests (Quercus brantii Lindl.) in western Iran. In addition, the impact of land-use change on main soil properties were investigated. The diversity and nutrient status of the three stages of the secondary succession of abandoned agroforestry systems were compared: croplands after a short period of abandonment (similar to 5 years), croplands after a long period of abandonment (similar to 15 years) and oak forests representing the 'climax' stage. The plant species were classified in four functional groups (annual forb, annual grass, perennial forb, and perennial grass). The diversity indices were computed for each group and each stage. Results showed that the Shannon-Wiener diversity and Margalef richness of all functional groups significantly increased with time from the shortly abandoned croplands to the forest. Shortly after abandonment, annuals (especially annual forbs) were dominant whereas the abundance of the perennials increased after 15 years of abandonment and in the 'climax' forest. The soil content in lime decreased along the successional stages (from 52.7% to 26.4%) and was strongly negatively correlated with the diversity of the perennial forbs. In contrast, the soil total nitrogen and aggregate stability increased with succession (respectively from 0.04% to 0.19% and from 0.49 mm to 0.92 mm) and were strongly positively correlated with the diversity of this group. Recovery in soil fertility (and in particular, total nitrogen), provided suitable conditions for the establishment of a wide range of plant functional groups, which in turn increased the species diversity. The relatively fast recovery of soil fertility and plant diversity of abandoned agricultural lands indicated that the reestablishment of the forest vegetation could rely mostly on natural processes.

However, the relationship between plant traits and germination has been much less studied, despite that germination can be a key transition for plants. Building on evolutionary theory, we propose that variation in germination fraction across co-occurring desert annual plants may result from the interaction of post-germination plant traits, density dependence and microsite type. Our study system consisted of three summer annual species abundant in a desert in western Argentina, for which we quantified germination fractions in three microsite types: Larrea divaricata shrub, Bulnesia retama shrub, and open spaces among shrubs. Based on post-germination trait data (summarized by a principal component, PC1), the annual species can be arranged in terms of increasing stress-tolerance, from Amaranthus standleyanus, to Gomphrena martiana and Tribulus terrestris. We found an interaction between PC1 and density of conspecific seeds suggesting that the strength of plastic negative density-dependence decreased with the increase of plant stress-tolerance. Our results emphasize that both plastic and non-plastic (bet-hedging) mechanisms would contribute to shape germination dynamics across annual plants, and that plant traits can offer parsimonious explanations for such cross-species variation.

The role of seed water content for the perception of temperature signals that drive dormancy changes in Polygonum aviculare buried seeds	FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY												Seedling emergence in the field is strongly related to the dynamics of dormancy release and induction of the seed bank, which is mainly regulated by soil temperature. However, there is limited information on how temperature-driven effects on dormancy changes are modulated by the seed hydration-level. We investigated the effect of seed water content (SWC) on the dormancy release and dormancy induction inPolygonum aviculareL. seeds. We characterised quantitatively the interaction between seed water content (SWC) and temperature through the measurement of changes in the lower limit temperature for seed germination (T-l) during dormancy changes for seeds with different SWC. These relationships were inserted in existing population-based threshold models and were run against field obtained data. The model considering SWC was able to predictP. avicularefield emergence patterns. However, failure to consider SWC led to overestimations in the emergence size and timing. Our results show that in humid temperate habitats, the occurrence of eventual water shortages during late-winter or spring (i.e. short periods of water content below 31% SWC) can affect soil temperature effects on seed dormancy, and might lead reductions in the emergence size rather than to significant temporal displacements in the emergence window. In conclusion, SWC plays an important role for the perception of temperature signals that drive dormancy changes in buried seeds.

Rapid Response to a Tree Seed Conservation Challenge in Hawai'i Through Crowdsourcing, Citizen Science, and Community Engagement	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY												Forest ecosystems are vulnerable to disturbances, especially novel, invasive fungal pathogens, which can cause rapid destruction. In such a crisis, it is imperative to respond quickly, and seed banking is a critical strategy to preserve genetic diversity. In Hawai'i, forests have been recently threatened by Rapid 'Ohi'a Death (ROD), a novel fungal disease caused by Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia, which has killed over a million trees of endemic Metrosideros species. Through the #OhiaLove crowdfunding campaign, over US$50,000 was raised to immediately begin a seed collection and storage program in 2016. In the following years, the project was scaled up to the ROD Seed Banking Initiative, which added a component of training community members to participate in citizen science and contribute seed collections to the project. Collections from over 1100 trees have been stored, representing 6 islands, 13 taxa, and 46 seed zones, and the effort is ongoing. Several critical factors contributed to the success of this initiative, including innovation, timeliness, collaboration, science-based practices, transparency, and community engagement.

The genetic implications of temporal migration can be particularly relevant for semelparous organisms, which are those that reproduce only once in a lifetime after a certain period of growth. In this case, reproductive asynchrony in individuals of the same population generates demes of individuals differing in their developmental stage (non-reproductive and reproductive). These demes are connected by temporal migrants, that is, individuals that become annually asynchronous with respect to the rest of individuals of their same deme. Here, we investigated the extent of temporal migration and its effects on temporal genetic structure in the biennial plant Erysimum mediohispanicum. To this end, we conducted two independent complementary approaches. First, we empirically estimated temporal migration rates and temporal genetic structure in four populations of E. mediohispanicum during three consecutive years using nuclear microsatellites markers. Second, we developed a demographic genetic simulation model to assess genetic structure for different migration scenarios differing in temporal migration rates and their occurrence probabilities. We hypothesized that genetic structure decreased with increasing temporal migration rates due to the homogenizing effect of migration. Empirical and modelling results were consistent and indicated a U-shape relationship between genetic structure and temporal migration rates. Overall, they indicated the existence of temporal genetic structure and that such genetic structure indeed decreased with increasing temporal migration rates. However, genetic structure increased again at high temporal migration rates. The results shed light into the effects of reproductive asynchrony on important population genetic parameters. Our study contributes to unravel the complexity of some processes that may account for genetic diversity and genetic structure of natural populations.				Pico, Xavier/E-5697-2016; Munoz-Pajares, A.

J	Montefalcone, M; Morri, C; Bianchi, CN				Montefalcone, Monica; Morri, Carla; Bianchi, Carlo Nike			Influence of Local Pressures on Maldivian Coral Reef Resilience Following Repeated Bleaching Events, and Recovery Perspectives	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Two severe heat waves triggered coral bleaching and mass mortality in the Maldives in 1998 and 2016. Analysis of live coral cover data from 1997 to 2019 in shallow (5 m depth) reefs of the Maldives showed that the 1998 heat wave caused more than 90% of coral mortality leaving only 6.8 +/- 0.3% of survived corals in all the shallow reefs investigated. No significant difference in coral mortality was observed among atolls with different levels of human pressure. Maldivian reefs needed 16 years to recover to the pre-bleaching hard coral cover values. The 2016 heat wave affected all reefs investigated, but reefs in atolls with higher human pressure showed greater coral mortality than reefs in atolls with lower human pressure. Additionally, exposed (ocean) reefs showed lower coral mortality than those in sheltered (lagoon) reefs. The reduced coral mortality in 2016 as compared to 1998 may provide some support to the Adaptive Bleaching Hypothesis (ABH) in shallow Maldivian reefs, but intensity and duration of the two heat waves were different. Analysis of coral cover data collected along depth profiles on the ocean sides of atolls, from 10 to 50 m, allowed the comparison of coral mortality at different depths to discuss the Deep Refuge Hypothesis (DRH). In the upper mesophotic zone (i.e., between 30 and 50 m), coral mortality after bleaching was negligible. However, live coral cover did not exceed 15%, a value lower than coral survival in shallow reefs. Low cover values of corals surviving in the mesophotic reefs suggest that their role as refuge or seed banks for the future recovery of some species in shallow-water reefs of the Maldives may be small. The repeatedly high coral mortality after bleaching events and the long recovery period, especially in sites with human pressure, suggest that the foreseen increased frequency of bleaching events would jeopardize the future of Maldivian reefs, and ask for reducing local pressures to improve their resilience.																		2296-7745				JUL 24	2020	7								587	10.3389/fmars.2020.00587							WOS:000552792400001

Seed traits determine species' responses to fire under varying soil heating scenarios	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Many plant species in fire-prone environments maintain persistence through fire via soil seedbanks. However, seeds stored within the soil are at risk of mortality from elevated soil temperatures during fire. Seeds may be protected from fire-temperature impacts by burial, however, those buried too deeply may germinate but fail to emerge. Thus, successful post-fire seed regeneration is contingent upon a trade-off between burial depth and survival through fire. We examined the relationships between seedling emergence behaviour, seed survival and soil temperatures during fire in 13 native and four non-native woodland species in southwestern Australia. We assessed total seedling emergence per depth, maximum seedling emergence depth and seedling emergence speed from seeds planted at eight depths (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 cm). Soil temperatures were quantified using distributed temperature sensing in optic fibre (DTS), measured continuously between 1 and 10 cm in depth (temperatures were subsequently categorized into 1 cm increments for analysis) during five experimental fires in beds with fine fuels manipulated between 8 and 20 t/ha. Using seed survival and emergence success relative to soil temperatures, we determined vulnerability of seedling emergence relative to soil temperatures generated by combustion of fuel quantities typically observed in woodlands. Maximum depth of emergence varied between species from 2 to >10 cm, with a positive linear correlation to seed mass. Maximum soil temperatures from the two highest fuel masses exceeded seed lethal thresholds (T-50-representing temperatures lethal to 50% of seeds) of at least five species. Lethal temperatures were exceeded at all potential emergence depths for all three grass species, and all four non-native species studied. Of the remaining 10 species, temperatures did not exceed the lethal thresholds under any of the fuel mass levels tested. We found no relationship between lethal temperature thresholds and maximum emergence depth. Our data demonstrate that seeds exhibit variation in their response to soil heating and capacity to emerge from depth, with three distinct functional responses amongst our study species, which enable persistence through, and recruitment following, fire. Such variation in species attributes and fuel mass may lead to heterogeneity (within fires) or divergent trajectories (among fires) in community response under changed fire regime.

The identification of major environmental reservoirs for P. salmonis has long been ignored. Most microbial life occurs in biofilms, with possible implications in disease outbreaks as pathogen seed banks. Herein, we report on an in vitro analysis of biofilm formation by P. salmonis Psal-103 (LF-89-like genotype) and Psal-104 (EM-90-like genotype), the aim of which was to gain new insights into the ecological role of biofilms using multiple approaches. The cytotoxic response of the salmon head kidney cell line to P. salmonis showed interisolate differences, depending on the source of the bacterial inoculum (biofilm or planktonic). Biofilm formation showed a variable-length lag-phase, which was associated with wider fluctuations in biofilm viability. Interisolate differences in the lag phase emerged regardless of the nutritional content of the medium, but both isolates formed mature biofilms from 288 h onwards. Psal-103 biofilms were sensitive to Atlantic salmon skin mucus during early formation, whereas Psal-104 biofilms were more tolerant. The ability of P. salmonis to form viable and mucus-tolerant biofilms on plastic surfaces in seawater represents a potentially important environmental risk for the persistence and dissemination of piscirickettsiosis.

We tested the effect of three historical variables on current forest plant communities and traits: forest temporal continuity (ancient: forested before 1860, recent: reforested after 1860, and very recent forest: reforested after 1958) and type of land use in 1860 and 1958 (forest, pasture or arable land). Location The Regional Natural Park of Luberon (southeastern France). Methods We used a comprehensive vegetation plot database (473 species in 1,429 plots). Species' response to historical variables was tested with logistic regressions, and the relationship between plant traits and historical variables was analysed with RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Results Among all studied species, 250 responded to forest temporal continuity, 208 to 1860 land use, and 246 to 1958 land use. Species associated with ancient forests were more frequently forest specialists or forest edge species, shade-tolerant and perennials, while species associated with recent and very recent forests were more frequently annuals, anemochorous and heliophilous species. Species exhibited different traits and ecological preferences according to the type of land use prior to forest: therophytes were more frequent on former arable land while chamaephytes were more frequent on former pasture. Trait responses to 1860 and 1958 land uses were globally consistent. Conclusions The effect of forest temporal continuity and past land use on forest understorey communities was consistent with other studies in northern Europe or northern America, which suggests that the same ecological processes apply in temperate lowland and Mediterranean regions. This study highlights a succession of plant communities in the long term and different trajectories of succession according to the type of former agricultural use. The long-term legacies of past land use in current forest plant communities highlight the importance to preserve ancient forests, where typical forest species can be maintained.

J	An, H; Zhao, YP; Ma, MJ				An, Hang; Zhao, Yunpeng; Ma, Miaojun			Precipitation controls seed bank size and its role in alpine meadow community regeneration with increasing altitude	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The Tibetan Plateau has undergone significant climate warming in recent decades, and precipitation has also become increasingly variable. Much research has explored the effects of climate change on vegetation on this plateau. As potential vegetation buried in the soil, the soil seed bank is an important resource for ecosystem restoration and resilience. However, almost no studies have explored the effects of climate change on seed banks and the mechanisms of these effects. We used an altitudinal gradient to represent a decrease in temperature and collected soil seed bank samples from 27 alpine meadows (3,158-4,002 m) along this gradient. A structural equation model was used to explore the direct effects of mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) on the soil seed bank and their indirect effects through aboveground vegetation and soil environmental factors. The species richness and abundance of the aboveground vegetation varied little along the altitudinal gradient, while the species richness and density of the seed bank decreased. The similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation decreased with altitude; specifically, it decreased with MAP but was not related to MAT. The increase in MAP with increasing altitude directly decreased the species richness and density of the seed bank, while the increase in MAP and decrease in MAT with increasing altitude indirectly increased and decreased the species richness of the seed bank, respectively, by directly increasing and decreasing the species richness of the plant community. The size of the soil seed bank declined with increasing altitude. Increases in precipitation directly decreased the species richness and density and indirectly decreased the species richness of the seed bank with increasing elevation. The role of the seed bank in aboveground plant community regeneration decreases with increasing altitude, and this process is controlled by precipitation but not temperature.

Effects of Fire Frequency on Seed Sources and Regeneration in Southeastern Amazonia	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE												The trajectory and recovery time of fire-disturbed forests depend on the capacity of seedlings and resprouts to get established over time. Here, we investigated the mechanisms associated with fire effects on post-fire regeneration in the context of a large-scale fire experiment located in southeastern Amazonia. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that recurrent understory fires reduce forest regeneration capacity by reducing the recruitment of seedlings, the viability of the soil seed bank, the seed rain, and the resprouts. The experiment was comprised of three 50-ha plots: an unburned control, and two plots that were experimentally burned three (triennially) or six (annually) times between 2004 and 2010. Seedlings represented 2.4 and 0.6% of the seed rain and soil seed bank in the Control and burned treatment plots, respectively. Compared to the control, the triennial burns caused more reduction than the annual ones in seed rain (-42 vs. -10%) and seed bank (-78 vs. -50%). These fire-related reduction in seed rain in both treatments explain most of the low post-fire density of seedlings (0.4 and 0.8 ind/m(2), respectively), compared with the Control (2.9 ind/m(2)). The 3-year interval between fires contributed to highest mortality of seeds stored in the soil than in the annual burn treatment, where fires were less severe. However, there were 5.5 times more resprouting in the plot burned triennially compared with the one burned annually. In both treatments, though, the number of resprouts declined over time. In conclusion, seeds from both seed rain and seed bank and resprouting were negatively affected by both fire frequencies, reducing the likelihood of native species recovery by altering the regeneration pathways. This situation is expected to be increasingly common in southeastern Amazon forests, particularly under warmer and dryer climate conditions.

Being able to build up a dormant seed bank in sediments is a key strategy that some species employ to regenerate from large-scale degradation. Much of the research on seed banks has focussed on temperate species, and little is known regarding the status of seed banks in tropical meadows. In the present study, we examined the seed bank status of three common seagrass species at six sites in Singapore and attempted to identify potential drivers of seed abundance. Our results indicated depauperate seed banks with few species setting viable seed and low seed densities.Halophila ovalisseeds were found at four sites andHalodule uninervisseeds at two sites, butCymodocea rotundataseeds were absent from all six sites. WhereasH. ovalisseed viability ranged from 20% to 68.8%, none of theH. uninervisseeds was viable.Halophila ovalisseed densities (33-334 m(-2)) were much higher than those ofH. uninervis(9-21 m(-2)). Of the variables examined, onlyH. ovaliscover was positively correlated with the number of seeds. Our study has highlighted the vulnerability of seagrass meadows in Singapore's urban waters to future disturbances.

The vegetation organization in these ecosystems is driven by the water regime as the main driver, but local processes like seed banks and soil resources redistribution also play a crucial role in determining the spatial distribution of the vegetation. Assessment of vegetation dynamics and long-term resilience requires the use of realistic models that can integrate the water regime and that can continuously simulate vegetation extent and conditions under flood-drought cycles. Here we study the influence of the water regime as the main driver of the vegetation. We apply a vegetation-modelling framework to compare the performance of a simplified model at the cell scale and a model integrated at a patch scale. Our results show that aggregating the analysis of vegetation dynamics at the patch scale allows for the incorporation of the effects of both local drivers (acting within the patch) as well as the global drivers (acting over the patch as a whole). The water regime acts as a global driver for the vegetation and indirectly affects the local drivers. Our patch scale model successfully captures wetland vegetation dynamics using the water regime as the main driver for representing changes in the vegetation and assessment of the wetland resilience under flood-drought periods.

Silviculture and fire effects on understorey flowering in jarrah forest	AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY												Long-term forest monitoring undertaken by Forestchecksince 2001 has examined the effects of silvicultural treatment on floral diversity and assemblage composition in the jarrah forest of southwest Western Australia. Both prescribed burns and wildfires have overlain the network of Forestcheckmonitoring sites, providing the opportunity to examine fire and silviculture interactions in natural experiments and allowing experimental control of time-since-fire effects on the flora. We report here two opportunistic experiments. First, the early effects of prescribed burns in spring on the flowering of the vascular flora were compared with closely paired sites that were long unburnt. Second, the early effects of a wildfire in summer on the flowering of the vascular flora were compared between silvicultural treatments. Flowering richness tended to be less on burnt grids in the non-peak period in the first two years after fire in one experiment, but there were no differential effects of silviculture on flowering assemblages arising from interaction with wildfires. Flowering assemblages varied from year to year and the extent to which they varied differed between locations but not as a result of silvicultural treatments. We conclude that no special management with respect to plant flowering is required to remedy outcomes of interaction between wildfire and silvicultural treatments. Further information is needed to understand the long-term implications of variability in flowering assemblages and how it affects the reproductive viability of understorey species and their interactions with pollinator networks in the face of a changing climate.

It is predicted that light can select species with the same light requirements, resulting in a decrease in species compositional dissimilarity among grass communities experiencing the same light intensity, and an increase in community dissimilarity under variable light intensities. However, these predictions have been questioned recently in light of modern coexistence theories, and evidence for them in natural communities is often indistinguishable from patterns created by dispersal limitation and biotic interactions. To help fill this gap, we sampled 48 understory grass communities that had regenerated from the same soil seed bank in Southern China. Plots were established under a light intensity gradient. Changes in species composition and neighborhood densities were monitored over a growing season. Our experimental setup controls for bias from dispersal limitation and is useful for detecting the effects of biotic interactions at different intensities of light. As expected, (1) compositional dissimilarity of grass communities increased between communities with different light intensities. The extent to which communities became more dissimilar was positively correlated with the difference in the light intensity. (2) No significant change in compositional dissimilarity was observed among communities experiencing the same light intensity. (3) Finally, relative neighborhood density significantly decreased in communities with moderate to high shading treatments. Our results clearly show that light can drive compositional divergence among communities under different light densities. However, the light may not lead to convergence among communities experiencing the same low light intensity, because intense competition induced by low light might enlarge species compositional differences, as shown with the neighborhood density analysis. Therefore, our study provides more convincing evidence for the importance of light on understory grass communities in subtropical forests and highlights the need to jointly consider biotic interactions when testing for evidence for environmental filtering.																	1664-462X					JUL 10	2020	11								1051	10.3389/fpls.2020.01051							WOS:000555883800001	32754188

Lessons learnt: crop-seed cleaning reduces weed-seed contamination in Western Australian grain samples	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Weeds are a major contributing factor to crop yield loss. Weed control is regularly practiced during the growing season, with many growers making a conscious effort to minimise weed-seed return to the soil seedbank during the cropping program. However, growers may be unintentionally introducing weed seeds through sowing of contaminated crop seed. Using samples of crop seed obtained from 29 growers across two Western Australian grain-growing regions, 81 samples were hand-cleaned to determine weed-seed contamination levels. Of those samples, 41% were weed-free, and in the remaining 59%, the main contaminant was Lolium rigidum (annual ryegrass), occurring in 49% of contaminated samples. Crop type and cleaning method had significant effects on the level of weed-seed contamination, with barley having higher levels of contamination than other crops, and professional contractors providing lower contamination than other methods of cleaning. However, any seed-cleaning method provided significantly cleaner grain samples than no seed cleaning. This study established that crop-seed contamination was evident on Western Australian farms and that growers may be unintentionally sowing weed seeds with their crops. Seed cleaning combined with judicious paddock selection and weed-seed removal during the growing season can lead to weed-free crop seed.					powles, stephen/0000-0001-6375-1977												1836-0947	1836-5795					2020	71	7					660	667		10.1071/CP20093		JUL 2020					WOS:000547146700001

Influence of flooding period and seed burial depth on Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) seed germination	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND Flooding throughout fall and winter months is an effective practice for rice (Oryza sativaL.) straw decomposition, soil seedbank depletion, and waterfowl habitat in Mississippi. Nevertheless, limited research is available regarding the effects of fall-winter flooding and seed burial depth on Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeriS. Wats.) seed germination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of flooding period and seed burial depth onA. palmeriseed damage and germination in three different soil textures in Mississippi. RESULTS Amaranthus palmeriseed damage was greater when seeds were buried in sandy loam compared to silt loam soil textures. An interaction between flooding period and seed burial depth was present forA. palmeriseed germination. Flooding periods of 1-month (at 0 and 15 cm burial depth) and 2 months (at 0 cm burial depth) provided similarA. palmeriseed germination compared to no-flooding (at 0 cm burial depth). In addition, flooding periods of 3, 4, and 5 months reducedA. palmeriseed germination by 10, 10 and 14 percentage points at 0 cm burial depth, and 36, 40, and 41 percentage points when seeds were buried at 15 cm, respectively, across all soil textures. CONCLUSION This research demonstrates that flooding for 3, 4, and 5-months throughout fall and winter is an effective cultural practice to increase soil seedbank depletion through reduced germination potential to help manage herbicide-resistantA. palmeripopulations in sandy loam, silt, and silt loam soil textures.

This study investigated the effects of plant residue application (zero: NR, low: LR, medium: MR and high: HR) and hand weeding (twice: TWI, thrice: THR, four times: FOU and clean weeding: CLE) under two tillage systems (basin planting: BASIN, and conventional tillage: CT) on weed seed density in a clay loam soil at Chinhoyi University of Technology experimental farm, Zimbabwe. During 2014/15, the number of germinableAmaranthus hybridusL. seeds was higher in BASIN+NR+THR and BASIN+MR+TWI than other treatments. Germinable propagules ofCyperusL. spp. were fewer in NR+FOU and NR+CLE than NR+TWI and NR+THR plots. In 2015/16, TWI resulted in an increase of 52.3-79.5% of the number of germinableA. hybridusseeds compared to THR, FOU and CLE. Germinable weed seeds increased by 67.1% forAlternanthera pungensKunth and 164.8% forGalinsoga parvifloraCav. in the surface compared to the subsurface layers of BASIN but were evenly distributed in CT. The results suggest that cultural practices exert selection pressure on individual weed species which may change the weed species composition in the soil seed bank.

We questioned how the mound-building ant,Camponotus herculeanus, affects the above-ground vegetation, the soil seed bank and physico-chemical properties of the soil. Location An alpine meadow in the northeast margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (37 degrees 40 ' N, 102 degrees 32 ' E), China. Methods We used field and greenhouse studies to determine the above-ground vegetation parameters and soil physico-chemical properties, and the soil seed bank composition under the mound (UM), the herbage circle at about 10 cm width around the outside of the mound (mound edge, ME) and the area 1 m from the center of the mound (control). Results (a) The mound edge had higher vegetation height, greater above-ground biomass, lower vegetation coverage and lower plant richness than controls; (b) Gramineae had a higher total importance value, which was based on the height, coverage and biomass of each plant species, and composed a higher biomass proportion in the mound edge than in controls (68% vs. 38%), while most of the perennial dicotyledons were restricted to the controls; (c) dicotyledons were the main seed group in the 0-8 cm layer of soil(UM)(43%), soil(ME)(51%) and soil(control)(60%), while Gramineae had a significantly higher seed density and percentage of total seeds in the soil(UM)(16,507 +/- 2,882.7 seeds/m(3), 28.1%) than in the soil(control)(4,200 +/- 799.5 seeds/m(3), 10.2%); and (d) soil in the 0-8 cm layer under the mound had lower water content and lower bulk density than soil on the mound edge and in controls. Conclusions Mound-building activity ofCamponotus herculeanusincreased the proportion of Gramineae and decreased the proportion of dicotyledons at the site of the study indicating, that mound building could enhance the transformation of a grass and sedges community to mainly a grass community in the alpine meadow.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				SEP	2020	31	5					867	876		10.1111/jvs.12907		JUL 2020					WOS:000546406300001						
J	Erfanzadeh, R; Daneshgar, M; Ghelichnia, H				Erfanzadeh, Reza; Daneshgar, Maryam; Ghelichnia, Hassan			Improvement of the seedling emergence method in soil seed bank studies using chemical treatments	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The seedling emergence method (SEM) is the most frequently used method for studying the soil seed bank. The main problem with this method is that it cannot provide a complete assessment of the seed flora present in the soil because its results are influenced by seed dormancy. In order to break seed dormancy of the soil seed bank, SEM can be combined with some chemical treatments. The objectives of this study were to determine the best chemical treatment which is able to overcome seed dormancy, and to study the effects of different chemical treatments on soil seedling emergence of different plant functional groups. Therefore, twenty soil samples were collected in the early spring in subalpine rangelands in northern Iran. Each soil sample was divided into four equal subsamples, and each subsample was treated by one of the dormancy-breaking treatments including gibberellic acid (GA(3)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium nitrate (KNO3) and distilled water as control. The emergent species from the soil samples were categorized into functional groups, i.e., annual forbs, perennial forbs and perennial grasses. The results showed that the highest total seedling emergence was observed in the soil samples treated with GA(3)(5465 seedlings/m(2)), whereas the lowest seedling emergence was found in the soil samples by KNO(3)application (586 seedlings/m(2)). The perennial forbs were the only functional group that responded to all chemical treatments. We concluded that the use of GA(3)for breaking seed dormancy can be useful for providing a more reliable estimation of the soil seed bank characteristics.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				JUL	2020	21	2					183	190		10.1007/s42974-020-00020-9		JUL 2020					WOS:000545302400001

The role of soil temperature and seed dormancy in the creation and maintenance of persistent seed banks ofNassella trichotoma(serrated tussock) on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales	RANGELAND JOURNAL												A large and persistent soil seed bank characterises many important grass weeds, includingNassella trichotoma(Nees) Hack. ex Arechav. (serrated tussock), a major weed in Australia and other countries. In the present study we examined the effects of constant and alternating temperatures in regulating primary and secondary dormancy and the creation and maintenance of its soil seed bank in northern NSW, Australia. One-month-old seeds were stored at 4, 25 degrees C, 40/10 degrees C and 40 degrees C, in a laboratory, and germination tests were conducted every two weeks. Few seeds germinated following storage at 4 degrees C, compared with seeds stored at 25 degrees C, 40/10 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Nylon bags containing freshly harvested seeds were buried amongN. trichotomastands in early summer, and germination tests conducted following exhumation after each season over the next 12 months. Seeds buried over summer and summer plus autumn had higher germination than seeds buried over summer plus autumn plus winter, but germination increased again in the subsequent spring. Seeds stored for zero, three, six and 12 months at laboratory temperatures were placed on a thermogradient plate with 81 temperature combinations, followed by incubation at constant 25 degrees C of un-germinated seeds. Constant high or low temperatures prolonged primary dormancy or induced secondary dormancy whereas alternating temperatures tended to break dormancy. Few temperature combinations resulted in more than 80% germination.

Influence of stand age, soil attributes, and cover type on Rubus (Rosaceae) seed bank abundance	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												We assessed Rubus seed bank abundance and variability in 39 stands located throughout northern Pennsylvania as part of a replicated chronosequence of age classes. Seed abundance declined precipitously after stand age 60 in the Allegheny hardwoods or after stand age 50 in the northern hardwood and oak forests. Variability among sites increased with stand age, resulting in less predictability of Rubus seed abundance. Rubus seed banks were more than twice as abundant in Allegheny and northern hardwoods as in mixed oaks. Rubus seed bank abundance decreased as percent clay in the soil increased. Given that Rubus seed bank abundance declines with age and seed abundance becomes more variable, we suggest that there will be less Rubus immediately following the stand-replacing disturbances in older stands, potentially changing plant competition dynamics and wildlife food sources.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL-SEP	2020	147	3					222	231		10.3159/TORREY-D-17-00015.1							WOS:000599331300002

In this study, the annual behaviour of the BAI was analyzed in the tropical dry forest region of the Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica among 1997 to 2019 according to the frequency of fires. Our results show that the areas frequently burned by forest fires display a differentiated behaviour in the BAI throughout the years. Where, the greater the frequency of forest fires is, the higher the BAI values. On the other hand, areas that have not been affected or have been affected by a single fire showed low BAI values. These results could validate the hypothesis that after two to three fires, the forest seed bank is destroyed. Consequently, the composition and structure of tropical dry forests change considerably after the occurrence of many fires.

Biological information was lacking for Euphorbia telephioides, a threatened species endemic to pine flatwoods in the Florida Panhandle. Decline of this species is due largely to habitat loss and degradation. To understand the conservation requirements for the recovery of E. telephioides, we established three permanent plots, marked 150 plants, and investigated size and reproduction, response to fire, and in situ seed germination and seedling survival from 2010 to 2014. Plants are long-lived and survived fire by resprouting. Populations are composed of vegetatives, males, females, and monoecious individuals with labile sex expression, including fire-induced sex change. Both adults and seedlings exhibited obligate winter dormancy and facultative non-synchronized summer dormancy, and some adults had prolonged (>1 y) vegetative dormancy, which minimize exposure to stressful conditions. Reproductive plants tended to be larger than vegetatives, but did not differ significantly in most size parameters. Seeds possess a deep physiological dormancy, tolerate fire, and persist in the field less than 1 y; thus, soil seed bank is unlikely to maintain populations in the face of environmental stochasticity. Once established, seedlings resprout after fire, which likely contributes to population persistence. Overall, E. telephioides displays life history traits that are adaptive in the fire-prone habitats where this species occurs. For specific management recommendations in the field, knowledge of gender expression and lability, seed ecology, and the effects of disturbances such as fire on plants and habitat are imperative.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JUL	2020	40	3					262	272		10.3375/043.040.0323							WOS:000575913400008

One way to contribute to the preservation of this family is to understand the processes that promote seed germination. Questions: How common is dormancy and seed banks in Cactaceae? Are there general patterns in cacti germination response to temperature, light, water, salinity, phytohormones, hydration/dehydration cycles, mechanical or chemical scarification? Data description: A total of 333 studies on cactus germination with information on 409 taxa. Study site and dates: since 1939 to January 2020. Methods: A search of scientific articles in Google Scholar was performed with the words Cactaceae, cacti and cactus, in combination with various matters on germination in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Results: The main germination studies in cactus deal with photoblasticism (275 taxa), temperature (205 taxa) and seed longevity (142 taxa). Other lines of study in cactus germination (e.g., desiccation tolerance, vivipary, phytohormones, mechanical or chemical scarification, in vitro germination, hydration/dehydration cycles, water and saline stress, serotiny, storage in cold, high temperature tolerance and soil seed bank) include between 14 and 65 taxa. Cacti have only physiological dormancy and optimal germination for most species occur between 20 and 30 degrees C. Conclusions: Mexico, Brazil and Argentina are the three leading countries in the study of cactus germination.

Questions and / or Hypotheses: Which abiotic factors determine the germination of new individuals of different functional groups? how this information can contribute in the planning of conservation and restoration programs?Which environmental factors determine germination and the recruiting of individuals? And how this knowledge could be considered in conservation programs? Studied species / data description: This research was carried out in 30 plots established in the forest (North and South slopes) during both year seasons. Study site and dates: Temperate forest of Quercus rugosa (L.) in the Magdalena river Basin, Mexico City. Methods: Through a TWINSPAN classification nine functional groups were determined in the seed bank and the standing vegetation. Through a Multiple Response Permutation Analysis (MRPP) and a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) the environmental effect was determined, seasonally and spatially on the abundance and richness of the functional groups. Results: A high similarity inside each functional group and a high dissimilarity between them were found. The Multivariate Permutation Variance Analysis (PERMANOVA) showed a significant effect of the season and of the slope orientation on the identification of the functional groups. Conclusions: In terms of conservation the presence of characteristic and native species implies a high resilience, however the presence of introduced species indicates changes in the system composition, which jeopardizes the natural regeneration potential.

Bieb.) Asch. et Graebn. Seed Dormancy Tested in Soil Conditions	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Medicago truncatula(barrel medic) andPisum sativumsubsp.elatius(wild pea) accessions originating from variable environmental conditions in the Mediterranean basin were used to study physical seed dormancy (PY) release. The effect of soil burial on PY release was tested on 112 accessions of medic and 46 accessions of pea over the period of 3 months in situ at three common gardens (Hungary, Spain and Greece) from 2017 through 2019. PY release after soil exhumation followed by experimental laboratory germination of remaining dormant seeds (wet, 25 degrees C, 21 days) were related to the environmental conditions of the common garden and macroclimatic variables of the site of origin of the accessions. Higher PY release was observed in buried seeds under humid rather than under dry and hot environments. Exposure of remaining dormant seeds to experimental laboratory conditions increased total PY release up to 70% and 80% in barrel medic and wild pea, respectively. Wild pea showed higher phenotypic plasticity on PY release than barrel medic, which had higher bet-hedging within-season. Wild pea showed lower bet-hedging among-season (PY < 10%) in relation to precipitation than barrel medic, which was more conservative (PY approximate to 20%). Observed variability suggests that these species have the capability to cope with ongoing climate change.

Seasonality drives herbaceous community beta diversity in lithologically different rocky outcrops in Brazil	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Seasonality exerts strong controlling forces on species diversity in herbaceous species communities, however, this control process remains poorly understood in tropical lithologically different rocky outcrops. We aim to investigate the effect of seasonality and the variability of soil properties on changes in the herbaceous species richness and species composition of two different herbaceous species communities on rocky outcrops in Brazil. We hypothesize that seasonality, determined by variation in precipitation. and soil fertility, determined by variability in nutrient-related soil properties, drives species diversity (i.e., richness and beta diversity) patterns of herbaceous communities at local scale. Methods - To investigate how the variation between diy and wet seasons affects species richness and beta diversity, we studied plots on rocky outcrops of Iron Quadrangle (40 plots, 1 x 1 m) and Carajas (20 plots, 1 x 1 m). Key results - We observed similar richness patterns between seasons, without significant differences between sites, using rarefaction and extrapolation curves. However, we observed significant differences in beta diversity between seasons. Our results indicate that seasonality determines the temporal variation of the herbaceous species composition, but not species richness. Likewise, our tested models indicated that seasonality shape beta diversity in the studied rocky outcrops. Conclusions - The predictable seasonal precipitation is closely related to the community composition on this type of rocky outcrop formation, where there typically is a marked seasonal water deficit pattern. with increased deficit during the dry season. We presume that seasonality is an important driver in determining plant community assembly at local scale on the studied rocky outcrops.

Seeds of Success: A conservation and restoration investment in the future ofUSlands	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE												Seeds of Success (SOS) is a national seed collection program led by the Bureau of Land Management. SOS represents the most comprehensive native seed repository in the United States, supporting native plant restoration, management, and research. Since inception in 2000, SOS has collected seeds from over 24,400 native plant populations from ~5,600 taxa from 43 states. Collections include species important to wildlife, pollinators, and indigenous people, and over 10,000 collections have been shared for restoration and research use. We asked how many SOS sites have burned since collection, and identified 662 fires at 631 sites. If fire continues at the pace observed since 2011, an estimated 14% of collection sites will burn by 2050 and over 24% by 2080, putting genetic diversity at risk in areas where fire is linked with invasion. Analysis of 14 native forb species from the western United States found that many collections were from the warmest and driest portions of their range, areas at the highest risk of wildfire, subsequent invasion, and local extinction. SOS provides an opportunity to understand change in natural populations, and represents a critical repository of native plant genetic resources for conservation and future use.																		2578-4854				JUL	2020	2	7							UNSP e209	10.1111/csp2.209							WOS:000546955300011

Integrating cover crops for weed management in the semiarid US Great Plains: opportunities and challenges	WEED SCIENCE												The widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in weed populations has become an increasing concern for no-tillage (NT) growers in semiarid regions of the U.S. Great Plains. Lack of cost-effective and alternative new herbicide sites of action further exacerbates the problem of herbicide-resistant (HR) weeds and threatens the long-term sustainability of prevailing cropping systems in the region. A recent decline in commodity prices and increasing herbicide costs to manage HR weeds has spurred research efforts to build a strong rationale for developing ecologically based integrated weed management (IWM) strategies in the U.S. Great Plains. Integration of cover crops (CCs) in NT dryland production systems potentially offers several ecosystem services, including weed control, soil health improvement, decline in selective pest pressure, and overall reduction in pest management inputs. This review article aims to document the role of CCs for IWM, with emphasis on exploring emerging weed issues; ecological, economic, and agronomic benefits of growing CCs; and constraints preventing adoption of CCs in NT cropping systems in the semiarid Great Plains. We attempt to focus on changes in weed management practices, their long-term impacts on weed seedbanks, weed shifts, and herbicide-resistance evolution in the most common weed species in the region. We also highlight current knowledge gaps and propose new research priorities based on an improved understanding of CC management strategies that will ultimately aid in achieving sustainable weed management goals and preserving natural resources in water-limited environments.

Perennial plant patches are sinks for seeds in semi-arid woodlands in varying condition	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Understanding the processes that influence resilience in semi-arid woodland communities is of critical importance in landscapes where livestock grazing is the dominant land use and an important driver of site condition. Seed banks are a critical component of site resilience as their persistence can be crucial for recovering from disturbances. We predicted that site condition and landscape structural elements (perennial plant patches) would strongly influence the richness and density of the soil seed bank. Location New South Wales, Australia. Methods We conducted a seedling emergence study to investigate the germinable seed bank in semi-arid woodland. Soil samples were collected from three woodland communities (Cypress pine, Black box, Red gum) from sites in three levels of site condition (poor, average, good) and from four patch types (tree, shrub, grass, open). Seed bank species were assigned to three plant trait groups based on: (a) origin; (b) lifespan; and (c) palatability. We used linear models to assess the effects of community, site condition and patch type on the richness and seed density of the germinable seed bank. Results Site condition did not affect the seed bank density or richness, except for a lower density of highly palatable species at poor-condition sites. Across all communities the importance of patch type on the soil seed bank density and richness varied with plant traits. The seed bank of perennial plant patches had a greater density of perennial species, a lower density of low palatability plants, and a greater richness of native and perennial species than interspaces. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the germinable soil seed bank in semi-arid woodlands can be relatively resilient to degradation. This suggests that disturbed sites where perennial patches remain, may still have the ability to recover, because these patches act as important seed reservoirs.

However, rangeland quality and quantity are rapidly deteriorating due to a number of natural and human-induced factors, one of which is bush encroachment. Little is known on how bush encroachment affects the ecosystem functions and services expressed in terms of the native vegetation composition and structure, status of the soil seed bank, soil chemical and physical properties, and the abundance of mycorrhiza spores. Methods We assessed woody species in 64 plots distributed across four levels ofProsopis juliflorainvasion (high, medium, low, and none) at two sites, Amibara and Gewane, in the Afar Region, Ethiopia. We collected composite soil samples to investigate the soil seed bank, mycorrhizal associations, and spore abundance. Results Plant biodiversity was generally low, with eight and four woody species in Gewane and Amibara, respectively.Prosopis juliflorawas dominant in highly, moderately, and lowly invaded areas while Acacia senegal dominated the non-invaded areas. The average number ofP. julifloraindividuals ranged from 3/ha at non-invaded areas in Gewane to 4200/ha at highly invaded areas in Amibara while the total individual number of native woody species ranged from 0 to 88/ha at highly and lowly invaded areas, respectively. The population structure of trees/shrubs in all invasion areas showed an inverted J-shaped distribution, characterized by a high abundance of small individuals.Prosopis juliflorainvasion was associated with high soil OC, Na, Ca, P, bulk density, and moisture content. Herbaceous seed numbers and species richness were highest in the moderately and highly invaded areas. All sampled tree species were associated with mycorrhiza but the percentage of root length colonization by different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus structures varied significantly (p< 0.05) across invasion categories and sites. Conclusions Our results revealed that althoughP. juliflorainvasion negatively impacted the availability of native woody livestock forage species, it had a positive effect on most soil physical and chemical properties. Such variable effects call out for sustainable management practices when invaded areas are restored.

The role of shrubs in spatially structuring the soil seed bank of perennial species in a semi-arid gypsum plant community	PLANT ECOLOGY												The soil seed bank is crucial for the stability and regeneration of the specialised gypsum plant communities. The presence of shrubs influences the spatial structure of the soil seed bank by trapping more or fewer seeds depending on their physiognomic attributes or, for example, by providing seeds through the plants established under canopies. We aimed to unravel the potential role of different shrub species with diverse physiognomy in determining the spatial structure of the soil seed bank in a semi-arid gypsum plant community of NE Spain. We examined richness and abundance of the soil seed bank at different microsites associated with four dominant shrubs of different size-type (tall or short), and architecture (crawling-branched or erect). We found more considerable richness and abundance of seeds of perennial species within shrub canopies than in open areas. Specifically, the crawling-branched shrubsGypsophila struthiumandHelianthemum squamatum, and the tall erect shrubOnonis tridentataaccumulated the most abundant soil seed banks of perennials, thus having an important structuring role. Conservation and restoration efforts should focus on gypsophyte shrubs (G. struthium, O. tridentataandH. squamatum), which can enhance community stability and regeneration through the formation of an abundant soil seed bank of perennial species in gypsum plant communities.

The comprehensive dataset used spans over 45 years of worldwide conservation effort across various organisations. The data provides evidence-based results and future directions for the represented globally threatened flora that are of relevance to all plant conservation and seed banking organisations across the globe. The reviewed sample includes 523 collections and represents a wide geographic range, originating from 67 countries, from all nine bio-geographic continents. The majority of collections originated from temperate climates and from habitats with no dry seasons but experiencing warm summer periods. The taxonomic composition of the collections highlighted a substantial diversity, with 303 taxa (four extinct in the wild; 56 critically endangered; 105 endangered; and 138 vulnerable) represented by 297 species, 199 genera and 74 families. Almost four fifths of the collections were harvested from wild habitats. Whilst wild-origin collections can harbour useful genes not available in the cultivated gene pool, for threatened plants both collections and taxa are likely to suffer from low genetic diversity as a low number of individual plants, populations and/or potentially viable or usable seeds were sampled at the original harvest. Large numbers of empty and infested seeds in the original harvest have significantly affected the quality of collections in terms of availability of potentially viable or usable seeds in collections. As a result, just over one third of taxa and one fifth of collections consisted of >= 5000 potentially viable or usable seeds. Viable seeds exhibited a sound physiological status in terms of germinability and viability at the initial round of germination tests after storage, but on average, relative germination and viability achieved were below 85%. A decline in germinability during their variable time of storage was evident for 16% of the 78 collections analysed for longevity. According to a set of criteria, suitable germination protocols for propagation of plants from seeds were identified for 165 taxa. Given the apparent differences between wild species, especially those that are rare and threatened, and domesticated crops, the quality and physiological status of reviewed collections are reasonably sound. The characteristics we observed for collections, the challenges we identified for conserving them and the germination protocols we suggested for propagation of plants from seeds have the scope to be noted, integrated and used globally across various conservation activities and policies.

Moq., with the former replacing the latter during the naturally vegetation succession in sandy dune regions in China. A previous study revealed that the foliage litter ofA. halodendronhad strong negative allelopathic effects on germination of the soil seed bank and on the seedling growth. However, whether this allelopathic effect varies with litter types and with the identity of plant species has not yet been studied. We, therefore, carried out a seed germination experiment to determine the allelopathic effects of three ltter types ofA. halodendron(roots, foliage, and stems) on seed germination of six plant species that progressively occur along a successional gradient in the semi-arid grasslands in the Horqin Sandy Land of northeastern China. In line with our expectation, we found that the early-successional species rather than the late-successional species were negatively affected byA. halodendronand that the allelopathic effects on seed germination increase with increasing concentration of litter extracts, irrespective of litter types. Our study evidenced the negative allelopathic effects ofA. halodendronon the species replacement and on the community composition during dune stabilization in the Horqin Sandy Land. Further studies are needed to better understand the successional process and thus to promote the vegetation restoration in that sandy dune region asA. halodendronitself disappeared also during the process.

The aim was to evaluate the possibility of harvesting retained seeds on weeds at crop harvest by a combine harvester based on estimation of weed seed retention. Before flowering, ten plants of each weed species were selected and surrounded by a seed trap comprising of a porous net. When the plants started shedding seeds, the seeds were collected from the traps and counted weekly until oat harvest. Just before oat harvest, the retained seeds on the plants were counted and the ratio of harvestable seeds and shed seeds during the growing season was determined. The seed production and shedding patterns varied between the 2 years. Across both years,Anagallis arvensisL.,Capsella bursa-pastorisL.

Knowledge of the main factors regulating the ability of seeds to persist in the soil beyond the first germination season is however limited. While morphological and physiological seed traits, and the degree of environmental uncertainty are considered important in shaping the seed banking strategies of plants, global assessments that explicitly account for phylogenetic relatedness are lacking. Using a global seed bank database comprising data for 2,350 angiosperms, we examined the extent to which two seed bank properties, i.e. seed bank type (transient vs. persistent) and density of viable seed banks, are determined by phylogenetic relatedness. We then tested phylogenetic correlations between these properties with seed mass and seed dormancy (dormant vs. non-dormant), and the contribution of phylogenetic relatedness relative to that of climatic and habitat-related variables in shaping seed bank properties. We found significant phylogenetic signal in seed bank type and density, providing evidence that the ability to form persistent seed banks is not randomly distributed across the phylogeny. While the ability to persist in the soil was phylogenetically correlated to the production of dormant and smaller seeds, seed mass and seed dormancy per se were poor predictors of seed persistence. Interestingly, habitat-related variables (mainly disturbance and canopy openness) but not climate significantly affect the ability of seed plants to form persistent seed banks. Synthesis. Our study is the first to show that phylogenetic relatedness plays an important role in explaining seed bank properties in angiosperms and how these properties relate to early life-history traits, climate and habitat-related variables. These findings represent a starting point to assess the generality of persistent seed banks as a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments and provide important insights into how seed plants might respond to global environmental changes.

Different wetland environments have been sampled in areas of a nature reserve and their macroremain content analysed to build a modern analogue dataset. This dataset was then used to characterise archaeological samples from a navigation channel from the Roman port cityLattara. In the modern analogue samples, the different wetland types (saline/brackish or fresh water) could be differentiated in the correspondence analysis. Within these groups, the sampled area of the littoral (submerged, shoreline, unsubmerged) could also be differentiated. This dataset can therefore provide a basis for the interpretation of the nature and degree of aquatic influence and layer formation processes in archaeobotanical records of coastal sites. In the tested archaeological samples from the navigation channel ofLattara, changes in space and time could be tracked using the modern analogue dataset and geoarchaeological information. The channel lost its fresh water supply and silted up over a short period of time (approx. 100 years).

Viability of living collections, and their value for future conservation efforts, can be limited without coordinated efforts to track and manage individuals across institutions. Using a pedigree-focused approach, the zoological community has established an inter-institutional infrastructure to support long-term viability of captive animal populations. We assessed the ability of this coordinated metacollection infrastructure to support the conservation of 4 plant species curated in living collections at multiple botanic gardens around the world. Limitations in current practices include the inability to compile, share, and analyze plant collections data at the individual level, as well as difficulty in tracking original provenance of ex situ material. The coordinated metacollection framework used by zoos can be adopted by the botanical community to improve conservation outcomes by minimizing the loss of genetic diversity in collections. We suggest actions to improve ex situ conservation of exceptional plant species, including developing a central database to aggregate data and track unique individuals of priority threatened species among institutions and adapting a pedigree-based population management tool that incorporates life-history aspects unique to plants. If approached collaboratively across regional, national, and global scales, these actions could transform ex situ conservation of threatened plant species.

Understanding vegetation dynamics including soil seedbank in Parthenium invaded communities and the growth pattern of the weed itself is essential for effective management of Parthenium. We monitored growth of Parthenium (height, density, cover and soil seedbank) and species composition of associated plant species for 5-year period from 2009 in a grassland invaded by Parthenium in south-central Nepal. We found that Parthenium cover and height decreased from 2009 to 2010 and then slightly increased in 2013. Parthenium density decreased from 2009 to 2010 and then was variable until 2013. Year x grazing interactions had significant effect on Parthenium cover and density. Parthenium soil seedbank was eight times higher near the soil surface (0-5 cm) than in deep soil (5-10 cm). It increased from 2009 to 2012 but decreased in 2013. Seedbank was also affected by interactions of year x depth, depth x grazing, and year x depth x grazing. Altogether, 87 plant species were recorded in Parthenium invaded sites and their species richness decreased until 2012 but slightly increased in 2013. The composition of associated plant species was affected by animal grazing intensity, Parthenium density, cover, and their interactions. Parthenium invasion has been ever increasing in our study site and many palatable plant species are under potential threat. Thus, there is an urgent need to carry out awareness campaign, formulate proper management plans, and implement such plans properly to manage Parthenium weed in Nepal.																	0564-3295	2661-8982				JUN	2020	61	2					238	247		10.1007/s42965-020-00085-7		JUN 2020					WOS:000543582000003

Mill.,Pyrus communis(L.),Sorbus aucuparia(L.),Prunus avium(L.),Prunus padus(L.), andCornus sanguinea(L.) are related, co-occurring species producingorthodoxseeds. However, we observed differences in their response to storage conditions, such as storage at different seed moisture contents (5%, 8%, and 11%) and/or temperatures (- 3 degrees C, - 18 degrees C, and - 196 degrees C). Severe desiccation to ca. 5% of MC negatively affected seeds ofM. sylvestris. Seeds ofP. aviumwere sensitive to storage in LN or at - 18 degrees C.S. aucupariaseeds are best stored at - 3 degrees C, whereasC. sanguineaseeds tolerate desiccation and storage in LN. In general, species with deeper physiological dormancy (S. aucuparia,P. padus, andC. sanguinea) tended to be more tolerant to desiccation and low temperatures. For all species, storage conditions did not affect seedling growth. Context Wild fruit woody species face many threats such as genetic loss, population fragmentation, and alien species; thus, their genetic variability should be preserved. Aims To examine the effect of storage conditions on seed viability and the initial growth of seedlings of six European wild fruit species:Malus sylvestris(L.) Mill.,Pyrus communis(L.),Sorbus aucuparia(L.),Prunus avium(L.),Prunus padus(L.), andCornus sanguinea(L.). Methods Seeds were desiccated to three different levels of moisture content (ca. 5, 8, or 11%) and stored at three different temperatures (- 3 degrees, - 18 degrees, or - 196 degrees C; liquid nitrogen, LN) for up to 3 years. Germination and seedling emergence tests were performed as well as measurement of seedling growth. Results Desiccation ofM. sylvestrisseeds from 10.7 to 4.9% significantly lowered germination from 91 to 77% and seedling emergence from 88 to 74%. InP. avium, LN storage significantly inhibited seedling emergence, both in the laboratory and the greenhouse, but did not affect total seed germination. InP. communis,P. padus, andC. sanguinea, neither germination nor seedling emergence was affected by seed storage conditions. There were small or no differences in stem height and root collar diameter in the first year of seedling growth of stored seeds. Conclusion Species with deeper physiological dormancy (S. aucuparia,P. padus,C. sanguinea) tended to be more tolerant of various storage conditions. Seeds ofP. padusandC. sanguineacan be stored long term at - 18 degrees C or in LN at 5-8% MC without losing viability.M. sylvestrisandP. aviumseeds are sensitive to desiccation below 6% MC or low temperature of storage at - 18 degrees C or - 196 degrees C, respectively. We observed that storage conditions had significant influence on germination and seedling emergence but had no effect on seedling growth after the first growing season.

However, the interactive effects of N addition and mowing on soil seed banks and plant communities are poorly quantified. A six-year field experiment was used to examine the responses of soil seed banks and plant communities to N addition (10 g N m(-2) year(-1)) and mowing (once a year) in a temperate steppe in northern China. Soil seed bank and plant community structure were investigated with laboratory germination and visual examination. Mowing reversed the depletion of seed bank size under N deposition at soil depths of 2-5 cm and 5-10 cm. The main effects of N addition and mowing increased 1.1 species (0.25 x 0.25 m(2)) independently, but no interactions of N addition and mowing on seed richness were detected at soil depths of 5-10 cm. Nitrogen addition had few effects on plant cover, but mowing suppressed it by 11.5%, mainly by decreasing grass cover. Nitrogen addition stimulated plant height by 6.25 cm by enhancing grass height whereas mowing did not influence it. Nitrogen addition decreased 2.8 plant species due to negative effects of N addition on forb. The positive effects of mowing on forb richness exceed negative effects of mowing on grass richness, leading to a net increase of 2.8 plant species with mowing. Our findings suggest that changes in soil seed bank size under N deposition can be strongly modulated by land use. Both N deposition and mowing can increase seed richness in deep soil (5-10 cm). Mowing stimulated, but N deposition suppressed, plant species richness. This is potentially important for understanding the influences of land use and environmental changes on soil seed banks, with subsequent effects on plant community dynamic.

However, how plant species diversity influences soil-based functions along post-agricultural secondary succession is still a largely ignored question in Mediterranean semi-arid conditions. Therefore, we used the plant functional group approach to investigate the relationships between plant species diversity indices and soil-based functions including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal respiration (BR), and carbon sequestration (CS) across three different stages of the vegetation succession corresponding to similar to 5 years after agricultural abandonment, similar to 15 years after abandonment, and oak forests which represent the terminal stage. We also tested if these relationships are supported by the niche complementarity and selection effect hypotheses. The results showed that soil-based functions significantly increased with time since abandonment as BR, MBC, and CS increased respectively by 1.7, 1.5, and 2.7 times across the three successional stages. We also found strong correlations between the diversity indices and the soil-based functions BR, MBC, and CS which were positive for richness (R(2)values 0.75, 0.74, and 0.75) and Shannon diversity (R(2)values 0.61, 0.58, and 0.61) but negative for evenness (R(2)values 0.38, 0.38, and 0.36 for, respectively). Similarly, richness and Shannon diversity of the different plant functional groups positively correlated with soil-based functions. However, contrasting results were found for evenness which positively correlated with soil-based functions for perennial grass only. We suggested that increasing the diversity of plant species and facilitating dominant species would be needed to improve the soil-based ecosystem functions after abandonment of degraded soils. This study also revealed that the mechanisms behind the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions were influenced by the vegetative forms.

In Hungary, it occasionally escapes cultivation, in other countries it has already become invasive, and thus, further spread cannot be ruled out. The production of copious long-lived seeds may contribute to its invasiveness. We investigated the soil seed bank of honey locust growing in urban parks of Budapest (Hungary). Soil samples of 1200 cm(3)were taken under the canopy of 48 solitary female trees, seeds were extracted by washing, and their viability was assessed by germination test following scarification. For each tree, trunk circumference and level of park maintenance were recorded. Seed bank density varied between 0 and 500 seeds/m(2)and in 17 out of 48 cases, it exceeded 100 seeds/m(2). Larger trees tended to form better-developed soil seed bank than smaller ones, yet the level of park maintenance has a much stronger effect: trees in neglected parks produced five-times higher density on average than those in perfectly managed parks (126.4 and 24.5 seeds/m(2), respectively). For a better understanding of the species' invasion risk, detailed seed ecological studies are needed and to prevent its further spreading, a more careful treatment of its litter is recommended.																	2676-8615	2676-8607				JUN	2020	71	1-2			SI		81	91		10.1007/s42977-020-00020-w		JUN 2020					WOS:000541860100001						
J	Li, L; Xiong, KN				Li, Liang; Xiong, Kangning			Study on peak cluster-depression rocky desertification landscape evolution and human activity-influence in South of China	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The peak cluster depression is a concentrated distribution of karst rocky desertification hazards in southern China. Under special water and soil conditions, the bare peak cluster slopes are covered with dense evergreen forests. The traditional human farming activities have affected the forest landscape on the slopes of the peak clusters, causing the phenomenon of point-like rock exposure on the slopes of the peak clusters, which can be repaired by natural forces; modern destructive economic activities rapidly degenerate the karst forest landscape into planar rocks. The exposed landscape is superimposed on the fragile karst environment, forming a large area of rocky desertification landscape, dissipating the basic conditions for the production and living of rural communities, and forming "karst ecological poverty". "Blocking the mountains and nourishing forests" is the best way to restore the landscape of the peak forests. "Artificial afforestation" can provide seed banks for the areas with strong rocky desertification.

Late-season surveys were conducted in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields in Texas in 2016 and 2017 to identify common weed species present as escapes and estimate seed rain potential of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) and waterhemp [A. tuberculatus (Moq.) J.D. Sauer], two troublesome species with high fecundity. A total of 400 cotton fields across four major cotton-producing regions in Texas [High Plains (HP), Gulf Coast (GC), Central Texas, and Blacklands] were surveyed. Amaranthus palmeri, Texas millet [Urochloa texana (Buckley) R. Webster], A. tuberculatus, ragweed parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.), and barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] were reported as the top five weed escapes in cotton fields. Amaranthus palmeri was the most prevalent weed in the HP and Lower GC regions, whereas A. tuberculatus escapes were predominantly observed in the Upper GC and Blacklands regions. On average, 9.4% of an individual field was infested with A. palmeri escapes in the Lower GC region; however, 5.1 to 8.1% of a field was infested in the HP region. Average A. palmeri density ranged from 405 (Central Texas) to 3,543 plants ha(-1) (Lower GC). The greatest seed rain potential by A. palmeri escapes was observed in the upper HP region (13.9 million seeds ha(-1)), whereas the seed rain potential of A. tuberculatus escapes was the greatest in the Blacklands (12.9 million seeds ha(-1)) and the upper GC regions (9.8 million seeds ha(-1)). Seed rain from late-season A. palmeri and A. tuberculatus escapes is significant in Texas cotton, and effective management of these escapes is imperative for minimizing seedbank inputs and impacting weed species persistence.

Storage of Brazilian Cattleya seeds from diverse biomes: lipid composition and effects on germination	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The establishment of seed banks is essential for the conservation of cultivated and wild plant species.Cattleyaspecies are economically important, but many of them are at risk of extinction. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of storage temperature on the physiological quality of seeds of seven congeneric species of diverse biomes from the UNOESTE-OSSSU seed bank and the lipid composition. Seeds were split into sub samples, pre-conditioned to 0.03 g H2O g DW(-1)for a week over a supersaturated solution of lithium chloride at 23 +/- 2 degrees C and maintained in rubber-sealed vessels for nine months under four storage temperatures: room temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C), 5 degrees C, -18 degrees C and -196 degrees C. Germination, the germination speed index, and viability based on a tetrazolium test were evaluated at three-month intervals. Lipid profiles were determined by GC-MS in the original seed lots. Different lipid profiles were found among species. Orchid seeds with a low water content could be stored for a short period in all conditions studied and were considered orthodox short-lived seeds.Cattleya rupestrisseeds were more tolerant than the congeners to deterioration under all the storage conditions.

Temporal patterns of seed germination in early spring-flowering temperate woodland geophytes are modified by warming	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Understorey species in temperate deciduous woodlands such as wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarrissus) and common snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) have complex dormancy: seeds that are shed in late spring require warm summer temperatures for embryo elongation and dormancy alleviation, but then cooler temperatures for germination in autumn. As seasons warm and tree canopies alter, how will different seasonal temperature sequences affect these complex dormancy responses? Methods The effect of different sequences of warmer (+5 degrees C), current or cooler (-5 degrees C) seasons (summer to spring) on seed germination patterns over seven successive seasons were investigated, with all sequences combined factorially to determine the consequences of differential seasonal temperature change for the temporal pattern of germination (and so seedling recruitment). Key Results Little (<1 %. G. nivalis) or no (N. pseudonwrissus) seed germination occurred during the first summer in any treatment. Germination of N. pseudonarcissus in the first autumn was considerable and greatest at the average (15 degrees C) temperature. irrespective of the preceding summer temperature; germination was also substantial in winter after a warmer autumn. Germination in G. nivalis was greatest in the warmest first autumn and influenced by preceding summer temperature (average > warmer > cooler); the majority of seeds that germinated over the whole study did so during the two autumns but also in year 2's cooler summer after a warm spring. Conclusions Warmer autumns and winters delay first autumn germination of N. pseudonarcissus to winter but advance it in G. nivalis; overall, warming will deplete the soil seed bank of these species, making annual seed influx increasingly important for recruitment and persistence. This study provides a comprehensive account of the effects of temperature changes in different seasons on seed germination in these early spring-flowering geophytes and consequently informs how these and other temperate woodland species with complex seed dormancy may respond to future climate change.

J	Ma, MJ; Collins, SL; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Collins, Scott L.; Du, Guozhen			Direct and indirect effects of temperature and precipitation on alpine seed banks in the Tibetan Plateau	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Plant community responses to global environmental change focus primarily on aboveground vegetation; however, the important role of the seed bank is frequently neglected. Specifically, the direct and indirect effects of changes in temperature and precipitation on seed banks remain poorly understood, yet seed banks provide a vital source of ecosystem resilience to global environmental change. We used a structural equation model to explore the direct and indirect effects of temperature, precipitation, and other biotic and abiotic factors on soil seed bank community composition using 1,026 soil seed bank samples from 57 sites along an elevation gradient that served as a space-for-time substitution for changing climate in the Tibetan Plateau. Seed bank richness was negatively correlated with both precipitation and temperature, but neither climate factor affected seed bank density. Temperature was also negatively correlated with vegetation species richness, which was positively correlated with seed bank richness and density. Both precipitation and temperature were positively correlated with soil total N, and total N was negatively correlated with vegetation richness. Both precipitation and temperature were negatively correlated with soil pH, and soil pH was negatively correlated with vegetation richness, but positively correlated with seed bank richness and density. Increasing precipitation and temperature would decrease seed bank diversity through direct effects as well as indirectly by decreasing vegetation diversity. Soil pH and total N emerged as the most important soil abiotic factors for seed bank diversity. Increasing precipitation and temperature under climate change may increase the extinction risk of some species in the seed bank by altering bet-hedging and risk-spreading strategies, which will degrade natural restoration ability and ultimately ecosystem resilience. This research is important because it identifies the potential underlying mechanistic basis of climate change impacts on seed banks through effects of aboveground vegetation and belowground biotic and abiotic factors.

Germination behaviour of forbs native to the southwestern United States following exposure to short-term seed bank conditions (-20 degrees C)	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seeds are increasingly being stored in seed banks for ex situ conservation, food security, and restoration reserves. Although it is hypothesized that seeds of many species can survive the dry, freezer conditions (-20 degrees C) of seed banks for many years, shelf life is unknown for many species. In particular, changes to dormancy and germination requirements following freezer storage have not yet been studied extensively. To improve our understanding of how seed dormancy and germination respond to seed banking conditions, we evaluated seed of six restoration-priority species in the southwestern United States, which is a region of increasing restoration need. Germination tendencies of seeds that were and were not exposed to a -20 degrees C treatment for 4-6 months were evaluated under 22 cold-moist stratification and incubation treatments to broadly assess changes to dormancy and germination requirements and speed. Direct or indirect (via interactions with stratification and/or incubation treatments) differences in dormancy breaking and germination were observed in seeds for four of the six species studied. Specifically, storage temperature accounted for differences in the final germination proportion, germination during stratification, and/or rate of germination in five of the six species. Notably, seeds of the one species that exhibit a combination of physiological and physical dormancy showed significant differences in all germination measures. However, while significant differences were found between seeds exposed to short-term seed bank storage and those that were not, these differences were small and may not be biologically meaningful, indicating that seed banking these species should not change how they are used for restoration or reintroduction purposes.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				JUN	2020	30	2					81	91	PII S096025852000001X	10.1017/S096025852000001X							WOS:000612779800003						
J	Davies, RM; Hudson, AR; Dickie, JB; Cook, C; O'Hara, T; Trivedi, C				Davies, Rachael M.; Hudson, Alice R.; Dickie, John B.; Cook, Charlotte; O'Hara, Tom; Trivedi, Clare			Exploring seed longevity of UK native trees: implications for ex situ conservation	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												UK trees require increased conservation efforts due to sparse and fragmented populations. Ex situ conservation, including seed banking, can be used to better manage these issues. We conducted accelerated ageing tests on seeds of 22 UK native woody species, in order to assess their likely longevity and optimize their conservation in a seed bank. Germination at four ageing time points was determined to construct survival curves, and it was concluded that multiple samples within a species showed comparable responses for most species tested, except for Fraxinus excelsior. Of all species studied, one could be classified as very short-lived, four as short-lived and 17 as medium, with none exceeding the medium category. The most important finding of this manuscript is that although some taxonomic trends were observed, the results indicate the need for caution when making broad conclusions on potential seed storage life at a species, genus or family level. Longevity predictions were compared to actual performance of older collections held in long-term storage at the Millennium Seed Bank, Kew. Although most collections remain high in viability in storage after more than 20 years, for short-lived species at least, there is some indication that accelerated ageing predicts longevity in seed bank conditions. For species with reduced potential longevity, such as Fagus sylvatica and Ulmus glabra, additional storage options are recommended for long-term gene banking.

Grass weeds are highly competitive and an increasing number of species develop resistance against the most commonly used herbicide modes of action. A diverse management strategy provides a better overall control of grass weeds and decreases the reliance on herbicides. The bio-economic decision support system, DK-RIM (Denmark-Ryegrass Integrated Management), was developed to assist integrated management ofL. multiflorumin Danish cropping systems, based on the Australian RIM model. DK-RIM provides long-term estimations (10-year period) and visual outputs ofL. multiflorumpopulation development, depending on management strategies. The dynamics ofL. multiflorumplants within the season and of the soil seed bank across seasons are simulated. The user can combine cultural weed control practices with chemical control options. Cultural practices include crop rotation changes, seeding density, sowing time, soil tillage system, and cover crops. Scenarios with increasing crop rotation diversity or different tillage strategies were evaluated. DK-RIM aims at being an actual support system, aiding the farmer's decisions and encouraging discussions among stakeholders on alternative management strategies.

J	Shi, ZJ; Zhang, JE; Wei, H				Shi, Zhaoji; Zhang, Jiaen; Wei, Hui			Research Progress on Soil Seed Bank: A Bibliometrics Analysis	SUSTAINABILITY												The soil seed bank (SSB) is a natural bank of viable seeds in the soil or on its surface. Researches on SSB have accumulated extensively worldwide, but have seldom been visualized and quantitatively analyzed. In this paper, publications related to SSB from 1900 to 2019 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database, and reviewed and analyzed using CiteSpace. Annual publications distribution, co-occurrence analysis, collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis and burst detection were all conducted. The results showed that (1) the number of SSB publications had increased rapidly and is still a hotspot; (2) SSB study is an interdisciplinary field mainly concentrated in ecology, environmental science, and plant science; (3) close research cooperation occurred among European countries which were more influential, whereas the USA was the most active country; (4) soil seed genetic diversity, seed persistence, seed trait, restoration potential and restoration projects, and spatial and temporal variation were the main research areas. (5) R language and linear mixed effects models are currently popular in SSB research. Invasive species, weed control, restoration potential and restoration projects, seed traits (especially seed longevity and dormancy), and SSB responses to environment changes (especially climate change and fire) are newly emerging trends in the research.																		2071-1050				JUN	2020	12	12							4888	10.3390/su12124888							WOS:000554692900001

No studies exist on the relationship between thermoclimatic belts that classify mountain life zones according to bioclimatic criteria and the germination strategy of alpine plants. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship using two closely related species growing in different thermotypes and to test whether their germination responses were related to the climate at natural sites. FreshRhaponticum bicknelliiandR. scariosumseeds were cold stratified for 0, 30, 60 and 90 days and tested for germination at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. At the same time, seed burial experiments were run in the field and in the plant nursery. A GLM analysis showed that the length of cold stratification affected significantly only the germination ofR. bicknelliiseeds, while increasing temperatures prompted germination in both species. We found thatR. bicknelliiadopts a drought-avoiding germination strategy, whileR. scariosumgermination is favoured by warm temperatures. Our findings support the general view that alpine plants do not share common germination requirements and that any conclusions should be interpreted from a biogeographical and bioclimatic perspective. Therefore, seed germination and seedling establishment of endemic alpine species can also be predicted by looking at the bioclimate of the species' range.

J	Ebert, AW				Ebert, Andreas W.			The Role of Vegetable Genetic Resources in Nutrition Security and Vegetable Breeding	PLANTS-BASEL												Malnutrition, comprising undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency, and overnutrition, is more widespread than hunger per se and affects most nations around the globe. The diversity and the quality of food produced and consumed are decisive factors when addressing the triple burden of malnutrition. In this context, fruit, vegetables, and nuts are increasingly moving into the focus of the nutrition community. Agricultural policies and investments in agriculture are predominantly focused on staple food production, neglecting the economic and nutritional potential of fruit and vegetables. While global vegetables are well represented in genebanks around the globe, this is much less the case for traditional vegetables. Collecting efforts in hotspots of vegetable diversity in Africa and Asia are required to conserve this germplasm before it is being replaced by modern varieties. Home gardens, community seedbanks, and variety introduction through vegetable seed kits are ways how genebanks can link with the farming community to strengthen the informal seed sector. This in turn may result in more diverse production systems and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. In the formal seed sector, vegetable breeders need access to a wide diversity of genetic resources, predominantly farmers' varieties, landraces, and crop wild relatives. Genomics-assisted breeding is increasingly facilitating the introgression of favorable genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with complex inheritance patterns from wild species into cultigens. This will lead to wider use of crop wild relatives in the development of resilient cultivars.

As a legume, symbiosis is determinant for adaptation. Our study aims to isolate a wider consortium of bacteria harboured in nodules, including both nitrogen and non-nitrogen fixers. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate the effects of fire in nodulation and bacterial diversity on young acacias growing in unburnt and burnt zones, one year after the fire. For this, we used molecular approaches, M13 fingerprinting and 16S rRNA partial sequencing, to identify species/genera involved and delta N-15 isotopic composition in leaves and plant nodules. Nitrogen isotopic analyses in leaves suggest that in unburnt zones, nitrogen fixation contributes more to plant nitrogen content. Overall,A. longifoliaseems to be promiscuous and despiteBradyrhizobiumspp. dominance,Paraburkholderiaspp. followed byPseudomonasspp. was also found. Several species not previously reported as nitrogen-fixers were identified, proposing other functions besides ammonia acquisition. Our study shows that bacterial communities are different in nodules after fire. Fire seems to potentiate nodulation and drives symbiosis towards nitrogen-fixers. Taken together, a multifunctional community inside nodules is pointed out which potentiateA. longifoliainvasiveness and adaptation.

J	Schutte, BJ; Rashid, A; Wood, JB; Marquez, I				Schutte, Brian J.; Rashid, Abdur; Wood, Joseph B.; Marquez, Israel			Colorimetric assay for detecting mechanical damage to weed seeds	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Weed seeds with mechanical damage are more susceptible to mortality in soil than nondamaged seeds. In this study we introduce a colorimetric assay to distinguish mechanically damaged weed seeds from nondamaged weed seeds. Our objectives were to 1) compare steepates from mechanically damaged seeds against steepates from nondamaged seeds for their capacities to reduce resazurin-a nontoxic, water-soluble dye that changes color and light absorbance properties in response to pH; and 2) use light absorbance data from steepate-resazurin solutions to create classification trees for distinguishing damaged from nondamaged weed seeds. Species in this study included barnyardgrass, curly dock, junglerice, kochia, oakleaf datura, Palmer amaranth, spurred anoda, stinkgrass, tall morningglory, and yellow foxtail. Seeds of each species were subjected to mechanical damage treatments that collectively represented a range of damage severities. Damaged and nondamaged seeds were individually soaked in water to produce steepates that were combined with resazurin. Light absorbance properties of steepate-resazurin solutions indicated that for all species except kochia, damaged seeds reduced resazurin to greater extents than nondamaged seeds. Prediction accuracy rates for classification trees that used absorbance values as predictor variables were conditioned by species and damage type. Prediction accuracy rates were relatively low (66% to 86% accurate) for lightly damaged seeds, especially grass weed seeds. Prediction accuracy rates were high (91% to 99% accurate) for severely damaged seeds of specific broadleaf and grass weeds. Steepate-resazurin solutions that successfully separated seeds took no more than 32 h to produce. The results of this study indicate that the resazurin assay is a method for quickly distinguishing damaged from nondamaged weed seeds. Because rapid assessments of seed intactness may accelerate the development of tactics for reducing the number of weed seeds in soil, we advocate further development of resazurin assays by laboratories studying methods for weed seedbank depletion.																	0890-037X	1550-2740				JUN	2020	34	3					454	460		10.1017/wet.2019.125							WOS:000545220200019

Genomic Analysis of Vavilov's Historic Chickpea Landraces Reveals Footprints of Environmental and Human Selection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												A defining challenge of the 21st century is meeting the nutritional demands of the growing human population, under a scenario of limited land and water resources and under the specter of climate change. The Vavilov seed bank contains numerous landraces collected nearly a hundred years ago, and thus may contain 'genetic gems' with the potential to enhance modern breeding efforts. Here, we analyze 407 landraces, sampled from major historic centers of chickpea cultivation and secondary diversification. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) conducted on both phenotypic traits and bioclimatic variables at landraces sampling sites as extended phenotypes resulted in 84 GWAS hits associated to various regions. The novel haploblock-based test identified haploblocks enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with phenotypes and bioclimatic variables. Subsequent bi-clustering of traits sharing enriched haploblocks underscored both non-random distribution of SNPs among several haploblocks and their association with multiple traits. We hypothesize that these clusters of pleiotropic SNPs represent co-adapted genetic complexes to a range of environmental conditions that chickpea experienced during domestication and subsequent geographic radiation. Linking genetic variation to phenotypic data and a wealth of historic information preserved in historic seed banks are the keys for genome-based and environment-informed breeding intensification.				von Wettberg, Eric/C-1115-2016; Vishnyakova, Margarita Afanasyevna/S-4164-2016	von Wettberg, Eric/0000-0002-2724-0317; Vishnyakova, Margarita Afanasyevna/0000-0003-2808-7745; Noujdina, Nina/0000-0002-5117-2879; Igolkina, Anna/0000-0001-8851-9621; Sokolkova, Alena/0000-0002-4357-5264; Chang, Peter/0000-0001-7676-7708													1422-0067				JUN	2020	21	11							3952	10.3390/ijms21113952							WOS:000543400300214	32486400

Evolutionarily acquired, these mechanisms are efficient for the establishment and survival of these herbs, especially in forests with unpredictable climates, such as the Caatinga. Thus, our objective was to verify whether the studied herbaceous species adopt the physical dormancy mechanism and how these natural barriers are overcome, to understand the temporal dynamics existing in the soil seed bank from a Brazilian dry tropical forest. Methods Seeds of five native herbaceous species from the Caatinga forests were selected and submitted to pre-germinative treatments for verifying the presence of physical dormancy. We collected soil samples in the rainy and dry seasons for four consecutive years and monitored the emergence of the selected herbaceous in the greenhouse. We verified the differences in germination and seed bank emergence in the soil by generalized linear models. Important Findings The presence and absence of physical dormancy were observed in seeds from Caatinga herbaceous species. We found intraspecific and interspecific differences in the herbaceous emergence from soil seed banks between years and climatic seasons. In perennial herbs, consecutive lack of emergence between seasons and years was frequent, which suggests a direct relationship with the mechanism of physical dormancy and the environmental conditions necessary to overcome integument barriers. In these species, seed dimorphism and dormancy may confer additional advantages to their survival. Moreover, presenting intermediate levels of physical dormancy in an annual species may be an evolutionary adjustment to rainfall unpredictability. In contrast, we found that the annual herb without dormancy is more sensitive to seasonal and interannual climate changes, as evidenced by the increase and significant reduction of its emergence in the soil seed bank. These differences acquired evolutionarily are advantageous for the establishment of herbaceous populations, mainly in semiarid regions with an unpredictable climate.				de Andrade, Juliana Ramos/AAP-9583-2020; de Souza Aguiar, Bruno Ayron/AAX-9277-2020	de Andrade, Juliana Ramos/0000-0002-5445-8872; de Souza Aguiar, Bruno Ayron/0000-0001-6245-5826; Souza, Jose Djalma de/0000-0002-0677-4483												1752-9921	1752-993X				JUN	2020	13	3					256	265		10.1093/jpe/rtaa008							WOS:000544169500001

JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims The ability to form persistent seed banks is one of the best predictors of species' potential to establish in new ranges. Wild sunflower is native to North America where the formation of persistent seed banks is promoted by disturbance and it plays a key role on the establishment and persistence of native populations. However, the role of the seed banks on the establishment and persistence of invasive populations has not been studied. Here, we evaluated the role of seed bank and disturbance on the establishment and fitness, and seed persistence in the soil in several sunflower biotypes collected in ruderal (wild Helianthus annuus) and agrestal (natural crop wild hybrid) habitats of Argentina as well as volunteer populations (progeny of commercial cultivars). Methods In a seed-bank experiment, we evaluated emergence, survival to reproduction, survival of emerged seedlings, inflorescences per plant and per plot under disturbed and undisturbed conditions over 2 years; in a seed-burial experiment, we evaluated seed persistence in the soil over four springs (6, 18, 30 and 42 months). Important Findings Overall, seedling emergence was early in the growing season (during winter), and it was promoted by disturbance, especially in the first year. Despite this, the number of inflorescences per plot was similar under both conditions, especially in ruderals. In the second year, emergence from the seed bank was much lower, but the survival rate was higher. In the seed-burial experiment, genetic differences were observed but seeds of ruderals arid agrestals persisted up to 42 months while seeds of the volunteer did not persist longer than 6 months. The agrestal biotype showed an intermediate behavior between ruderals and volunteers in both experiments. Our findings showed that wild and crop-wild sunflower can form persistent seed banks outside its native range and that disturbance may facilitate its establishment in new areas.

Developing minimal-input techniques for invasive plant management: perimeter treatments enlarge native grass patches	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												There is a continual need for invasive plant science to develop approaches for cost-effectively benefiting native over nonnative species in dynamic management and biophysical contexts, including within predominantly nonnative plant landscapes containing only small patches of native plants. Our objective was to test the effectiveness of a minimal-input strategy for enlarging native species patches within a nonnative plant matrix. In Pecos National Historical Park, New Mexico, USA, we identified 40 native perennial grass patches within a matrix of the nonnative annual forb kochia [Bassia scoparia(L.) A.J. Scott]. We mechanically cutB. scopariain a 2-m-wide ring surrounding the perimeters of half the native grass patches (with the other half as uncut controls) and measured change in native grass patch size (relative to pretreatment) for 3 yr. Native grass patches around whichB. scopariawas cut grew quickly the first posttreatment year and by the third year had increased in size four times more than control patches. Treated native grass patches expanded by an average of 25 m(2), from 4 m(2)in October 2015 before treatment to 29 m(2)in October 2018. The experiment occurred during a dry period, conditions that should favorB. scopariaand contraction of the native grasses, suggesting that the observed increase in native grasses occurred despite suboptimal climatic conditions. Strategically treating around native patches to enlarge them over time showed promise as a minimal-input technique for increasing the proportion of the landscape dominated by native plants.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JUN	2020	13	2					108	113	PII S1939729120000097	10.1017/inp.2020.9							WOS:000539647300009

Vegetation restoration is an effective approach to control soil erosion and improve ecosystems. The soil seed bank generally plays an important role in vegetation restoration after disturbance. Thus, we reviewed soil seed bank studies to reveal the soil seed bank characteristics and its role in vegetation restoration in three vegetation types (forest, forest-steppe, and steppe). We selected 38 seed bank studies and analyzed several seed bank characteristics, such as seed density, species composition, and the relationship between seed size and seed bank. We also assessed the role of the soil seed bank in vegetation restoration. The soil seed bank density ranged from 2,331 +/- 1,993 to 6,985 +/- 4,047 seeds/m(2) among the different vegetation types. In the soil seed bank, perennial herbs and grasses accounted for 51.5% of the total species. Native species that were dominant or common in the standing vegetation usually had relatively high seed bank densities. Moreover, species with smaller seeds generally had higher soil seed bank densities. The present study indicates that the soil seed bank plays a significant role in spontaneous vegetation restoration, especially during the early successional stages in abandoned slope farmlands and grazing-excluded grasslands. However, species with large seeds or transient soil seed banks should be reintroduced through seeding to accelerate target species restoration. More studies on soil seed banks need to be conducted to comprehensively reveal their characteristics.

Ritter is a rare columnar cactus species endemic to four small habitat patches of a south-eastern caatinga inselberg elements located in Eastern Brazil. C. purpureus was listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN by habitat loss due to quarrying activities. Here, we used ten microsatellite markers to estimate genetic diversity and structure of C. purpureus populational groups to perform a remaining genetic diversity diagnosis and to define population boundaries. Our estimates of genetic diversity indicated that C. purpureus displayed moderated levels of genetic diversity, even though the species populational groups are small and fragmented. All genetic structuring approaches revealed that there is a clear differentiation in two populations isolated by the Jequitinhonha River, named here as South and North populations. The South population corresponds to a unique group placed in a disturbed non-protected area and the North population comprises three groups, including the admixtured and managed group placed in a Conservation Unit. As priority actions for the retention of genetic diversity of C. purpureus populations, we propose (i) that the isolated population should be considered as a prior for conservation efforts and managed as an independent unit; (ii) maintaining the integrity of the habitat within the four small patches that constitute the range of the species; (iii) continuous monitoring of genetic diversity of the populational groups; (iii) improve the quality of local pollinator habitats in order to avoid the inbreeding; and (iv) ex-situ conservation actions should be considered, especially the transfer of C. purpureus representatives to botanical gardens as well formation of a seed bank.

Effect of olive vegetation water and compost extracts on seed germination of four weed species	CURRENT PLANT BIOLOGY												Weed management has historically been recognized as one of the main challenges in crop production systems, especially in organic farming settings. Innovative and environment-friendly weed management tools are much needed to overcome weed herbicide resistance and minimize agricultural footprint and energy use. The objective of this study was to test the effect of four dilution levels of olive vegetation water (OVW) and three pomace/compost extracts on seed germination of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), little mallow (Malva parviflora L.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), and common sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.). In the first experiment, four dilutions (100 %, 75 %, 50 %, or 25 %) of OVW and a tap water control treatment were prepared. In the second experiment, extracts were prepared from raw olive pomace, olive/dairy manure mix compost or dairy manure-based compost. For each treatment and species, 100 seeds were divided into 10 Petri dishes. A 2 mL solution from each of the treatments above was applied to each Petri dish and incubated in a growth chamber for 24 days. Redroot pigweed was the most sensitive to OVW treatments, with germination rate dropping from 30 % in the control treatment to 1-4 % for all OVW levels on day 8 after application. In common sowthistle, full strength OVW (OVW100) caused a germination delay of 4 days compared to the control. In little mallow, OVW100 decreased germination rate throughout the duration of the experiment, while OVW75 slightly increased the germination rate after 12 days of application, apparently overcoming seed dormancy. For common purslane, the three higher OVW concentrations decreased germination rate during the first six days. Compost extracts had little effect on weed seed germination, with some of them initially depressing germination in some species or tending to accelerate little mallow germination in the second half of the incubation period. Overall, this study shows that OVW can be used to control weeds or otherwise stimulate their germination so that they can be controlled using other means before planting. This material could possibly be used to deplete the soil weed seed bank.																		2214-6628				JUN	2020	22								100150	10.1016/j.cpb.2020.100150							WOS:000536951200007

Burrowing Richardson's ground squirrels affect plant seedling assemblages via environmental but not seed bank changes	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												In grassland ecosystems, burrowing mammals create disturbances, providing habitat for animal species and increasing plant community diversity. We investigated whether seedling assemblages on Richardson's ground squirrel Urocitellus richardsonii mounds result from seed rearrangement or environmental changes that favor germination of certain species over others. To test whether ground squirrels rearrange the seed bank by burrowing, we compared seed compositions among mounds, burrows, and undisturbed soil. To test whether ground squirrels change environmental conditions, we compared soil nitrate and bare ground cover on and off mounds. We also compared seedlings that germinated on mounds with seedlings that germinated on artificial disturbances from which we removed aboveground vegetation. Soil nitrate and bare ground cover were significantly higher on mounds than artificial disturbances. While seed richness and abundance did not differ among mounds, burrows, and undisturbed soil, seedling richness was reduced on mounds relative to artificial disturbances. Burrowing disturbance favors seedlings that can capitalize on bare ground availability but are less able to immobilize nitrate, as opposed to perennial species that immobilize more nitrate but take longer to establish. Our results suggest that Richardson's ground squirrels act as ecosystem engineers, although future research following succession on ground squirrel mounds is necessary to understand how they influence plant communities past the seedling stage.

The restinga vegetation is associated with the Atlantic rainforest biome and comprises four distinct main formation zones: coastal grasslands, shrublands, open-forests and marsh zones. Especially due to coastal urbanization, this is a threatened ecosystem that, through its different shrub formations, exhibits a unique mosaic as a result of the vegetation distribution in nuclei of different covering, physiognomy and floristic composition. Objective: We aimed to characterize the above and belowground composition of a conserved, non-flooded, open-scrub, nuclei (patches of bushes) formation of restinga in Linhares, ES, southeastern Brazil. Methods: The vegetation survey was conducted using the line intercept method. Diameter and height of the first six nuclei were measured in five transects separated by 50 m. totaling 30 nuclei up to 350 in away from the shore line. The phytosociology and Shannon Index of the aboveground vegetation community were calculated. In the same 30 nuclei, leaf litter and topsoil layer (15 x 15 x 10 cm) samples were collected to survey the viable seed bank, which was later placed in a greenhouse for germination and seedling identification. The Sorensen Similarity index (SSi) was used to compare the floristic composition between the leaf litter and topsoil layer seed banks. Nuclei volume and number of species were calculated as well. Results: In the aboveground vegetation, 54 plant species belonging to 32 families were identified, totaling 1 098 individuals. The nuclei showed a diversity (H') of 3.08 nats, and an average diameter of 11.5 m (s = 9.1), area of 526.4 m(2) (s = 1 081.7), and height of 2.9 m (s = 1.1). Davillailexuosa, followed by Smilax rufescens, presented the highest IVI (Importance Value Index). A total of 1 839 seedlings from 32 species and 19 families were identified in the seed bank. Enydra sessilis (Asteraceae) had the highest seed density (544), while the family with highest species richness was Cyperaccae. A low similarity between the vegetation surveyed and the seed bank composition was found (only 5 species in common, SSi = 0.10). Conclusions: The results indicate that a post-disturbance early community, established from the seed bank, would have a substantially different species composition, but with other potential species to restore vegetation over the long-term succession.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				JUN	2020	68	2					541	550									WOS:000532579400014						
J	Borrelli, L; Pecetti, L				Borrelli, Lamberto; Pecetti, Luciano			Weed seedling emergence in contrasting fodder crop systems following 30 years of cultivation in the lowlands of Northern Italy	WEED RESEARCH												Five fodder crop systems of different intensity (ranging from a double annual crop of Italian ryegrass + silage maize to a permanent meadow) were adopted for 30 years in the lowlands of Northern Italy under two input levels, differing mainly in their provision of organic fertiliser (manure). Herbicides were used in the maize crops included in all systems, except the meadow. After 30 years, the weed seedbank of all systems and input levels were assessed by the seedling emergence technique on soil samples from each plot. The cropping systems determined the abundance and composition of the weed assembly. Relatively few, frequent species made up the majority of the emerged seedlings in all systems, and there was no relationship between the total number of emerged seedlings and the mean number of species recorded in the different systems. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oxalis corniculata were abundant in the annual double crop and in the 3- and 6-year rotations that also comprised the annual double crop. These weeds, however, were unlikely to represent a major threat to the crops, due to their vigour and growth period. The permanent meadow tended to greater weed biodiversity than the other systems. The application of manure favoured the seedbank of species such as Lolium multiflorum, Digitaria sanguinalis and A. thaliana. Weed communities in the different systems were mainly determined by herbicide application, (through the ability of weeds to avoid its effects, determined by the weed life history and emergence period) and manure application (with its possible dual effect of spreading weed seeds and favouring nitrogen-responsive weeds).																	0043-1737	1365-3180				JUN	2020	60	3					194	203		10.1111/wre.12412							WOS:000531175200003						
J	Castillo, NR; Melgarejo, LM; Blair, MW				Castillo, Nohra Rodriguez; Melgarejo, Luz Marina; Blair, Matthew Wohlgemuth			Seed Structural Variability and Germination Capacity in Passiflora edulis Sims f. edulis	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Purple passion fruit,Passiflora edulisSims f.edulis, is an important semi-perennial, fruit bearing vine originating in South America that produces a commercial tropical juice pulp for international and national consumption. Within the round purple passion fruit are a large number of membranous seed sacs each containing individual seeds. Little is known about the seed anatomy of the commercial passion fruit, differences between wild collected and commercial types, and its effect on seedling germination. Therefore, our main objective for this study was to analyze the seed anatomy variability of different germplasm as well as the effect on viability and germination of the seeds of this species. Germplasm was evaluated from three sources: (1) commercial cultivars grown in current production areas, (2) genebank accession from the national seed bank, and (3) landraces collected across different high and mid-elevation sites of the Andean region. A total of 12 morphometric descriptors related to seed anatomy were evaluated on the 56 genotypes, of which three were most informative: Angle to the vertex which is related to the shape of the seed, the thickness of the tegument and the horizontal length; separating the seed according to its source of origin. Germination was found to be positively correlated with the number (r= 0.789) and depth (r= 0.854) of seed pitting. Seeds of the commercial cultivars had more seed pits and higher germination compared to seeds of landraces or genebank accessions showing a possible effect of domestication on the crop. Interestingly, passion fruits often germinate during the rainy season as escaped or wild seedlings especially in the disturbed landscapes of coffee plantations, so some dormancy is needed but faster germination is needed for intensive cultivation. Harnessing passion fruit diversity would be useful as the semi-domesticated landraces have valuable adaptation characteristics to combine with rapid germination selected in the commercial cultivars. The variability of seed pitting with cultivars more pitted than landraces possibly resulting in faster germination may indicate that purple passion fruit is still undergoing a process of selection and domestication for this trait.

Our primary aims were to determine the number of reported amphicarpic species and their taxonomic, geographic, life form and phylogenetic distribution, to evaluate differences in the life history of plants derived from aerial and subterranean seeds, to discuss the ecological and evolutionary significance of amphicarpy, to explore the use of amphicarpic plants in agriculture, and to suggest future research directions for studies on amphicarpy. Amphicarpy occurs in at least 67 herbaceous species (31 in Fabaceae) in 39 genera and 13 families of angiosperms distributed in various geographical regions of the world and in various habitats. Seeds from aerial and subterranean fruits differ in size/mass, degree of dormancy, dispersal and ability to form a persistent seed bank, with aerial seeds generally being smaller, more dormant and more likely to be dispersed and to form a seed bank than subterranean seeds. In addition, plants produced by aerial and subterranean seeds may differ in survival and growth, competitive ability and biomass allocation to reproduction. Amphicarpic plants may exhibit a high degree of plasticity during reproduction. Subterranean fruits are usually formed earlier than aerial ones, and plants may produce only subterranean propagules under stressful environmental conditions. Differences in the life histories of plants from aerial and subterranean seeds may be an adaptive bet-hedging strategy.

Pods as sails but not as boats: dispersal ecology of a habitat-restricted desert milkvetch	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise Adaptive seed dispersal mechanisms are fundamental to plant fitness, but dispersal advantage is scale-dependent. We tested the hypothesis that informed dispersal in response to an environmental cue enables dispersal by wind on a local scale for Astragalus holmgreniorum, a desert species restricted to swales and wash skirts with overland flow, but prevents longer-distance dispersal by water into unfavorable wash habitats. Methods Pod biomechanics in A. holmgreniorum lead to major shape modifications with changes in moisture content. We performed laboratory experiments to examine the interaction of pod shape with wind and water, and conducted field experiments in A. holmgreniorum habitat evaluating the roles of wind, water, and seed predators on dispersal. Results Dry pods exhibit a flattened crescent shape with partial dehiscence that facilitated wind dispersal by ground tumbling and seed scattering in laboratory experiments. Rain simulation experiments showed that even small precipitation events returned wetted pods to their cylindrical shape and opened the dorsal suture, exposing the seeds. In the field experiments, dry pods were moved locally by wind, whereas rain caused pod opening and washing out of seeds in place. Seed predators had minimal effect on pod movement. Conclusions Astragalus holmgreniorum exhibits pod structural remodeling in response to environmental change in a striking and novel demonstration of informed dispersal. Wind-driven movement of dry pods facilitates local seed dispersal, but rain causes pods to open and release seeds, ensuring that they are not transported out of suitable habitats and into active washes where they would be lost from the seed bank.

Inadequate seed storage can lead to a waste of both natural and economic resources when seeds of poor quality are sown. When working with native species with unknown storage behavior, general assumptions can be made based on studies on related species, and standard practices may be applied with caution; however, an investigation should be conducted to understand if specific storage requirements are needed and for how long seeds can be stored before they lose significant viability.

Many proposed mechanisms for this coexistence involve changes to the competitive dynamics or abiotic environment. However, another possible mechanism could be a change to seed bank dynamics, ultimately impacting the species available for re-establishment. Here, we test: (a) how gap creation alters seed bank composition, seed inputs (i.e. seed rain) and outputs (i.e. seedling establishment and predation); and (b) whether these changes are due to total vegetation removal or an indirect consequence of the removal of particularly influential species or traits. Location Rough fescue grassland in Alberta, Canada. Methods To test the impact of gap creation on seed bank dynamics, we experimentally removed or kept the standing vegetation intact in a paired-plot design. Within each pair, we combined field sampling with greenhouse emergence studies to measure seed bank composition throughout the growing season. To examine inputs, we added seed trays that collected seed rain, and to examine outputs, we measured germination in seed trays with or without seed predation. Results Seed bank composition within gaps was significantly different from the original standing vegetation before removal and the seed bank where standing vegetation was kept intact. Gap creation increased net seed rain and seedling establishment but had no impact on seed predation. These effects of gap creation on seed outputs seem to be reliant on the total removal of vegetation, while seed inputs are also dependent on the community and trait composition of the standing vegetation. Conclusions The creation of gaps through small-scale disturbances leading to a distinct seed bank community is another possible explanation for why we see increased beta-diversity with disturbance. Further, these gaps seem to be more important than standing vegetation compositional changes for preserving the local seed bank and promoting coexistence.

Therefore, soil seed banks can reflect the effects of long-term cumulative field management and crop sequences on weed communities. Moreover, soil seed banks provide strong estimates of future weed problems but also of potential arable plant diversity and associated ecological functions. For this, we evaluated the effects of different long-term farming systems under the same crop rotation sequence on the abundance, diversity and community assembly of weed seed bank, as well as on the functional diversity and composition. Location: DOK (biodynamic [D], bioorganic [O], conventional [K]) long-term trial, Therwil, Switzerland. Methods: The effects of long-term contrasted farming systems (i.e., biodynamic, organic, conventional, mineral and unfertilised systems) and last crop sown (i.e., wheat and maize) were evaluated on different indicators of species and functional diversity and composition of the weed soil seed bank. Results: The results showed significant influences of 40 years of contrasted farming systems on the diversity and composition of the seed bank, with higher diversities being found in unfertilised and organic farming systems, but also higher abundances than those found under conventional systems. Organic farming also allowed higher functional richness, dispersion and redundancy. Different farming systems triggered shifts in species and functional assemblies. Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of organic management for the maintenance of a diverse arable plant community and its functions. However, such results emphasise the need for appropriate yearly management to reduce the abundance of settled weediness and prevent affecting crop production. The farm management filtered community composition based on functional traits. Although the soil seed bank buffers the long-term farming and crop sequence, the last crop sown and, thus, the yearly management were important determinants of seed bank composition.				Serra, F.

In the present study, we used epilithic macroalgae present on the limpetNiveotectura pallidato determine the macroalgal seed bank along a depth gradient of habitats (surf, turf, barren and sandy zones). We collected a total of 46 limpets in two seasons (summer: August and winter: December) and from four zones at Sashiga-hama on the north-east coast of northern Honshu, Japan. The attached organisms on the limpet shells were brushed off and identified using a plastid-encodedrbcL gene and high throughput sequencing (HTS) based DNA metabarcoding. The original data set consisted of 432 macroalgal and 224 microalgal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For macroalgae, 37, 190 and 205 OTUs were assigned to Ulvophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyta, respectively. For canopy-forming macroalgal OTUs, Agaraceae, Alariaceae, Lessoniaceae, Laminariaceae and Sargassaceae were detected. In summer, the OTU was significantly richest in the sandy zone (77.0 +/- 15.2 OTUs), but the difference among zones was less conspicuous in winter, ranging from 52.8 +/- 16.4 to 64.3 +/- 13.2 OTUs. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index showed similar patterns. The laminarialean and sargassacean OTUs were significantly the richest in the sandy zone during summer (p< 0.001). In light of these results, macroalgal restoration (i.e. through sea urchin removal) should be initiated in summer and the sandy zone should be preferentially targeted.

Fresh mature fruits ofZ. xanthoxylonwere placed on the soil surface and buried at a depth of 3-5 cm in soil in a natural habitat in August 2015. At regular intervals until July 2017, fruits/seeds were taken to the laboratory and evaluated for viability and germination. Fresh seeds in fruits germinated to 22-62% over a range of temperatures. After 6 weeks in the field, seeds on the surface germinated to 72-99% and those in soil to 70-100%. From 12 to 98 weeks, seeds on and in soil germinated to 72-100% at low (15/5 and 20/10 degrees C) temperatures, but germination at high (25/25 and 30/15 degrees C) temperatures was higher in summer than in spring. Seeds in fruits on the soil surface had higher germination percentages than those in the soil, especially at high temperatures. Although about half the seeds were dormant at maturity, they became nondormant in the field during summer. There was a decrease in ability to germinate at high temperatures in spring, especially for seeds in buried fruits, which indicates conditional dormancy/nondormancy cycling. Lack of germination at high temperatures in spring would help delay germination until the onset of the summer rainy season in the desert. Burial of fruits in the soil enhances the formation of a short-lived persistent seed bank.																	1532-4982	1532-4990				OCT 1	2020	34	4					435	444		10.1080/15324982.2020.1763514		MAY 2020					WOS:000539364000001

In the present study, we investigated the variation of the bank components, especially in the Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyta, on cobbles at four different vegetation and depths (1, 2, 5, and 7 m) of urchin barren grounds (UB1, UB2, UB5, and UB7), and alternative ecological phases (EB, ecklonian kelp bed and SC, soft coral bed). We collected 30 cobbles (3-7 cobbles per station) from the six stations and identified the attached algae by DNA metabarcoding based on high-throughput sequencing. In the rarefied data, 74 macroalgal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, of which 32 and 42 OTUs were assigned to Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyta, respectively. The OTU richness in urchin barrens increased with depth from UB1 (0.07 +/- 0.03 OTUs cm(-2) of cobble) to UB7 (0.21 +/- 0.12 OTUs cm(-2) of cobble), which was similar to the other ecological phases (EB and SC). The Shannon-Weiner diversity index in UB7 was also significantly highest and similar to EB and SC (p < 0.05). However, the ordination test (non-metric multidimensional scaling) assigned EB to different group apart from UB7 and SC, probably due to solely Phaeophyceae dominance in EB. Therefore, macroalgal richness and components of the bank could be determined by depth and ecological phases, respectively. Furthermore, OTU identified as Undaria pinnatifida was detected on a cobble collected UB7. Thus, in urchin barren coast, the richness in kelp gametophyte is probably also higher in deeper area.

These strategies are known to be mediated by adaptations of seed dispersal and reproductive phenology, which if analyzed together can provide valuable information about the regeneration strategies of species. We explored whether dispersal syndrome and/or seed dispersal phenology control the similarity between standing vegetation, seed rain and soil seed bank in a seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) in Southern Ecuador. Location Arenillas Ecological Reserve, Southwestern Ecuador, the biogeographic region of Pacific Coastal Ecuador. Methods We recorded standing vegetation of woody species in a 9-ha permanent plot and sampled soil seed bank from 265 cores of 0.06 m(2). Additionally, we sampled seed rain from 265 seed traps of 0.64 m(2) for one year. We evaluated similarity in species composition, species richness, and abundance between the three components for all species and for each dispersal syndrome. Results The community we studied showed a high similarity in species composition between components. The similarity was influenced by dispersal syndrome and the seed dispersal phenology. Similarity between seed rain and standing vegetation was high in species that dispersed in the rainy season, such as zoochorous species, while for autochorous species, compared with the other dispersal syndromes it was higher between seed bank and standing vegetation. Conclusions In our SDTF, dispersal phenology seemed to influence whether seeds had direct germination or entered the soil seed bank and influenced the match between seed rain and soil seed bank, suggesting different regeneration strategies related to dispersal ability.				de la Cruz, Marcelino/M-6124-2015; Espinosa, Carlos Ivan/AAI-1305-2019; Mendez, Marcos/A-3745-2009	de la Cruz, Marcelino/0000-0002-9080-4525; Espinosa, Carlos Ivan/0000-0002-5330-4505; Mendez, Marcos/0000-0002-0144-643X												1100-9233	1654-1103				NOV	2020	31	6					995	1005		10.1111/jvs.12894		MAY 2020					WOS:000534691200001						
J	Oshima, K; Takahashi, K				Oshima, Katsumi; Takahashi, Koichi			Forest disturbances promote invasion of alien herbaceous plants: a comparison of abundance and plant traits between alien and native species in thinned and unthinned stands	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasion of alien plant species can have irreversible effects on ecosystems. Although alien plants often distribute in disturbed area, understanding of the initial invasion process soon after disturbance is poor. We compared forest floor vegetation between thinning treatment plots and intact control plots in a red pine (Pinus densiflora) forest in central Japan to test whether the thinning treatment (i.e. disturbance) induced invasion of alien plants. We also examined how invasion of aliens is influenced by the environment, plant traits, and buried seeds in the soil. In control plots, few alien plants emerged at the herbaceous layer and only a few buried seeds of alien plants were found. In treatment plots, on the other hand, many alien plants were observed both at the herbaceous layer and in the soil seed bank. Treatment plots had a larger percentage of canopy openness than control plots. In treatment plots, the cover of alien plants was negatively correlated with the distance from the nearest primary road. Alien plants had taller maximum plant height, larger leaves, and greater leaf nitrogen concentration than native species in treatment plots. This indicates that alien plants were superior to native plants in growth, competition, and carbon assimilation abilities. Alien plants tended to have seeds with long dispersal abilities, such as anemochory and zoochory, and short life histories, such as annual and biennial histories. These findings suggest that thinning promoted invasion of alien plants and that alien plants had the potential for further invasion by rapid dispersion, establishment, and growth.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2020	22	9					2749	2762		10.1007/s10530-020-02283-9		MAY 2020					WOS:000534446800001

The results showed that the United States was the pioneering country in studies on the wetland ecological restoration, while China began to pay widespread attention from 2000. Compared to the international developed countries, the start time of concern for wetland ecological restoration in China was about 10 years later. The phytoremediation and engineering restoration were the most popular among all the wetland ecological restoration techniques. Besides the United States, the number of publications increased most quickly in China since 2004. The Louisiana State University published most of the researching findings among the international institutions related to wetland ecological restoration. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most important institution for wetland restoration study in China. The analysis of the wetland ecological restoration practice in China and international states indicated that the study and application of combined bioremediation techniques would receive more attention for wetland ecological restoration in the future.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2020	40	6					2755	2764		10.1007/s13157-020-01305-5		MAY 2020					WOS:000533201900002

One major problem is the abandonment of management, especially in semi-natural grassland ecosystems. Numerous restoration projects were, therefore, launched to counteract this development. However, the effects of restoration are not yet fully understood. Especially the early successional stage, i.e. the composition of the vegetation in the first years after the restoration measures, has received little attention probably due to its supposedly low conservation value. As study area, we selected the largest area of calcareous grasslands at the northern edge of the German uplands. About 35 ha of formerly abandoned calcareous grasslands have been restored by cutting shrubs here in the last eight years. Within the restored sites, 50 randomly chosen vegetation surveys were made and the results were compared to 50 control plots. Our study revealed that the value of the early successional stage for biodiversity conservation was previously underestimated. Even though the target state - calcareous grassland - is far from being reached, the early successional stage enhances the conservation value of calcareous grasslands by (i) increasing diversity at the landscape scale, (ii) hosting numerous target species as well as (iii) contributing to a higher habitat quality and heterogeneity. Future restoration of calcareous grasslands should focus on sites with low nutrient content of the soil, a shallow topsoil, and a warm microclimate. At such sites, the chances are greatest that species with a high nature conservation value, i.e. characteristic species of calcareous grasslands as well as thermophilous fringe and ruderal species, will re-establish.				; Hamer, Ute/J-5519-2016	Poniatowski, Dominik/0000-0002-9955-688X; Hamer, Ute/0000-0002-3845-3983												0925-8574	1872-6992				MAY 15	2020	151								105858	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.105858							WOS:000533857300014

The Carpathian Mountains, an iconic centre of biodiversity in temperate Europe, harbour a remarkable number of endemic vascular plants. Current knowledge on their taxonomic status, spatial distribution and genetic diversity is, however, incomplete. Research and conservation efforts have mostly been country specific, resulting in contrasting chorological knowledge and taxonomic acceptance between neighbouring countries, and differing conservation policies. Urgent synchronisation of cross-border conservation measures is required. Here, we present an overview of a new international project that will address these issues, outlining the current state of knowledge and theoretical background concerning Carpathian subendemics and endemics in order to improve their conservation status. The project involves partners from eight countries, working collaboratively in conservation, research and sharing of standardised data for the Carpathian flora. Long-term seed conservation of 500 species, with a focus on endemics, regionally endangered species and range-margin populations from the Carpathians, will be used as an effective measure for the conservation of Carpathian endemics and endangered species. Research focused on the biosystematics of selected taxa will increase our knowledge of the evolutionary processes involved in the origin of the Carpathian flora. Finally, the establishment of the Carpathian Research Network (CRN) provides an official framework for pooling, sharing and standardising scientific data on Carpathian endemics from different countries. The CRN is developing an online database of the distribution of selected species (The Carpathian Endemics Distribution Database, CEDD) including their intrinsic and extrinsic traits and current opinion on their taxonomic status. This will be used to produce a monograph on the Carpathians' endemic flora.

Patrick			Taxonomic similarity does not predict necessary sample size for ex situ conservation: a comparison among five genera	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Effectively conserving biodiversity with limited resources requires scientifically informed and efficient strategies. Guidance is particularly needed on how many living plants are necessary to conserve a threshold level of genetic diversity in ex situ collections. We investigated this question for 11 taxa across five genera. In this first study analysing and optimizing ex situ genetic diversity across multiple genera, we found that the percentage of extant genetic diversity currently conserved varies among taxa from 40% to 95%. Most taxa are well below genetic conservation targets. Resampling datasets showed that ideal collection sizes vary widely even within a genus: one taxon typically required at least 50% more individuals than another (though Quercus was an exception). Still, across taxa, the minimum collection size to achieve genetic conservation goals is within one order of magnitude. Current collections are also suboptimal: they could remain the same size yet capture twice the genetic diversity with an improved sampling design. We term this deficiency the 'genetic conservation gap'. Lastly, we show that minimum collection sizes are influenced by collection priorities regarding the genetic diversity target. In summary, current collections are insufficient (not reaching targets) and suboptimal (not efficiently designed), and we show how improvements can be made.

Aerial seed bank in a cold desert annual-ephemeral species: Role of anatomical structure of stem and delayed fruit dehiscence in timing of seed dispersal	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Why the fruits are retained on dead upright herbaceous plants and how this relates to seed dispersal and timing of germination remain unclear. Stems of the annual Euclidium syriacum (Brassicaceae) with infructescences bearing indehiscent silicles remain upright after plants die in the spring. We investigated the effect of anatomical structures of stem and pedicle and delayed silicle dehiscence on seed dispersal phenology of this species. For comparison, sections were made of the stem of the annual Goldbachia laevigata (Brassicaceae), which has stems that fall over when plants die. Compared to G. laevigata, the stem of E. syriacum has vascular bundles that are closer together, a thicker xylem and phloem, more fibers, a thicker perimedullary zone and a smaller pith diameter:stem diameter ratio. The thickened pedicle did not form an abcission layer. By late October, 5-20% of seeds were dispersed, depending on the position of infructescences on the plant. Snow covered the plants in late autumn and when it melted in mid-April many of the plants had fallen over, with a high number of seeds germinating in attached silicles; seedlings became rooted in soil. After snowmelt, 14-15% of the silicles on the remaining upright plants contained seeds; all seeds were dispersed by early July. The anatomical structures of the stem and pedicle plus the delayed dehiscence of silicles explain the presence of an aerial seed bank in E. syriacum and delay of germination of many of seeds until spring. Further, pieces of upright plants are broken off and dispersed by wind, which helps to explain the wide distribution of E. syriacum in the cold desert.																	0913-557X	1442-1984				OCT	2020	35	4					260	269		10.1111/1442-1984.12274		MAY 2020					WOS:000532549100001

The utilization of cover crops such as Trifolium subterraneum L. may represent an innovative and efficient option for low-input and organic agricultural systems. In a 3-year experiment, we evaluated the effect of T. subterraneum and spontaneous flora cover cropping, with or without burying dead mulch into the soil, on the quali-quantitative composition of the weed seed bank in an apricot orchard. Moreover, the bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea and Azotobacter vinelandii, involved in the soil N cycle, and the content of ammoniacal and nitric soil nitrogen were quantified. For the first time, we demonstrated that T. subterraneum cover cropping with the incorporation of dead mulches into the soil on the one hand reduced weed biodiversity and the seed bank size (- 70% compared to conventional management following the standard commercial practices), while, on the other hand, increased the amount of N. europaea (+ 109%), A. vinelandii (+ 145%), NH4+ (+ 137%) and NO3- (+ 478%) in the soil. This approach was therefore found to be a major improvement in low-input agriculture and organic farming, and it can be applied in Mediterranean orchards as an eco-friendly strategy with the aim of reducing synthetic herbicides for weed control and mineral nitrogen fertilizers as the sole source of nitrogen supply.

It may represent a useful source of proteins for food and animal feed, as well as bioactive components. Seed samples from 39 populations of V. ervilia have been analyzed. Polyphenol contents ranged from 0.09% to 0.19%. Luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin, and quercetin were the major aglycones. The total free amino acid content of the seeds was 0.05% to 0.19% in which canavanine represented 9% to 22%. The protein content was 24.1%. The amino acid composition indicated a high content in acidic amino acids and a deficit in sulphur amino acids. V. ervilia seeds proved to be a good substrate for the preparation of protein isolates. The seed extracts inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 colon tumor cells, simultaneously, exerting antioxidative effects. Hence, seeds of V. ervilia could represent a source of high-value food and feed components, as well as functional components. Practical applications Vicia ervilia (bitter vetch) (Leguminosae) is an ancient crop from the Mediterranean Region. Although it was still grown in many Mediterranean countries at the beginning of the twentieth century, other crops that provide higher and more consistent yield later replaced it. However, V. ervilia seeds may represent a useful source of proteins for human nutrition and animal feeding, and a source of bioactive components with health-promoting properties. Our results show that the seeds of V. ervilia could, indeed, represent a source of high-value food and feed components, as well as functional, health-promoting components. This may result in a revalorization of this neglected crop. The availability of numerous populations in seed banks guarantees the preservation of a genetic diversity in V. ervilia that could be used for the production of new varieties with better nutritional and functional characteristics.

Dormancy dampens the microbial distance-decay relationship	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Much of Earth's biodiversity has the capacity to engage in dormancy, a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. By increasing resilience to unfavourable conditions, dormancy leads to the accumulation of 'seed banks'. These reservoirs of genetic and phenotypic diversity should diminish the strength of environmental filtering and increase rates of dispersal. Although prevalent among single-celled organisms, evidence that dormancy influences patterns of microbial biogeography is lacking. We constructed geographical and environmental distance-decay relationships (DDRs) for the total (DNA) and active (RNA) portions of bacterial communities in a regional-scale 16S rRNA survey of forested ponds in Indiana, USA. As predicted, total communities harboured greater diversity and exhibited weaker DDRs than active communities. These observations were robust to random resampling and different community metrics. To evaluate the processes underlying the biogeographic patterns, we developed a platform of mechanistic models that used the geographical coordinates and environmental characteristics of our study system. Based on more than 10(6) simulations, our models approximated the empirical DDRs when there was strong environmental filtering along with the presence of long-lived seed banks. By contrast, the inclusion of dispersal generally decreased model performance. Together, our findings support recent theoretical predictions that seed banks can influence the biogeographic patterns of microbial communities. This article is part of the theme issue 'Conceptual challenges in microbial community ecology'.

Enhanced seed defenses potentially relax selection by seed predators against serotiny in lodgepole pine	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Serotiny, the retention of seeds in a canopy seed bank until high temperatures cause seeds to be released, is an important life history trait for many woody plants in fire-prone habitats. Serotiny provides a competitive advantage after fire but increases vulnerability to predispersal seed predation, due to the seeds being retained in clusters in predictable locations for extended periods. This creates opposing selection pressures. Serotiny is favored in areas of high fire frequency, but is selected against by predispersal seed predators. However, predation also selects for cone traits associated with seed defense that could reduce predation on serotinous cones and thereby relax selection against serotiny. This helps explain the elevated defenses in highly serotinous species. However, whether such interactions drive variation in seed defenses within variably serotinous populations has been studied rarely. We investigated the effects of phenotypic selection exerted by red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) predation on Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) seeds. Squirrels preferentially harvested cones with more and larger seeds, indicating a preference for a higher food reward. We found evidence for stronger selection on trees with serotinous cones, which presumably accounts for the elevated defenses of and lower predation on serotinous compared to non-serotinous cones. Lower levels of predation on serotinous cones in turn lessen selection against serotiny by squirrels. This has important implications because the frequency of serotiny in lodgepole pine has profound consequences for post-fire communities and ecosystems widespread in the Rocky Mountains.

In our previous studies, we found an association of the early flowering phenotype with the ACCase inhibitor herbicide resistance genotype in a population of Polypogon fugax. MADS-box transcription factors are known to play pivotal roles in regulating plant flowering time. In this study, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like gene, belonging to the StMADS11 subfamily in the MADS-box family, was cloned from the early flowering P. fugax population (referred to as PfMADS16) and resistant to the herbicide clodinafop- propargyl. Overexpression of the SVP-like gene PfMADS16 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in early flowering and seed abortion. This is consistent with the phenotypic characters of resistant P. fugax plants, but contrary to the conventional role of SVP-like genes that usually suppress flowering. In addition, down regulation of the seed formation gene AtKTN1 in flowers of PfMADS16 transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicates that PfMADS16 may be indirectly associated with seed viability. Furthermore, one protein (PfMADS2) from the APETALA1 (AP1) subfamily interacting with PfMADS16 in P. fugax was identified with relevance to flowering time regulation. These results suggest that the PfMADS16 gene is an early flowering regulation gene associated with seed formation and viability in resistant P. fugax population. Our study provides potential application of PfMADS16 for integrated weed management (such as genetic-based weed control strategies) aiming to reduce the soil weed seedbank.

J	Fenollosa, E; Jene, L; Munne-Bosch, S				Fenollosa, Erola; Jene, Laia; Munne-Bosch, Sergi			A rapid and sensitive method to assess seed longevity through accelerated aging in an invasive plant species	PLANT METHODS												Background Seed longevity and vigor assessment is crucial for efficient ex situ biodiversity conservation in genebanks but may also have potential applications for the understanding of ecological processes and in situ biodiversity conservation. In fact, one of the factors determining the persistence of invasive species, a main threat to global biodiversity, is the generation of soil seed banks where seeds may remain viable for several years. Artificial seed aging tests using high temperatures and high relative humidity have been described for seed longevity estimation but have been mainly optimized for species with commercial interest. Thus, the aim of the study is to define a rapid and sensitive method to assess seed longevity and vigor through accelerated aging in the worldwide distributed invasive species Carpobrotus edulis to provide tools to biodiversity managers to evaluate invasive potential and develop effective post-eradication plans. Results Slow seed deterioration rate was obtained when C. edulis seeds were subjected to common accelerated aging temperatures (43-45 degrees C). This contrasts with the rapid viability decay between 24-72 h when seeds were subjected to temperatures superior to 55 degrees C, a strong inflection point for this species' thermosensitivity. Relative humidity also played a role in defining seed survival curves, but only at high temperatures, speeding up the deterioration process. The selected aging conditions, 55 degrees C at 87% relative humidity were tested over two C. edulis populations and three measures were proposed to parametrize the differential sigmoidal seed survival curves, defining the seed resistance to deterioration (L-5, aging time where 95% of seeds maintain their viability), medium longevity (L-50, 50% of seeds lose their viability) and lethal aging time (L-95, 95% of viability loss). Conclusions An accelerated aging test at 55 degrees C and 87% relative humidity constitutes a rapid and sensitive method that can be performed within a working week, allowing managers to easily test seed vigor and longevity. This test may contribute to assess invasive potential, design effective monitoring programs and soil seed bank eradication treatments.				; Munne-Bosch, Sergi/N-3302-2014	Fenollosa, Erola/0000-0002-6189-2124; Munne-Bosch, Sergi/0000-0001-6523-6848													1746-4811				MAY 8	2020	16	1							64	10.1186/s13007-020-00607-3							WOS:000533403600001	32411273

New Zealand's Myrtaceae have received little attention in terms of ex situ conservation. In this study, we assessed the integrated ex situ conservation strategies for selected New Zealand Myrtaceae. We particularly investigated seed banking options by assessing seed desiccation tolerance, in vitro culture, pollen cryopreservation and zygotic embryo cryopreservation of the recalcitrant Syzygium maire. A desiccation trial was conducted on six Myrtaceae species: Lophomyrtus bullata, L. obcordata, Metrosideros diffusa, M. umbellata, M. bartlettii and Syzygium maire. S. maire seeds and embryos showed extreme sensitivity to desiccation confirming its recalcitrant behaviour. The seeds of the other species were desiccation tolerant i.e. orthodox. Zygotic embryos of S. maire were successfully cryopreserved using an encapsulation-dehydration technique. Pollen cryopreservation was successful for M. excelsa following desiccation to about 5% moisture content, rapid freezing and rapid thawing. For M. bartlettii, one of the most endangered and a nationally critical Myrtaceae species in New Zealand, we tested the efficacy of hand pollination in producing viable seeds. Our assessment confirmed that one of the M. bartlettii trees at Otari is self-incompatible, and successful hand pollination using pollen obtained from different genotypes growing in the gardens at the University of Auckland resulted in seed production with c. 20% germination. Tissue culture protocols were successfully developed for selected Myrtaceae. In addition, photoautotrophic micropropagation techniques were developed for the first time for L. scoparium. This paper highlights the importance of holistic conservation strategies to ensure future access to New Zealand's unique Myrtaceae germplasm as a key component of long-term management response to the threat posed by A. psidii.

Enhancement of palatable perennial grasses by disturbance and seed addition in degraded native grasslands of the dry pampas in Central Argentina	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Land use has changed the original composition of the natural grasslands in the dry pampas of central Argentina, to the detriment of palatable perennial grasses (PPG). Long-term elimination of anthropogenic disturbances has not been enough to effectively recover the PPG, which suggests that availability of seeds and/or habitats may be limiting their recruitment. Therefore, our objectives in a degraded grassland site were to assess: (1) the germinable soil seed bank and (2) changes in botanical composition after addition of PPG seed following canopy disturbance. In autumn 2015, we randomly selected 10-paired plots, measured the aboveground biomass and took soil samples to assess the germinable soil seed bank. Afterwards, we disturbed the resident vegetation in each paired plot and either added PPG seeds or left the plot without any seed addition as a control. We quantified the seedling density of seeded and spontaneous species in the spring of 2015 and 2016, and the aboveground biomass at the end of 2017. Annual grasses and forbs (AGFS) dominated the soil seed bank, while PPG and unpalatable perennial grasses (UPG) occurred at low seed density and richness. Addition of PPG seeds resulted in the successful establishment of one key seeded PPG (Poa ligularis). In the spring 2017, the aerial biomass of PPG was highest in the seeded plots, where P. ligularis accounted for 94%. Our results showed that PPG were poorly represented in the soil seed bank of the degraded grassland and that disturbance of the resident vegetation combined with PPG seed addition enabled successful recruitment of a key PPG. So, enhancement of the pastoral value of degraded dry pampas grasslands would be possible through disturbance of the resident vegetation and addition of PPG seed.

These researchers have the capacity to contribute to practical management solutions while also answering fundamental biological questions; however, scientific endeavors often fail to meet the perceived needs of practitioners involved in on-the-ground invasive plant management. One way that researchers have sought to bridge the gap between research and practice is by surveying managers to identify areas of study that are underexplored in invasion ecology. In this paper, we build on these efforts by reviewing the current state of knowledge and suggesting new directions for research in seven areas of plant invasion ecology that are highly relevant to management: seedbanks, dispersal and spread, life history, impacts, climate change, distribution, and succession. These topics were previously identified as urgent research priorities by land managers and are underrepresented in the invasion ecology literature. In addition to highlighting key knowledge gaps for these seven areas of research, we propose steps that academics can take to cultivate academic-practitioner relationships and remove barriers to conducting management-focused research, such as co-producing research questions with managers, addressing issues of working at management-appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and considering non-traditional funding and labor sources for long-term monitoring. Greater communication and collaborative selection of basic research questions will ensure that the goals of management and invasive species research remain aligned.

The Case ofSenecio morisii(Asteraceae), a Vascular Plant Exclusive to Sardinian Water Meadows	PLANTS-BASEL												Understanding seed viability under long-term storage conditions provides basic and useful information to investigate the effectiveness of seed banking. Besides the germination success, seedling establishment is also an important requirement, and a decisive step to ensure plant propagation. We used comparative data of germination, seedling growth, and survival percentage between fresh and 10-years-stored seeds ofSenecio morisii, a narrow endemic and vulnerable species of Sardinia (Italy), in order to evaluate if differences exist in these traits between fresh and 10-years-stored seeds. Stored seeds showed higher germination percentages than fresh ones, whereas seedling growth and survival did not present significant differences between them, except for seedling growth in plants produced from seeds germinated at 25 degrees C. This study allowed us to assess if seeds ofS. morisiiwere able to germinate under controlled conditions, and if they maintained their viability and germination capacity for at least 10 years of long-term storage in the seed bank. In addition, the high seedling survival detected in both fresh and stored seeds suggests that stored seeds ofS. morisiican be used to support reinforcement or reintroduction actions when fresh materials are not available.

The aim of this study was to assess the qualitative and quantitative changes in weed flora and soil seed bank under reduced tillage and no-till (direct sowing) in comparison with traditional ploughing. In the crop rotation: pea/rape-winter wheat-winter wheat the number and dry weight of weeds increased with the simplification of tillage. The seed bank was the largest under direct sowing and about three times smaller in traditional ploughing. Under direct sowing, most weed seeds were accumulated in the top soil layer 0-5 cm, while in the ploughing system most weed seeds occurred in deeper layers: 5-10 and 10-20 cm. In the reduced and no-till systems, a greater percentage of perennial and invasive species, such as Conyza canadensis L., was observed. The results show that it is possible to maintain weed infestation in the no-till system at a level that does not significantly affect winter wheat yield and does not pose a threat of perennial and invasive weeds when effective herbicide protection is applied.

Previous research demonstrated that fall cattle grazing has strong potential for reducing invasive annual grass species dominance in winter-dominated precipitation areas of the Intermountain West. Fall cattle grazing reduces the volume of safe sites through the removal of standing dead biomass in the fall and early winter, when cheatgrass can actively germinate. This study continued an assessment of cheatgrass seed bank characteristics under fall-grazing and grazing exclusion treatments initiated by a previous study. A seed bank assay was organized into a randomized complete block, repeated measure design to assess cheatgrass seed bank characteristics from 2014 to 2017 in central Nevada. Across years, fall-grazed areas had about half the assayed seed bank levels (3 432 +/- 2 513 seeds . m(-2)) of ungrazed areas (7 187 +/- 1 569), (P<0.0001). There was also a difference among years with 2015 producing higher assayed numbers in both grazing treatments. Combined plotted data from this and the previous study indicated that after several years of fall-grazing treatments, removal of fall cattle grazing for only 1 yr can result in significant increases in cheatgrass seed bank size. Conversely, reapplication of fall cattle grazing can quickly decrease cheatgrass seed bank potential. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Plant diversity of Holocene dune landscapes in the Cape Floristic Region: The legacy of Pleistocene sea-level dynamics	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Coastal dune landscapes are subject to harsh environmental conditions and, owing to Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, comprise small, fragmented features. These environments present several challenges for plant colonization and persistence, and dune floras are therefore likely to be species-poor but endemic-rich. Here, we explore an explicitly historical hypothesis - the Pleistocene disturbance hypothesis - to explain patterns of plant diversity on Holocene dunes of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). This hypothesis predicts that: (1) dunes would not show the west-east decline in diversity evident in inland habitats as the unique selective regime of the dune environment would override the evolutionary diversity patterns evident elsewhere in the CFR; (2) dune diversity would be lower than in adjacent, inland habitats that were not exposed to extreme disturbance regimes during the Pleistocene. We tested this by compiling regional-scale plant species diversity data from dune and interior lowland habitats of the southwestern and southeastern CFR and subjecting the data to species-area analysis. Our results were consistent with the Pleistocene disturbance hypothesis: diversity patterns of dunes did not differ between the southwestern and southeastern subregions, and interior sites were richer in species than dune sites. However, the difference in diversity between interior and dune sites (1.42 x ) was remarkably marginal. We propose that this is a consequence of the CFR's glacial physiography, where a large expanse of dune habitat was exposed at length along the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain during Pleistocene sea-level lowstands. This vast habitat area would have facilitated the development of a species-rich dune flora. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.				Cawthra, Hayley/AAA-4004-2021	Grobler, B.

Melilotus albus (Fabaceae) is considered valuable for honey production and is frequently cultivated as livestock forage. However, it is difficult to germinate M. albus seeds. The primary goal of the present study was to determine the environmental requirements for breaking seed dormancy and the dynamics of soil seed bank. The results indicate that seeds of M. albus have a water impermeable seed coat which can be penetrated by scarification or alternating wet heat and ice water cycles; however, wet heat or dry heat alone were ineffective. After receiving 30 cycles of alternating wet heat and ice water treatments, cracks formed in the lens of seeds. Under natural precipitation and temperature,> 60% of the seedlings emerged in spring. A persistent soil seed bank formed and most seeds were found in the 0-2 cm soil layer. Our findings indicate that seeds of M. albus have physical dormancy; persistence of the seed bank might spread risks associated with a specific seed cohort over multiple years.																	0367-2530	1618-0585				MAY	2020	266								151600	10.1016/j.flora.2020.151600							WOS:000535714500001

Chronosequence of former kaolinite open cast mines suggests active intervention is required for the restoration of Atlantic heathland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Atlantic lowland heath (ALH) is a priority conservation habitat in Western Europe, but restoration efforts have met with mixed success due to the complexity associated with replicating establishment conditions. By virtue of their impoverished, often acidic soils and geographic location in areas naturally occupied by ALH communities, former kaolinite mine sites may offer an excellent opportunity for heathland restoration. Using a chronosequence of former open cast kaolinite mines in South West England (0, 2, 27, and 150 years since mining ceased), we determined the ability of ALH vegetation and soils to reestablish naturally and in addition, for the three youngest sites, how the reinstatement of stored overburden affected heathland regeneration. Analysis of soil characteristics revealed major differences in the levels of acidity, organic content, and fertility between abandoned kaolinite sites and a nearby natural reference heath. Even 150 years after mining ceased, concentrations of all major soil nutrients and organic content were lower, and pH higher, than undisturbed ALH. The reinstatement of overburden did little to improve soil quality, since all former kaolinite sites were dominated by mesotrophic grasses, rather than species characteristic of the target ALH community. We conclude that to maximize the potential of former open cast kaolinite sites for ALH reestablishment, changes in pre- and postrestoration management are required. These include modification of how overburden is stockpiled, while the addition of organic material, microbial communities, and sulfur (to reduce soil pH) to reinstated overburden are likely also essential interventions to facilitate successful ALH establishment.

In grassland ecosystems, a few invertebrates that engineer soils have been identified as key species regulating soil nutrients and plant communities' diversity and dynamics. Here, we assessed the role of the harvester ant Messor barbanis, an ecological engineer, in a Mediterranean dry grassland under restoration by characterising its nest environment, particularly the soil and vegetation. We found profound differences in soil physical and chemical variables and plant community structure between nests and ant-free patches in the restored grassland. Messor barbarus has improved soil fertility, driven the seed bank towards the reference grassland and significantly increased plant biomass, species richness and micro-local-heterogeneity. As biological filters, M. barbarus has driven plant communities towards a new trajectory in the restored site. Ant patches are characterised by mesotrophic species, whereas ant-free patches are dominated by species characteristic of compacted soils. They have accelerated the ecological recovery of Mediterranean dry grassland plants by directly and indirectly facilitating their re-establishment. These results illustrate the potential key role of ants as ecological engineers for the conservation and restoration of Mediterranean grasslands.

In the first, we examined the recruitment of small and large saplings and trees into 31 gaps resulting from treefalls occurring between 1984 and 2015 in the 2.25-ha core area of a 4-ha tree plot at Cocha Cashu in Peru. In the second, we identified the tallest saplings recruiting into 69 gaps created during a violent wind storm in February 2000. In the established tree plot, we were able to compare the composition of saplings in the disturbance zones of gaps prior to, during, and subsequent to the period of gap formation. Recruitment in gaps was compared with that in "nofall" zones, areas within the plot that had not experienced a treefall at least since the early 1980s. Our results confirmed earlier findings that a consistently high proportion (~60%) of established saplings survived gap formation. Light demanding species, as proxied by mortality rates, recruited under all conditions, but preferentially during periods of gap formation, a pattern that was especially strong among gap pioneers. Similar results were noted, separately, for small and large saplings and trees recruiting at >= 10 cm dbh. One hundred percent of previously untagged trees recruiting into gaps in the first post-disturbance census were gap pioneers, suggesting rapid development. This conclusion was strongly supported in a follow-up survey taken of 69 gaps 19 months after they had been synchronously created in a wind storm. Ten species of gap pioneers, eight of which are not normally present in the advance regeneration, had attained heights of 6-10 m in 19 months. The 10 gap pioneers were dispersed, variously, by primates, bats, birds, and wind and reached maximum frequency in different-sized gaps (range 1,000 m(2)). Both gap size and limited dispersal of zoochorous species into gaps serve as filters for establishment, creating a complex mosaic of conditions that enhances species diversity.

Time of wild oat (Avena fatua) panicle clipping influences seed viability	WEED SCIENCE												Wild oat (Avena fatua L.) is one of the most problematic weed species in western Canada due to widespread populations, herbicide resistance, and seed dormancy. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and especially in shorter crops such as lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), A. fatua seed panicles elongate above the crop canopy, which can facilitate physical cutting of the panicles (clipping) to reduce viable seed return to the seedbank. However, the viability of A. fatua seed at the time of panicle elongation is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the viability of A. fatua seed at successive time intervals after elongation above a wheat or lentil crop canopy. A 2-yr panicle clipping and removal study in wheat and lentil was conducted in Lacombe, AB, and Saskatoon, SK, in 2015 and 2016 to determine the onset of viability in A. fatua seeds at successive clipping intervals. Manual panicle clipping of A. fatua panicles above each crop canopy began when the majority of panicles were visible above respective crop canopies and continued weekly until seed shed began. At the initiation of panicle clipping, A. fatua seed viability was between 0% and 10%. By the last clipping treatment (approximately 6 to 7 wk after elongation), 95% of the A. fatua seeds were viable. Seed moisture and awn angle were not good predictors of A. fatua viability, and therefore were unlikely to provide effective tools to estimate appropriate timing for implementation of A. fatua clipping as a management technique. Based on A. fatua seed viability, earlier clipping of A. fatua is likely to be more effective in terms of population management and easier to implement in shorter crops such as lentil. Investigations into long-term effects of clipping on A. fatua populations are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this management strategy on A. fatua.

However, the utility of the sediment seed bank as a passive riparian regeneration option is poorly understood. After modelling a range of flows for field-surveyed cross sections, a glasshouse seedling emergence experiment was undertaken to compare the effects of simulated flow duration on seedling emergence of desirable riparian species that occur on benches of the gravel-bedded Hunter River near Muswellbrook, New South Wales. The duration of inundation did have an effect (although not always significant) on seed germination for most species. The most successful simulated flood conditions differed among species, with the control treatment (no inundation) resulting in the most germination for only two of the 10 species examined. These findings suggest that although environmental flows for the sole purpose of stimulating the riparian seed bank in order to facilitate regeneration of desirable riparian species would be largely ineffective and complicated by differing inundation responses among species, seed bank stimulation using environmental flows could be a value-added benefit from flows allocated for other purposes. As such, consideration of flow duration is worthy of inclusion in environmental flow allocation planning.				; Leishman, Michelle/G-9726-2012	Fryirs, Kirstie/0000-0003-0541-3384; Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797												1535-1459	1535-1467				MAY	2020	36	4			SI		607	619		10.1002/rra.3376							WOS:000530042100009

Post-windthrow salvage logging increases seedling and understory diversity with little impact on composition immediately after logging	NEW FORESTS												Salvage logging after forest disturbances is a controversial but common practice, yet it remains relatively poorly studied, particularly after windstorms within deciduous forests. Here, we present results from the first growing season following salvage logging on four gaps (3.5-6 ha) created by a 2012 tornado. While salvage logging shifted the distribution of stem heights to smaller sizes, it increased woody species seedling diversity by 33% and total plant richness and diversity by 20%. Salvaging did not alter or homogenize community composition. These short-term differences in richness and diversity were partly driven by a more even distribution of seedlings among species and increased species recruitment from the seed bank after salvaging. Overall, the initial impacts of salvage operations in a mixed deciduous forest redirected forest regeneration towards a more diverse community with a wider pool of species.

Impacts of fire cues on germination of Brassica napus L. seeds with high and low secondary dormancy	PLANT BIOLOGY												Agricultural burning is used in farm management operations; however, information about the impact of fire cues on the release and/or induction of secondary dormancy in crop seeds is scarce. Seeds from two oilseed rape cultivars were induced for high (HD) or low (LD) secondary dormancy using polyethyleneglycol (PEG) pre-treatment, and their germination after exposure to various fire cues was compared to control PEG pre-treated and non-dormant seeds. Non-dormant seed germination was unaffected by various fire cues. Low doses of aerosol smoke released secondary dormancy in HD seeds, while higher doses increased dormancy of LD seeds. Dilute smoke water also released HD seed secondary dormancy, but concentrated smke water enhanced dormancy in both LD and HD seeds. The concentrated aqueous extracts from charred oilseed rape straw only promoted germination of HD seeds, while dilution inhibited LD seed germination. Heat shock (80 degrees C, 5 min) released secondary dormancy in HD seeds; however, higher temperatures and/or increased exposure time was associated with seed death. GC-MS analyses of smoke water revealed two butenolides and an array of monoaromatic hydroxybenzene compounds with potential germination inhibitor or promoter activity. The extent of secondary dormancy induction in seeds affects their subsequent responses to fire cues. Both aerosol smoke and smoke water have both germination promoter and inhibitor activity. Lacking any butenolides, aqueous extracts of charred straw contain a potential germination stimulating steroid, i.e. ergosterol. The significance of fire-derived cues on behaviour of oilseed rape seeds in the soil seed bank is discussed.

Unusually high-quality soil seed banks in a Midwestern US oak savanna region: variation with land use history, habitat restoration, and soil properties	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												An overarching conclusion in the literature is that soil seed banks rarely contain many restoration-target species and are often liabilities rather than assets to restoration. Our objective was to evaluate composition and spatial variation of seed banks and their potential contributions to restoration, including restoration-target species such as rare species and those characterizing historical habitats. On 64 sites in a Midwestern U.S. oak savanna landscape, we sampled soil seed banks in seven habitat types (restored oak savannas, oak woodlands, and mesic prairies; unmanaged upland oak and mesic forests; and unmanaged and managed pine plantations). The germinable seed bank was exceptionally rich in restoration-target species. In total for the 64 sites, seedlings of 127 species emerged from seed bank samples. Of the 101 native species, 56 were restoration-target species, an unusually high number among seed bank studies. Restoration-target species in seed banks included 13 threatened or endangered species, in addition to 43 other specialist species associated with high-quality native habitats or on a floral list thought to characterize historical ecosystems. When analyzed across the 64-site gradient, seed banks differed among the seven habitat types and varied with historical (1939) land use, recent management activities that restored open-structured habitats, and biophysical gradients of tree density, soil drainage, and soil texture. While not all restoration-target species were detected in the seed bank, the unusually high-quality seed bank is a potential asset to restoration and was partly structured along environmental gradients across the landscape.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2020	28	5					1100	1112		10.1111/rec.13164		APR 2020					WOS:000529659900001

A case-study from Western Guatemala	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY												Community seed banks (CSBs) are initiatives to support the conservation and use of diverse crops though locally rooted collective action. The impact of CSBs is assumed to be complex, but has not been investigated in detail. Our study addresses this gap by analysing the impact of CSBs using social-ecological resilience as theoretical framework. We focus on the western highlands of Guatemala where CSBs have been implemented since 2009. We used qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection and analysis, including focus groups, participatory workshops, and structured and semi-structured interviews conducted in the local communities with CSB members and non-members. Our results indicate that CSBs contributed to increased seed exchanges, improved access to novel crop diversity, more saving of traditional varieties, and greater information and knowledge access, use and exchange. These effects strengthened the social-ecological resilience of the local communities. The scope of action of the CSBs, however, was constrained by wider socio-economic trends, including social divisions, out-migration of youth, and a change in livelihood strategies. We conclude that for CSBs to effectively strengthen social-ecological resilience in the future, they should be continuously adapted to the local context. Conceptually, our findings call for the further evolution of the CSB concept.

J	Vieira, MD; Overbeck, GE				Vieira, Mariana de Souza; Overbeck, Gerhard Ernst			Small seed bank in grasslands and tree plantations in former grassland sites in the South Brazilian highlands	BIOTROPICA												The soil seed bank can be an important source for vegetation regeneration, and data on the similarity between aboveground vegetation and the seed bank can provide information about successional pathways after disturbances or land-use change. We conducted this study in natural grasslands in the subtropical highland region in southern Brazil. We evaluated the effect of silviculture on richness, density, and composition of the seed bank at former grassland sites converted to pine plantations 25 years ago. We worked at six grassland sites and three pine plantation sites and used the seedling emergence method. Seed bank density and richness in grasslands were lower than those reported in similar environments in other regions. Species richness and density varied considerably within each vegetation type; therefore, richness and density were not statistically significant, while composition varied among vegetation types. In terms of species, the pine plantation seed bank was a small subset of the grassland seed bank. Seeds of typical grassland species were missing in the pine plantation, but also had only low abundances in the grassland, and similarity of seed bank and vegetation were low (less than 20%). The low seed density found in this study, including in grasslands areas, indicates that regeneration of species from the soil seed bank likely is of a limited role for the maintenance of plant populations after disturbances in this system. Our data further suggest that natural regeneration after tree planting in grasslands is reduced due to seed limitation. in Portuguese is available with online material				Overbeck, Gerhard/D-8695-2013	Overbeck, Gerhard/0000-0002-8716-5136												0006-3606	1744-7429				JUL	2020	52	4					775	782		10.1111/btp.12785		APR 2020					WOS:000527232600001

Complementarity in nurse plant systems: soil drives community composition while microclimate enhances productivity and diversity	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Nurse plants facilitate the establishment of other species under their canopies through improvement of microclimate and soil conditions beneath their canopies. We aimed to test whether the effect of nurse soil on understorey communities was independent of the canopy effect, and to what extent soil properties (i.e., nutrients, pH, moisture, temperature, aggregates) can predict understorey biomass and diversity. Methods In a field experiment, we extracted three soil blocks (20 x 20 x 15 cm) under the canopy of eighteen Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs --grouped into small, medium, and large canopy sizes (n = 6). Soil blocks were distributed in a stratified-random design, so that each shrub received back three soil blocks (one from under each Retama canopy size). At the end of the growing season plant biomass, abundance, diversity and soil properties were recorded. Results Canopy and soil independently affected understorey community structure. Biomass and diversity increased under large Retama canopies irrespective of soil origin, whereas biomass was higher -and plant diversity lower- in soils from large Retama shrubs irrespective of canopy size. Biomass and species abundance were influenced more by soil than by canopy. There was, however, complementarity between these factors, as biomass increased in soils with high moisture and low temperature, while diversity was highly influenced by canopy size. Conclusions Soil, rather than microclimate amelioration by the nurse, was the main driver of understorey community structure, soil moisture playing a pivotal role. This is highly relevant as drought is expected to increase in drylands worldwide.

Jasper; Mahy, Gregory			Topsoil translocation in extensively managed arable field margins promotes plant species richness and threatened arable plant species	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Since the 1950s, agriculture has intensified drastically, which has led to a significant biodiversity decline on arable lands. This decline was especially dramatic for segetal plant species, the specialist species of cereal fields. Due to the low population density and poor dispersal abilities of many segetal species, the recovery of species-rich fields may fail even though the environmental conditions are suitable. Therefore, conservation efforts including active restoration measures aimed at recovering segetal vegetation are needed. To this purpose, we propose to alleviate dispersal limitation by means of topsoil translocation from a species-rich donor arable field. At two receiver sites, we tested this technique using two topsoil-spreading densities, i.e. 2.5L(soil)/m(2) and 5L(soil)/m(2) in experimental plots (3 m(2)). At one receiver site, we tested the impact of topsoil translocation from two different donor sites, while in the other receiver site one donor site was used. We compared plant species diversity and composition of treated plots with control plots as well as with the species composition of the donor sites (field survey) and their seed bank (greenhouse survey). Species richness was increased by topsoil spreading, including richness of threatened species. 33% and 71% of the threatened species were successfully translocated respectively at the two receiver sites. At one site, plant cover was also increased, including threatened species cover. Conversely, topsoil spreading did not promote pernicious species that could affect fanner acceptance negatively. Vegetation of translocated plots was more similar in terms of species composition to donor site seed banks than to donor site field survey. The higher spreading density led to increased species richness when seed bank in topsoil had lower density. Our results show that topsoil translocation can be a highly effective method for restoring threatened segetal plant communities in agricultural landscapes. Even when a full plant community was already present (Receiver 1) topsoil transfer led to a doubling in species richness. The seed bank surveys were a good indicator of plant community composition upon topsoil translocation in the field and are therefore advisable to implement in the project-planning phase to evaluate donor site potential. From our results, we recommend to spread soil at an overall rate of 500 seeds/m(2) equivalent. Future studies need to assess the long-term fate of the translocated species as well as the impacts of soil harvests on the donor sites to establish sustainable use levels.

J	Dong, HG; Liu, T; Liu, ZQ; Song, ZL				Dong, Hegan; Liu, Tong; Liu, Zhongquan; Song, Zhanli			Fate of the soil seed bank of giant ragweed and its significance in preventing and controlling its invasion in grasslands	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida, L. henceforth referred to as GR), an annual non-native invasive weed, may cause health problems and can reduce agricultural productivity. Chemical control of GR in grasslands may have irreversible side effects on herbs and livestock. In an attempt to propose a solution to the harmful effects of GR on grasslands, this study explores the fate of its soil seed bank (SSB) and considers the physical control of its SSB reduction. By studying GR distributed in grasslands of the Yili Valley, Xinjiang, China, we measured the spatial and temporal changes in seed density, seed germination, dormancy, and death. We analyzed seed germination, dormancy, and death following different storage periods. The study analyzed population characteristics over time, including seed fate, and examined physical control methods for reducing the SSB density. The SSB of GR occurs in the upper 0-15 cm of soil in grasslands. Seed density in the SSB decreased by 68.1% to 82.01% from the reproductive growth period to the senescence period. More than 98.7% of the seeds were rotten, eaten, germinated, dispersed, or died within one year after being produced. The seed germination rate of the SSB decreased with the number of years after invasion. When stored for 0.5 or 3.5 years, seed germination rates fell by 40%, during which time seed death rate increased by almost 40%. When GR was completely eradicated for two consecutive years, the SSB and population densities decreased by >99%. The vast majority of GR seeds germinated or died within one year; the germination rate decreased significantly if the seeds were stored dry at room temperature for a long time. Newly produced seeds are the main source of seeds in the SSB. Therefore, thoroughly eradicating GR plants for several years before the seeds can mature provides an effective control method in grasslands.																	2045-7758					JUN	2020	10	11					4854	4866		10.1002/ece3.6238		APR 2020					WOS:000526008500001	32551066

Lasting signature of planting year weather on restored grasslands	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Ecological restoration - the rebuilding of damaged or destroyed ecosystems - is a critical component of conservation efforts, but is hindered by inconsistent, unpredictable outcomes. We investigated a source of this variation that is anecdotally suggested by practitioners, but for which empirical evidence is rare: the weather conditions during the first growing season after planting. The idea of whether natural communities face long-term consequences from conditions even many years in the past, called historical contingency, is a debated idea in ecological research. Using a large dataset (83 sites) across a wide geographic distribution (three states), we find evidence that precipitation and temperatures in the planting year (2-19 years before present) affected the relative dominance of the sown (native target species) and non-sown (mostly non-native) species. We find strong support for lasting planting year weather effects in restored tallgrass prairies, thereby supporting the historically contingent model of community assembly in a real-world setting.

Eryngium sparganophyllum (Apiaceae) is a globally critically endangered plant species endemic to cienega wetlands of southwest North America. To support in situ and ex situ conservation efforts of E. sparganophyllum, we asked (i) howdoes the embryo: seed (E:S) ratio change over time once imbibed, (ii) howdoes germination respond with varying periods of exposure to cold (5 degrees C) and warm (25 degrees C) stratification, and concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA(3)). By answering these questions, (iii) can dormancy class be inferred, and (iv) what storage behaviour category is exhibited? To answer these questions, we collected seeds in Southern Arizona from one of the few remaining wild populations. We measured embryo growth and tested the effects of cold (0-18 weeks) and warm (0 and 4 weeks) stratification, and 0-1000ppmgibberellic acid on germination. We also tested the effects of cold (-80 degrees C) dry (similar to 20% equilibrium relative humidity) storage on germination. We found that (i) embryos grow inside seeds prior to germination; (ii) compared to control, cold stratification for at least 6 weeks increased germination and warm stratification had no effect; (iii) 1000-ppm GA(3) had the highest germination success; (iv) therefore this species exhibits morphophysiological dormancy; and (v) seeds are orthodox and can therefore be conserved using conventional storage methods. This information will aid managers in the propagation of E. sparganophyllum that is crucial for in situ reintroduction and restoration projects, and seed banking represents a critical ex situ conservation strategy for the preservation of this species.																	2051-1434					APR 4	2020	8								coaa017	10.1093/conphys/coaa017							WOS:000527699500001	32274064

Topsoil disturbance reshapes diaspore interactions with ground-foraging animals in a megadiverse grassland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Anthropogenic disturbances are known to be followed by extremely poor recovery in edaphic grasslands. However, the role of interactions with diaspore predators and secondary dispersers, which compose the dispersal filter and modulate plant community recovery, has been overlooked. We performed field experiments to investigate how soil disturbances affect diaspore interactions with the ground-foraging fauna to better understand how disturbance influences regeneration potential. Location Campo rupestre vegetation, megadiverse edaphic grasslands, southeastern Brazil. Methods We used diaspores from five native species to compare removal rates between disturbed (top soil removal) and preserved sites; we also controlled invertebrate and vertebrate access to determine their role. In addition, we assessed differences in the diaspore removal effectiveness (DRE) and the structure of animal-diaspore interactions through network based-approach. Results For three species, the average diaspore removal rates was relatively high (between 30% and 70%). Invertebrates were the most common removal agents in both disturbed and preserved sites. Interactions with foraging fauna and removal rates were 20% smaller in disturbed sites. Considering all diaspore removal events in disturbed sites, 24% resulted in the displacement from disturbed to preserved sites, but no diaspore was transported from preserved to disturbed ones. The animal-diaspore network was exclusively composed by ant-diaspore interactions and was more diverse and robust in preserved sites compared with disturbed ones. Seed predator ants (Pheidole and Dorymyrmex) were more common in disturbed sites. Furthermore, significant differences were found in the DRE between ant species and site types, suggesting specificity in the provision of dispersal services. Conclusions Topsoil removal affected removal proportions, DRE and ant-diaspore interaction network structure. The lack of diaspore dispersal towards disturbed sites indicates that soil removal affects secondary seed removal dynamics, impeding recovery potential. Disturbance negatively affected diaspore fate by reshaping interactions with ground-foraging secondary seed dispersers and predators, constraining the development of seed bank and thus impacting upon vegetation dynamics and resilience.

With the aim of investigating the phytoplankton assemblage structure in relation to environmental drivers and human pressures, we analyzed resting stages of diatoms and dinoflagellates, including harmful algal bloom taxa, in the surface sediments of 3 Mediterranean regional areas. Abundance of resting stages was determined by molecular quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Multivariate data analysis confirmed that the abundance of resting-stage assemblages seemed related to depth. Regional differences in the composition of the resting-stage assemblages were evident and environmental drivers were correlated with those regional differences. Three main groups of samples were defined according to SST and depth thresholds. Samples from the northern and central Adriatic Sea (average SST < 18 degrees C) formed the richest assemblages, both in terms of abundance and species richness, while deep samples from all other basins (depth > 368 m) were poorer and less diverse than those from shallower sites (depth <= 368 m). Resting-stage taxa contributed differently to the 3 groups. Diatom spores and dinoflagellate cysts were the most abundant taxa, but Alexandrium minutum cysts and Ditylum brightwellii spores also accounted for a large share of the overall inter-group compositional distance. The structure of resting-stage assemblages can be regarded as a time- and space-integrated response of a subset of phytoplankton species to environmental conditions, including the physical oceanographic dynamics that favor or prevent sedimentation of resting stages.

A community biodiversity management approach was explored in this study as a means to reinforce the cultivation of these crops by increasing farmers' access to intraspecific diversity and developing capacities of community institutions for their management. The research involved six communities in Segou and Sikasso regions. Multiple varieties of fonio (10-12) and Bambara groundnut (8-12) were established in diversity fields in each site over 2 years where farmers engaged in experiential learning over the crop cycle. Significant adoption of fonio and Bambara groundnut was detected in several study sites. The precise drivers of adoption cannot be definitively determined but likely include increased seed access and awareness gained through the diversity field fora, seed fairs and community seed banks. No significant yield advantage was detected for any of the varieties in the diversity fields, which showed variable performance by site and year. The number of varieties registered and managed by community seed banks in each site increased from 1-5 varieties of each crop to 11-12 varieties following the interventions. The number of Bambara groundnut varieties cultivated in farmers' fields also increased, while there was evidence of a slight decline in fonio diversity in some communities. The results of this study can inform efforts to strengthen seed systems and cultivation of neglected and underutilized species in Africa.																	1479-2621	1479-263X				APR	2020	18	2					31	48	PII S1479262120000076	10.1017/S1479262120000076							WOS:000577615600001						
J	Wyatt, R				Wyatt, Robert			Corydalis flavula and Nemophila aphylla in Georgia: Ecological observations	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Following removal of thickets of the invasive nonnative Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour.), two rare winter annuals, Corydalis flavula (Raf.) DC and Nemophila aphylla (L.) Brummitt, appeared at sites where they were previously unknown. Moreover, these sites in Clarke County were more than 100 km from the few previously known localities of the species in Georgia. Soil samples revealed that these sites were strongly divergent from typical secondary forests of the Piedmont with respect to pH, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium (all significantly higher). It is possible, but unlikely, that these species were recently transported to these sites. It seems more likely that recent management activities stimulated seeds to emerge from a dormant seed bank.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				APR-JUN	2020	147	2					185	189		10.3159/TORREY-D-19-00045.1							WOS:000562125400006

We analyzed SSB richness and density in a subtropical grassland in southern Brazil with different forage offers (low, intermediate, high and very high), that is, contrasting grazing intensities. The SSB was evaluated by the seedling emergence method. We collected ten SSB samples at two Layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm) in spring and autumn in each of grazing intensity treatments. We surveyed the established vegetation to assess its similarity with the SSB. Treatment effects were analyzed by Poisson regression while compositional differences were visualized by ordination. We found 103 species in the SSB, of which 71 were also found in established vegetation. We found a positive correlation between SSB density and grazing intensity. High grazing intensity influences patterns of composition and dominance in the SSB, while no strong differences were found among the other treatments. The SSB was characterized by low participation of dominant grasses in the vegetation and the dominance of ruderal species, indicating that recovery from the SSB after total removal of vegetation (severe disturbance) may be limited in grasslands in the region.

However, all statistical methods to date rely on a mathematical model built upon characteristics of hominid species. Namely, this model ignores specific ecological traits common to many plant, invertebrate, or fungal species such as self-fertilization and dormancy. The latter is defined as the ability of plant seeds or invertebrates to remain dormant for long periods of time in the soil or sediments. Here we develop a new statistical method which uses several whole genome sequence data per population/species to simultaneously infer 1) the rates of dormancy and of self-fertilization, and 2) past demographic history. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method using extensive simulations. We also apply our method to Arabidopsis thaliana confirming a high rate of selfing and the absence of long term seed dormancy, and to Daphnia Pulex demonstrating a long lived egg bank. We discuss the wide applicability of our method to draw accurate inference of past evolution for non-hominid species. Several methods based on the Sequential Markovian coalescence (SMC) have been developed that make use of genome sequence data to uncover population demographic history, which is of interest in its own right and is a key requirement to generate a null model for selection tests. While these methods can be applied to all possible kind of species, the underlying assumptions are sexual reproduction in each generation and non-overlapping generations. However, in many plants, invertebrates, fungi and other taxa, those assumptions are often violated due to different ecological and life history traits, such as self-fertilization or long term dormant structures (seed or egg-banking). We develop a novel SMC-based method to infer 1) the rates/parameters of dormancy and of self-fertilization, and 2) the populations' past demographic history. Using simulated data sets, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method for a wide range of demographic scenarios and for sequence lengths from one to 30 Mb using four sampled genomes. Finally, we apply our method to a Swedish and a German population of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrating a selfing rate of ca. 0.87 and the absence of any detectable seed-bank. In contrast, we show that the water flea Daphnia pulex exhibits a long lived egg-bank of three to 18 generations. In conclusion, we here present a novel method to infer accurate demographies and life-history traits for species with selfing and/or seed/egg-banks. Finally, we provide recommendations for the use of SMC-based methods for non-model organisms, highlighting the importance of the per site and the effective ratios of recombination over mutation.

About 10 years after the first record of P. stratiotes, the number, abundance and biomass of indigenous and non-indigenous macrophytes as well as different abiotic parameters were measured. In that period, colonized sections (similar to 94% of the oxbow lake) were completely covered with water lettuce, and the only reservoirs of indigenous macrophyte species were the non-colonized areas (6%). Research in 2011 found only a third of the previously recorded indigenous macrophytes, but then only in small section without P stratiotes. Three of the species that disappeared were on the Red data list. In the colonized section a higher biomass was observed than in the non-colonized section because of high abundance of water lettuce which remained the only macrophyte. Due to the presence of P stratiotes, the intensity of light penetrating into the depth and water circulation were reduced, as was the oxygen saturation of the water. In addition to the well documented vegetative propagation of P. stratiotes, a well-established and viable seed bank has been detected in the lake sediment and after winter floods also on lake banks. In the future, special attention should be given to the thermal water ecosystems in temperate climates since they can serve as stepping stones and recruitment centres for the establishment and spread of (sub-)tropical invasive species. Facing predicted climate change such local populations of invasive species can act as stepping stones for further dispersal.																	0365-0588	1847-8476				APR	2020	79	1					35	42		10.37427/botcro-2020-009							WOS:000551004600007

Considering strong variation in seed bank richness and density in these environments, this study aims to evaluate the spatial variation of seed bank in an area of Caatinga, in northeastern Brazil, determining its floristic composition and germination density. The selected area was a temporary lagoon in the Cariri region of Paraiba state, with highly anthropized vegetation, due to various uses over time. At each cardinal point, taking the center of the lagoon as a reference, soil samples were taken from the seed bank. All material collected was distributed in plastic trays and irrigated daily. The determination of seed density in the soil bank was performed by the seedling emergence method and expressed in seeds.m-(2). The flora of the Caatinga soil seed bank was represented in this study by 26 species and three morphospecies, distributed in 11 families and 26 genera, among them the Poaceae and Asteraceae families with the largest number of species. The main life form of the seed bank was herbaceous and the average density of the study area was 2,942 seeds.m-2 (lagoon) and 3,826 seeds.m-2 (in the surroundings) and after water stress was 732 seeds.m-2 and 1,208 seeds.m-2, in and around the lagoon areas, respectively. The area surrounding the lagoon has the highest plant density per m(2) and the highest diversity of species. In addition, the northern direction in both areas presented lower seed density.

Impact of forest fire on soil seed bank composition in Himalayan Chir pine forest	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims To explain how plant community copes with a recurring anthropogenic forest fire in Himalayan Chir pine forest, it is important to understand their postfire regeneration strategies. The primary aim of the study was to know: (i) how fire impact soil seed bank composition and (ii) how much soil seed bank composition differs with standing vegetation after the forest fire. Methods Soil samples were collected from burned and adjoining unburned sites in blocks using three layers down to 9 cm depth immediately after a forest fire and incubated in the net-house for seedling emergence. Same sites were revisited during late monsoon/early autumn season to know the species composition of standing vegetation recovered after a forest fire. Important Findings Soil contained viable seeds of >70 species. The average seed bank density was 8417 and 14 217 seeds/m(2) in the burned and unburned site, respectively. In both sites, it decreased with increasing soil depth. Overall fire had no significant impact on seed density; however, taking individual layers into consideration, fire had a significant impact on seed density only in the uppermost soil layer. The species richness of soil seed bank and standing vegetation was 73 and 100, respectively (with 35 shared species), resulting in a similarity of about 40%. In contrast, >80% species in soil seed bank was found similar between burned and unburned sites. Further, there were no significant differences in species richness of standing vegetation in burned (87 spp.) and unburned (78 spp.) sites. Our results showed that fire had an insignificant impact on soil seed bank composition and restoration potential of a plant species from seeds. The understory herb and shrub plant community's ability to form a fire-resistant viable soil seed bank and capable to recover in the postfire rainy season, explains how they reduce the risk of recurring fire damage in maintaining their population.

This crop belongs to the large Solanaceae family, which, among more than 90 genera and 2500 species of flowering plants, includes commercially important vegetables such as tomato and eggplant. The genus includes over 30 species, five of which (C. annuum, C. frutescens, C. chinense, C. baccatum, and C. pubescens) are domesticated and mainly grown for consumption as food and for non-food purposes (e.g., cosmetics). The main challenges for vegetable crop improvement are linked to the sustainable development of agriculture, food security, the growing consumers' demand for food. Furthermore, demographic trends and changes to climate require more efficient use of plant genetic resources in breeding programs. Increases in pepper consumption have been observed in the past 20 years, and for maintaining this trend, the development of new resistant and high yielding varieties is demanded. The range of pathogens afflicting peppers is very broad and includes fungi, viruses, bacteria, and insects. In this context, the large number of accessions of domesticated and wild species stored in the world seed banks represents a valuable resource for breeding in order to transfer traits related to resistance mechanisms to various biotic stresses. In the present review, we report comprehensive information on sources of resistance to a broad range of pathogens in pepper, revisiting the classical genetic studies and showing the contribution of genomics for the understanding of the molecular basis of resistance.

DSSs can select the appropriate herbicides for a given field and suggest the minimum dose rates for an herbicide application that can result in optimum weed control. Given that the adoption of DSSs may lead to decreased herbicide inputs in crop production, their potential for creating eco-friendly and profitable weed management strategies is obvious and desirable for the re-designing of farming systems on a more sustainable basis. Nevertheless, it is difficult to stimulate farmers to use DSSs as it has been noticed that farmers have different expectations of decision-making tools depending on their farming styles and usual practices. The function of DSSs requires accurate assessments of weeds within a field as input data; however, capturing the data can be problematic. The development of future DSSs should target to enhance weed management tactics which are less reliant on herbicides. DSSs should also provide information regarding weed seedbank dynamics in the soil in order to suggest management options not only within a single period but also in a rotational view. More aspects ought to be taken into account and further research is needed in order to optimize the practical use of DSSs for supporting farmers regarding weed management issues in various crops and under various soil and climatic conditions.

Weed Seed Bank Diversity in Dryland Cereal Fields: Does it Differ Along the Field and Between Fields with Different Landscape Structure?	AGRONOMY-BASEL												In this work, we aimed to test whether taxonomic diversity and functional diversity and the values of functional traits of the weed seed bank varied across the field, from margins to the core, and between fields embedded in distinct landscape structures. We sampled the seed bank of 47 conventionally managed cereal fields from two Mediterranean regions in Spain. In each field, three positions were selected: Margin, edge and core, and soil properties were measured for each position. Landscape structure was quantified for each field as the percentage of arable land in the surrounding 1 km radius circular sector. Seed bank diversity was characterized at the taxonomic (species richness, exponential Shannon index, and evenness) and functional levels (Rao's quadratic entropy index and four corner analysis). For functional diversity, eight functional traits related to the whole plant life cycle were considered. Results showed a slight response of increasing taxonomic diversity from the core of the fields to the margins. Functional diversity was extremely low, indicating high similarity among species in terms of functional traits. Species in the seed bank were mostly therophytes, shorter than the crop plants, small seeded, flowering between the herbicide application of late winter and crop harvest, and showed seed dispersal by gravity or wind. This trait syndrome allows persistence in intensively managed arable lands. The similarity between fields in terms of functional diversity of the seed bank and in species traits may suggest that the intensity of management practices was similar across the fields. Moreover, it emphasizes that an increase in landscape heterogeneity, if based on other intensively managed cropping systems, may not be sufficient to augment functional diversity of weed communities. Therefore, in these areas, the seed bank could restore weed taxonomic diversity following changes in management practices, but functional diversity would still remain limited.

J	Scavo, A; Mauromicale, G				Scavo, Aurelio; Mauromicale, Giovanni			Integrated Weed Management in Herbaceous Field Crops	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Current awareness about the environmental impact of intensive agriculture, mainly pesticides and herbicides, has driven the research community and the government institutions to program and develop new eco-friendly agronomic practices for pest control. In this scenario, integrated pest management and integrated weed management (IWM) have become mandatory. Weeds are commonly recognized as the most important biotic factor affecting crop production, especially in organic farming and low-input agriculture. In herbaceous field crops, comprising a wide diversity of plant species playing a significant economic importance, a compendium of the specific IWM systems is missing, that, on the contrary, have been developed for single species. The main goal of this review is to fill such gap by discussing the general principles and basic aspects of IWM to develop the most appropriate strategy for herbaceous field crops. In particular, a 4-step approach is proposed: (i) prevention, based on the management of the soil seedbank and the improvement of the crop competitiveness against weeds, (ii) weed mapping, aiming at knowing the biological and ecological characteristics of weeds present in the field, (iii) the decision-making process on the basis of the critical period of weed control and weed thresholds and iv) direct control (mechanical, physical, biological and chemical). Moreover, the last paragraph discusses and suggests possible integrations of allelopathic mechanisms in IWM systems.

Such richness is highly threatened, however, with many plants facing the risk of extinction and in need of urgent protection measures. The CARE-MEDIFLORA project promoted the use of ex situ collections to experiment with in situ active actions for threatened plants. Based on common criteria, a priority list of target plant species was elaborated, and germplasm conservation, curation and storage in seed banks was carried out. Accessions were duplicated in the seed banks of the partners or other institutions. Germination experiments were carried out on a selected group of threatened species. A total of 740 accessions from 429 vascular plants were stored in seed banks, and 410 seed germination experiments for 283 plants species were completed; a total of 63 in situ conservation actions were implemented, adopting different methodological protocols. For each conservation program, a specific monitoring protocol was implemented in collaboration with local and regional authorities. This project represents the first attempt to develop common strategies and an opportunity to join methods and methodologies focused on the conservation of threatened plants in unique natural laboratories such as the Mediterranean islands.

Restoration using salvaged soil-removal and translocation of topsoil from areas planned for development, with subsequent deposition at degraded sites-is an alternative to traditional methods. Salvaged soil contains both seed and spore banks, which may holistically augment restoration. Salvaged soil methods may reduce non-native germination by burying non-native seeds, increase native diversity by adding native seeds, or transfer soil microbiomes, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to recipient sites. We transferred soil to three degraded recipient sites and monitored soil microbes, using flow cytometry and molecular analyses, and characterized the plant community composition. Our findings suggest that salvaged soil at depths >= 5 cm reduced non-native grass cover and increased native plant density and species richness. Bacterial abundance at recipient sites were statistically equivalent to donor sites in abundance. Overall, topsoil additions affected AMF alpha diversity and community composition and increased rhizophilic AMF richness. Because salvaged soil restoration combines multiple soil components, including native plant and microbial propagules, it may promote both aboveground and belowground qualities of the donor site, when applying this method for restoring invaded and degraded ecosystems.

Freshwater zooplankton Daphnia adopts two distinct ways of reproduction: asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction for rapidly reproducing many offspring in favorable environment and sexual reproduction for producing resting eggs as seed bank to survive in harsh environments. Daphnia pulex has worse performance in growth and reproduction under the exposure to toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and tends to allocate less energy to reproduction in the case of insufficient food. However, the relative reproductive allocation strategy (energy allocation) of D. pulex individuals exposed to toxic M. aeruginosa is still unclear. Here we tested the relative reproductive performance of D. pulex fed on solely Chlorella pyrenoidosa (high quality food) or Chlorella mixed with toxic M. aeruginosa (low quality food), based on the parthenogenetic reproduction (life-history experiments) and sexual reproduction (population experiments). The results showed that under low quality food conditions, D. pulex reproduced fewer offspring which were also smaller and thus led to a reduced absolute output in parthenogenetic reproduction, but produced ephippia in the same size and quantity compared to those cultured under high quality food conditions. However, as the body size of maternal D. pulex cultured under low quality food conditions decreased, the relative reproductive allocation significantly increased in both parthenogenetic and sexual reproduction, compared to those cultured under high quality food conditions. In conclusion, D. pulex tend to allocate relatively more energy to reproduction under Microcystis conditions, which is a reasonable strategy for it to decentralize the risks from low-quality food.

Evaluating a DOE screen to reduce hyperhydricity in the threatened plant, Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT												In vitro methods for propagation and preservation are critical when seed banking is not an option for the ex situ conservation of an endangered species. Such methods rely on the ability to maintain normal growth for the ultimate goal of producing plants. Previous studies revealed that the threatened Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii can exhibit extreme hyperhydricity when cultured in vitro, but that this phenotype can be largely normalized by venting of the cultures. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to investigate factors contributing to hyperhydricity in this species. Using a 6-factor fractional factorial design, the effects of nitrogen, CaCl2, BAP, gelling agent, and the presence of venting on the phenotype were tested. Venting was the strongest driver decreasing hyperhydricity, but gelling agent and other factors had significant effects, depending on the response measured. A revised medium was then designed and compared with the original maintenance medium through 2-3 subcultures. Venting was again the strongest driver decreasing hyperhydricity, but the revised medium also significantly affected some responses, even in the absence of venting. The revised medium was not optimal, as shoots became progressively smaller with each transfer, but despite their size, hyperhydricity decreased. These results demonstrate the usefulness of DOE for simultaneous testing of multiple factors, but also the need for follow-up optimization experiments. DOE can be particularly useful in working with rare species. By making efficient use of limited resources, it can facilitate the development of in vitro propagation protocols for such species and help ensure their conservation.																	1054-5476	1475-2689				APR	2020	56	2					215	229		10.1007/s11627-019-10038-y							WOS:000530818800009

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of the soil seed bank and dispersal for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations of near-natural river habitats and anthropogenic habitats created by traditional fish farming practices using Cyperus fuscus as a model. Using microsatellite markers, we found no difference in genetic diversity levels between soil seed bank and above-ground population and only moderate differentiation between the two fractions. One possible interpretation is the difference in short-term selection during germination under specific conditions (glasshouse versus field) resulting in an ecological filtering of genotypes out of the reservoir in the soil. River populations harbored significantly more genetic diversity than populations from the anthropogenic pond types. We suggest that altered levels and patterns of dispersal together with stronger selection pressures and historical bottlenecks in anthropogenic habitats are responsible for the observed reduction in genetic diversity. Dispersal is also supposed to largely prohibit genetic structure across Europe, although there is a gradient in private allelic richness from southern Europe (high values) to northern, especially north-western, Europe (low values), which probably relates to postglacial expansion out of southern and/or eastern refugia.

Distribution of dinoflagellate cysts along the salinity gradient in two tropical estuaries along the West coast of India	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Dinoflagellate cysts are known to be potential seed banks which have an essential role in providing bloom history and also serve as useful indicators of eutrophication in marine environments. The present study is focused on the surface distribution of dinoflagellate cysts along the salinity gradient in two tropical estuaries, namely Chapora and Sal in Goa along the West coast of India. Surface sediments and water samples were collected monthly from February 2016-March 2017 which included all three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). A total of sixteen species of dinoflagellate cysts belonging to the order, Gymnodiniales, Gonyaulacales, and Peridiniales were recorded in the surface sediments. Cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates dominated the assemblage in both estuaries. Based on Redundancy Analysis (RDA), it was observed that the distribution of the dinoflagellate cysts were influenced by various physico-chemical parameters in both estuaries with salinity and grain size being the main explanatory variable. Nitrate limitation is noted to be a triggering factor for dinoflagellate cyst formation. Also, yessotoxin producer species, such as Gonyaulax spinifera, encountered in both estuaries showed an inverse relationship with nitrate concentration. This suggests that, high nitrate input in these estuaries might lead to excystment of Gonyaulax spinifera eventually leading to harmful blooms under eutrophic conditions.

Seedbank density and a multiscale assessment of genotypic diversity in the seagrass Halodule wrightii	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seagrass conservation and management plans are placing increased emphasis on the collection of data related to seagrass bed "condition" such as vegetative characteristics, seed production and genetic diversity. One important aspect of genetic diversity in species that reproduce both sexually and asexually is genotypic diversity. Genotypic (clonal) diversity is usually described as the proportion of unique genets within a population (richness), but it can also be characterized in other ways such as the degree to which individual ramets are distributed among genets (evenness) or the spatial arrangement of genets relative to one another (architecture). Genotypic richness, evenness, and architecture have the potential to influence sexual reproduction by affecting the proximity of genets, a key feature in dioecious species where pollen dispersal is limited and clones can vary greatly in size. They may also differ substantially according to the scale at which they are measured. This study examined genotypic richness, evenness and architecture across multiple spatial scales in the seagrass Halodule wrightii, and its association with seedbank density from three sites in the northwest Gulf of Mexico. While the magnitude of diversity estimates differed, the overall patterns remained consistent across scales. Seedbank density ranged from 19 +/- 9-188 +/- 30 seeds m(-2), following a gradient from north to south. The highest and most consistent production of seeds occurred at a site where richness (R: 0.24 - 0.42) and evenness (ED: 0.67 - 0.93) were uniformly high across spatial scales, and clonal architecture (A(c): 0.20 - 0.36) was represented by a high degree of intermingling.																	0304-3770	1879-1522				APR	2020	163								103207	10.1016/j.aquabot.2020.103207							WOS:000525342600005

Seed Banks, Seed Germination, and Implications for Conservation of the Endangered, Fire-Dependent Shrub, Arctostaphylos morroensis	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Conservation of obligate-seeding shrubs from Mediterranean-climate regions is an international conservation priority. Morro manzanita (Arctostaphylos morroensis) is one such shrub whose persistence may depend on germination and establishment from soil-stored seeds following fire. However, fire has been virtually eliminated from its remaining habitat. Thus, conservation of A. morroensis may depend on actions that stimulate germination to establish new populations. We characterized seed banks in different-aged stands and examined viability and germination of A. morroensis seeds in response to various cues, including heat and charred wood. We found that seed density varied greatly among sites, although not increasing with stand age as predicted. Rather, the oldest stand had especially low seed densities and viability. Viability of A. morroensis seeds was low-on average similar to 4%-limiting germination. Surprisingly, similar to 40% of viable seeds germinated with no fire treatments. Neither heat nor charred wood alone enhanced germination; however, when combined the two resulted in highest germination. Seeds soaked in water prior to heat-and-charred-wood treatments had significantly reduced germination, suggesting that prescribed burns conducted in the wet season would result in a poor germination response. Characterization of the seed bank and determination of the cues stimulating germination can provide information vital to the maintenance of this and similar obligate-seeding species.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2020	40	2					155	167		10.3375/043.040.0207							WOS:000524488500007

Seed retention of winter annual grass weeds at winter wheat harvest maturity shows potential for harvest weed seed control	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Downy brome, feral rye, and jointed goatgrass are problematic winter annual grasses in central Great Plains winter wheat production. Integrated control strategies are needed to manage winter annual grasses and reduce selection pressure exerted on these weed populations by the limited herbicide options currently available. Harvest weed-seed control (HWSC) methods aim to remove or destroy weed seeds, thereby reducing seed-bank enrichment at crop harvest. An added advantage is the potential to reduce herbicide-resistant weed seeds that are more likely to be present at harvest, thereby providing a nonchemical resistance-management strategy. Our objective was to assess the potential for HWSC of winter annual grass weeds in winter wheat by measuring seed retention at harvest and destruction percentage in an impact mill. During 2015 and 2016, 40 wheat fields in eastern Colorado were sampled. Seed retention was quantified and compared per weed species by counting seed retained above the harvested fraction of the wheat upper canopy (15 cm and above), seed retained below 15 cm, and shattered seed on the soil surface at wheat harvest. A stand-mounted impact mill device was used to determine the percent seed destruction of grass weed species in processed wheat chaff. Averaged across both years, seed retention (+/- SE) was 75% +/- 2.9%, 90% +/- 1.7%, and 76% +/- 4.3% for downy brome, feral rye, and jointed goatgrass, respectively. Seed retention was most variable for downy brome, because 59% of the samples had at least 75% seed retention, whereas the proportions for feral rye and jointed goatgrass samples with at least 75% seed retention were 93% and 70%, respectively. Weed seed destruction percentages were at least 98% for all three species. These results suggest HWSC could be implemented as an integrated strategy for winter annual grass management in central Great Plains winter wheat cropping systems.

Junglerice (Echinochloa colona) and feather fingergrass (Chloris virgata) seed production and retention at sorghum maturity	WEED TECHNOLOGY												In Australia, junglerice and feather fingergrass are problematic weeds in sorghum. The high seed production potential of these weeds increases their seedbank in the soil and makes weed control practices more difficult and expensive, particularly when weeds have evolved resistance to herbicides. A study was conducted to evaluate the seed production and seed retention behavior of junglerice and feather fingergrass at sorghum crop maturity following four transplanting times: 0, 2, 4, and 6 wk after sorghum emergence. Averaged across years, junglerice and feather fingergrass produced 4,060 and 5,740 seeds plant(-1), respectively,when they were transplanted with the emergence of a sorghum crop. Seed retention ranged from 42% to 56% for junglerice and 67% to 75% for feather fingergrass when these weeds were transplanted from 0 to 4 wk after crop emergence. A positive correlation (r = 0.75 for junglerice; r = 0.44 for feather fingergrass) was found between seed production and weed biomass in both weeds, indicating that larger plants produced more seeds than smaller plants. However, no correlation was found between weed biomass and seed retention for junglerice. A weak positive correlation (r = 0.44) was found between feather fingergrass biomass and percent seed retention, indicating that seed retention was greater in larger plants compared with smaller plants. Our results suggest that feather fingergrass is a good candidate for harvest weed seed control (HWSC) tactics if crop harvest is timely. There is limited opportunity to use HWSC tactics for targeting junglerice seeds in sorghum crops, because most seeds dispersed before crop maturity. Additional research is required to evaluate seed retention levels of these weeds in other summer crops such as corn and soybean to determine the potential for HWSC for management of these species.																	0890-037X	1550-2740				APR	2020	34	2					272	276		10.1017/wet.2019.109							WOS:000523655400018

Evidence for physiological seed dormancy cycling in the woody shrub Asterolasia buxifolia and its ecological significance in fire-prone systems	PLANT BIOLOGY												Dormancy cycling is a key mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of long-term persistent soil seed banks, but has not been recorded in long-lived woody shrub species from fire-prone environments. Such species rely on seed banks and dormancy break as important processes for post-fire recruitment and recovery. We used germination experiments with smoke treatments on fresh seeds and those buried for 1 year (retrieved in spring) and 1.5 years (retrieved the following late autumn) to investigate whether Asterolasia buxifolia, a shrub from fire-prone south-eastern Australia with physiologically dormant seeds, exhibited dormancy cycling. All seeds had an obligation for winter seasonal temperatures and smoke to promote germination, even after ageing in the soil. A high proportion of germination was recorded from fresh seeds. but germination after the first retrieval was significantly lower, despite high seed viability. After the second retrieval, germination returned to the initial level. This indicates a pattern of annual dormancy cycling; one of the few observations, to our knowledge, for a perennial species. Additionally, A. buxifolia's winter temperature and smoke requirements did not change over time, highlighting the potential for seeds to remain conditionally dormant (i.e. restricted to a narrow range of germination conditions) for long periods. For physiologically dormant species, such as A. buxifolia, we conclude that dormancy cycling is an important driver of successful regeneration, allowing seed bank persistence, sometimes for decades, during fire-free periods unsuitable for successful recruitment, while ensuring that a large proportion of seeds are available for recruitment when a fire occurs.

As (strong) seed banks stratify a population, we expect them to produce a signal comparable to population structure. We present tractable formulas for Wright's F-ST and the expected site frequency spectrum for these models, and show that they can distinguish between some models for certain ranges of parameters. We then use pseudo-marginal MCMC to show that the full likelihood can reliably distinguish between all models in the presence of parameter uncertainty under moderate stratification, and point out statistical pitfalls arising from stratification that is either too strong or too weak. We further show that it is possible to infer parameters, and in particular determine whether mutation is taking place in the (strong) seed bank. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, very few studies on disperser decline and seedling regeneration have been conducted in urban forest systems. In three isolated forest patches in Wuhan, central China, acorn dispersers, acorn dispersal, acorn deposition patterns in soil seed banks and seedling recruitment of the dominant animal-dispersed tree species (Quercus chenii) were investigated over four consecutive years (2014 to 2017). The hypothesis tested was that the loss of acorn dispersers caused by forest fragmentation leads to low regeneration and functional degradation of the urban forest system. As predicted by the hypothesis, very few acorn dispersers (only a few Chinese white-bellied rats, Niviventer confucianus, and Eurasian jays, Garrulus glandarius, were observed) existed in the forest patches; thus, almost all of the acorns were left on the soil surface under the mother trees, where conditions are not favorable for germination and establishment. Large acorns had higher probabilities of germination and seedling establishment than did small acorns when they were buried in the soil. These results suggest that regeneration of fragmented urban forests is increasingly hampered by sharp reduction in seed disperser abundance. Planting large seeds in the soil may compensate for the low regeneration caused by disperser loss in fragmented urban forests.																	1083-8155	1573-1642				APR	2020	23	2					379	388		10.1007/s11252-019-00911-4							WOS:000520351500014						
J	Li, XB; Kang, YH				Li, Xiaobin; Kang, Yaohu			Agricultural utilization and vegetation establishment on saline-sodic soils using a water-salt regulation method for scheduled drip irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Reclamation of saline-sodic soils for agricultural and vegetation ecological establishment is an important way to solve food and environmental problems, especially in developing countries. A water-salt regulation method using scheduled drip irrigation to control the soil matric potential (SMP) at a depth of 0.2m immediately under drip emitters was proposed and the application effect of the method applied in field experiments was evaluated for reclamation of saline-sodic wasteland at five sites with different climates, land-use objectives, and planting patterns. A low-salinity environment was created in the whole soil profile, especially in the root zone, and the salt leaching process was divided into three stages: rapid desalination, slow desalination, and salt stabilization. The soil environment was improved with reclamation time, resulting in improved land productivity, crop yields at levels close to those in local farmland after 2-3 years, and good landscape vegetation ecosystems were created by establishment of artificial vegetation and natural germination of seeds in the soil seed bank. Soil alkalization should receive some attention during the salt leaching process because it may affect the growth of acid-loving plants. In addition, the low survival rates for salt-sensitive/non-salt tolerant landscape plants in the early reclamation period led to the creating a non-saline soil environment by adding non-saline soils into planting holes. Overall, the water-salt regulation method to control SMP immediately under scheduled drip irrigation emitters is suited for saline-sodic soils restoration, and some suggestions were proposed for its better application according to the field experiments.																	0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 31	2020	231								105995	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105995							WOS:000525285400013

Seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions provide germination cues for the establishment of seedlings at the right time and place to ensure plant survival and population regeneration. Diaspore heteromorphism is a phenomenon in which diaspores with stark qualitative differences in morphology and ecology are produced by the same maternal plant. Germination responses and dispersal times of the annual halophyte Atriplex centralasiatica were examined to determine the role of diaspore heteromorphism in its adaptation to salt desert conditions. A. centralasiatica is a tumbleweed that produces three types of diaspores that differ in morphology and ecophysiology. The relative potential dispersal ability and intensity of dormancy of the three diaspore types was type A (fan-shaped diaspores with yellow fruits) < type B (fan-shaped diaspores with black fruits) < type C (globular diaspores with black fruits). In the field, type A retained high germinability, but all of them were depleted from the (transient) soil seedbank in the first growing season. Types B and C cycled between dormancy and nondormancy, and 0 and > 90.0% remained in the soil seedbank 2 years after dispersal, respectively. The dormancy, dispersal and salt tolerance of type B diaspores were intermediate between those of A and C. Type A exhibited low dispersal-nondormancy, type B exhibited intermediate dispersal-intermediate dormancy and type C exhibited high dispersal ability-high dormancy. In the unpredictable salt desert habitat, the functional differences in germination and dispersal of the three diaspores act as a bet-hedging mechanism and ensure population establishment in different years by spreading germination over time and space.

Seed banks in urban vacant lots of a Latin American megacity are easily germinable and strongly dominated by exotic flora	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Seed banks in the soil play a role in the temporal continuity and succession of vegetation in urban vacant lots. Therefore, it is necessary to know the composition, abundance and dynamics of the seeds stored in the lots' soils to understand their effect on spontaneously established urban plants. We hypothesized that soil seed banks in the urban vacant lots of Santiago, Chile, have a high abundance of seeds and an easily germinable bank of mainly exotic annual weeds. Additionally, 5 drivers (lot age, lot area, distance to urban centre, distance to urban boundary, and population density) were associated with the density of seed banks in the soil of urban lots. In 20 lots studied, 18 soil samples (150 cm(3) per sample) were collected, 9 samples at a depth of 0-5 cm, and 9 samples at >5-10 cm. This seed bank was studied by seed germination in each of the soil samples. Thirty-eight species recorded in the seed banks were exotic (83.7% were European, Mediterranean or Eurasian) and only three native. Two species could be identified up to genus only. We recorded in total 2934 seedlings in the upper soil layer and 506 seedlings in the lower soil layer from the 20 lots analyzed. The species frequency in the upper seed bank was positively and significantly correlated with the frequency of the lower seed bank and with species frequency for above-ground vegetation. In the upper soil layer, our results showed that smaller lots located in the most densely populated neighborhoods contain more weed seed density in the soil than greater lots located in less densely populated areas. The rest of the factors evaluated were not associated with the density of the seed banks in the soil. The results indicate that research in seed banks in urban habitats should be expanded and deepened, since the seed banks are determinants in the spatio-temporal abundance and diversity of above-ground spontaneous urban lot flora.																	1083-8155	1573-1642				OCT	2020	23	5					945	955		10.1007/s11252-020-00986-4		MAR 2020					WOS:000521784100001

The seagrass Zostera japonica Asch. & Graebn. is an endangered species in its native range along the northwestern Pacific coast. In this study, we used ecological survey methods and microsatellite analysis to evaluate sexual reproduction and its role in recruitment of Z. japonica populations at Swan Lake lagoon (SLL) and Huiquan Bay (HQB) in northern China. Mixed annual and continuous meadows of Z. japonica at SLL produced a high number of seeds (mean +/- SD: 40 244 +/- 18 666 seeds m(-2)) and formed a relatively stable seed bank (1460 +/- 417 seeds m(-2)) in the sediment. About 41 % of the seed bank and 6% of shoots survived over winter, and recruitment from seeds accounted for 41 +/- 24 %. In contrast, perennial and fragmented Z. japonica at HQB had lower seed production (12 501 +/- 5748 seeds m(-2)) and a much smaller seed bank (10 +/- 6 seeds m(-2)). About 66% of shoots survived over winter, but seedling recruitment was rare at HQB. Thus, relatively large differences in genetic and clonal diversity were predicted between SLL and HQB. Results of the microsatellite analysis of samples collected in 2012 and 2015 showed higher clonal (R) and genetic diversity (H-o) at SLL (2015: R = 1; H-o = 0.55) than at HQB (2015: R = 0.40; H-o = 0.42). These results highlight the role of sexual and asexual reproduction in maintenance and evolutionary connectivity of seagrass populations and emphasize the need to understand local recruitment strategies before starting restoration and management projects.

Factors at Multiple Scales Influence Recruitment from Herbaceous Wetland Seed Banks in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley	WETLANDS												In early successional stages, seedlings serve as a link between past and future wetland plant assemblages. Our objectives were to 1) enumerate seedling density in soil exposed to various hydrologic treatments 2) determine similarities between standing vegetation, germinated seedlings, and early successional stage assemblages, and 3) better understand effects of landscape-level factors on overall wetland seedling density. Soil samples were collected and standing vegetation characterized from 12 restored and three non-managed wetlands in the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MAV). Seedling germination was observed in a greenhouse experiment, while early-stage plant assembly was followed in outdoor mesocosms. Hydrology significantly affected seedling density, with constantly moist treatments increasing seedling germination above that observed in fluctuating or continually inundated treatments. Standing vegetation in MAV wetlands differed from germinated seedlings; however, germinated seedlings were similar in terms of structure and identity to early successional mesocosm assemblages, indicating close linkages of these two vegetation stages. When landscape-level factors were examined, we found that wetland size was positively correlated, and surrounding land use and watershed nitrogen (N) loading negatively correlated with seedling numbers. Thus, seedling dynamics were affected by factors internal and external to wetlands, necessitating landscape-scale perspectives when making management decisions, even for individual wetlands.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2020	40	5					1161	1172		10.1007/s13157-019-01248-6		MAR 2020					WOS:000562593200001

Here, we analyze changes in vegetation, seed-bank, soil and litter at six different stages during the coppicing rotation and after 10 years of abandonment of an Ostrya carpinifolia forest located in the central Apennines. Data show that the dynamism characterizing this coenose during traditional coppice rotation alters after cessation of the management practices. Although from the phytosociological point of view all the forest stands belonged to the same association, the highest biodiversity was achieved in the early stages after cutting. This was ascribed to the canopy removal, which creates favourable conditions for the germination of pre-mantels and mantels species stored in the soil seed-bank, while suitable conditions for the nemoral flora are maintained around the tree stumps. In later years, a reduction of non-strictly forest species and an increase in the relative thicknesses of the more superficial top-soil horizons occurred, reaching the maximum around 18 years after cutting. With the abandonment, simplification of the top-soil morphology, total loss of seed bank viability and increase of open-environments species were observed.

J	da Silva, FHB; da Cunha, CN; Overbeck, GE				Barbosa da Silva, Fernando Henrique; Nunes da Cunha, Catia; Overbeck, Gerhard Ernst			Seasonal Dynamics of Flooded Tropical Grassland Communities in the Pantanal Wetland	WETLANDS												We aimed to answer the following questions: do vegetation structure and functional characteristics of grassland types differ between hydrological periods (i.e., aquatic and terrestrial phase) in the Pantanal wetland? What general plant functional traits characterize these communities? We sampled 37 sites in three grassland types in the Cuiaba river megafan, in the northern Pantanal, Brazil, in both the aquatic and terrestrial phases. We determined, from the literature, 'stable' plant functional traits, namely life cycle, bud-bank types and, for graminoids, photosynthetic pathway, i.e., characteristics important in tropical habitats with the occurrence of flood, fire and drought. We compared the grassland types in distinct hydrological phases concerning the vegetation structure and functional attributes using Permutation test. We found that all grasslands are dominated by perennials during terrestrial and aquatic phases. Most species bears clonal organs, and aboveground bud-banks are specially relevant to the grassland under long-term flooding. C-4 graminoids are dominant but C-3 graminoids increase their cover during aquatic phase. Pantanal grasslands are rich in species and showed marked differences in height between terrestrial and aquatic phases. Our results are a basis to devise conservation strategies for grasslands in the Pantanal, susceptible to threats by global change processes.

Chemical and mechanical control of the invasive shrub Cytisus scoparius in forest clearings in western Washington, USA	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												We conducted a large-scale, multiple-year study in harvested areas of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirbel] Franco) forests in western Washington, examining the effectiveness of control methods on the widespread invasive shrub Scotch broom [Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link]. We tested both chemical and physical control methods, using three different approaches that are management relevant: (1) triclopyr, a POST herbicide, at different times of year and on different-sized plants; (2) cutting (or brushcutting) of mature individuals; and (3) scarification of soil surface to remove seedlings once versus multiple times. We measured initial mortality, seed germination, and percent cover of C. scoparius in plots for 3 yr following treatments. Triclopyr treatment resulted in greater mortality and reduced percent cover compared with all other treatments with the effect persisting for 2 yr after spraying. Further, triclopyr had the same effect on C. scoparius cover and mortality irrespective of time of year applied. Similar to soil scarification, triclopyr treatments resulted in a flush of seedlings, suggesting that removal of conspecific competitors and not soil disturbance per se promotes seed germination. Brushcutting was generally effective in reducing C. scoparius cover in the short term, but effects did not persist as long as triclopyr treatments, in part due to large differences in stump resprouting rates across sites. Soil scarification to remove seedlings, even over multiple years, did not result in reduced C. scoparius cover. Triclopyr is an effective approach for controlling both emerging and established stands of C. scoparius.

Characterization of genetic heterogeneity within accessions in the USDA soybean germplasm collection	PLANT GENOME												Soybean breeding relies on the use of wild (Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc.) and domesticated [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] germplasm for trait improvement. Soybeans are self-pollinating and accessions can be maintained as pure lines, however within-accession genetic variation has been observed in previous studies of some landraces and elite cultivars. The objective of this study was to characterize within-line variation in the accessions housed in the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. This collection includes over 20,000 accessions, each previously genotyped using the SoySNP50K Chip. Each SoySNP50K genotype was developed by pooling approximately three individuals per accession. Therefore, clusters of SNPs called as heterozygous within an accession can be inferred to represent putative regions of heterogeneity between the three individuals sampled. In this study, we found high-probability intervals of heterogeneity in 4% of the collection, representing 870 accessions. Heterogeneous loci were found on every chromosome and, collectively, covered 98.4% of the soybean genome and 99% of the gene models. Sanger sequencing confirmed regions of genomic heterogeneity among a subset of ten accessions. This dataset provides useful information and considerations for users of crop germplasm seed banks. Furthermore, the heterogeneous accessions and/or loci represent a unique genetic resource that is immediately available for forward and reverse genetics studies.

Dry afterripening (DAR) and wet and dry (WD) cycles at 15/5 and 25/15 degrees C as well as moist chilling (MC) at 15/5 degrees C were used to mimic the natural environment at different times of the year. A field experiment was conducted to monitor seasonal changes in germination responses of the seeds. About 40-65% ofB. guishanensisand 5% ofP. mileenseseeds were dormant at maturity. DAR at 25/15 and 15/5 degrees C as well as MC and WD cycles at 15/5 degrees C alleviated dormancy forB. guishanensisbut notP. mileense, and WD cycles at 25/15 degrees C induced a deeper conditional dormancy for both species. Seeds ofB. guishanensisexhibited dormancy cycling in the field, with increased dormancy under natural WD cycles at relatively high temperatures during the transition from the dry to the wet season in April to May and decreased dormancy during the wet season from June to October. KNO(3)mitigated the dormancy-inducing effect of both artificial and natural WD cycles at relatively high temperatures forB. guishanensis.The field experiment indicated that seeds ofB. guishanensismay be able to form a persistent soil seed bank, while almost all seeds ofP. mileensegerminate at the beginning of the wet season in the field.

Early Regeneration Dynamics of Pure Black Spruce and Aspen Forests after Wildfire in Boreal Alberta, Canada	FORESTS												Research Highlights: Black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) both regenerated vigorously after wildfire. However, pure semi-upland black spruce stands are at increasing risk of changing successional trajectories, due to greater aspen recruitment. Background and Objectives: Black spruce and aspen are found across the boreal forest with black spruce dominating lowlands and aspen being common in uplands. Both species are well adapted to wildfire with black spruce holding an aerial seedbank while aspen reproduce rapidly via root suckering. In the summer of 2016, the Horse River wildfire burned 589,617 hectares of northern Alberta's boreal forest. Methods: We assessed early regeneration dynamics of both pure aspen and pure black spruce forests. For black spruce, 12 plots were established in both bog and semi-upland habitats to assess seedling regeneration and seedbed availability. For aspen, 12 plots were established in each of the low, moderate, and high burn severities, as well as 5 unburned plots. Results: Post-fire black spruce regeneration densities did not differ between bog and semi-upland habitats, but were positively correlated with forb cover and charred organic matter seedbeds. Aspen regeneration within pure black sprue stands was substantial, particularly in semi-upland habitats, indicating a potential shift in successional trajectory. Fire severity did not significantly affect aspen regeneration in pure aspen stands, but regeneration density in all severity types was >90,000 stems ha(-1). Aspen regeneration densities were negatively related to post-fire forb and shrub cover, likely due to competition and cooler soil temperature.

J	Acosta-Vargas, L; Rovere, AE; Camacho-Sandoval, J				Acosta-Vargas, Luis; Rovere, Adriana E.; Camacho-Sandoval, Jorge			Effectiveness of two treatments to promote tree regeneration: implications for forest restoration in the Isla del Coco National Park, Costa Rica	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Introduction: Isla del Coco is the only island in the Eastern Tropical Pacific with humid tropical forests; 296 plant species are reported, of them, 22% are endemic. Their ecology is poorly understood. Deforestation and the introduction of rats, feral pigs and white-tailed deer are the primary agents of forest degradation. After more than 120 years, the deforested areas have never recovered the native forest. Objective: To analyse if the deforested area keeps its resilience, we evaluated the natural regeneration and ecological processes associated. Methods: From August 2016 to June 2018, we conducted a restoration experiment consisting of a randomized complete blocks design including vegetation cutting, vegetation uprooting and controls as treatments. Plots were protected with an exclusion fence to avoid herbivores. Results: There were no differences between plant cutting and uprooting in stimulating natural regeneration. We only recorded the seedlings of two tree species, 35 individuals of Cecropia pittieri and three of Sacoglottis holdridgei, both endemic. Their regeneration established during the first 15 months mainly. At the end of the experiment, the structure and composition of the vegetation changed from bushes dominated by Entada gigas (28%) and Clidemia strigillosa (12%) to grasses dominated by Paspalum conjugatum (39%). Entada gigas has a high recolonizing potential with a growing rate of 1.6 +/- 0.2m/month. Conclusions: As filters for restoration we determined herbivores, which pose a strong negative impact in the development of the forest; the exhausted seed bank of tree species and scarce or null seed dispersion.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR	2020	68			1			103	114									WOS:000532610600007

Forage Legume Establishment under Exposure to Progressive Declines in Aminocyclopyrachlor and Aminopyralid in Temperate Pastures	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Legumes such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) increase forage productivity and quality in northern temperate pastures, but require re-establishment following broadleaf weed control using herbicides. To quantify the residual effects of two herbicides (aminocyclopyrachlor and aminopyralid) on potential legume re-establishment we examined alfalfa and clover recruitment at two field sites over two years. Sites were over-seeded with alfalfa and clover to populate the seed bank, and then sprayed with herbicide, after which seedling densities were monitored in late summer and fall of the current growing season. Defoliation (via mowing) effects were also assessed to evaluate the role of vegetation competition on legume establishment. Herbicides were applied at recommended rates (1.0), and 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, and 0 times recommended field rates, emulating exponential herbicide degradation (one through four half-lives). Alfalfa and white clover seedling densities were negatively impacted by all rates of herbicide, with modestly greater negative impacts from aminopyralid than aminocyclopyrachlor, although responses to herbicides remained site and legume specific. Reductions in alfalfa and clover were particularly evident through the 0.25 (i.e., two half-life) herbicide rate, with reductions in alfalfa ranging from 78% to 95%, and in clover from 73% to 88%. Legume densities at the 0.125 (three half-life) rate were 39%-68% lower than those in nonsprayed control plots. Our results suggest that at least three half-lives of degradation must occur, and likely four or more, before these legumes can re-establish at densities acceptable for pasture production. These findings have implications for producers seeking to promptly re-establish forage legumes within pastures sprayed for broadleaf weed control in northern temperate regions.																		2073-4395				MAR	2020	10	3							392	10.3390/agronomy10030392							WOS:000529377300078

Meanwhile, seeds undergo changes in morphology and viability. In this study, we launched an artificial seed bank experiment that included 26 species of seeds. We excavated cohorts for 6-8 consecutive years after burial (YAB) in order to determine changes in the morphology (mass, volume, density, seed form) and proportion of fresh (thus persistent) seeds using a crush test as a measure of persistence. The change in seed morphology was fitted by linear and logistic regression, and the proportion of persistent seeds was fitted by logistic regression (effectively by the binomial GLM), which enabled estimation of 50 and 5% persistence times (PT50 and PT05). We found that in most species, seed mass, volume and proportion of persistent seeds declined with YAB, while other morphological traits were less variable, and the decline in these traits with YAB was best fitted with logistic regression. The decline in the proportion of persistent seeds was better fitted by the change in mass than by YAB in some species. Among the species included in this study, PT50 ranged from 1.2 to 10.5 years, and PT05 ranged from 2.1 to 24.3 years. These results can contribute to better understanding of the ecology of weed seed bank persistence in soil. Describing the morphological changes that the seeds undergo in the soil bank may improve our understanding of the biology of seed persistence and facilitate the identification of seeds from the soil bank.

The formation of resting cyst is a key strategy to resist harsh environmental conditions. In this study, the resting cysts of two major bloom-forming species of the A. tamarense species complex in China, A. catenella (Whedon & Kof.) Balech (previously A. fundyense, or A. tamarense species complex Group I) and A. pacificum Litaker (A. tamarense species complex Group IV), were studied in surface sediment collected from the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS) during two cruises conducted in 2012 and 2015. Cyst abundance of the A. tamarense species complex was first quantified by the primuline-staining method, and cysts of the two species were subsequently determined using two real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Results showed that resting cysts of the A. tamarense species complex were more abundant in the YS than the BS (mean of 480 and 33 cysts g dry weight, DW-1 of sediment, respectively). Cysts were mainly found in the central portion of the northern YS, the area SE (southeast) of the Shandong peninsula, and the area near the Subei Shoal in the southern YS, where surface sediment had a high percentage of clay and silt (particle size < 63 mu m) content. The maximum cyst abundance recorded was 3090 cysts g DW-1 of sediment in 2012 and 3448 cysts g DW-1 in 2015, respectively. Cysts were mainly composed of A. catenella in the YS and the BS, while those of A. pacificum were only detected occasionally at some sampling sites in the YS. Highly abundant resting cysts in surface sediment of the YS may serve as "seed banks" for recurrent toxic blooms of A. catenella and the associated shellfish contamination by paralytic shellfish toxins in the YS.

Ex situ conservation of threatened plant species in island biodiversity hotspots: A case study from Hawai'i	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Global plant extinction rates have increased dramatically over the past 50 years. Conservation efforts are especially challenging across the Hawaiian archipelago, where habitat loss and competition with invasive species threaten the existence of native plant species. Currently, 238 endemic Hawaiian plant species have fewer than 50 individuals remaining in the wild. To counteract this daunting statistic, conservationists apply a suite of ex situ techniques to effectively safeguard the many threatened plant species from imminent extinction. This perspective piece highlights how an integrated conservation approach that utilizes a co-located seed bank, micropropagation laboratory, and greenhouse, has led to the successful rescue and conservation of many threatened Hawaiian plant species. We draw on specific examples from the long history of Hawaiian plant conservation to detail successes and ongoing challenges associated with the implementation of ex situ conservation techniques. In doing so we discuss how plant micropropagation has emerged as a critical ex situ conservation tool, and how this underutilized tool fits into plant conservation as a whole. We also emphasize the essential roles that partnerships with external organizations play in ensuring that effective conservation efforts are implemented. Last, using lessons learned from these examples we detail and discuss an ex situ plant conservation decision tree that is widely applicable to other plant diversity hotspots of conservation concern, in order to help ensure regional and global zero-extinction goals are met.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				MAR	2020	243								108435	10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108435							WOS:000526787100014						
J	Coelho, N; Goncalves, S; Romano, A				Coelho, Natacha; Goncalves, Sandra; Romano, Anabela			Endemic Plant Species Conservation: Biotechnological Approaches	PLANTS-BASEL												Endemic plant species are usually more vulnerable to anthropogenic threats and natural changes and, therefore, hold a higher extinction risk. The preservation of these species is a major concern on a worldwide context and in situ protection alone will not guarantee their conservation. Ex situ conservation measures must be undertaken to support the conservation of these species, and seed banking is the more efficient and cost-effective method. However, when seed banking is not an option, alternative approaches should be considered. Biotechnological tools provide new and complementary options for plant conservation including short-, medium-, and long-term strategies, and their application for plant species conservation has increased considerably in the last years. This review provides information about the status of the use biotechnology-based techniques for the conservation of endemic plant species. Particular attention is given to cryopreservation, since is the only long-term ex situ conservation strategy that can complement and support the other conservation measures. The cryopreservation of plant genetic resources is, however, more focused on crop or economically important species and few studies are available for endemic plant species. The plant material used, the cryopreservation methods employed, and the assessment of cryogenic effects are reviewed. The reasons to explain the difficulties in cryopreserving these species are discussed and new strategies are proposed to facilitate and increase the interest on this matter. We expect that further studies on the conservation of endemic plant species will increase in a near future, thus contributing to maintain these valuable genetic resources.

In this research, the issue of seed degradation was studied in an undisturbed and a no-till soil, trying not only to uncover where seeds are more degraded, but also to investigate the microbial activities that could be involved in this process. Six different weed species, commonly found in northern Italy, were used: Abutilon theopharsti, Alopecurus myosuroides, Amaranthus retroflexus, Digitaria sanguinalis, Portulaca oleracea and Sorghum halepense. Seed decay was tested in two different sites, a no-till field and the adjacent buffer zone. Soil microbial activity was also measured using the Fertimetro, an approach based on the degradation of cotton and silk threads buried in the soil for one week. Degradation of the buried seeds was higher in the no-till field soil than in the buffer strip for all the studied species as was the microbial cellulolytic activity. Even though the buffer strip soil is an undisturbed habitat and resulted as having higher organic matter, the no-till soil conditions appeared more unfavourable to seed viability. Our findings suggest that no-till management can improve weed seed suppression in the soil. Moreover, cellulolytic microorganisms play an important role in seedbank longevity, so cellulolytic activity surveys could be used as an early monitoring bioindicator for weed seed suppression in soil.

Modeling the Population Dynamics and Management of Italian Ryegrass under Two Climatic Scenarios in Brazil	PLANTS-BASEL												Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) is an annual grass widely distributed in cultivated crops around the world. This weed causes significant yield reduction in many crops and has developed herbicide resistance. The aim of this study was to develop a cohort-based stochastic population dynamics model that integrates both emergence (thermal time) and dynamic population models as a tool to simulate the population dynamics of susceptible and resistant populations of L. multiflorum under the effects of climate change. The current climate scenario and the increase in the average air temperature by 2.5 degrees C were considered. Chemical and cultural management strategies commonly used in the South Region of Brazil during the winter and summer seasons were incorporated into the model. In the absence of control and under the current climate conditions, the seed bank population grew until reaching an equilibrium density of 19,121 +/- 371 seeds m(-2) for the susceptible and 20463 +/- 363 seeds m(-2) for the resistant populations. Considering the second climate scenario, the seed bank reaches an equilibrium density of 24,182 +/- 253 seeds m(-2) (+26% in relation to the current scenario) for the susceptible population and 24,299 +/- 254 seeds m(-2) (+18% in relation to the current scenario) for the resistant one. The results showed that the effect of the rise in temperature implies an increase in population in all the management strategies in relation to the current climate scenario. In both climate scenarios, the strategies based on herbicides application controlling cohorts 1 and 2 were the most efficient, and cropping systems including winter oat-soybeans rotation had a smaller impact on the L. multiflorum seed bank than crop rotations including winter wheat or summer corn. Crop rotations including wheat and corn for L. multiflorum management as an adaptive strategy under the future climate change are suggested.

Seed Dressing Maize with Imazapyr to Control Striga hermonthica in Farmers' Fields in the Savannas of Nigeria	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Use of small doses of imazapyr and pyrithiobac for seed coatings of imazapyr-resistant maize hybrids (IR-Maize) offers an effective means to control Striga hermonthica. Field trials were conducted in Bauchi and Kano States of Nigeria in 2014 and 2015 under heavy Striga infestation to evaluate the potential effectiveness of herbicide coated hybrids maize on Striga control in farmers' field. Results showed that herbicide coated seeds reduced number of emerged Striga per m(2) and Striga damage symptoms in farmers' fields in all the locations. In Kano the number of emerged Striga was 4.9 to 7.9 times less in herbicide treated hybrids in comparison with those of the same hybrids planted without herbicide treatment. The Striga-resistant open pollinated variety (OPV) (TZL COMP1 SYN) had 6.7 to 8.0 times more Striga than the treated hybrids. In Bauchi, the number of emerged Striga on the untreated IR-maize hybrids were over four-times higher on the treated IR-maize hybrids than on the untreated hybrids. The Striga-resistant OPV check had four-times more Striga than the treated IR-maize hybrids and twice more than the untreated IR-maize hybrids across the two years. However, the effects of herbicide seed coating on grain yields were not consistent because of strong seasonal effects. The result revealed that coating of imazapyr-resistant hybrid maize seeds with imazapyr was effective in reducing Striga infestation in farmers' fields. Although herbicide seed coating did not give consistent yield advantages of the hybrids over the untreated checks, a combination of herbicide seed treatment and genetic resistance to Striga would serve as an effective integrated approach that could significantly reduce the parasite seed bank from the soil and prevent production of new seeds. The IR-hybrids and the OPV checks contained Striga resistance/tolerant genes that protected them against drastic yield loss in the Striga infested fields in both Bauchi and Kano.																		2077-0472				MAR	2020	10	3							83	10.3390/agriculture10030083							WOS:000524417700031						
J	Bitarafan, Z; Andreasen, C				Bitarafan, Zahra; Andreasen, Christian			Seed production and retention at maturity of blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides) and silky windgrass (Apera spica-venti) at wheat harvest	WEED SCIENCE												Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) and silky windgrass [Apera spica-venti (L.) P. Beauv.] are becoming a significant problem in Europe. Due to the development of herbicide-resistant biotypes and unwanted side effects of herbicides, there is a need for new integrated weed management strategies to control weeds. Therefore, reducing weed infestations by targeting seed production during crop harvest should be considered. In 2017 and 2018, we estimated the fraction of the total seed production of A. myosuroides and A. spica-venti in a field that potentially could be collected by a grain harvester during winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) harvest. Twenty plants of each species were surrounded by a porous net before flowering to trap shed seeds during reproductive development. Seeds were collected and counted weekly up until and immediately before wheat harvest, and the ratio of harvestable seeds to shed seeds during the growing season was determined. Alopecurus myosuroides produced on average 953 seeds plant(-1) in 2017 and 3,337 seeds plant(-1) in 2018. In 2017 and 2018, 29% and 37% of the total A. myosuroides seeds produced, respectively, were retained on plants at maturity. Apera spica-venti produced on average 1,192 seeds plant(-1) in 2017 and 5,678 seeds plant(-1) in 2018, and retained 53% and 16% of the seeds at harvest, respectively. If a grain harvester potentially collected approximately 30% of the total seed production of the two grass weeds and removed or killed them, it would reduce seed input to the soil seedbank. However, such methods cannot stand alone to reduce weed pressure.

Olive groves are undergoing rapid changes because of the spread of intensive farming systems, which may have negative environmental impacts. This paper reports a survey on the aboveground flora and seed banks in five olive groves located in Andalusia (Southern Spain). In this study, the following three management systems have been compared: no-tillage, with the mowing of spontaneous weedy vegetation; no-tillage, with the mowing of planted cover crops (Poaceae); and conventional tillage practices. Results showed that coverage and an abundance of vegetation are favored by spontaneous weedy vegetation with mowing management, while the richness of aboveground species was affected by landscape diversity and the presence of edges, which increases the richness and diversity of aboveground flora species in olive groves. Seed bank composition showed a low relationship with aboveground flora in the three cover crop management systems. The multivariate analysis performed pointed to those seed species that have a major influence on the aboveground flora communities of each of the three agricultural systems. The seed bank was clearly impoverished in terms of both abundance and species richness after the long-term conventional tillage practices. We conclude that the intensive long-term conventional tillage dramatically reduces weed communities in olive orchards and the subsequent ecosystem services provided by them.

Mechanical characterization of blends containing recycled paper pulp and other lignocellulosic materials to develop hydromulches for weed control	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												Spreading of hydromulch as a crop management technique might show important advantages over plastic films for weed control, because it can be applied anywhere in a field, even in orchard and vineyard rows. In the present work, 24 blends were prepared by mixing paper pulp, from recovered paper and cardboard coming from paper mills, with different additives: (a) wheat straw, rice hulls, and substrate used for mushroom cultivation on the one hand as fillers, and (b) rice bran, white glue, sodium silicate, and powered gypsum on the other hand as agglomerating agents. The blends were tested with a texture analyser to evaluate their mechanical properties, testing the puncture resistance (24 blends) and the tensile strength (15 blends). Scanning electron photomicrographs of some blends were obtained in order to explore the relationship between their components and the mechanical properties. The results indicate that a blend prepared with paper pulp, wheat straw sieved at 2.5 mm and gypsum attained the highest stress resistance and tensile strength. An environmentally controlled experiment was performed on this and another hydromulch in which rice husk substituted wheat straw to evaluate their efficiency for reducing weed seedling emergence, using propagules of four common summer weeds. Compared with the control treatment performed, the hydromulches reduced seedling emergence from 64.6% to 95.9%. In general, the percentage of dead seedlings underneath was greater than that which passed through the barrier, making the hydro mulches promising tools for preventing seedling emergence and for managing the weed seed bank in field conditions.

To assist such efforts, we investigated relationships between fertilization treatments and depth-related characteristics of the weed seed bank (density, species composition and diversity) under a wheat-soybean rotation after long-term (16 years) fertilization. Numbers of weed species present and the Shannon-Wiener index were significantly lower under NPK, NP, NK, and PK fertilization treatments than under the fertilization-free control treatment (CK), and the vertical distribution of dominant species differed under the treatments. Generally, the species richness and Shannon-Wiener index decreased and the Pielou index increased with increases in soil depth, but the relationship of the Simpson index with depth was complex and unclear. The results show that effects of considered fertilization treatments on weeds warrant careful attention, and that PK fertilization would be optimal for suppressing weeds in the wheat-soybean rotation system studied.

To better conserve them, it is important to assess the effect of intensification in extensive mixed crop-livestock systems, which are considered hotspots for segetal species. The aim of this study was to evaluate how certain key farming practices and land-use intensity affect the composition, species richness and abundance of segetal species, taking into account spatial heterogeneity within the studied fields. To do this, we sampled 94 winter cereal fields - 41 farmed organically and 53 farmed conventionally - along a gradient of land-use intensity. At field scale, we found that both the species richness and the abundance of segetal taxa decreased with an increase in land-use intensity. The results also showed significant differences in segetal taxa composition, species richness and abundance between the edges and the inner-fields location and these differences significantly increased with land-use intensity. The species richness and abundance of both common and threatened segetal taxa were significantly higher at the edges of fields than within them. Herbicide treatments had a significant negative impact on segetal taxa species richness and abundance, while mechanical weeding had a positive impact on abundance. Nitrogen inputs had a significant detrimental effect only on the abundance of common segetal taxa. Crop seed origin and the ratio of cereal crops in the rotational cycle had no effect on segetal taxa species richness and abundance. Despite these impacts, we found that segetal species richness and abundance were better explained by farm identity (random factor) than by current management (fixed factors). Variation in segetal species richness and abundance between fields of the same farm and between farms reflect the long-term effects of farming practices and the history of seed transfer between farms more than by current management practices. In our study area, the production of cereals is destined for the consumption of the farm's sheep and the fact the cereals are not marketed makes it possible to tolerate the presence of segetal species in higher proportions than in intensive farming systems.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				MAR 1	2020	290								106778	10.1016/j.agee.2019.106778							WOS:000514929300013

Rainforest expansion reduces understorey plant diversity and density in open forest of eastern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The expansion of rainforest pioneer trees into long-unburnt open forests has become increasingly widespread across high rainfall regions of Australia. Increasing tree cover can limit resource availability for understorey plant communities and reduce understorey diversity. However, it remains unclear if sclerophyll and rainforest trees differ in their competitive exclusion of understory plant communities, which contain most of the floristic diversity of open forests. Here, we examine dry open forest across contrasting fire histories (burnt and unburnt) and levels of rainforest invasion (sclerophyll or rainforest midstorey) to hindcast changes in understorey plant density, richness and composition. The influence of these treatments and other site variables (midstorey structure, midstorey composition and soil parameters) on understorey plant communities were all examined. This study is the first to demonstrate significantly greater losses of understorey species richness, particularly of dry open-forest specialists, under an invading rainforest midstorey compared to a typical sclerophyll midstorey. Rainforest pioneers displaced over half of the understorey plant species, and reduced ground cover and density of dry forest specialists by 90%. Significant understorey declines also occurred with increased sclerophyll midstorey cover following fire exclusion, although losses were typically less than half that of rainforest-invaded sites over the same period. Understorey declines were closely related to leaf area index and basal area of rainforest and wattle trees, suggesting competitive exclusion through shading and potentially belowground competition for water. Around 20% of displaced species lacked any capacity for population recovery, while transient seed banks or distance-limited dispersal may hinder recovery for a further 68%. We conclude that rainforest invasion leads to significant declines in understorey plant diversity and cover in open forests. To avoid elimination of local native plant populations in open forests, fires should occur with sufficient frequency to prevent overstorey cover from reaching a level where shade-intolerant species fail to thrive.

However, sowing only grasses usually leads to species-poor and dense swards, where the establishment of target forbs is hampered by microsite and propagule limitation. To overcome these limitations and increase the diversity of species-poor sown grasslands, we developed a novel method by creating "establishment gaps.". We used tillage to open gaps of 1-, 4-, and 16-m(2) size in the dense grass sward of six species-poor restored grasslands in the Great Hungarian Plain. We sowed high-diversity seed mixtures of 35 native species into all gaps. We analyzed vegetation development during the first 5 years after setting up the trial. We also studied the colonization dynamics of the sown species along four 20-m transects around each gap, resulting in a total of 1440 plots of 1-m(2) size that were studied. Our results indicated that most of the sown species were able to establish permanently in the gaps. The total cover and the cover of perennial sown species increased and the cover of short-lived sown species decreased independent of gap size. There was only a moderate level of weed abundance in the gaps, and weed cover decreased over the years. The sown target species started to colonize the species-poor grasslands surrounding the gaps within 5 years. The highest number of species and individuals dispersed from the 4-m(2) gaps, as they had a more stable development than smaller gaps and were exposed to lower grazing pressure than large ones.

Vegetation trajectories of restored agricultural wetlands following sediment removal	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Recognition of wetland ecosystem services has led to substantial investment in wetland restoration in recent decades. Wetland restorations can be designed to meet numerous goals, among which reestablishing a diverse native wetland plant community is a common aim. In agricultural areas, where previously drained wetland basins can fill with eroded sediment from the surrounding landscape, restoration often includes excavation to expose buried seed banks. The extent to which excavation improves the diversity of wetland plant communities is unclear, particularly in terms of longer-term outcomes. We examined plant species diversity and community composition in 24 restored agricultural wetlands across west-central Minnesota, U.S.A. In all study wetlands, hydrology was restored by removing subsurface drainage and plugging drainage ditches, thus reestablishing groundwater connectivity and hydroperiod ("business as usual" treatment). In half of the wetlands, accumulated sediment was removed from the basin and redeposited on the surrounding landscape ("excavated" treatment). Initially, sediment removal significantly decreased invasive species cover, particularly of hybrid cattail (Typha x glauca) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), and increased community diversity and evenness. Over time, the effects of sediment removal diminished, and eventually disappeared by approximately 6 years after restoration. While our results demonstrate that sediment removal improves initial restoration outcomes for plant communities, longer-term benefits require sustained management, such as invasive species control or resetting of basins through additional excavation.

J	Whelan, RJ; Ayre, DJ				Whelan, Robert J.; Ayre, David J.			Long inter-fire intervals do not guarantee a large seed bank in a serotinous shrub (Banksia spinulosa Sm.)	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												It is often assumed that long-lived woody perennials with canopy-stored seed banks steadily accumulate seeds over time since fire. Trends in flowering and fruiting have usually been inferred from synchronic studies of sites of different post-fire ages or counting stored seeds in apparent age classes, and mostly in obligate-seeder species. Long-term longitudinal studies on a broader range of species are needed to fully understand the dynamics of flower and fruit production and accumulation of viable seeds. Key questions are as follows: What is the annual trend in flowering and cone production? Is this matched by accumulation of cones and seeds? How is seed germinability related to cone age at the time of a fire? We counted inflorescences and tagged cones produced annually by the resprouting shrub Banksia spinulosa in 315 plants over 13 years at one site and in 46 plants over 20 years at another. At the end of the study, we harvested all accumulated cones, burned them and assessed seed viability using germination trials. We detected enormous inter-plant variation in reproductive effort and output. 50% of inflorescences was produced by only 10%-15% of plants. There was a potential for accumulation of massive seed banks. However, (a) only 8%-10% of inflorescences became cones; (b) only 44%-50% of these were retained until harvest; (c) many retained cones suffered seed predation; and (d) viability of retained seeds declined with cone age. The result of these processes meant that the accumulated seed bank was only two to four seeds per plant, 82%-94% of the viable seeds had been produced in 6 years prior to harvest and only 12%-26% of plants contributed to this viable seed bank. Synthesis: Cone and seed losses and declining seed viability in B. spinulosa mean that almost all viable seeds come from the past few years of flowering even though apparently intact cones may be retained for decades. If this is typical for resprouting serotinous shrubs, it is important to understand trends in flowering and fruit set over time because the magnitude of recruitment will depend on fecundity in the few years prior to a fire.

A hypothetical model on how germination and post-germination occur in a species from transient seed banks	PLOS ONE												We hypothesize that by simulating the natural priming in seeds of a species that forms transient seed banks it is possible to clarify molecular aspects of germination that lead to the recruitment of seedlings when the next rainy season begins. We used seeds of Solanum lycocarpum as a biological model. Our findings support the idea that the increment of seed germination kinetics when the rainy season returns is mainly based on the metabolism and embryonic growth, and that the hydropriming, at the end of seed dispersion, increases the germination window time of these seeds by mainly increasing the degradation of galactomannan of the cell wall. This can improve the energy supply (based on carbon metabolism) for seedling growth in post-germination, which improves the seedling's survival chances. From these findings, we promote a hypothetical model about how the priming at the end of the rainy season acts on mRNA synthesis in the germination of seeds from transient banks and the consequence of this priming at the beginning of the following rainy season. This model predicts that besides the Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid balance (content and sensitivity), Auxin would be a key component for the seed-seedling transition in Neotropical areas.					da Silva, Edvaldo/0000-0001-6454-1488												1932-6203					FEB 26	2020	15	2							e0229215	10.1371/journal.pone.0229215							WOS:000535233700020	32101558

Protected from fire, but not from harm: seedling emergence of savanna grasses is constrained by burial depth	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: The Cerrado is a fire-prone Neotropical savanna and grass seeds are the main component of the soil seed bank. Although grass seeds are presumed to tolerate heat pulses during fires, the assumption that these seeds will be recruited may be an overestimation, since it does not account for factors that limit seedling emergence from the soil. Aims: We tested if burial depth constrained the seedling emergence of nine common Neotropical savanna grasses. Methods: Seeds were sown at the surface or at 5, 10, 20 and 30 mm in trays filled with cerrado soil. Emergence was assessed daily for 30 days and any remaining non-germinated seeds were tested for viability. Results: Seedling emergence decreased with depth, and was positively related to the seed mass. Seven species showed a significant reduction in emergence when sown at 10 mm and only two species emerged from 30 mm. Most non-germinated seeds lost viability after 30 days. Conclusions: Burial depth constrained the seedling emergence of Neotropical savanna grasses. Although seeds in the soil are protected during Cerrado fires, they may not generate new individuals, as seedling emergence is limited once a depth of 10 mm is reached and the seeds lose viability within 30 days in humid soil.

The role of community seed banks in achieving farmers' rights	DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE												The core objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. The ITPGRFA links these goals explicitly to farmers' rights. Although farmers' rights have been debated intensely at international level, their effective implementation at national level remains a major challenge. Community seed banks are good examples of effective implementation of those rights, but have received little attention in scientific literature and policy circles. Case studies in this article from Bangladesh, Cote d'Ivoire, India and Zimbabwe illustrate how this knowledge gap can be filled.

This hypothesis was tested in the current study. Soil seed bank samples were collected in the aforementioned environments during rainy and dry seasons, and taken to a shade house, where they remained under favorable seed germination conditions. Tree seedling emergence was measured, and sample species were identified every 15 days, for six months, in each sampling period. In total, 97 individuals m(-2) and 23 species emerged in all environments and periods. The highest density of viable seeds of tree species in the soil seed bank was found in the initial forest stretch, mature forest stretch and abandoned Eucalyptus stand. Only the Pinus stand seed bank in the dry season had different floristic and lower viable seed density than the mature forest seed bank. Thus, all environments, except the abandoned Pinus stand, can preserved Seasonal Semideciduous Forest fragments.

Soil seed banks could play an important role in restoring vegetation that was originally present, by recruiting species that have disappeared above-ground. We addressed this topic in plantations located in the Patagonian steppe by asking the following questions: Are richness, abundance and composition of steppe above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank affected by plantations? Is species composition of the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank similar in plantations and in the steppe? Location NW of Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. Methods We selected three plantations located in the steppe, and delimited three sectors: steppe, plantation edge and plantation interior. We compared richness and abundance by species origin and growth form among sectors for the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank compartments, using generalized linear mixed models. We compared species composition for each compartment and between them using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Results In above-ground vegetation, we found a decrease in richness and abundance, and changes in composition from the steppe to the plantation interior. Richness and abundance of the soil seed bank did not show differences among steppe and the plantation sectors, although composition was different among them. Above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank species composition were always different; native perennial herbs and shrubs were predominant in the above-ground vegetation while exotic annual herbs dominated the soil seed bank. Conclusions Our findings suggest that plant recruitment from the soil seed bank would not be sufficient for restoring depleted species pools in the above-ground vegetation of plantations. Therefore, actions promoting native species reestablishment and control of exotics should be considered to reach the aim of restoring biodiversity in former plantations.

Thermal germination niches of Persoonia species and projected spatiotemporal shifts under a changing climate	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Seasonal germination is critical in synchronizing seedling emergence with optimal conditions for survival but will be disrupted by climate change. Understanding how germination of threatened species with complex dormancy patterns will be affected by climate change is a priority for their management. By exploring the effects of temperature on germination for six Persoonia species ranging in rareness, this study aims to improve ex situ plant production and better understand the probable impacts of climate change on persistence of local populations. Location South-eastern Australia. Methods The role of temperature on seed dormancy was explored using generalized additive models to predict germination probabilities for six Persoonia species ranging in rarity. Embryos were exposed to 24-hr cycles of alternating 12-hr warmer/light and 12-hr cooler/dark combinations of temperatures between 8 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Optimal temperature conditions for germination were determined, and spatiotemporal changes in germination probability were predicted in response to expected temperatures under future climate change scenarios. Results Unique germination niches representing complex responses across diurnal regimes were identified for each species. Germination probability was predicted to decline in four species in response to warmer day or night temperatures and in two species in response to cooler day or night temperatures. Across bioregions, areas of likely germination largely aligned with species-specific temperature sensitivity, with suitable germination niche declining in four species, one staying roughly the same and one increasing in physical range under predicted climate warming. Main conclusions In response to increased temperatures associated with climate change, germination probability varied from current rates. These changes were quantified both spatially and temporally and highlight expected challenges for persistence of some populations, particularly range restricted and rare species. Current understanding of extinction threat must consider future conditions, and these results highlight the urgent need to protect populations of these six Persoonia species that are currently threatened by habitat destruction and encourage future population persistence through restoration efforts.

The concentrations of 55 soil elements and related environmental factors including organic matter content, electrical conductivity, and pH were investigated in natural, restored, and farmed wetlands in the Xingkai Lake Watershed of northeastern China. All but four of the soil element concentrations varied by wetland type (natural, restored, and farmed wetlands), and the soil concentrations of 41 elements increased from natural to restored to farmed wetlands. Soil organic matter and electrical conductivity explained 87.8% and 3.3% of the variation in element concentration based on ordination analysis using redundancy analysis. Both nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and cluster analysis indicated that the restored wetlands had a higher similarity with the farmed wetlands than the natural wetlands. Our findings suggest that restoration led to an increase in soil organic matter content and shifts in level of element concentration that was more similar to natural wetlands. However, differences remained so that the biogeochemistry of restored wetlands was not the same as the original prefarming level. This information is very important for wetland restoration, because to be successful, not only biodiversity and hydrology, but also the soil element composition and biogeochemistry need to be restored. Our approach can be used to assess the success of wetland restoration.																	1085-3278	1099-145X				AUG 15	2020	31	13					1641	1649		10.1002/ldr.3561		FEB 2020					WOS:000514180300001

We studied one such species, Viola uliginosa, an endangered perennial wetland species typically inhabiting sporadically flooded meadows alongside rivers/lakes. In order to estimate genomic diversity, population structure, and history, we sampled five sites in Finland, three in Estonia, and one each in Slovenia, Belarus, and Poland using genomic SNP data with double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq). We found monophyletic populations, high levels of inbreeding (mean population F-SNP = 0.407-0.945), low effective population sizes (N-e = 0.8-50.9), indications of past demographic expansion, and rare long-distance dispersal. Our results are important in implementing conservation strategies for V. uliginosa, which should include founding of seed banks, ex situ cultivations, and reintroductions with individuals of proper origin, combined with continuous population monitoring and habitat management.

Domestic grazing changes several habitat variables that can affect seed-eating birds. Birds, in turn, show adaptations (e.g. in their feeding behavior) that could allow them to overcome habitat perturbations. Here we modelled habitat variables (e.g. cover of different plants, panicles, soil seed bank) in grazed and ungrazed (or lightly grazed) habitats of the central Monte desert, Argentina, to detect those affected by grazing activity. There was no effect of grazing on shrub and tree cover, but grazing reduced the abundance mostly of large grass seeds but also of small grass and forb seeds. Then, we used model's outputs and knowledge of feeding preferences of the five most common seed-eating passerines in the Monte to make species-specific predictions: changes in abundance of grass seed specialists (Saltatricula multicolor, Microspingus torquatus and Porphyrospiza carbonaria) due to grazing activity should be consistent and should depend on large grass seeds (i.e. preferred seeds), whereas changes in abundance of more generalist species (Zonotrichia capensis and Diuca diuca) should be less consistent and explained also by the abundance of other seeds. The abundance of large grass seeds was sufficient to predict the abundances of S. multicolor, M. torquatus and P. carbonaria. The best model for predicting the abundance of Z. capensis included large grass seeds as well as small grass or forb seeds. No model including the abundance of seeds predicted the abundance of D. diuca. Therefore, feeding behavior explained the abundance of four out of the five bird species. A review of the literature showed that feeding behavior is also a good predictor of habitat use in other desert grasslands. Conservative range management should consider, and even manipulate, the level of the seeds preferred by wildlife. Grazed grasslands should be rested from grazing on a rotational basis so that grasses, especially those whose seeds are preferred by birds, can seed.

Aims: We determined the role of three dominant shrubs on SSB characteristics and evaluated their potential for their possible use in rangeland restoration projects. Methods: Ten sites, each containing three shrub species (Onobrychis cornuta, Berberis integerrima and Juniperus sabina) and a herbaceous patch (control) in close proximity, were sampled and their SSB density, richness and diversity were determined. Results: Density of the SSB at 0-5 cm depth was lowest under J. sabina and highest under herbaceous vegetation, but did not differ between B. integerrima and O. cornuta. SSB density at 5-10 cm depth was significantly greater under B. integerrima than under the other shrubs or herbaceous patch. Species richness of the SSB was significantly greater under B. integerrima at 5-10 cm depth than under the other shrubs. Conclusion: This study revealed that the extent to which vegetation affected SSB characteristics did not only depend on the presence of shrubs, but also on the species of shrub. We recommend B. integerrima as a priority species in restoration projects due to its significant positive influences on SSB.																	1755-0874	1755-1668				MAR 3	2020	13	2					199	208		10.1080/17550874.2020.1718233		FEB 2020					WOS:000514501700001

Seed and seedling establishment in abandoned tea plantations role of ecological and edaphic factors, southern Western Ghats, India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Seed input and microsite suitability play a major role in tropical forest recovery. Understanding these can provide insights on passive restoration, especially in abandoned plantations near forests. This study assesses recovery of native species in abandoned tea plantations and identifies ecological and edaphic factors influencing seed input and seedling recruitment. We measured seed inputs from forest to plantation using 1 x 1 m plot along a transect at specific distances from the forest edge. The results showed that 54-63% of species reached plantations. Proximity to forest strongly influenced both seeds from seed bank and seedling establishment within the plantations. The plantations 25 m from forest recorded 37-59% of forest species while at 95 m only 11-14% of species were recorded. Seed input varied with elevation and seedling establishment at lower elevation strongly correlated with organic carbon and phosphorous whereas at higher elevation it was soil pH and electrical conductivity. Overall dispersal limitation and microsite conditions strongly influence seed colonization and establishment.																	0564-3295	2661-8982				DEC	2019	60	4					566	580		10.1007/s42965-020-00052-2		FEB 2020					WOS:000513034300001

However, there is a significant gap of knowledge about how hydromorphological fluctuations affect their structural and functional responses in southern Mediterranean streams. In this study, we investigated the impact of hydromorphology on macrophyte stream assemblages in Cyprus and analysed their structural and functional responses. We collected macrophytes and hydromorphological data from 63 sites along a gradient from permanent to intermittent streams. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify and characterise stream sub-types. We performed an Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and estimated taxonomical diversity indices to investigate whether differences among stream sub-types affect macrophytes assemblage structure. Functional responses to the flow regime were tested by allocating traits related to persistence, regeneration, dispersibility and ecological preferences for moisture, light, nutrients and salinity. The results indicated the existence of two permanent and two intermittent flow sub-types. A total of 25 indicator species were identified showing taxonomic variation in macrophyte assemblages among streams with different flow regimes. We demonstrated that flow intermittency promotes a higher number of indicator species with wider ecological preferences and traits allowing resilience to drought. Specifically, we found that macrophytes in the intermittent streams, survive during dry period through the establishment of dormant seed bank or through belowground organs. They also showed lower values of Specific Leaf Area and therefore a reduction of water loss through evapotranspiration. In the light of climate change, where droughts are anticipated to increase, more permanent streams will become intermittent especially in south Mediterranean countries, and new habitats will be released, including marginal zones. Our results showed that these alterations in stream hydromorphology will produce changes in macrophyte assemblages which might cause shifts in stream ecosystem functions and services. Therefore, our knowledge about the direction of these changes is crucial for future management and conservation plans. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, prediction of future distributions of S. alterniflora and its management are required. Local population expansion after establishment depends heavily on asexual (clonal) reproduction, whereas sexual (seed) reproduction is one of the critical factors for estimating invasion success and the likelihood of colonization to new habitats. However, knowledge about the germination characteristics of S. alterniflora is lacking. Here, we report the environmental conditions suitable for germination of S. alterniflora, under variable conditions of cold stratification periods (0, 4, 8 weeks), temperature (constant, alternating temperature), light (light/dark, dark), and oxygen (aerobic, anaerobic). Cumulative germination rate of S. alterniflora increased with an increasing period of cold stratification. Its seeds clearly preferred aerobic conditions to germinate. Also, the germination rate was higher under alternating temperature than under constant temperature regardless of light and oxygen conditions in any cold stratification period. However, long-term cold stratification, alternating temperature, and aerobic conditions were more important for germination of S. alterniflora than light. Removal of soil seed banks within 8 weeks of cold stratification after seed dispersals with matured seeds may be effective approaches for disrupting the germination of S. alterniflora.

Lack of adequate seed supply is a major bottleneck for effective ecosystem restoration in Chile: friendly amendment to Bannister et al. (2018)	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												We argue that the need for a quality seed supply chain is a major bottleneck for the restoration of Chile's native ecosystems, thus supplementing the list of bottlenecks proposed by Bannister et al. in 2018. Specifically, there is a need for defining seed transfer zones, developing standards and capacities for properly collecting and storing seeds, reducing information gaps on seed physiology and longevity, and implementing an efficient seed supply chain with certification of seed origin and quality. Without such capacities, countries are unlikely to meet their restoration commitments. Although we focus on bottlenecks in Chile, the issues we raise are relevant to other countries and thus the global agenda for ecological restoration.

Increased light availability due to forestry mowing of invasive European buckthorn promotes its regeneration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The invasive shrub Rhamnus cathartica L. (common buckthorn) dominates the understory of many temperate forests of eastern North America. Common buckthorn outcompetes native understory species for light, forming monospecific stands that suppress plant and animal diversity. Removing common buckthorn is a common management priority within its invasive range. In recent years, forestry mowing has become popular in removing common buckthorn. This control method removes a midstory of common buckthorn, increasing light availability to the lower understory (which could favor buckthorn regeneration) and creating a layer of mulch on the forest floor (which could suppress buckthorn regeneration). Here we investigate whether and how increased light availability and increased ground cover (mulch) resulting from forestry mowing affects buckthorn regeneration from the seed bank. We evaluated buckthorn germination, survival, and early growth in response to a factorial combination of shading treatments and buckthorn mulch depth treatments in an oak forest in Minnesota, U.S.A. Increased light availability increased buckthorn seedling survival and growth, whereas increased mulch depth did not significantly affect the number of buckthorn establishing from seed over one growing season and winter. Thus, removing buckthorn by forestry mowing (or any other method) is likely to facilitate buckthorn reestablishment by increasing light availability at the ground.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	2020	28	2					475	482		10.1111/rec.13107		FEB 2020					WOS:000511205700001

Soil and litter seed banks and the juvenile bank as sources of vegetation resilience in a semiarid Neotropical forest	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: The existence of reservoirs from which dominant plants recruit after disturbances is a key factor in ecosystem resilience. With this in mind, we ask the following qestion: where do woody species regenerate from in the semiarid Neotropical Chaco forest? Is land use affecting the floristic composition of biodiversity reservoirs? Are the soil and litter seed banks and the juvenile bank potential sources of resilience of these forests in the face of different land-use regimes? Location: Chancani, Northwestern Cordoba, Argentina. Methods: We selected four ecosystem types subjected to increasing long-term land-use intensity: primary forest (no land use in the last 50 years), secondary forest (low land-use intensity), closed species-rich shrubland (moderate land-use intensity), and open shrubland (high land-use intensity). We monitored four sites per ecosystem type where we recorded adults, saplings and seedlings of all woody species. We collected litter and soil samples that were processed in the laboratory for taxonomic identification and germination of seeds. We compared the floristic composition of the soil and litter banks, as well as of the juvenile bank ("biodiversity reservoirs") with that of established vegetation of the primary forest, considered as the reference ecosystem. We also compared the established vegetation from sites under land use with that of the primary forest. Results: Woody species were scarcely represented in the soil, but very well represented in the litter and the juvenile banks from different ecosystem types. These two reservoirs showed high similarity with the established vegetation of the primary forest. However, as land-use intensity increased, similarity between the reservoirs and the established vegetation of the primary forest decreased. Conclusion: Litter and juvenile banks, but not the soil bank, are the main reservoirs for the recruitment of new individuals of woody species in the Chaco forest. However, the ability of these reservoirs to act as sources of resilience decreases as land use intensifies.

J	Shinoda, Y; Akasaka, M				Shinoda, Yushin; Akasaka, Munemitsu			Interaction exposure effects of multiple disturbances: plant population resilience to ungulate grazing is reduced by creation of canopy gaps	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The impact of multiple disturbances on populations could be synergistic or antagonistic via disturbance interaction and are considered to be provoked by alternation of the impact of an ecosystem disturbance due to the effect of a preceding disturbance. The impact of a focal disturbance can also change when a preceding disturbance alters the proportion of individuals in a population exposed to these disturbances (i.e., interaction exposure effects), although this effect has not been addressed to date. Herein, we propose and test interaction exposure effects by elucidating disturbance interactions between canopy gap formation and ungulate grazing. Based on a vegetation and seed bank survey conducted on an island in Hokkaido, northern Japan, we examined whether canopy openness changes the impact of ungulate grazing on the occurrence probability of palatable plant species through the facilitation of germination. Species occurrence in the seed bank significantly decreased with increasing canopy openness under the presence of grazing; however, it slightly increased under the absence of grazing, suggesting that gap creation, which facilitates germination, exposes the seed bank to ungulate grazing. Because disturbances of various types often modify the habitat structure, these proposed disturbance interactions are expected to operate within various ecosystems and taxa.

Synergistic impacts of co-occurring invasive grasses cause persistent effects in the soil-plant system after selective removal	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Human influence on the environment is so extensive that virtually all ecosystems on the planet are now affected by biological invasions. And, often, ecosystems are invaded by multiple co-occurring non-native species. Hence, it is important to understand the impacts these invasions are producing on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Here, we present results of a 2-year long field experiment where we tested the effects of co-occurring invasive C-4 African grasses in a Cerrado area in central Brazil. We compared plant and arthropod communities, plant biomass, and soil nitrogen dynamics and soil chemical characteristics across five experimental treatments: Urochloa decumbens removal; Melinis minutiflora removal; both U. decumbens and M. minutiflora removal; U. decumbens and M. minutiflora invaded plots; and uninvaded Cerrado. We hypothesized that selective removal of invasive grasses would have distinct effects on the native ecosystem structure and functioning. We expected that each invasive grass would produce a different type of impact on the native ecosystem and that their impacts would be synergistic when co-occurring. Removal of M. minutiflora doubled native plant diversity and biomass when compared to invaded plots, whereas removal of U. decumbens did not alter these parameters. Cerrado plots had four times more plant species than plots cleared of invasives. Removal of invasive grasses did not affect the species richness or community composition of soil epigeal fauna. Cerrado soils had lower fertility, organic matter content and pH than invaded soils. The effects were generally higher when both invasive grasses were removed, suggesting impacts were synergistic, but M. minutiflora had greater effects on plants and soils than U. decumbens. Both invasive species produced negative impacts, but a single species was the main driver. We also detected persistent effects of the invasive grass species on the ecosystem after 2 years of removal. We conclude that invasive species of the same functional group have similar types of effects in native ecosystems, but the magnitude of impact was largely dependent on invasive species biomass and cover. Where multiple invasive species are present, research and management of invaded ecosystems should tackle the interacting effects of co-occurring invaders.

It is gaining attention as a way to reduce the use of synthetic herbicides in agriculture and so pot experiments and field trials were conducted to explore the possible use of residues ofAcaciaspecies to alleviate weed emergence. We assessed, under greenhouse conditions, the herbicidal effect of phytotoxic manures fromAcacia dealbataandAcacia longifoliaapplied to soil at different doses (1.5 and 3% w/w) on maize growth, some accompanying weeds, and the physiological profile of soil microbes. Applied at a higher dose,A. dealbataresidues reduced the emergence of dicotyledons in the short-term (P< 0.05) and, after 30 days, there was a decrease in total weed emergence (P< 0.005) and a mild effect on weed composition, while total weed biomass remained unaffected. Regardless of the inclusion ofAcaciaresidues, the physiological profile of the soil bacterial community did not show significant alterations. Additionally, we testedA. dealbataresidues as a mulch or a green manure at the field scale. Although the effects of manures were site-dependent and affected monocot and dicot weeds differentially, dicots were more sensitive. The herbicide potential of acacia residues was only evident for dicots at sites with low-weed density in the seed bank. Nevertheless, due to the absence of phytotoxic effects on maize and minor modifications in the functional profile of bacterial communities, residues of acacia could be used as a complementary tool used together with other practices to reduce the reliance on synthetic herbicides in maize-based cropping systems.

WETLANDS												Natural disturbances have the potential to limit exotic species invasions. The exotic grass, Urochloa humidicola, has high propagation potential following seasonal flooding, but, flooding tends to reduce the cover. Neither the potential for U. humidicola form a seed bank for recruitment following seasonal flooding, nor the mechanism responsible for reducing adult plant cover during floods is currently known. The soil seed bank of a U. humidicola was sampled for 2 years. To examine the potential role of competition with aquatic macrophytes in reducing its cover during floods, cuttings of U. humidicola were flooded in tanks in presence and absence of aquatic macrophytes for 3 months. Seedling density of U. humidicola was higher post-flood (245 seedlings/m(-2)) than the post-dry (130 seedlings/m(-2)). Germination occurred throughout the year, with highest seedling densities at the five to 7 months following soil collection. Competition with aquatic plants significantly increased mortality (c. 70%) of inundated U. humidicola. Our findings suggest that the survival potential of U. humidicola under flood is high, but is limited by shading of aquatic macrophytes. Nonetheless, its seed bank germinates throughout the year, though delayed by flooding. Control of invasive species in grasslands of the Pantanal depend on natural hydrological and biological drives.

This review is grounded on the results of DIVERSIFOOD, a European H2020 multi-actor research project, and explores the concept of cultivated diversity using various dimensions relevant to foster sustainable organic food systems and agro-ecological transition. From the evaluation of underutilized genetic resources and forgotten crops, DIVERSIFOOD has proposed plant breeding strategies, on-farm experimentation, and statistical tools to create new populations, landraces, and organic cultivars with intra-varietal diversity. The added value of Community Seed Banks and forms of collective seed management in Europe have been described in terms of goals and activities, and their value for improving seed regulations, treaties, and genetic resources management is discussed. In the context of the current agro-food system characterized by standardization, DIVERSIFOOD raised awareness of qualities of 'biodiverse food systems' in which all actors have a role to play. It highlighted the critical capacity to preserve a diversity of cultural values embodied in 'biodiverse products', thereby involving consumers in collective strategies for reviving diversity, and empowering all actors of organic food systems to really and efficiently implement research within their farms and networks.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the organic rice' performance and management, probably due to the limits encountered by the reductionist approach in studying complex systems such as an organic paddy. The study proposes a knowledge-intensive and qualitative research methodology based on researcher-farmer participatory approach, with the aim to improve the state of knowledge on organic rice, explore the yield potential and variability, and identify the successful agronomic practices. A wide range of cropping systems placed in North Italy were monitored and analysed during three years by a multi-actor network. Knowledge was generated from collected data and information, integrating the scientific and empirical knowledge on the basis of the DIKW hierarchy and through mutual learning and knowledge sharing tools. The organic rice field proved to be a complex and difficult to predict system, which evolves over the time, under the on-going pressure of the bottom-up innovations, and whose performance depends on many interacting elements. The results highlighted three main knowledge-intensive management strategies, not involving universal recipes but a range of agroecological principles and flexible solutions that the farmers adapt to the time- and space-variability through an active adaptive management. Yield showed a wide variability (0-7 t/ha) and normal distribution (median 4 t/ha). The lower, middle and upper quartiles of yield showed a mean of about 2, 4 and 6 t/ha, respectively, with high variance associated with upper and lower quartiles. The variability sources related to the management and effectiveness in weed control have mainly determined the productivity gap, "Know-how" (suitability of the chosen management plan), "optimization" (timely and accuracy of interventions) and "seed bank" (previous operations and land uses affecting the weeds dynamics) were responsible of the low yield in 77%, 54% and 31% of the cases, respectively, drowning out the impact of climate, soil and variety. Results are useful to drive further scientific inquiries and evaluations consistently with the faced reality by the farmers, and suggest that improvements in the farmer' know-how and skills can lead to further yield increase and variability reduction. The participatory research, adopted to explore complex systems, has worked in this direction, fostering the co-creation of knowledge and innovation and the social cohesion. However, the methodology showed constraints mainly related to the time-consuming surveys and its nature affected by human component.

J	Sharma, P; Singh, MK; Verma, K; Prasad, SK				Sharma, Prashant; Singh, Manoj Kumar; Verma, Kamlesh; Prasad, Saroj Kumar			Changes in the Weed Seed Bank in Long-Term Establishment Methods Trials under Rice-Wheat Cropping System	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The rice-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains is the backbone of food security in India. In the 1990s, due to the scarcity of resources, the traditional Crop Establishment (CE) method shifted from Conventional Till Puddle Transplanted Rice (CTPTR) to CT Direct Seeded Rice (CTDSR) and Zero-Till DSR (ZTDSR) in paddy; and in wheat, from Conventional Till Wheat (CTW) to Zero Till Wheat (ZTW), with residue retention in rice (RRR) or in both rice and wheat (RRRW). Shift in CE methods led to change in Weed Seed Bank (WSB) dynamics and ultimately affected the weed management program. After five years of field trials, soil samples were drawn as per 2-factors factorial randomized block design. Factor-I comprised 4-CE methods, whereas factor-II consisted of 3-soil depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm). Results showed CTPTR-CTW and ZTDSR-ZTW (RRRW) record the highest seed bank (SB) of grasses, sedges and BLWs as total weeds, in general; and predominant weeds like Echinochloa spp., Ammania baccifera, Commelina benghalensis and Digitaria sanguinalis, in particular. It also showed the higher species richness (D-Mg) and Shannon-Weaver (H') indices. CTDSR-CTW and CTDSR-ZTW (RRR) show the lowest WSB and at par with Shannon-Weaver (H') index; further, lowest species richness (D-Mg) under CTDSR-CTW. Species Evenness (J') and Simpson index (lambda) vary non-significantly with CE methods. Furthermore, 0-10 cm soil depth showed the highest SB of different category of total weed, predominant weeds as well as higher values of D-Mg, H', and lambda; whereas reverse trend was observed in Whittaker Statistic (beta(W)). Interaction between CE methods and soil depth revealed most of WSB lying on the top layer in case of ZTDSR-ZTW (RRRW) and CTDSR-ZTW (RRR); while CTPTR-CTW showed almost uniform WSB distribution, and in case of CTDSR-CTW, a gradual decrease in WSB with soil depth.

However, the accumulated litter layer may hamper vegetation development, and thereby postpone recovery or even change the outcome. We studied effects of the litter layer on vegetation establishment during two seasons following a clear-cut of Norway spruce in Denmark. We experimentally assessed the response of multiple vegetation properties to litter removal, with and without wildlife exclusion by fencing, and in combination with sowing of trees, while fencing. Burning was tested as an alternative way to remove the litter layer. Vegetation establishment was poor, when the litter layer was intact, and cover developed slowly remaining below 10% after two years, irrespective of fencing. In contrast, litter removal and fencing together gave significantly faster recovery and reached nearly 60% mean cover. Vegetation cover was driven by few dominant species, especially the sedge Carex pilulifera. Species richness was similar in all treatments, but increased with sowing of trees. Fencing resulted in taller birch seedlings independently of litter removal, but enhanced by seedling density. Litter removal seemed to favor species with lighter seeds, lower specific leaf area (SLA) and lower Ellenberg N value, i.e. associated with relative infertile conditions. Disturbing the litter by burning seemed to have an effect comparable to mechanical removal, and could be a management alternative. Our results showed that a persistent litter layer after spruce plantation removal may hamper the initial vegetation establishment. Actively removing litter may serve as an additional restoration intervention to overcome this legacy. However, as grazing can keep this potential in check, wildlife exclusion may be necessary as well. To speed up recovery and diversify vegetation structure after spruce plantation removal, we suggest patchy disturbance of the litter, essentially combined with wildlife exclusion.

J	Rusterholz, HP; Binggeli, D; Baur, B				Rusterholz, Hans-Peter; Binggeli, Denise; Baur, Bruno			Successful restoration of abandoned terraced vineyards and grasslands in Southern Switzerland	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Extensively managed semi-natural grasslands represent species-rich habitats and therefore play a key role for the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural areas. In marginal and poorly accessible areas, the traditional management of grassland is frequently abandoned, which leads to the spread of forest. In Southern Switzerland, terraced vineyards (a special grassland type) and terraced grasslands are part of the cultural heritage and local biodiversity hotspots. Yet, many of them are overgrown by forest. In the past years, several abandoned terraced vineyards and grasslands have been restored by removing the forest, rebuilding the walls and re-introducing the traditional management. We examined restoration success by assessing plant species richness, diversity and species composition in both the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank in (1) restored, (2) abandoned for 25-50 years, and (3) permanently used areas of six terraced vineyards and six terraced grasslands. Plant species richness and diversity were reduced and species composition altered in the aboveground vegetation of abandoned vineyards and grasslands compared to the permanently used and restored ones. However, species richness, Shannon-diversity and species composition of the aboveground vegetation did not differ between restored and permanently used areas, indicating a successful restoration of the vegetation 10-15 years after restoration. In abandoned vineyards, species richness of plants emerging from the soil seed bank was slightly higher than in permanently used and restored vineyards. No difference in seedling species richness was found between abandoned, permanently used and restored terraced grasslands. Our results showed that the soil seed bank played a minor role for the re-establishment of the above-ground vegetation. We assume that the large species pool in the surroundings and the presence of dispersal vectors are essential for the successful passive restoration of abandoned grassland in this region.

J	Bucharova, A; Krahulec, F				Bucharova, Anna; Krahulec, Frantisek			Native seed addition as an effective tool for post-invasion restoration	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Invasive plant species reduce biodiversity, alter ecosystem processes, and cause economic losses. Control of invasive plants is therefore highly desired by land managers and policy makers. However, invasive plant control strategies frequently fail, partly because management often concentrates only on the eradication of invasive plants and not on revegetation with native species that use the available resources and prevent reinvasion. In this study, we focused on the intracontinental invader Rumex alpinus L., which was introduced by humans from the Alps to the lower mountains of Central Europe, where it has spread to semi-natural meadows, suppresses local biodiversity, and reduces the quality of hay used as cattle fodder. The species can be effectively removed using herbicide, but this leaves behind a persistent seed bank. Without further treatment, the invader rapidly regenerates and reinvades the area. We supplemented the herbicide treatment by adding the seeds of native grasses. Addition of native-seed effectively suppressed the regeneration of the invader from the seed bank, reduced its biomass, and consequently, prevented massive reinvasion. While the invader removal was successful, the restored community remained species-poor because the dense sward of native grasses blocked the regeneration of native forbs from the seed bank. Nevertheless, the addition of native seed proved to be an effective tool in preventing reinvasion after the eradication of the invasive plant. (C) 2020 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

We therefore investigated the effect of the native halophyte Suaeda japonica on initial settlement of the invasive Spartina anglica on a tidal flat. The seed bank among native vegetation was compared with an unvegetated mudflat, and the effects of inundation on seed germination were tested. Five flooding duration treatments were compared: moistened, permanently-inundated, and inundated for 1, 2, or 3 h per day. Seed bank density was significantly higher where native vegetation (7.1 +/- 1.3 seeds m(-2)) than on the unvegetated mudflat (0.6 +/- 0.3 seeds m(-2)). Seed germination tests showed no significant differences among inundation treatments (log-rank test, p > 0.05). The broad range of conditions in which seeds can germinate allow Spartina anglica to become established widely in mudflat environments. Results suggest that native halophytes may function as an effective seed trap promoting initial settlement and establishment of the invasive Spartina anglica.

Today, ex situ seed banking is important for the preservation of heirloom strains, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration, and diverse research applications. However, these efforts primarily target microalgae and terrestrial plants. Although some collections include macroalgae (i.e., seaweeds), they are relatively few and have yet to be connected via any international, coordinated initiative. In this piece, we provide a brief introduction to macroalgal germplasm banking and its application to conservation, industry, and mariculture. We argue that concerted effort should be made globally in germline preservation of marine algal species via germplasm banking with an overview of the technical advances for feasibility and ensured success.

Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli) emergence and growth in a changing climate in great plains wetlands	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Projected twenty first century increases in temperature and precipitation intensity in the U.S. Great Plains may alter playa wetland hydroperiods. Our objective was to identify favorable germination conditions for a common moist-soil grass, Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli L.), by evaluating emergence and growth response to various environmental conditions specific to the Northern (Nebraska) and Southern (Texas) range of playas. We used a temperature-controlled growth chamber experiment to evaluate emergence and growth response of Barnyardgrass to three main effects: (i) weekly temperatures representing historical and future conditions under a moderate emissions scenario, (ii) dry, moist, and saturated soil moisture conditions, and (iii) various seed bank densities. In Nebraska samples, projected future temperatures reduced emergence percentage by up to 20%, but increased emergence percentage by up to 15% for Texas samples. For Nebraska samples, plants were 9.6 cm taller under field capacity moisture compared to saturated moisture. Texas plant height was driven by temperature, where historical conditions produced plants that were 13 cm shorter than future warm conditions. These effects may be exacerbated in natural settings over time and when inter-specific competition exists; thus, temperature, soil moisture, and seed bank densities may be important considerations when planning for playa management in future climate conditions.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the destination of ecological compensation for restoration and appropriateness to the environmental legislation of rural properties in the municipality of Araponga, Minas Gerais (MG). Information on Areas of Permanent Preservation (APP) and Legal Reserves (LR) were obtained from the Rural Environmental Registry's database. Plans on environmental appropriateness were evaluated and they are: dense planting, enrichment planting, plant spacing, fencing, artificial bird perches and transposition of soil seed bank. A total of 197.39 ha in APP is without forest (26.19 % of APP area) in the rural properties of the municipality of Araponga. In relation to LR, 566.92 ha (20.95 % of LR area) face conflict. The total costs, per year, for all forest restoration techniques were lower than the average value of ecological ICMS received by the municipality of Araponga (US$ 186,873.21 year(-1)).

Soil translocation, which transfers the topsoil of donor forest to the receiving site to allow for the germination and reestablishment of soil seed bank and seedling, is a promising method for restoring vegetation that is similar to the donor forest. However, the lower similarly between the germinated community and donor forest has diminished its application against the ecological restoration and biodiversity compensation. We hypothesized that the exposure of donor forest soil to strong sunlight and early herb/liana competition may block germination and establishment of woody species (trees and shrubs) following soil translocation. To test this, here we investigated the effect of shading and weeding treatment on woody species assembly and seedlings growth at a karst rocky desertification area in southwest China. The results showed that soil translocation in blank control significantly increased the richness and similarly of woody species compared with receiving site. Moreover, soil translocation with shade treatment not only increased the richness and density of species during the germination period, but it also improved the survival and growth of most species-especially Osteomeles anthyllidifolia, Fraxinus malacophylla, Quercus baronii, and Rhamnus parvifolia-when compared with soil translocation in blank control after 18 months. Additionally, although soil translocation with blank control and weeding, and soil translocation with shade and weeding increased neither the number of woody species nor the density of shrubs species, they improved the density and similarly of tree species as well as the similarly of shrub species. We concluded that soil translocation with shade and weeding is likely more effective and helpful to restore the vegetation that is more similar to the donor forest in semi-humid regions of southwest China and comparable regions worldwide. But in practice, only soil translocation with moderate shade is deemed the optimal restoration method because it maintain the "recovery effect" while decrease the labor cost. Nevertheless, we should further assess the longer-term development and stabilization of established vegetation.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				FEB 1	2020	144								105704	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105704							WOS:000509459800005

The case of Spain	CROP PROTECTION												Lolium rigidum Gaudin is a troublesome weed worldwide, and its distribution may increase due to climate change. It has become resistant to several herbicides and, therefore, its control is problematic. On the other hand, its seed biology, with little dormancy and short-term viability, can play a major role in reducing its seed bank, which would improve control of this weed. For this reason, knowledge of the emergence patterns of this species entails improvements for its management. In this work seeds from one population of L. rigidum, collected in Northeastern Spain, were distributed and sown in 11 sites across Spain, and its emergence was followed every 2-7 days for two growing seasons (2016-17 and 2017-18). These emergence sequences were compared with previously published thermal time and hydrothermal time based models, and new models were developed afterwards. The hydrothermal time based model did not significantly improve models based solely on thermal time. The accuracy of these newly developed models varied from site to site, but in general, they worked better for Northern locations than for Southern locations. Thus, the experimental sites were split between North and South, and specific models for each region were developed. The model developed for Northern sites worked very well, but the one for Southern sites needs improvement. This works reveals that, with regard to this weed species, probably different models should be developed for different climatic conditions. The model developed with data from Northern sites should be validated with local populations, while the one developed with data from Southern sites will probably need to be revised or newly developed with data from more Southern populations.

J	Kottler, EJ; Gedan, K				Kottler, Emily J.; Gedan, Keryn			Seeds of change: characterizing the soil seed bank of a migrating salt marsh	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims The capacity for dispersal to promote or hinder species' responses to global change remains a major question in ecology. One ecosystem experiencing rapid change is the tidal marsh, which is migrating inland in response to accelerated sea level rise. Few studies to date have investigated the ecological dynamics that impact this large-scale migration. Seed dispersal and persistence in the soil seed bank is a component that can be strongly indicative of community trajectories. With this in mind, the aim of our study was to characterize the germinable seed bank across a marsh-forest ecotone in the Chesapeake Bay. Methods Soil samples were collected across transects that ran from the high marsh to the coastal loblolly pine forest in a brackish marsh in Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, MD, USA. Samples were grown in a greenhouse and watered with either freshwater or 3 ppt seawater solution. We compared community composition across transects and between salinity treatments. Additionally, we compared the seed bank with standing vegetation and used seed trait data from the TRY Database to investigate changes in functional traits along this ecotone. Key Results We found halophytic species dispersing up to 15 m into the forest and a general lack of obligate upland species, including near absence of Pinus taeda, the dominant species in the forest canopy. A majority of species detected in the seed bank were wetland species of various types, with species with wide salinity tolerance arising most frequently. Salinity addition had a significant negative influence on seed bank diversity. Conclusion Overall, our seed bank results suggest that dispersal and germination under the conditions of saltwater intrusion will limit forest regeneration and favour marsh plant dispersal. This indicates that the ecological processes that determine the soil seed bank community will support continued migration of marsh species into uplands.

Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the role of SSB to the restoration of degraded lands in six, fifteen and twenty-five year's ex-closures and adjacent degraded open grazing land (DOGL). Totally, 160 samples of SSB from four soil layers (litter, 0-3cm, 3-6cm & 6-9cm), four sites and ten in a composite of 5 (15x15cm) were collected and tested for seed viability through seed extraction and seedling emergence methods. Species richness and diversity showed a significant difference between the SSB of the ex-closures and DOGL (P=0.0148 and P=0.0218 respectively). Seed densities also showed significant differences between the vertical layers of the soils in the ex-closures and DOGL (P=0.0112) and the interaction effect of the land use type and the vertical soil layers (P=0.0174). Ex-closures and DOGL scored highest seed densities in their litter and bottom layers of the soils respectively. Most of the woody species in the SSB of older ex-closures were represented in the aboveground flora. Thus, this study has verified that SSB has played a vital role in the restoration of woody species in degraded land through ex-closure practices.																	2045-2322					JAN 22	2020	10	1							956	10.1038/s41598-020-57651-1							WOS:000559821400008	31969606

We examined the performance of 60 grassland species growing in monoculture for 12 years in a biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) and studied three groups of biotic drivers potentially affecting plant performance in monocultures over time: 1) soil biota (nematode communities, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), 2) leaf traits related to leaf economics spectrum, and 3) plant life-cycle characteristics related to buffered population growth (viable seeds in topsoil, seedling density, seed survival). Monocultures of 15 out of 60 species increased productivity, while monocultures of the remaining 45 species showed slight to strong losses of productivity over time, resulting in zero biomass in 15 species. All three biotic drivers were related to the varying long-term performance of monocultures. Their combined influence on monoculture performance could be interpreted as a tradeoff between 'fast' versus 'slow' life strategies. 'Fast' species showed rapid resource use and little buffering of population growth through a viable seed bank, which led to high biomass production in young monocultures but a consecutive loss of biomass production over time. 'Slow' species were characterized by positive nematode effects (high abundance of predatory nematodes), conservative use of resources, and a viable seed bank with high recruitment success resulting in gradually increasing productivity over time. In summary, our study highlights the importance of studying long-term field monocultures to investigate the complex role of different biotic drivers responsible for productivity changes over time. These insights provide an essential baseline for estimating biodiversity effects on productivity as well as to understand and predict long-term performance of plant populations.

The annual dynamics of weed seed bank responses to different weeding measures (chemical herbicide, hand weeding and no weeding) in rice-wheat cropping systems were compared to observe the succession of weed communities under different weed selection pressures for 17 years. RESULTS In unweeded rice-wheat cropping plots, the initially dominant broadleaf weeds were overtaken by grasses and eventually by sedges, while in plots subjected to chemical herbicide or hand weeding, broadleaf weeds remained dominant followed by grasses. The rice-wheat cropping system favoured the spread of paddy weed species; weeding had little effect on the composition of the dominant rice weeds but greatly influenced that of wheat weeds. Total seed density tended to decrease in both weeded and unweeded plots, but the species density and composition of the seed banks differed among plots treated differently. Weeding slightly increased weed species diversity and decreased weed community evenness and dominance in the first several years, but this scenario could have negative consequences in the long term; however, without weeding, stronger interspecific competition led to a decrease in weed species diversity whereas weed community evenness and dominance increased. CONCLUSION Long-term and repeated application of pre-emergence chemical herbicides and hand weeding had similar effects on the weed community dynamics, indicating that exclusive application of pre-emergence herbicide could maintain the weed community at a durable relatively low infestation level.

Reducing the fitness of an invasive weed, Parthenium hysterophorus: Complementing biological control with plant competition	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We studied the effects of a biological control agent, Epiblema strenuana Walker (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) alone and together with a sown native grass, Astrebla squarrosa C.E. Hubb. and an introduced pasture plant, Clitoria ternatea L. on growth and seed production of Parthenium hysterophorus L. Astrebla squarrosa and C. ternatea individually reduced shoot dry biomass of P. hysterophorus by 30 and 42%, respectively; and by 48 and 70%, respectively in the presence of biological control agent, E. strenuana. Similarly, A. squarrosa and C. ternatea individually reduced weed seed production up to 48 and 64%, respectively; and by 73 and 81%, respectively in the presence of E. strenuana. In the presence of E. strenuana, the biomass of A. squarrosa and C. ternatea was increased by 13 and 10%, respectively. The biological control agent induced more galls per P. hysterophorus plant when either of the competing plants were present than when grown alone. The abundance of galls increased with pasture competition, but only for C. ternatea, and not for A. squarrosa. The biological control agent worked synergistically with the two competitive plants to reduce the growth and production of viable seed, which should lead to a decrease in the P. hysterophorus soil seed banks in the field, and eventually seedling recruitment in future generations of P. hysterophorus.																	0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 15	2020	254								109790	10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109790							WOS:000504777700011	31733483

Investigating changes in ecosystem characteristics after these measures is of great importance for establishing management and recovery strategies. This study aimed to investigate spatial-temporal changes in the understory heterogeneity, diversity and composition after fires of different severities in a Brant's oak (Quercus brantii Lindl.) forest. Vegetation sampling was monitored in 14 patches including unburned sites (UBN), burned sites with low fire severity after 1, 5, and 10 years (LFSO, LFSF, and LFST, respectively), and burned sites with high fire severity after 1, 5, and 10 years (HFSO, HFSF, and HFST, respectively). Fire severity and time since fire significantly affected diversity indices with the lowest values of richness, evenness and diversity in high-severity fires, while the highest values were observed in low-severity fires. Time since fire did not significantly affect the understory evenness in both fire severities. However, species diversity and richness in low-severity fires decreased with time since fire while the reverse was observed in high-severity fires. The results of a detrended correspondence analysis indicated that the severity and time since fire significantly changed vegetation composition. The largest changes in vegetation composition compared to control sites were observed in HFSO, and then in HFSF and HFST. Both fire severity and time since fire caused changes in the heterogeneity of plant communities. We concluded that the use of low-severity fires can be suitable for maintaining and increasing the heterogeneity of understory vegetation in semiarid forest ecosystems. However, low-severity fires have also slightly, while not significantly, increased evenness and can therefore potentially reduce the ecosystem functions of dominant species in such semiarid regions. This could mitigate the positive effect of fire on vegetation heterogeneity and necessitate further investigations.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Astragalus myriacanthus and Acantholimon spinosum on SSB characteristics. Soil sampling was carried out in four different positions (upslope edge, downslope edge, center and outside) of each cushion in semiarid mountainous regions in Iran. Then, SSB composition and density, species diversity and richness of SSB in each position were estimated using the germination method. The results of the nonmetric multidimensional scaling showed that the separation of species composition of SSB in four different positions was not possible in any of the cushion species. Nevertheless, the results indicated that the lowest of SSB density, species diversity and richness were observed in the outside of the two cushions. In both cushions, A. myriacanthus and A. spinosum, the mean SSB density (1,606.4 and 646.5 seeds/m(2), respectively) was significantly higher in the upslope edge. Totally, the mean density of SSBs in A. myriacanthus (903.6 seeds/m(2)) was significantly higher than that of A. spinosum (360.6 seeds/m(2)). We concluded that the cushion plants can act as seed traps and therefore could facilitate recovery of degraded sites in the steep-hilly areas, while, the possibility of seed penetration into the soil of different directions of cushion might be significant.																	1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 15	2020	31	8					990	1000		10.1002/ldr.3517		JAN 2020					WOS:000506299000001						
J	Yamazaki, H; Yoshida, T				Yamazaki, Haruka; Yoshida, Toshiya			Various scarification treatments produce different regeneration potentials for trees and forbs through changing soil properties	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Soil scarification removed surface layers including nutrients and buried seeds. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of alternative practices that intentionally leave the surface soil (screening and replacing) along with the standard scarification. We focused on soil properties, the density of buried seeds, the invasion of competitive vegetation, and the regeneration of tree species. There were significant differences in soil properties among the treatments. Soils that were treated with the replacing treatment had the highest water contents from the surface layer to the deep layer in the lower slope in particular. On the other hand, there were higher densities of tall forb germinated from rhizomes, which are likely to shade tree species, with the replacing in the lower slope locations. The residual buried seed densities in the soil were estimated to be significantly higher in the screening than the replacing. Phellodendron amurense, producing seed bank and having dry tolerance, exhibited the greatest seedling density with the screening. However, there was no significant difference between screening and replacing in Betula species which has higher water demands. In conclusion, it is important that screening and replacing should be used properly according to the site condition and target tree species. The replacement had the advantage of retaining higher water content, but it is suggested that the screening is a better option when intended for regeneration from buried seeds and when many tall forb species grow alongside dwarf bamboo prior to treatment.																	1341-6979	1610-7403				JAN 2	2020	25	1					41	50		10.1080/13416979.2019.1706798		JAN 2020					WOS:000505453300001

ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES												Background: Bush clearing of encroached rangelands is crucial for restoration of herbaceous cover and diversity. Regeneration after bush clearing depends largely on the soil seed bank (SSB) size and composition. To assess the potential of the SSB to facilitate post-clearing herbaceous restoration, we examined the SSB density, composition and diversity and similarity between SSB and aboveground vegetation (AGV). Methods: The study was conducted in semi-arid rangelands of Maseding and Kgomokgomo in North-West Province of South Africa. In each rangeland, all woody plants in three 1250 m(2) plots were cut using saws and loppers, with the stumps treated with picloram. Paired observations were conducted in cleared and uncleared microsites. Soil samples were collected at three depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) in each microsite in April (pre-treatment), August, October and December 2016 and in April and August 2017. SSB was assessed using seedling emergence method, whereas pre-and post-clearing surveys of AGV were conducted in February 2016 and 2017, respectively. Results: Cleared microsites had significantly (p < 0.01) higher seed bank densities (1872 and 693 seeds m(-2) at Maseding and Kgomokgomo, respectively) relative to uncleared microsites in August 2017, with grasses accounting for higher densities than other plant functional groups in the upper 0-10 cm. Pioneer grasses (Aristida congesta subsp. barbicollis, Brachiaria eruciformis and Tragus berteronianus) and invasive forbs (Bidens pilosa and Schkuhria pinnata) dominated the SSB in cleared microsites at Maseding, whereas succulents (Portulaca spp.) and pioneer grasses (T. berteronianus and Urochloa mosambicensis) were abundant at Kgomokgomo in August 2017. SSB and AGV were dissimilar until December 2016; thereafter, similarity increased significantly (p < 0.05) in cleared microsites (Sorensen's coefficient = 0.60 to 0.66 at Maseding and 0.43 to 0.52 at Kgomokgomo) compared to uncleared microsites. Species diversity was highest in August 2016 and April 2017 at Maseding, but it did not differ between two microsites (p > 0.05). At Kgomokgomo, SSB was more diverse in cleared than uncleared microsites in April and August 2017. Conclusion: High seed bank densities in the upper soil layer in cleared microsites would promote passive restoration, but regeneration is likely to be initiated by early successional species. However, close monitoring and eradication of invasive forbs and succulents is necessary following bush clearing. The tendency of SSB resembling AGV over time in cleared microsites signifies that seed production from AGV is important for passive restoration following bush clearing.																		2192-1709				JAN 3	2020	9	1							1	10.1186/s13717-019-0204-6							WOS:000517817100001

Forb community responses to an extensive drought in two contrasting land-use types of a semi-arid Lowveld savanna	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Projected increases in the frequency and severity of drought events are expected to impose changes in the ecology of native forb communities in semi-arid ecosystems. We examined the state of forb communities during, and directly after an extreme drought event across two contrasting land-use types, which included a protected area (high diversity of free roaming wild herbivores) and communal rangeland (long history of intensive cattle grazing) in a semi-arid Lowveld savanna of the Gazankulu area, South Africa. Forb floristic data were collected towards the end of the drought and repeated after the drought release a few months later. Forb community composition was significantly different among land-use types. Community changes were not induced by annual forb emergence alone, but through species-specific dominance shifts, which differed among land-use types. Forb richness, diversity and biomass were equally low at both land-use types and increased significantly after the drought release, although the magnitude of response was much stronger in the protected area, whereas drought contributed to a directional change in the protected area with a complete post-drought turnover in both annual and perennial forb species, much less variability was observed in the communal rangeland, which may suggest long-term effects imposed by land-use history.

J	Khan, AR; Goldringer, I; Thomas, M				Khan, Abdul Rehman; Goldringer, Isabelle; Thomas, Mathieu			Management Practices and Breeding History of Varieties Strongly Determine the Fine Genetic Structure of Crop Populations: A Case Study Based on European Wheat Populations	SUSTAINABILITY												As the effects of climate change begin to be felt on yield stability, it is becoming essential to promote the use of genetic diversity in farmers' fields. The presence of genetic variability in variety could fulfil this purpose. Indeed, the level of intra-varietal genetic diversity influences the spatio-temporal stability of yields and the disease susceptibility of crop species. Breeding history of varieties and their management practices are two factors that should influence intra-varietal genetic diversity. This paper describes the genetic diversity of eight wheat samples covering a gradient from modern single varieties to on-farm mixtures of landraces. This gradient discriminates between landrace, historical and modern varieties, considering the breeding history of varieties, between single-varieties and mixtures of varieties, and between ex situ and in situ de facto strategy in terms of management practices. Genetic diversity of these samples was analyzed with the help of 41 single nucleotide polymorphism markers located in neutral regions, through computing genetic indices at three different levels: Allelic, haplotypic and genetic group level. Population structure and kinship were depicted using discriminant analysis and kinship network analysis. Results revealed an increase in the complexity of the genetic structure as we move on the gradient of variety types (from modern single variety to in situ on-farm mixtures of landraces). For the landraces, the highest levels of genetic diversity have been observed for a landrace (Solina d'Abruzzo) continuously grown on-farm in the region of Abruzzo, in Italy, for many decades. This landrace showed an excess of haplotypic diversity compared to landraces or the historical variety that were stored in genebanks (ex situ conservation). Genetic analyses of the mixtures revealed that, despite a very high selfing rate in wheat, growing in evolutionary mixtures promotes recombination between different genetic components of the mixture, a second way to increase the level of haplotype diversity. When management practices such as growing in mixture and on-farm management are combined, they substantially increase the different levels of genetic diversity of the populations (allelic, haplotypic, genetic group diversity), and consequently promote their adaptability. Our results confirm the need to develop and manage evolving diversified large populations on-farm. These results invite crop diversity managers such as genebank curators, community seed bank managers and farmers' organizations to adapt their management strategies to the type of variety they wish to manage, because we have shown that their choices have a strong influence on the genetic composition of the crop populations.

J	Mueller-Bieniek, A; Pyzel, J; Kapcia, M				Mueller-Bieniek, Aldona; Pyzel, Joanna; Kapcia, Magda			Chenopodium Seeds in Open-Air Archaeological Sites - How to Not Throw the Baby Out with the Bathwater	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Differentiating between charred and uncharred plant remains may appear straightforward but for some taxa (here fat-hen, Chenopodium album type) can be very problematic. Recognition of the preservation state is obviously crucial for archaeobotanical data derived from dry, open-air sites. Fat-hen as a common weed, is also one of the most important components of a persistent soil seed bank. It is also a well-known food plant, gathered or cultivated. Numerous findings of fat-hen seeds in unclear states of preservation were noted in the Early Neolithic sites of the Linear Pottery culture in Kuyavia (N Europe). In previous studies such specimens were omitted as probably uncharred. Re-examination of Neolithic finds of fat-hen from that region showed the link of their abundancy with the earliest phases of the Neolithic occupation. The plant probably played an important role in the diet of the early Neolithic settlers there. It may indicate intensive use of local, open, fertile, probably alluvial areas. Distinguishing between ancient and modern specimens of that common weedy plant, producing large amounts of small, black, resistant seeds is thus very important, holding a great potential to shed new light on the origins of agricultural societies in this part of northern Europe.

J	Kassa, G; Molla, E; Abiyu, A				Kassa, Getachew; Molla, Eyayu; Abiyu, Abrham			Effects of Eucalyptus tree plantations on soil seed bank and soil physicochemical properties of Qimbaba forest	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE												Qimbaba, a prioritized forest area in the northwest of Ethiopia. However, it is experiencing deforestation that limits restoration possibilities. Hence, a detailed assessment of soil seed bank composition and regeneration potential could permit to improve the management of the forests. The study aimed at comparing native with plantation relative to the soil seed bank, as well as their effect on soil properties. A total of 40 circular sample plots (314 m(2)) were established, half in the natural and half in the plantation forests. Aboveground vegetation was recorded in each plot. Samples were collected for the soil seed bank analysis in the litter layer and the top 9 cm of the soil (3 cm layers) and for soil analysis down to 30 cm (15 cm depths). Vegetation and soil seed bank composition were compared and the effect of forest type (natural vs plantation) on soil seed bank and soil physical and chemical parameters was evaluated. A total of 14 plant species (11 families) were recovered from the soil seed bank (12 species in the natural and 7 in plantation forest). The soil seed bank was not similar according to the Sorenson's similarity values. There were 11,022 and 10,667 seeds/m2 in the soil seed bank of the natural and plantation forest, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two forests in bulk density, CEC and P but SOC, N, and K were significantly higher in natural. Plantation forest pH was significantly lower than the natural forest.																	2331-1932					JAN 2	2020	5	1							1711297	10.1080/23311932.2019.1711297							WOS:000505946300001

A novel cellular automata approach: seed input/output of the alien species Leucaena leucocephala in the soil and the effects of climate changes	PLANT ECOLOGY												The potential impact of the soil seed bank of a given species and subsequent population persistence will depend on the robustness of the seeds against depletion. Invasiveness is frequently linked to this behavior and successful control of invasive species depends on reducing the size of their seed banks. We propose a hybrid model that simulates the seed bank dynamics in association with their physical dormancy (PD) based on experimental data on seed bank depletion of a Leucaena leucocephala population during the dispersal phase. The hybrid model uses cellular automata (CA) and Monte Carlo techniques. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the model delivers reproducible and reliable results. Then, we discuss the ability of the hybrid model to predict the effect of seasonal climate change. A 2.0 degrees C increase in temperature was enough to cause a considerable impact in the seed depletion curve, and after 1 year, similar to 75% of the seeds had already disappeared from the seed bank. The proposed hybrid CA model can be used to study soil-stored seed banks with physical dormancy, and could be applied to other Fabaceae species with similar seed traits. We believe that this computational model contributes to a better understanding of seed bank dynamics and will aid in the control of invasive species and for testing different scenarios to reduce or eliminate seed banks that have already been formed.

Conserving the holobiont	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Organismal biology has undergone a dramatic paradigm shift in the last decade. The realization that host cells and genes are outnumbered by symbiotic microbial cells and their genes has forced us to rethink our focus on 'individuals'. It is also becoming increasingly clear that the ecology and biology of animals and plants are intimately connected with their microbial partners. In the context of conserving functioning species, such revelatory insights beg the question-what exactly should we be trying to conserve? Here, we review how an understanding of host-microbe interactions can benefit conservation biology. We propose a way forward for conservation biologists, to gather evidence of the potential effects of changes to plant and animal microbiomes, and to incorporate the holobiont concept into applied conservation practice. In humans, microbes influence physiology, health, behaviour and psychology. In animals and plants, microbes similarly influence critically important components of health, communication and (in animals) behaviour. Together, the animal or plant and all of its associated micro-organisms are termed the holobiont. At the same time, humans are now the strongest evolutionary force on the planet, causing global change at unprecedented scale. We know that microbial diversity in humans has been compromised in urban societies, with a growing list of consequences for health and function. While we still have limited evidence for similar effects in plants and animals, anthropogenic factors that affect diversity are also likely to affect animal and plant microbiomes, with similar associated effects on host function and health. Microbiome research is still in its relative infancy, particularly in its application to plants and animals, yet the tools are becoming more widely available and affordable. Forward-looking conservation biologists could harness such tools and apply them to the study of plant and animal microbiomes with the goal of understanding which microbiota might be required to ensure future viability of conserved host populations. For now, the precautionary principle applies. We suggest that, to meaningfully and effectively conserve a species, we must also consider how to conserve the bacteria, viruses, fungi and other symbionts intimately associated with that macro-organism.

B	Biancardi, E		Biancardi, E; Panella, LW; McGrath, JM		Biancardi, Enrico			Cultivated Offspring	BETA MARITIMA: THE ORIGIN OF BEETS, 2ND EDITION												Sea beet was first harvested wild for leaves to be eaten as a vegetable and potherb. Once domestication had begun, root and hypocotyl were slowly enlarged through selection and used after cooking. Fodder and sugar beet appeared, respectively, around 1000 and 200 years ago in Central Europe. Sugar beet had become one of the more important crops and, consequently, was more studied and selected than the rest of the beet types. Some of the progresses obtained in breeding sugar beet (monogermy, male sterility, and some resistances) has been utilized for other types. Whether the interest shown today for the green fuels will develop it into another crop is yet to be determined.																			978-3-030-28748-1; 978-3-030-28747-4				2020							219	236		10.1007/978-3-030-28748-1_9	10.1007/978-3-030-28748-1						WOS:000653537700011						
J	Albrecht, H; Mademann, S; Weikl, H				Albrecht, Harald; Mademann, Sandra; Weikl, Helmut			Development of the arable vegetation 23 years after conversion from conventional to organic farming - experiences from a farm-scale case study in southern Germany	TUEXENIA												Recent meta-analyses assessing the impact of organic farming on plant species diversity showed that positive effects mainly occurred at a small scale while benefits at the farm or landscape level were less pronounced. The studies also detected that common species were more favored by organic farming than rare ones. In a farm scale study in southern Bavaria, Germany, we analyzed how the conversion to organic farming changed arable plant communities over a 23-years period and questioned the impact on weed management and species conservation. Vegetation sampling started two years before this conversion. At the end of the study period, crop cover had slightly decreased but yields of winter cereals (5.2 t/ha) still achieved 78% of the pre-organic harvest. Arable plant cover increased from 2 to 40% and the soil seed banks enlarged from 4200 to 33,300 seeds m(-2). Total numbers of plant species increased by 46% at the plot level and by 22% at the farm level, plant species characteristic of arable fields increased by 50% and 19%, respectively. Populations of both threatened and problematic plant species clearly profited from the conversion. Our results generally confirm that organic farming benefits plant biodiversity in arable land. Such benefits being more pronounced at the plot scale verifies previous studies, however, these effects were also visible over the whole arable area of the farm. A significant increase in the cover of insect-pollinated plants indicated that organic management can also support ecosystem functions. Our data prove that long-term organic farming can increase nature conservation value of the arable flora with only a moderate setback of crop yields.																	0722-494X						2020		40					291	308		10.14471/2020.40.005							WOS:000646853800014						
J	Sondej, I				Sondej, Izabela			Impact of wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting on a soil seed bank of oak-linden-hornbeam forest in the Bialowieza Forest	SYLWAN												The wild boar is an omnivorous animal that disturbs the top soil layer by foraging (rooting). In some regions of Europe seasonal fluctuations in rooting have been observed. Wild boars not only eat plants, but also strongly modify their habitat. In the Bialowieza Forest wild boar most frequently visit oak-hornbeam forests growing on fertile soil. On sites where the forest floor is covered with dense vegetation germination of seeds is difficult, and wild boar rooting can promote the removal of diaspores from deeper layers of the soil seed bank. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of wild boar rooting on the soil seed bank in a natural oak-linden-hornbeam forest. Observations were carried out on permanent plots in the strictly protected zone of the Bialowieza National Park. Samples of the soil seed bank were taken from plots which showed varying intensities of wild boar rooting (frequency and average percentage of exposed ground surface). Areas to be sampled were selected on the basis of archival data. Research was conducted by the seedling emergence method during two vegetation seasons. Altogether, 7985 seedlings of 67 taxa germinated from 240 soil samples. The highest number of germinated seedlings and species were found in the highly rooted plots. In all the series dominant species was Urtica dioica. In the soil seed bank 19 species of anemochory germinated, and accounted for 27.5% of all species present in the seed bank of all series. Permanent wild boar rooting increased the species richness in the soil seed bank and increased the amount of species with higher light requirements.

Distribution of common cocklebur and palmer amaranth seed exiting the combine for harvest weed seed control in soybean	CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT												Harvest weed seed control (HWSC) tactics are being investigated for herbicide resistance management by reducing the number of weed seeds entering the soil seedbank. Weed seed retention and the location where weed seeds exit the combine (chaff, straw, or grain) are factors influencing potential HWSC success. An experiment was conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Keiser, AR, to determine where the seeds of common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium I,.) and Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.) exited the combine during soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] harvest. Plots within soybean production fields containing infestations of common cocklebur and Palmer amaranth were harvested with a combine and the grain, chaff (top sieve), and straw (rotor) fractions were collected. The number of seeds in each fraction was determined for both species. The grain fraction contained 6 and 13% of the total Palmer amaranth and common cocklebur seed entering the combine, with 75 and 85% of the common cocklebur and Palmer amaranth seed, respectively, in the chaff fraction. As the chaff fraction is the target for many I IWSC systems (e.g., integrated Harrington Seed Destructor, chaff carts, chaff lining, and chaff tramlining), these proportions indicate the potential success of these systems. The HWSC systems that target all harvest residues (e.g. narrow windrow burning and bale direct) would potentially control high proportions of common cocklebur and Palmer amaranth seed (94 and 87% respectively) during harvest. Preventing this seed from entering the seedbank would improve weed management programs and lessen the likelihood of selecting for herbicide resistance.

Scott			Head-started Agassiz's desert tortoises Gopherus agassizii achieved high survival, growth, and body condition in natural field enclosures	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												We measured survival, growth, and body condition of 8 hatchling cohorts of desert tortoises Gopherus agassizii (living in predator-resistant outdoor pens in the Mojave Desert, California, USA) over 11 yr to evaluate head-starting methods. At 11 yr of age, 7 times as many of the first cohort had survived than if they had been free-living tortoises. Subsequent improvements in predator control, food and water supplementation, and pen structure increased survival from 7 to 10 times that under wild conditions in younger cohorts. Annual survival averaged 96%. Carapace length (CL) increased 6.95 mm yr-1, similar to that of free-living tortoises. Annual growth rates varied with calendar year (possibly reflecting food and water supply), age, cohort (year hatched), mother, and in 4 dry years, with crowding. Most of the first cohort grew to a releasable size (CL > 100 mm) by their 9th year. Body condition indices remained high, indicating little dehydration despite droughts in 8 of the 11 years, because irrigation offered drinking opportunities. Headstarted tortoises developed fully hardened shells (>= 98% of adult shell hardness) earlier (10.1 vs. 11.6 yr), but at a larger CL (117 vs. 104 mm) than did free-living tortoises. Selective feeding in head-start pens decreased subsequent germination of favored wildflower species, apparently by reducing the natural seedbank. Consequently, we reseeded and irrigated each autumn to promote subsequent spring food supply. We irrigated in early summer to enable drinking and ensuing consumption of dry, dead plants and Bermuda grass hay, a supplement. These procedures can greatly improve juvenile survivorship, and increase numbers of hard-shelled, midsized juveniles to help augment wild populations.																	1863-5407	1613-4796					2020	43						305	321		10.3354/esr01067							WOS:000619516900023

SSR-based evaluation of genetic diversity in populations of Agriophyllum squarrosum L. and Agriophyllum minus Fisch. & Mey. collected in South-East Kazakhstan	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII												The development of informative polymorphic DNA markers for poorly studied genera is an important step in population analyses of living organisms, including those that play very important ecological roles in harsh environments, such as desert and semi-desert area. Examples of those poorly studied desert species are Agriophyllum squarrosum L. and Agriophyllum minus Fisch. & Mey. However, a recent RNA-sequencing project in A. squarrosum has proposed a large set of hypothetical SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers. In this work, 11 novel polymorphic SSRs were found due to the screening of 24 randomly selected SSRs for three populations of A. squarrosum and one population of A. minus. The analysis of 11 SSRs revealed 16 polymorphic loci in two Agriophyllum species, 8 polymorphic loci within three populations of A. squarrosum, and 6 polymorphic loci in the population of A. minus. Statistical analyses showed high interspecific, but relatively low intraspecific genetic diversity. The phylogenetic clusterization and population structure analysis have demonstrated a clear segregation of A. minus from A. squarrosum, as well as the separation of population 1 from populations 2 and 3 of A. squarrosum. Thus, we identified the set of novel and informative SSR markers suitable for the study of genetic diversity in Agriophyllum. Key words: sand rice; Agriophyllum squarrosum; Agriophyllum minus; SSR markers; genetic diversity; population structure.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intercropping systems of maize with brachiaria or crotalaria on qualitative and quantitative parameters of the weed seedbank, along the succession of pearl millet, maize and common bean. Moreover, the effect of these crop rotation systems on the selection of specific weed species of the seedbank was also evaluated. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four replications. The treatments were represented by three cropping systems in succession: pearl millet, single maize, common bean; pearl millet, maize intercropped with brachiaria, common bean; pearl millet, maize intercropped with crotalaria, common bean. The following phytosociological indexes were calculated: density, frequency and relative importance, diversity and equitability. The grain yield of maize and common bean were also quantified. Twenty-three weed species were identified, divided into 12 families, highlighting the Poaceae one, with the most important being Alternanthera tenella, Commelina benghalensis, Eleusine indica and Phyllanthus tenellus. The cropping system with single maize presented a lower density and diversity of weeds, but with a high selection of E. indica. The intercropping systems in the previous crop, as a guarantee of a higher weed diversity, could be use as alternative tools, different from the herbicides, to control weeds and improve the common bean yield. Regarding the weed control in the common bean, Crotalaria spectabilis presented better results in the previous maize-intercropping system than Urochloa ruziziensis.

These samples were kept in greenhouse and monitored for eight months. The seed bank was registered according to the seedling emergence method. TIF presented the greatest richness of trees, while in the other transects there was a predominance of herbaceous and anemochorous species. We observed the occurrence of exotic species in the bank. The low richness of tree species in the reforestation seed bank, despite its proximity to a conserved fragment, suggests that management actions should be evaluated and implemented in order to accelerate the successional process.

At 30 days after sowing the germination percentage was evaluated and the data were submitted for analysis of variance. The B. tuberculata seeds germinated at all concentrations of agar and storage periods evaluated, presenting average germination above 70%. Germination percentage decreases with increasing storage period and agar concentrations. Thus, for in vitro sowing of this species, seeds stored for up to 30 days are recommended, regardless of the agar concentration used in the culture medium.																		2446-8231					2020	75								e2020017	10.21826/2446-82312020v75e2020017							WOS:000592437500017

Response of imidazolinone-resistant and -susceptible weedy rice populations to imazethapyr and increased atmospheric CO2	PLANTA DANINHA												Background: Weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the main weed of rice crop. The high genetic variability of weedy rice contributes to the high phenotypic diversity between biotypes and different responses to environmental stress. Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the response of imidazolinone-susceptible and -resistant weedy rice populations to increased atmospheric [CO2]. Methods: The experiment was arranged in a complete randomized design with six replications. The treatments included two [CO2] concentration (700 and 400 mu mol mol(-1)) and three treatments: resistant genotype (IMI-resistant) treated with imazethapyr; resistant genotype without imazethapyr, and a susceptible genotype without imazethapyr. Results: The IMI-resistant and -susceptible weedy rice responded similarly to [CO2] enrichment. Enhanced [CO2] increased competitive ability of the weedy rice populations tested, by means of increased plant height. Weedy rice seed production also increased with enhanced [CO2] by means of increased photosynthesis rate and reduced transpiration (increased water use efficiency). Increased seed production also means increased weed persistence as it increases the soil seedbank size. The application of imazethapyr on IMI-resistant weedy rice did not alter its response to [CO2]; conversely, increased [CO2] did not change the resistance level of weedy rice to imazethapyr. High [CO2] increased spikelet sterility, but this beneficial effect was negated by the overall increase in production of filled grains. Conclusions: Enhanced [CO2] concentrations increases weedy rice growth, photosynthesis rates, seed production and spikelet sterility; the imidazolinone application does not affect the response of weedy rice to enhanced [CO2] affects weedy rice response to imidazolinone herbicide.				de Avila, Luis Antonio/E-2892-2010	de Avila, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-2532-7152; Burgos, Nilda/0000-0002-6977-6873; Piveta, Leonard/0000-0002-6238-0710; Refatti, Joao/0000-0002-0770-556X												0100-8358	1806-9681					2020	38								e020215165	10.1590/S0100-83582020380100078							WOS:000595918400001

RARE AND PROTECTED VASCULAR PLANTS IN YUGYD VA NATIONAL PARK (RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Yugyd va National Park is one of the largest Protected Areas in Russia and Europe, created in 1994. In 1995 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage site "Virgin Komi Forests". Due to its large area (about 20 000 km(2)) and remoteness, the flora of the Yugyd va National Park still remains insufficiently studied. Systematic studies of its natural complexes have been carried out since 2005. This paper presents data on the composition and distribution of rare and protected species of vascular plants listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, Red Data Book of the Republic of Komi and Appendices to them in the Yugyd va National Park. We found 120 species of rare and protected vascular plants in the Yugyd va National Park. We recorded 31 taxa listed in the Appendix of the Red Data Book of the Republic of Komi. Among them, there are endemics of the Arctic, Urals, North-East of European Russia, as well as Pleistocene relicts. A high number of plant populations are located on the border of species' ranges or their isolated fragments. Yugyd va National Park provides a territorial protection for nine species included in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and its Appendix. The Protected Area plays an important role in preservation of plant populations of the narrow-ranged Arctic endemics Astragalus gorodkovii and Castilleja arctica subsp. vorkutensis. More than a third of all the rare species known in the Yugyd va National Park are under protection in the adjacent Russian regions of the Urals and the North-East of European Russia. In the Republic of Komi, Erysimum pallasii, Kobresia myosuroides, Drauba pauciflora, Achoriphragma nudicaule, Petasites sibiricus, Carex atrofusca, C. williamsii, C. krausei, C. misandra, Gastrolychnis affinis, Oxytropis merlensiana are known exclusively in the Yugyd va National Park. In the mountainous area of its northern part (Kozhim River basin), there are unique locations of Neotorularia humilis and Oxygraphis glacialis for Europe, and an unique location of Kobresia sinipliciuscula for the Republic of Komi. These species could be lost due to the planned exclusion of the Kozhimsky mining site from the area of the Yugyd va National Park. As additional measures to preserve the biological and genetic diversity of a number of particularly the most threatened taxa, it is necessary to develop species conservation programmes, monitor and restore populations, as well as to create a seed bank, and introduce these species to culture.

Scientists have not yet reached a consensus on the definition of biodiversity; therefore, we will discuss various interpretations. Most biodiversity studies have focused on species diversity, but biodiversity has a more comprehensive aspect. Due to the extinction of plant and animal species, climate change, air pollution, advances in technology and industry, development of agricultural and urban lands, and changing human attitudes toward species, ecosystems, and landscapes, biodiversity has become a more attractive topic for researchers over the last decade. When diversity is being measured, a precise taxonomic classification of the subject must be made. Although many diversity indices and models have been proposed to quantify diversity, many of them confuse researchers. The use of new approaches, such as considering functional and genetic characteristics (functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity, respectively) has revealed hidden functions, services, and sustainability of ecosystems. These valuable measures have also created new issues. The variety of introduced indices and the multidimensionality of ecosystem services, and the different roles of species in other ecosystem functions have raised new questions and numerous complexities. Therefore, researchers have tended to use multidimensional and trans-ecosystem approaches. In this review article, the definitions and concepts of biodiversity and its historical background are presented, and then new ideas, challenges, and opportunities are discussed.																		2588-3526					2020	4	4					26	39		10.22120/jwb.2020.123209.1124							WOS:000592017800003

Most of the weeds (indigenous and invasive) seeds get preserved in soil horizons as weed seed bank which ensure their survival leading to the spoilage of quantitative and qualitative functioning of agricultural farms. Objective: To keep weeds below threshold level, elimination of weeds seed before germination can be a viable and pro-ecological approach. To achieve this objective, weed seeds reserved in the soil which serve as an effective pool to ensure their survival necessitate weed-seed bank management. Thus the ultimate goal was to synthesize and analyze research findings on weed seed bank management leading to formulating the most effective strategy encompassing viable control of weeds in maize. Methods: This study reviewed and analyzed the characteristics which impart botanical superiority to weeds and impact of all prevalent weed control strategies on weed seed bank, weeds density and maize yield. The research findings pertaining to different agronomic practices and technological packages were critically analyzed to sort out the most effective and eco-friendly approach to control weed-seed bank and weeds density in maize crop. Results: The synthesis and critical evaluation of research findings pertaining to weed control methods revealed that manual and mechanical methods were eco-friendly but involved expensive labor, while the chemical approach involving the use of herbicides led to serious deterioration of agro-environmental resources. Two or more techniques used in coherence which encompassed deep tillage to burry weeds seed and prevented their germination through mulches of biotic and synthetic materials along with optimizing sowing method especially raised bed technique reduced weed seed bank and weeds density in maize. Conclusions: It is inferred that integrated approach entailing cultural, manual, mechanical and chemical control can be developed as a pro environmental and farmer friendly approach for weed control by reducing weed seed reserves which can potentially lead to higher economic returns through higher maize yield.

We show that by using Entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) together with the Gittins index, agents can make intelligent decisions about whether to exploit the estimated distribution of weeds in the environment or to explore new areas of the environment. The use of this method improves the performance of agents in comparison to previous methods, resulting in a system which can weed denser fields using fewer robots. Furthermore, we show that for the reward function and environmental dynamics which represent the weeding problem, our system is able to perform comparably to the fully observed case over the real -world range of seed bank densities, while operating under partial observability.

Seed exploration and conservation in Ciremai Mountain National Park and Kerinci Seblat National Park	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOSCIENCES	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				3rd International Conference on Biosciences (ICoBio) - Innovation in Biosciences towards Industrial Revolution 4.0	AUG 08, 2019	Bogor, INDONESIA	IPB Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Biol, IPB Univ, Int Collaborat Off				Seed storage at a seed bank facility is one of the ex-situ bioresources conservation strategies in the world's Botanical Gardens. Enrichment of species for seed banks is done through exploration in various forest areas. The exploration and conservation of seeds have been done in Ciremai Mountain National Park (CMNP) on November 7-16th, 2016 and Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP) on April 11-20th, 2017. This research aims to search and collect plant seeds and to know the diversity of species from fruiting plants and seeds. Furthermore, this exploration also aims to study a biological seed that support conservation efforts for these plants. Research used an exploratory method at each location. The recording of ecological data includes habitat, altitude, soil pH, soil moisture, and air temperature. This study obtained thirty-two (32) collection numbers in the CMNP area consisted of 20 families and 28 genera; and thirty-three (33) collection numbers consisted of 21 families and 31 genera in the KSNP area. Most of the seeds found are orthodox seeds that can be stored for a relatively long time.																	1755-1307						2020	457								012026	10.1088/1755-1315/457/1/012026							WOS:000562379500026

Conservation in the wake of myrtle rust - a case study on two critically endangered Australian rainforest plants	PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We investigatedex situconservation options for two Australian rainforest species severely affected by myrtle rust in the wild - Rhodamnia rubescens(Benth.) Miq. andRhodomyrtus psidioides(G.Don) Benth. Both species were successfully initiated into tissue culture though the rate of contamination was high and not significantly improved by the disinfection techniques tested. Explants surviving initiation grew well on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS; pH 6.0) with 30 g L-1 sucrose, 1 mu m benzyl adenine and 0.2 mu m indole-3-butyric acid. Culture ofR. rubescensfor eight weeks on MS with 0, 5, 10 or 20 mu m indole-3-butyric acid resulted in root production for some plantlets, and successful transfer to potting mix; no significant differences in root production among treatments were detected. Both species were successfully propagated by semi-hardwood cuttings with strike rates of 0-67% forR. rubescensand 0-75% forR. psidioides. ForR. rubescens, pretreatment of cuttings with Zaleton(R)and incubation in Preforma(R) plugs reduced the time to root development and significantly improved the strike rate (P = 0.001). R. rubescensseed proved to be orthodox and suitable for standard seedbanking;R. psidioidesseed proved to be freezing sensitive but suitable for storage at 4 degrees C. As the two species now produce few viable seeds in the wild, however, conservation by seedbanking will first require the establishment of a seed orchard from vegetatively propagated plants. We recommend swift action to conserve species in the Pacific similarly affected by myrtle rust before their growth and reproductive capacity are seriously diminished.

J	Wang, M; Wang, SZ; Wang, GD; Jiang, M				Wang, Ming; Wang, Shengzhong; Wang, Guodong; Jiang, Ming			Soil seed banks and restoration potential of tussock sedge meadows after farming in Changbai Mountain, China	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Vast tracts of the wettest agricultural fields have been abandoned worldwide, hence knowledge of their restoration potential is becoming important. Soil seed banks can be important components of ecological restoration, particularly if the seeds of key structural dominants can survive periods of cultivation. In Changbai Mountain, China, we compared the seed banks and standing vegetation between natural sedge meadows and adjacent paddy fields under drained and flooded conditions. The tussock-forming sedge Carex schmidtii dominated plant communities in the natural sedge meadows. However, this key structural dominant species was not found in the paddy fields. Other important wetland species survived cultivation as seeds (e.g. Cyperus fuscus, Lythrum salicaria and Sagittaria trifolia). Species of various life history types require either drawdown (emergent; e.g. C. schmidtii) or flooding (e.g. Potamogeton pectinatus) for successful germination. This study indicates that the seed banks of farmed sedge meadows could contribute towards the establishment of new wetland vegetation assemblages. Active revegetation of sedge meadow, particularly the native tussock-forming Carex, and changes in environmental conditions are necessary to support the region's biodiversity.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2020	71	9					1099	1106		10.1071/MF19025							WOS:000562536400005

J	Tibugari, H; Chiduza, C; Mashingaidze, AB				Tibugari, Handsen; Chiduza, Cornelius; Mashingaidze, Arnold Bray			A survey of problem weeds of sorghum and their management in two sorghum-producing districts of Zimbabwe	COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES												Sorghum is an important staple food crop in dry areas of Zimbabwe but yields are reduced due to inefficient weed management strategies that largely rely on hand weeding. A study to establish weeds associated with sorghum and their management was conducted in two sorghum-growing districts, Insiza and Chipinge, during the 2016/17 cropping season. Physical weed sampling in farmers' fields was done to identify weeds infesting sorghum. A questionnaire was used to collect survey data from 80 respondents who were randomly selected. Physical weed sampling established that the dominant weeds that infested sorghum in the two districts wereAmaranthus hybridus, Richardia scabra, Tagetes minuta, Striga asiatica, Commelina benghalensis, Eleusine indica, Datura stramoniumandPanicumspp. Many of the weeds are broadleaf species, offering opportunity to harness sorghum allelopathy for weed control. Allelopathic compounds exuded by sorghum, such as sorgoleone, have been proven to largely suppress broadleaf weeds. There has been little change in the weed spectrum in sorghum when results of the current study are compared to benchmark national weed survey of arable lands of the smallholder farms of Zimbabwe conducted in 1988. This indicates possibility of high persistence of the soil seedbank. The majority of farmers in the two districts (85%) controlled weeds by hand weeding, indicating a very limited shift towards adopting alternative weed management technologies since 1990 when an inventory of weed science technological needs for communal farmers was compiled. Smallholder sorghum growers may need to broaden their weed management strategies in order to overcome some of the challenges that are associated with hand weeding.																	2331-1886					JAN 1	2020	6	1							1738840	10.1080/23311886.2020.1738840							WOS:000560189600001

In the river ecosystem, aboveground vegetation and soil seed banks have a low similarity. However, there are species found only in soil seed banks without above-ground vegetation. Therefore, the soil seed banks are regarded to support biodiversity. In addition, the formation of soil seed banks and ground-level vegetation in the stream has been simplified after the flood, but it has been studied that the flood functions to maintain the native vegetation of the stream as the number of aquatic plants has increased. The Blanket Bog moorlands in the UK are well-developed peat layers that play an important role in controlling the global carbon concentration. In the second study, we proposed the appropriate intervals of prescribed burning to maintain Sphagnum species, the main species forming peat layers, and the Calluna vulgaris community, which provides essential ecosystem services. Finally, the dispersal trend of alien invasive plants along the road was studied using the hand sorting seed count method. The alien invasive plants are introduced during the road construction and they tend to spread according to the movement of the vehicle and the road conditions. We found that the unique 'tubular' structure of the road enables the long-distance dispersal in a relatively short time. As such, the study of seed banks in the soil can be applied in various ways, providing a clue to the solution of phenomena occurring in the ecosystem. There are considerations, such as the inability to identify all seeds in the soil samples and the fact that the dominant above-vegetation species may differ from the soil seed bank in an ecosystem. However, there are advantages, such as providing information for predicting potential vegetation, and it takes relatively short time with less than four months, in common, to evaluate.

Seed size an important factor for the germination response of legume seeds subjected to simulated post-fire soil temperatures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Potential impacts of soil temperatures in a post-fire environment were examined for seeds of legume species with a physical seed dormancy typically found in the eucalypt communities in eastern Australia. Soil temperatures in a post-fire environment may be elevated owing to increased solar radiation and this may influence germination of species with soil-stored seed banks. Seeds were heated at 50, 60 or 70 degrees C, with one unheated control, for 3 h per day for 5 days to simulate soil temperatures where canopy gaps existed. More germination of small-seeded species (<12.6 mg) occurred owing to changes in simulated soil temperatures than large-seeded species (>14.0 mg). Temperatures up to 70 degrees C significantly increased the germination of species with relatively small-sized seeds than large-seeded species (>70 degrees C). This study demonstrated that small-seeded species are able to germinate across a range of temperatures (50-70 degrees C) and can have dormancy broken either during the passage of a fire, or after fire from increased solar radiation, potentially resulting in the decline of the post-fire residual soil seed bank. In contrast, post-fire germination of large-seeded species may be dependent solely on the degree of soil heating during the passage of fire and the species may have a relatively stable residual soil seed bank thereafter.

REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS OF THE INVASIVE SPECIES ACACIA DEALBATA LINK. IN THE NORTHERN MEDITERRANEAN BASIN	ANNALI DI BOTANICA												Among the many exotic plants introduced in the last two centuries in Northern Mediterranean Basin Acacia dealbata Link. is one of the most invasive. Despite its presence in the region since many years., it has not yet been investigated how the species has established itself and has formed small forests. In this study, we aimed to gather data on reproductive trait of the invasive species A. dealbata at the northern limit of the Mediterranean bioclimatic region. In six naturalized populations, fruit and seed set were estimated and seed germination was tested in laboratory. Two out of the six populations failed to set fruits, and the fruit set was always low as observed in other invaded areas of the world. Only three populations produced germinating seeds whose rates were comparable to other invasive areas. The seeds may constitute a long-lasting seed bank that may favour the colonization of the species in areas disturbed by external factors. In conclusion. the reproductive system may contributes only partially to the spread and invasiveness of the species in the Northern Mediterranean basin, while the plant to spread itself adopts also other vegetative strategies.

Twenty samples (20cm x 20cm) were collected inside each forest restored in randomly distributed points, at a depth of 0 to 5cm, considering the litter. After being placed in plastic trays, the samples were irrigated and monitored daily for a period of approximately three months (90 days). The species were also evaluated according to their dispersal syndrome, adopting the morphological criteria of the fruits as anemocoric, zoochoric, and autocoric, besides being classified according to the way of life and origin. Seed bank diversity was estimated through Shannon diversity index (H') and Pielou Equity (J'). These analyzes were performed using the Fitopac 2.0 program. It was found that the composition of the herbaceous community varied with the localities, being the highest viable seed density for this class observed in Ivinhema, where the seed bank was composed mainly of spontaneous herbs from anthropized areas around the area and high density of seeds. seedlings of the Poaceae family, with four distinct species.

The restored area of Caarapo presented different vegetation classes and the presence of important succession components such as trees and vines. In the three seed banks evaluated, there was the presence of tree species representing an advance in the successional process of each area.				dos Santos, Bruna Souza/AAR-4466-2021	dos Santos, Bruna Souza/0000-0001-8170-2554; LOPES FERNANDES, SHALINE SEFARA/0000-0001-8525-404X												0103-9954	1980-5098				JAN-MAR	2020	30	1					104	116		10.5902/1980509832896							WOS:000537868000008

Evaluation of the growth response of arid zone invasive species Salvia verbenaca cultivars to atmospheric carbon dioxide and soil moisture	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Although climate change is expected to affect the ecology of many weed species, the nature and scale of these responses is presently not well defined. This presages a suite of potential problems for the agricultural industries. Consequently, we investigated the effects of anticipated climate change on biomass and seed production, for two varieties of wild sage, Salvia verbenaca L. var. verbenaca and Salvia verbenaca var. vernalis Bioss. For the investigation, ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) carbon dioxide conditions, in combination with well-watered (100% field capacity) and drought conditions (60% field capacity), were selected to represent alternative climate scenarios. The alteration in biomass production was represented by a combined measurement of nine variables; plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, number of branches, leaf area, leaf thickness, shoot biomass, root biomass and dry leaf weight, and fecundity was measured via two variables; 100 seed weight and number of seeds per plant. All biomass measurements were reduced in a drought situation compared with well-watered conditions in ambient carbon dioxide (400 ppm), and each corresponding measurement was greater under elevated carbon dioxide (700 ppm) regardless of water treatment. In contrast, this was not observed for 100 seed weight or number of seeds per plant. Although a similar profile of a reduction in fecundity parameters was observed under drought conditions compared with well-watered conditions in ambient carbon dioxide, there was an increase in seed mass only for var. verbenaca under elevated carbon dioxide in both water treatments. In addition, there was a very small increase in the number of seeds in this species under drought conditions in elevated carbon dioxide, with neither increase in seed mass or seed number being observed in var. vernalis. These results suggest that although future climate change may result in increased competition of both these varieties with desirable plants, their management strategies will need to focus on effects of increased size of the weeds, rather than only attempting to reduce the seed bank holdings.

Key findings were that weed density within crops was low, with 72% of cropping paddocks containing fewer than 10 grass weeds/m(2) at anthesis. Weed density and herbicide resistance were not correlated, despite the most abundant grass weed species (annual ryegrass, Lolium rigidum Gaudin) testing positive for resistance to at least one herbicide chemistry in 92% of monitored paddocks. A wide range of herbicides were used (369 unique combinations) suggesting that the diversity of herbicide modes of action may be beneficial for reducing further development of herbicide resistance. However, there was a heavy reliance on glyphosate, the most commonly applied active ingredient. Of concern, in respect to the evolution of glyphosate resistant weeds, was that 45% of glyphosate applications to canola were applied as a single active ingredient and area sown to canola in Western Australia expanded from 0.4 to 1.4 million hectares from 2005 to 2015. In order to minimise the weed seed bank within crops, pastures were used infrequently in some regions and in 50% of cases pastures were actively managed to reduce weed seed set, by applying a non-selective herbicide in spring. The use of non-selective herbicides in this manner also kills pasture plants, consequently self-regenerating pastures were sparse and contained few legumes where cropping intensity was high. Overall, the study indicated that land use selection and utilisation of associated weed management actions were being used successfully to control weeds within the survey area. However, to successfully manage herbicide resistant weeds land use has become less diverse, with pastures utilised less and crops with efficacious weed control options utilised more. Further consideration needs to be given to the impacts of these changes in land use on other production factors, such as soil nutrient status and plant pathogens to assess sustainability of these weed management practices in a wider context.				; Rose, Michael/P-2161-2016; Renton, Michael/A-9979-2011	Flower, Kenneth/0000-0002-7477-9921; Rose, Michael/0000-0001-6457-145X; Scanlan, Craig/0000-0002-2199-9939; Renton, Michael/0000-0003-1316-0145												1836-0947	1836-5795					2020	71	5					491	505		10.1071/CP19509							WOS:000537283800008

The goal of this work was to generate an update of weedy ferns from Argentina, including morphology, distribution, and type of weed according to their impact on natural habitats and/or human activities. All Argentinian fern species were analyzed based on references, herbarium specimens, and field trips. As a result of our study 25 species were recorded from Argentina and classified as segetal, ecological, or aquatic weeds, and ruderal and/or toxic species. Current taxonomic identity, diagnostic characters, origins, habitats, geographical distribution, common names, and impact and potential risks were indicated by species. In addition, we provide a dichotomous key to species, presence of these species in southern South American countries, as well as and photographs in natural habitat. This work represents the first review on native and exotic ferns from Argentina that cause an impact on human activities or disturbe native habitats. The results provide information for the development of weed management tools and priority areas to implement them.

The ecological restoration and stabilization of an intact vegetation layer on steep slopes with the soil seed bank is therefore an important factor for functional high mountain ecosystems. We analyze the relationships between the soil seed bank composition, topography, and land use and compare the plant species composition of the aboveground vegetation to the soil seed bank. Study area: Stepantsminda, Georgia, Greater Caucasus (1,800-2,500 m a.s.l.). Methods: 74 grassland vegetation releves (5 x 5 m) on steep high mountain slopes were compared to the respective persistent soil seed bank (05 cm depth), assessed via the seedling emergence method. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and vector fitting uncovered the relationships between topography, land use, and soil on the seed bank and aboveground vegetation composition. The similarity between both datasets was assessed with a Mantel test. Vegetation types were described with indicator species analysis for both aboveground and belowground plant species composition. Results: Exposure to the north and incoming solar radiation relate to seed bank composition, as well as the belowground species diversity, whereas the effect of land use on the soil seed bank remains unclear. The similarity between the aboveground vegetation and the soil seed bank is generally low (18% shared species, Mantel test r = 0.21, no common indicator species). Conclusions: The higher seed density and belowground species richness on intensively illuminated and pastured south-exposed slopes imply a higher restoration potential in the case of disturbance events such as mass-wasting. However, the overall moderate diversity within the soil seed bank challenges the restoration of the aboveground grassland, especially on north-exposed slopes.

Floodplain meadow restoration revisited: Long-term success of large scale application of diaspore transfer with plant material in restoration practice	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Rare and endangered floodplain meadows have been a focus of previous restoration projects, but knowledge about the long-term development of newly created meadows is scarce. We studied the long-term development of sites restored via the transfer of seed-containing plant material on former arable fields and former species-poor grassland. We analyzed the long-term development of the vegetation and tested the differences between former land-use types and former preparatory treatments. In former arable fields, we studied the influence of sowing with a grass seed mixture. In former species-poor grassland, we tested the effect of topsoil disturbance by rotovation to inhibit competition by the resident grassland vegetation. Restoration was generally successful with mean transfer rates (number of meadow species at restoration site/number of meadow species at donor site) of 60%, increased species richness, and high proportions of plant material species in the vegetation. Transfer rates were similar between arable fields and former species-poor grassland, though the number of target species for restoration (typical and/or endangered species) was higher in former arable fields. Communities on grassland sites developed more slowly but were more resilient against flooding. Sowing the grass seed mixture had no influence on restoration success on former arable fields, and the positive effects of rotovating on former species-poor grassland decreased over time. We conclude that the transfer of seed-containing plant material is an adequate method to restore species-rich grasslands that are resilient enough to persevere under floodplain dynamics.

Biology of Brassica tournefortii in the northern grains region of Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Brassica tournefortii Gouan. (wild turnip, WT) has become a problematic weed in the no-till production systems of the northern grains region of Australia. Experiments were undertaken using different biotypes of B. tournefortii to examine its phenology, emergence and seedbank persistence. Biotypes were obtained from paddocks of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (WT1 and WT9) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) (WT1/17 and WT2/17). Fresh seeds initially had high dormancy rates and persisted for a short period on the surface. Seedbank persistence increased with burial depth, with 39% of seeds remaining for WT1 and 5% for WT9 after 30 months at 2 cm depth. Persistence of buried seeds varied across biotypes; WT1/17 seedlings also emerged in the second growing season from 2 cm depth. Compared with buried seeds, seedlings readily emerged from the surface (in March-June following increased rainfall) within 6 months of planting. Emergence was greatest on the surface and varied between biotypes and tillage systems; the highest rate recorded was similar to 14%. Multiple cohorts were produced between February and October. No-till systems produced higher emergence rates than conventional tillage systems. Seedlings of B. tournefortii did not emerge from 5 cm soil depth; therefore, diligent tillage practices without seedbank replenishment could rapidly reduce the presence of this weed. A soil-moisture study revealed that at 25% of water-holding capacity, B. tournefortii tended to produce sufficient seeds for reinfestation in the field. Brassica tournefortii is a cross-pollinated species, and its wider emergence time and capacity to produce enough seeds in a dry environment enable it to become widespread in Australia. Early cohorts (March) tended to have vigorous growth and high reproduction potential. This study found B. tournefortii to be a poor competitor of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), having greater capacity to compete with the slow-growing crop chickpea. Therefore, control of early-season cohorts and use of rotations with a more vigorous crop such as wheat may reduce the seedbank. The information gained in this study will be important in developing better understanding of seed ecology of B. tournefortii for the purpose of developing integrated management strategies.																	1836-0947	1836-5795					2020	71	3					268	277		10.1071/CP19451							WOS:000526575700007

Plant colonization of a restored wetland in northern Kentucky: Contribution of seeding vs. natural sources	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Despite their important ecosystem services, most wetlands in Kentucky and the surrounding region have been lost. Many restoration attempts have occurred, but the success of seeding or planting, which is often done alter restoration, is unclear. To our knowledge, seeding success relative to other propagule inputs has never been quantified. We measured the restoration success of a four-year-old emergent open-canopy wetland, with seven adjacent ponds near the banks of the Ohio River in Kentucky. Potential restoration plant origins include (a) from the seedbank and surrounding area, (b) a native seed mix designed for upland and wetland restorations, and (c) from the onsite prerestoration wetland. We tested the hypotheses that elevation and distance from an established wetland pond are driving factors to establish species that dominate the wetland vegetative cover. Plant cover and relative elevation were determined in 78 1-m(2) plots. Although most species (73%) came either from scedbank or offsite sources, the remainder appear to have come from seeding (14-16%) and the prerestoration wetland (11-14%), and the latter two sources accounted for almost 50% of the total cover at the site. Ordination supported the hypotheses that distance from the prerestoration pond and relative elevation were the two most important factors determining patterns of plant cover. Despite its modest contribution to plant diversity, the prerestoration pond had an important effect on plant patterns. While the site falls into Kentucky Wetland Rapid Assessment ( KY-WRAM) Category 1 (most disturbed), prevalence index (PI) scores, which are based on species wetland classifications, appear to be similar to or higher than those of other created wetlands in the United States.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JAN-MAR	2020	147	1					9	21		10.3159/1095-5674-147.1.9							WOS:000526063800002

But the economic values of these important benefits of church forests were not well documented. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate the mean and total willingness to pay for church forest conservation using open-ended and double bounded contingent valuation formats. In doing so, both cash and labour contributions were used to measure the respondents' willingness to pay. Primary data were collected from 300 randomly selected households and analyzed using descriptive statistics and bivariate probit model. The estimated mean willingness to pay from the double bounded format (239.79 Ethiopian Birr) is higher than from the open-ended format (178 Ethiopian Birr). Similarly, the estimated mean willingness to contribute labour was also 71.51 and 94.34 man-days for the open-ended and double bounded contingent valuation format, respectively. The comparison indicated that the mean and total willingness to pay from the double bounded format is higher than in the open-ended format. Therefore, researchers, policymakers, and forestry experts should give special attention to the double bounded format rather than to the open-ended format to elicit respondents' willingness to pay for the conservation of church forests.

Physicochemical Analysis and Essential Oils Extraction of the Gorse (Ulex europaeus) and French Broom (Genista monspessulana), Two Highly Invasive Species in the Colombian Andes	SUSTAINABILITY												Gorse (Ulex europaeus) and French broom (Genista monspessulana) are two highly invasive species that have become a threat to tropical countries, especially in Andean ecosystems. This research focused on providing a physicochemical characterization and essential oils extraction of both species to better understand their potential valorization and guide further environmental management efforts. For this purpose, the following analyses were conducted for both species: higher heat value (HHV), elemental analysis, proximate analysis, thermogravimetric analysis to obtain constituent natural polymers (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin), and extraction of essential oils and other interest chemical compounds through supercritical fluids. Ecological closeness was found between the two species mostly regarding HHV, fixed carbon, and volatile matter, which calls for similar potential uses. Both species were also found to be suitable for combustion processes, gasification, extraction of chemical compounds, and use of lignocellulosic content; however, only U. europaeus appeared suitable for activated carbon obtention. Therefore, this work provided relevant data that can be used as preliminary basis to establish strong scientifically-based management and control strategies for these two invasive species. We recommend focusing primarily on thermal processes such as pyrolysis, gasification, or combustion, and also essential oils extractions of acetic acid, dodecanoic acid, anagyrine, amylene hydrate, caulophylline, and maltol in the future.

We show that the simultaneous switching mechanism leads to a new jump-diffusion limit for the scaled frequency processes, extending the classical Wright-Fisher and seed bank diffusion limits. We further establish a new dual coalescent structure with multiple activation and deactivation events of lineages. While this seems reminiscent of multiple merger events in general exchangeable coalescents, it actually leads to an entirely new class of coalescent processes with unique qualitative and quantitative behaviour. To illustrate this, we provide a novel kind of condition for coming down from infinity for these coalescents, applying a recent approach of Griffiths [12].																	1083-6489						2020	25								27	10.1214/19-EJP401							WOS:000519777000001

In Caatinga, this species occurs in areas where melons are cultivated, and even after deforestation, they may be present in the soil seed bank. The aim of this study was to investigate the allelopathic activity of A. cearensis aqueous seed extract fractions on the emergence of melons and to carry out photochemical analyses of the extracts. Four experiments were carried out based on the fractionation of the seed extract: E1 - hexane fraction, E2 - dichloromethane fraction, E3 - ethyl acetate fraction, and E4 - aqueous fraction. The statistical design was completely randomized, with four replicates, each having 20 seeds. The treatments were composed of different extract concentrations (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0%) and phytochemical prospecting of the extracts obtained during fractionation was performed. The extracts obtained from the hexane fraction affected the emergence and initial development of melon seedlings. The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts had negative effects on the formation of dry matter, shoots, and roots, with the highest concentrations prompting the most negative effects. Coumarin was present in all extracts, but its concentration was highest in the hexane fraction, which was consequently characterized as highly phytotoxic during the bioassays.

Changes in soil propagule banks with depth can indicate the state of past vegetation and potentially demonstrate the effects of different land uses on the soil profile. Here, we examined changes in soil propagule banks down the soil-depth profile in an Australian floodplain wetland with five different land-use histories, ranging from a, in this case, relatively minor disturbance (clearing) through to more major disturbance (continuous cultivation). Land use had a larger influence than floodplain geomorphology on the propagule distribution of wetland plant-group numbers. An observed decrease in individuals over the depth profile also altered terrestrial plant groups in fields with longer land-use histories. Overall, soil-propagule profiles for terrestrial plants were not as affected by land use as were those of wetland plants. The geomorphological position on the floodplain also altered the soil propagule bank, with areas subject to the most flooding having the highest number of wetland species and retaining more of these species with greater depths. In conclusion, land-use impacts alter soil-propagule banks down the profile, despite most studies focussing on the top few centimetres.

We estimated the proportion of weed seeds that could be removed at oat harvest. The seed production and shedding pattern of Fallopia convolvulus, Sinapis arvensis, Spergula arvensis and Stellaria media, were assessed in two spring oat fields in Denmark during 2018 and 2019. Ten randomly chosen plants of each species were surrounded by a porous net before flowering. The start time of seed shedding was recorded, and the seeds were collected from the nets and counted weekly until oat harvest. Just before harvest, the retained seeds on the weed plants were counted. The ratio between harvestable seeds and shed seeds during the growing season was determined. On average 260, 195, 411 and 316 seeds plant(-1) were produced by F. convolvulus, Sinapis arvensis, Spergula arvensis and S. media, respectively, of which in average 44%, 67%, 45% and 56% of the seeds were retained on the plants at harvest.

During the past decades, a significant infestation pattern was observed between these broomrape species with no scientific peer-reviewed explanation. A two-year pot experiment simulating the crop rotation and an independent hydroponic experiment were performed to address the problem and indicate the main reason behind the differential infestation pattern. Different varieties of three crops (sugar beet, pepper, and wheat) were grown in rotation with tomato and sunflower to identify a crop-rotation induced control mechanism on these two broomrape species. Germination bioassays were performed in vitro to identify stimulation of plant biochemicals collected as methanolic shoots/roots extracts and root exudates on the germination patterns of broomrape seeds. Results indicated that sunflower broomrape soil seed banks reduced during the two-year crop rotation; however, Egyptian broomrape seed banks did not alter and the resulting parasitism significantly reduced tomato growth. Seed germination bioassays confirmed that the methanolic shoot/root extracts successfully stimulate sunflower broomrape seeds germination but fail to stimulate Egyptian broomrape seeds germination. Root exudates collected from hydroponically grown crops also confirmed differential germination patterns in both broomrape species. Current results are of vital importance to explain the control effect of a crop rotation system and moreover, lay the foundation to study the genetic evolution of broomrape species that results in their differential germination responses to natural stimuli.

Sustainable use of the acid moraine loam Bathygleyic Distric Glossic Retisol prevailing in Western Lithuania is associated with the appropriate intensity of liming and tillage. Research was carried out at the Vezaiciai Branch of Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry during the period 2015-2018 in two long-term field experiments: liming (established in 1949) and soil tillage methods (established in 2003). The aim of the study was to establish the trends in weed infestation variation in the crop rotation after a long-term application of agronomic practices of different intensity (soil tillage and liming) Treatments of the soil tillage were as follows: conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing and shallow ploughless tillage. Treatments of liming were as follows: unlimed (pH(KCl) 4.0-4.1) and limed (pH(KCl) 6.2-6.8). The following weed infestation indicators were investigated: weed number and mass, weed species number, weed seed bank in the soil depths of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm. Findings of the study suggest that the long-term liming had an impact on the disappearance of dominating acidophilic weeds from crop communities. In a limed soil (pH 6.4-6.8), the total number of weeds was 4.1 times lower compared to that in a naturally acid soil (pH 4.0-4.1). The contamination with weed seeds was 14.2 times greater in the naturally acid soil; however, irrespective of the soil acidity (pH), vertical seed distribution was determined to be similar in different depths of the soil. The long-term conventional ploughing reduced crop weediness in the soil of low acidity (5.1-5.3). The total weed number and mass were 1.6 and 1.4 times greater in the treatment of reduced tillage soil. The effect of long-term regular soil tillage tended to cause changes to the depth of soil loosening, affecting vertical weed seed distribution. Under reduced tillage conditions, the soil depth of 0-10 cm was the most contaminated with weed seeds.																	1392-3196						2020	107	1					25	32		10.13080/z-a.2020.107.004							WOS:000513554700004						
J	Beckie, HJ; Flower, KC; Ashworth, MB				Beckie, Hugh J.; Flower, Ken C.; Ashworth, Michael B.			Farming without Glyphosate?	PLANTS-BASEL												Recent statements from scientific organisations and court decisions have resulted in widespread public interest and concern over the safety of glyphosate, the most popular and effective herbicide used worldwide. Consequently, glyphosate-based products are under intense scrutiny from governments at all levels. Some jurisdictions have already banned or restricted its use, which will adversely impact international trade in bulk grain commmodities if glyphosate residues are detected. The possibility of farming without glyphosate is becoming an important issue facing the agri-food research and development sector. Contingency plans need to be formulated if that scenario becomes a reality. In this review, we briefly summarize international events that have led to this possible situation, describe current glyphosate usage in major agronomic field crops worldwide, outline possible alternatives to glyphosate in two agroregions and perform bioeconomic model scenarios of southern Australian broadacre cropping systems without the herbicide. Model predictions suggest that we can farm profitably without glyphosate by consistently utilizing key non-herbicidal weed management practices combined with robust pre-emergence soil residual herbicide treatments. However, maintaining low weed seed banks will be challenging. If the social license to use glyphosate is revoked, what other pesticides will soon follow?

Our experiment was designed to investigate the impact of organic mulch combined with irrigation on the weed species composition and weed seed bank of open-field tomato. For three consecutive years (2016-2018), treatment of microplots included mulch only, irrigation only, mulch and irrigation combined, and the untreated control. Marginal microplots (bordered by the surrounding mown grassland) were distinguished from inner microplots to check margin effect. We collected soil samples from different depths and let the weed seeds germinate in a greenhouse. Germinated weed seedlings were counted and identified. The number of weeds, and time needed for weeding was reduced by mulching, temperature, sampling date, and the succession of the study years. Irrigation, on the other hand, had no effect on weeding time. Margin effect and year had the highest influence on weed species composition. Regarding seed bank, year and mulching had the highest influence. The importance of other variables remained low, with mulching being the strongest explained variable. Regardless of treatments, weed composition of the study area was transformed during the three-year study.

J	Zinsmeister, J; Leprince, O; Buitink, J				Zinsmeister, Julia; Leprince, Olivier; Buitink, Julia			Molecular and environmental factors regulating seed longevity	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Seed longevity is a central pivot of the preservation of biodiversity, being of main importance to face the challenges linked to global climate change and population growth. This complex, quantitative seed quality trait is acquired on the mother plant during the second part of seed development. Understanding what factors contribute to lifespan is one of the oldest and most challenging questions in plant biology. One of these challenges is to recognize that longevity depends on the storage conditions that are experimentally used because they determine the type and rate of deleterious conditions that lead to cell death and loss of viability. In this review, we will briefly review the different storage methods that accelerate the deteriorative reactions during storage and argue that a minimum amount of information is necessary to interpret the longevity data. Next, we will give an update on recent discoveries on the hormonal factors regulating longevity, both from the ABA signaling pathway but also other hormonal pathways. In addition, we will review the effect of both maternal and abiotic factors that influence longevity. In the last section of this review, we discuss the problems in unraveling cause-effect relationship between the time of death during storage and deteriorative reactions leading to seed ageing. We focus on the three major types of cellular damage, namely membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation and RNA integrity for which germination data on seed stored in dedicated seed banks for long period times are now available.

SEED LONGEVITY OF SPOTTED SPURGE AND WILD POINSETTIA UNDER DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS	PLANTA DANINHA												Seed longevity under different environmental conditions is considered as one of the most important factors in the spread and persistence of an exotic species. The Experiments were conducted to determine seed persistence in soil, effects of submergence in water, flooding of the soil, and high temperatures on germination and viability of spotted spurge (Chamaesyce maculata) and wild poinsettia (Euphorbia heterophylla) as two exotic species in different regions of Golestan province. Spotted spurge seeds buried at depth of 10 cm maintained their viability above 95% after a year, while wild poinsettia seeds were destroyed completely after exhuming the soil. Seeds of both species were unable to germinate under submergence, but 92% of the spotted spurge seeds remained viable under this condition for 14 d. No germination was observed after 9 weeks submersion. Submersion duration drastically affected seed germination of wild poinsettia, so that no germination occurred after 6 d submersion. Twelve days after flooding, spotted spurge emergence decreased by 57% compared to the control. Ten percentage of wild poinsettia seedlings emerged when flooding was kept up to 12 d after sowing, while control had 96% emergence. Germination of spotted spurge seeds subjected to 140 degrees C for 5 min was 5%. Viability of wild poinsettia seed was completely lost at 120 and 140 C for 5 min. These results suggest that spotted spurge is capable of forming persistent seedbank. Seeds of spotted spurge were partially tolerant to submersion in water, but wild poinsettia seed are susceptible to submergence. The burning of crop residue could also prevent augmenting the soil seed bank of both species.

J	Chen, FQ; Zhang, M; Wu, Y; Huang, YW				Chen, Fangqing; Zhang, Miao; Wu, Yang; Huang, Yongwen			Seed rain and seed bank of a draw-down zone and their similarities to vegetation under the regulated water-level fluctuation in Xiangxi River	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir converted areas of the original terrestrial ecosystem along the shores into a draw-down zone with a fluctuating water-level at an elevation ranging between 145 and 175 m. The water-level fluctuation is regulated against the normal seasonal flooding with summer emergence and winter submergence. We investigated the seed rain and soil seed banks along elevational gradients of the Xiangxi zone in the reservoir to explore the characteristics of species composition and spatial distribution of seed rain and soil seed bank, and their similarities with standing vegetation under the regulated water-level fluctuation. The results showed that the seed rain and soil seed bank comprised 36 and 50 species of plants, respectively. These were predominantly annual herbaceous plants, which accounted for 54.02 and 66.0% of the seed rain and soil seed bank, respectively, with an average density of 445.16 +/- 49.97 and 7322.18 +/- 678.44 seeds/m(2), respectively. The regulated water-level fluctuation resulted in greater species diversity and seed density of seed rain and soil seed bank in the middle and upper elevations of the zone than that of the lower elevations. The similarity coefficient between seed rain and seed bank, seed bank and extant vegetation, seed rain and extant vegetation was 0.488, 0.373 and 0.466, respectively. Effects of the regulated water-level fluctuation on the species compositions and spatial distribution of the seed rain and seed bank, and their similarities with existing vegetation were further discussed by contrast with the current research in the same field.																	0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2020	35	1					57	71		10.1080/02705060.2019.1670744							WOS:000510206200001						
J	Tamura, A				Tamura, Atsushi			Effects of 16-year Deer Exclusion on the Forbs and Tree Saplings in a Beech (Fagus crenata) Forest Degraded by Sika Deer in Eastern Japan	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Long-term exclusion of deer may decrease some plant species through interspecific competition. I studied the effects of deer exclosures for 16 y on tall forbs and tree saplings inside and outside three exclosures of beech forest in the Tanzawa Mountains, eastern Japan. Understory cover ranged from 69% to 95%, and herb-layer height ranged from 1.1 to 1.4 m, inside and outside the exclosures. The density of 2-4 of 18 targeted tall forb species was significantly greater inside than outside the exclosures (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.05). No species showed a higher density outside the exclosures. Mature ramet density of tall forbs was greater inside than outside exclosures, with the exception of two species. No clear relationship between forb densities and those of tree saplings was observed. The maximum height of saplings of most tree species exceeded the height of the herb layer. The mode of tree sapling height was 1-2 m and the tree density >= 2 m in height was 2260-5400 ha(-1), whereas no tree saplings >1 m in height were observed outside the exclosures. The results suggested that deer exclusion for 16 y maintained growth of tall forbs and concurrently promoted establishment of tree saplings, and almost no suppression of forbs and tree saplings was induced by the dense understory.

J	Wawrzyniak, MK; Jasinska, AK; Chmielarz, P; Kozlowski, G				Wawrzyniak, Mikolaj Krzysztof; Jasinska, Anna Katarzyna; Chmielarz, Pawel; Kozlowski, Gregor			Desiccation, dormancy, and storage of Pterocarya fraxinifolia (Juglandaceae) seeds: application in Hyrcanian and Colchian forest conservation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Pterocarya fraxinifolia (Poir.) Spach (Juglandaceae) is a model relict tree species native to South Caucasus and is a typical element of threatened riparian forests. Intensive land transformations, which are common in Transcaucasia, have resulted in loss of natural habitat and population decline of the species. One of the methods of ex situ conservation is seed banking. Cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) is of particular interest, as it allows safe preservation of valuable plant genetic resources. However, the feasibility of seed cryopreservation is related to the desiccation tolerance and intrinsic composition of the seeds. In this study, we examined the physiological traits of Pterocarya fraxinifolia seeds, for which desiccation tolerance is unknown or controversial, and their feasibility for cryopreservation. Additionally, we tested stratification methods for dormancy assessment. Results showed that seeds survived desiccation to a moisture content of 2.8% with a germination rate of 64%. Stratification at a temperature of 3 degrees C for 8 weeks proved to be both fast and effective. Seed moisture content ranging from 2.8% to 18.1% was determined to be safe for cryopreservation. There was no difference in seedling emergence in seeds stored for 1 year regardless of the storage temperature (-3, -18, or -196 degrees C). Based on our results, Pterocarya fraxinifolia seeds can be classified as orthodox. This study demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of cryopreserving Pterocarya fraxinifolia seeds.

To test the hypothesis, allelic variants at the SD1-2, 7-1, 7-2, and 12 loci from weedy and cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) were assembled into the same genetic background, and 16 homozygous lines selected as a tetragenic system. These lines were evaluated for SD measured by germination at 7, 21, 35, and 150 days of after-ripening (DAR), and for SL measured by the seed decay rate and survivability in the soil of a rice field for 7 months. Pyramiding the alleles from weedy rice lengthened the dormancy duration, and seeds survived in the soil remained dormant at the excavation. Germination levels at 7 to 150 DAR were correlated positively with the seed decay rate (r = 0.41-0.53) and negatively with the survivability (r = -0.45 to -0.28) in the tetragenic system. All four loci contributed to genotypic variation for each of the SD and SL measurements through main and/or epistatic (two- to four-order interactions) effects. SD7-1 (identical to the pericarp color gene Rc) played a major role in regulating seedbank longevity when interacted with the other SD gene(s). This research provided evidence that natural genes controlling SD are involved in regulation of soil seedbank longevity. Thus, accumulation of SD genes in a population could result in persistence of wild plants and weeds in conventional tillage systems.

Physiological and cytological aspects of embryos of the Cerrado (neotropical savanna) palm Butia capitata were evaluated when subjected to osmotically induced WS and FH. The water potential (psi(w)), viability, and vigor of dehydrated or hydrated embryos were determined after immersion in osmotic solutions. Embryos were submitted to FH (psi(w) =0 MPa), moderate WS (psi(w) = -1 and -2 MPa), and severe WS (psi(w) = -2 and -4 MPa). Indicators of oxidative stress (H2O2, O-2(-), MDA, and CAT, SOD, and APX activities), membrane functionality (electrical conductivity and leaching of K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+), and ABA content were evaluated. The ultrastructures of dehydrated embryos and hydrated embryos submitted to psi(w) = 0, - 1, and - 2 MPa were evaluated. Dehydrated embryos (psi(w) = - 8.5 MPa) showed high tolerance to WS that was related to their abundant protein reserves, SOD activities, and high ABA contents. Embryos tolerate FH and hydration makes psi(w) = -0.2 MPa. Hydrated embryos also show high tolerance to WS, which is related to their control of oxidative stress and increases in their ABA contents. Loss of viability under severe WS occurs associated with the blockage of protein mobilization, loss of membrane functionality, and the collapse of cellular structure. Embryo tolerance to WS and FH is crucial to the resilience of B. capitata seed banks exposed to hydration cycles in the seasonal Cerrado biome environment.

J	Block, PR; Gasch, CK; Limb, RF				Block, Pamela R.; Gasch, Caley K.; Limb, Ryan F.			Biological integrity of mixed-grass prairie topsoils subjected to long-term stockpiling	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Surface mining often requires storage of topsoil in large piles for long periods of time (1-30 years). Such soil handling and storage results in physical and biogeochemical changes and may alter the soil biological integrity. Microbial activity regulates nutrient cycling and soil quality, and post-mining revegetation of most native forb species in the Northern Great Plains relies on a viable seedbank. Soil condition and biological viability influence the establishment and success of the aboveground plant community, and therefore should be considered in facilitating successful reclamation. In this study, we characterized soil biological integrity via the seed bank and microbial community structure in a topsoil stockpile (depths of 15 cm-750 cm). We measured microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid analysis and assessed the seed bank using the seedling emergence method under greenhouse conditions. We hypothesized with increasing depth, soil biota would decrease in abundance and perhaps exhibit a shift in community structure, and stockpiled soils would display different communities compared to an undisturbed reference site. Further, we hypothesized the soil seedbank would decrease with increasing depth and be less than the reference site. We found distinct shifts in microbial communities in terms of community structure and declines in overall abundance of organisms with increased depth using principal component analysis. Furthermore, overall microbial abundance within the top 15 cm of stockpiled soil was nearly one third less than our native undisturbed reference site, and soil at depth was increasingly depleted. Total seedling emergence from soil collected at all depths of the stockpile was lower (20 viable seeds) compared to the reference soil emergence (36 viable seeds). Our results demonstrate that stockpiling greatly affects soil microbial communities and that stockpiled topsoil is not a dependable source for forb seeds. Reclamation may require forb seeding and soil amendments to facilitate whole-system restoration.																	0929-1393	1873-0272				JAN	2020	145								103347	10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.08.009							WOS:000495708400013
