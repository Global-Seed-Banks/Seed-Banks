J	Whittle, CA; Duchesne, LC; Needham, T				Whittle, CA; Duchesne, LC; Needham, T			Soil seed bank of a jack pine (Pinus banksiana) ecosystem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The soil seed bank (seed and vegetative propagules) of a jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) ecosystem was investigated using direct propagule emergence from soil cores in greenhouse experiments, and visual examination of rhizome/rooting systems in situ. Of the 985 emergents observed from soil cores 643 (65%) originated from seeds whereas 342 (35%) arose from rhizomes. Grasses and sedge comprised 89% of the seed emergents while shrubs comprised 75% of the vegetative emergents. In situ examination of root systems revealed that Linnaea borealis L., Carer houghtonii Torr., Gaultheria procumbens L., and Maianthemum canadense Desf. had rhizomes buried at or above the duff/mineral interface while Lycopodium obscurum L., Lycopodium complanatum L. and Pteridium aquilinum L. (Kuhn) were predominately buried within the upper- layers of mineral soil. All other vegetatively reproducing species examined, with the exception of Rubus alleghaniensis Porter, had rhizomes buried deeper than 25 cm into mineral soil. Rubus allegheniensis (reproductive roots) had no discrete area of burial and were located in duff, upper mineral, and deep mineral soil. Depth of burial of reproductive material is used to explain plant succession after disturbance.																	1049-8001	1448-5516				JUN	1998	8	2					67	71		10.1071/WF9980067							WOS:000074568300002						
J	Maranon, T				Maranon, T			Soil seed bank and community dynamics in an annual-dominated Mediterranean salt-marsh	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The seed bank in the soil and litter of an annual grassland in the upper salt marsh of the Guadalquivir delta (SW Spain) contained on average 49 110 seeds/m(2); 29 species were represented. Field censuses of the grassland, in two consecutive springs, yielded 7 410 and 9 520 plants/m(2) respectively. A combined Correspondence Analysis of the seed bank samples and field censuses showed differences in grassland composition between wet and dry years. The environmental changes induced different expressions of the soil seed bank, mediated by demographic processes. The effect of salinity (25 dS/m of NaCl) was studied on intact soil blocks transplanted to a greenhouse. Salinity did not affect the emergence of seedlings, but reduced the growth of the dominant species, Trisetaria panicea. The importance of the role of seed banks in community dynamics and their use for conservation management are discussed.

J	Dzwonko, Z; Loster, S				Dzwonko, Z; Loster, S			Dynamics of species richness and composition in a limestone grassland restored after tree cutting	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												After abandonment many limestone grasslands have been overgrown by trees and shrubs; as a result, species-rich communities with many regionally rare and endangered species are vanishing. Some studies suggest that, in cases where grassland is being restored, the species composition and rate of change is strongly dependent on the initial conditions, i.e. the earlier presence of grassland species and the opportunity for colonization of new sites by grassland species. These hypotheses were tested in a five-year restoration experiment after the clearing of a 35-yr-old secondary pine wood developed on abandoned grassland. Tree cutting induced rapid changes in the floristic composition and species cover. The number of grassland species from the class Festuco-Brometea increased significantly in the restored grassland, but their cover was much lower than in the old grassland. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed significant differences in species composition between the grassland restored in former wood gaps and that developed in former closed wood In wood gap sites the cover of species from the class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and tufted perennials was much higher, whereas the cover of Festuco-Brometea species was lower. Significantly more shrubs, woodland species, ruderal and nitrophilous species as well as annual and biennial species occurred in the former dosed wood site. It was found that richness and composition of the restored grassland depended strongly on the community composition before tree cutting, as well as on the presence of grassland species in the neighbourhood. Periodical tree cutting enables the maintenance of a temporal-spatial mosaic of scrub-grassland communities in isolated habitats and the preservation of local species diversity.																	1100-9233					JUN	1998	9	3					387	394		10.2307/3237103							WOS:000076469400010						
J	Erkkila, HMJB				Erkkila, HMJB			Seed banks of grazed and ungrazed Baltic seashore meadows	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The seed banks of three grazed and three ungrazed seashore meadows were studied on the west coast of Finland. 8486 seedlings (mean 13 669 seedlings/m(2)) germinated from cold-treated samples (n = 343; depth = 10 cm). Most seedlings and species were monocots and perennials. The seed bank flora included 54 dicots vs. 28 monocots and 66 perennials vs. 16 annuals. The most abundant species were Juncus gerardii, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Eleocharis uniglumis, Agrostis stolonifera, Juncus bufonius and Carex nigra, which made up 73 % of the seed bank. Numbers of species and seedlings differed between elevation classes. Species richness was highest in elevation class 50 - 70 cm. The highest seed density occurred in class 20 - 50 cm. A model for size and species composition of the seed bank in relation to elevation is presented. The seed bank was larger and richer in species in the ungrazed than in the grazed sites, but not so in the upper elevations and closest to the open sea. Grazing reduced the size of the seed bank of Agrostis stolonifera, A. capillaris, Calamagrostis stricta, Elymus repens, Juncus bufonius, Limosella aquatica and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, but increased that of J. gerardii. 32 species germinated only from ungrazed samples and 11 species only from grazed ones. Multivariate classification resulted in nine sample groups. The ordination scatter was best explained by the flooding stress variables, elevation, the distance from the water line and the number of helophyte species in samples. 75 species were found both in the seed bank and in the vegetation, but there was a significant lack of resemblance (in the Mantel test) due to over-representation of some species. Eight species occurring only in the seed bank were mainly annuals or biennials (63 %); those occurring only in the established vegetation (86 species) were mainly perennials (86 %).

J	Tyser, RW; Asebrook, JM; Potter, RW; Kurth, LL				Tyser, RW; Asebrook, JM; Potter, RW; Kurth, LL			Roadside revegetation in Glacier National Park, USA: Effects of herbicide and seeding treatments	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												From 1992 to 1995 we experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of several revegetation treatments along a segment of Going-to-the-Sun Highway in Glacier National Park, U.S.A. This segment, reconstructed during the spring and summer of 1992, is bordered by fescue prairie vegetation and is known to be susceptible to invasion by several alien species, including Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed) and Phleum pratense (common timothy). We used a split plot study design to evaluate the effectiveness of herbicide and seeding treatments on assisting recovery of native flora and limiting the establishment of alien species. The herbicide treatment consisted of a yearly herbicide spray application of clopyralid (3,6-dichloropicolinic acid). Five seeding treatments were evaluated, three of which included an indigenous graminoid-forb seed mix. Percent canopy coverages of four species groups-alien graminoids, native graminoids, alien forbs, and native forbs-were determined in July 1995. In addition, community-level patterns in sprayed plots and unsprayed plots were compared with a reference site of native fescue prairie. Herbicide treatments decreased mean canopy coverage of alien forbs (treated = 4.2%, untreated = 23.4%) and increased mean canopy coverage of native graminoids slightly (treated = 6.3%, untreated = 4.0%). But herbicide treatments reduced mean coverage of native forbs (treated = 3.9%, untreated = 8.9%) and likely increased coverage of alien graminoids. Treatments that included a fall 1992 seed mix increased native graminoid coverages 2.8-4.6 times, although coverages were still lower than those attained by alien graminoids. Native and alien forb coverage appeared unaffected by seeding treatments. Species composition was less diverse in sprayed plots and more dominated by alien grasses than in unsprayed plots and the reference site. Areas for additional study are suggested, including seed bank assays to determine treatment effects on recruitment of alien versus native species and the use of native graminoids to create low-diversity communities with high canopy coverages to resist establishment of alien species.																	1061-2971					JUN	1998	6	2					197	206		10.1046/j.1526-100X.1998.06211.x							WOS:000074270400009

Seeds were obtained from CATIE's Latin American Forest Seed Bank and germinated under aseptic conditions. Four explants were cultured in each Petri dish on half strength modified Murashige and Skoog basal medium, and five concentrations of BA (benzyladenine) were studied; A. guachapele and S. macrophylla responded positively to the presence of BA in the culture medium. Otherwise, Cedrella odorata required media supplemented with citokinin and auxin combinations to induce adventitious buds.																	0034-7744					JUN	1998	46	2					225	228									WOS:000078824100006						
J	Baptista, TL; Shumway, SW				Baptista, TL; Shumway, SW			A comparison of the seed banks of sand dunes with different disturbance histories on Cape Cod National Seashore	RHODORA												The seed bank compositions of four different coastal sand dunes on Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA) were characterized and used to predict the potential of seed banks in restoring species diversity in degraded sand dunes. Seedling emergence from sand collected from each site was observed over 15 weeks. A total of 254 seedlings emerged during the study. A single species, Artemisia caudata, was responsible for 85% of the total seedling emergence, and all but one of those seedlings was from a single study site. Overall, seedling emergence and the species diversity of seedlings was low, indicating a low density of seeds in the sand dune substrate. Seedlings emerged from only 20% of the sand samples, indicating that the distribution of seeds in the sand is tightly clustered. The lowest numbers of seedlings emerged from the most severely degraded site which had recently been replanted with Ammophila breviligulata (American Beachgrass). Potential reasons for this clumping of seedlings are discussed, including poor seed dispersal as a result of buried mature infructescences or as a result of wind deposition of seeds in small depressions. The results suggest that the existing seed bank is unlikely to lead to significant increases in species diversity at sites undergoing restoration. Consequently, the importation of sand and its associated seed bank from more mature sites is not a feasible means of restoring diversity because of the low density and species diversity of seeds in the sand at more stable sites.																	0035-4902					SUM	1998	100	903					298	313									WOS:000077157100005						
J	Hilhorst, HWM				Hilhorst, HWM			The regulation of secondary dormancy. The membrane hypothesis revisited	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Secondary dormancy is predominantly associated with seed behaviour in soil seed banks. Periodic changes in secondary dormancy may explain seasonal emergence of weedy species. Temperature and possibly soil water potential appear to be the predominant factors that determine the annual cycling of dormancy. Dormancy cycling is paralleled by modulations of germination responsiveness to germination stimulants, such as light and nitrate and to the width of the germination temperature window. Membranes have been proposed to be the primary target for the perception of temperature. It is hypothesized that alterations In properties of cellular membranes are involved in the regulation of dormancy. Possible mechanisms are discussed.

J	Le Page, C; Keddy, PA				Le Page, C; Keddy, PA			Reserves of buried seeds in beaver ponds	WETLANDS												Reserves of buried seeds are known to have an important role in the dynamics of plant communities. This is particularly so in wetlands, where periodic low water events are essential for plants to reestablish from seeds. In spite of the growing literature on reserves of buried seeds, little is known about this resource in beaver ponds. This study was designed to 1) document species found in beaver pond seed banks, 2) estimate their relative abundance, and 3) test whether the abundance and richness of seeds differ between young and old beaver ponds. Soil samples were collected from 14 beaver ponds in Gatineau Park (Quebec) in May 1995. Samples were spread out in plastic trays containing a sand and peat substrate and were placed in a growth chamber with fluctuating light and temperature regimes to stimulate germination. More than 2000 seedlings representing 42 species germinated from the various soil samples, yielding an estimated density of 2300 seedlings/m(2). Juncus effusus (426 seeds/m(2)), Leersia oryzoides (390 seeds/m(2)), Scirpus cyperinus (246seeds/m(2)), Juncus brevicaudatus (170 seeds/m2), and Ludwiga palustris (98 seeds/m(2)) were the 5 most abundant species. The abundance and richness of germinating seeds did not differ significantly between young and old beaver ponds.																	0277-5212					JUN	1998	18	2					242	248		10.1007/BF03161659							WOS:000074269500007						
J	Schutz, W				Schutz, W			Seed dormancy cycles and germination phenologies in sedges (Carex) from various habitats	WETLANDS												Seeds (nutlets) of four temperate-zone perennial Carer species from various habitats and with different growth forms were investigated to identify seasonal germination patterns. In the first experiment, freshly matured seeds were sown in summer 1994 on the soil surface and at a depth of 1 cm at a sun-exposed site and under a leaf canopy in an experimental garden. In the second experiment, seeds were exhumed after various periods of burial (7-cm depth) for up to 30 months and tested for germination in bath light and darkness at 15 degrees, 25 degrees, and 22/10 degrees C. In the first experiment, freshly-matured seeds of the four sedges did not germinate during summer or autumn 1994. Almost all surface-sown seeds of the four species germinated from late spring to summer in 1995 at the sun-exposed site. Most buried seeds of three species germinated in the soil, but germinants died prior to emergence. In Carex flacca, however, about 50% of the buried seeds germinated and emerged until 1997, and the ungerminated seeds remained viable. At the shaded site, seeds of C acutiformis. and C. flacca did not germinate, whereas a small percentage of the buried and surface-sown seeds of C. arenaria and C. extensa emerged in the second year. Seeds of C. acutiformis and C. flacca were dormant, and those of C. arenaria and C. extensa were conditionally dormant at the beginning of the second experiment. All four species had annual dormancy cycles at 22/10 degrees C in light and in darkness and at 25 degrees and 15 degrees in light. Seeds came out of dormancy in late autumn or winter and re-entered dormancy or conditional dormancy in late spring or early summer. Very few seeds of any of the four species germinated at constant temperatures in darkness. No seeds germinated during burial in soil at a depth of 7 cm. These field germination patterns indicate that the four sedges have the potential to form a persistent seed bank but that losses due to germination in the seed bank are dependent on temperature amplitudes, mean temperatures, and red:far red ratios under a leaf canopy.																	0277-5212					JUN	1998	18	2					288	297		10.1007/BF03161664							WOS:000074269500012

We have recorded vegetation (plant communities, seed bank) and soil characteristics (macrofaunal communities and abiotic conditions) following several sampling procedures balled an temporal or spatial gradients. The aim is to test two research hypothesis concerning i) the different rythms of compartimental changes in a dynamic ecosystem, and ii) the spatial dimension of biodiversity. For the taxinomical groups studied, results show significant changes in biodiversity along successional gradients. However, these dynamics do not occur at the same rate, which suggests inertia between ecosystem components and differences in recorded dynamics. We underline that measures of biodiversity must take into account this temporal dimension in order to have a predictive value (notion of ecological organization). It is also suggested that the scale at which biodiversity is measured is not necessarily that of the studied ecosystem (notion of functional unit of a compartiment). (C) Elsevier, Paris.

J	Pegtel, DM				Pegtel, Dick M.			Rare vascular plant species at risk: recovery by seeding?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Rare vascular plant species are endangered worldwide. Population losses are most commonly caused by human-related factors. Conservation management seeks to halt this adverse trend and if possible, to enhance long-lasting self-sustainable populations. In general, rare species are poorly recruited from seed banks, or disperse themselves very poorly. It may be a management option to translocate such plants by seeds and/or transplants. This paper asks which problems may be faced. It is argued that translocation is only acceptable if it is based on knowledge of species biology and ecology and the size and structure of its geographic range through time. Such knowledge of rare species is often lacking. The finite management goal can only be achieved if conservationists closely cooperate with both ecologists and geneticists.																	1402-2001					MAY	1998	1	1					67	74		10.2307/1479086							WOS:000208471800009						
J	Willems, JH; Bik, LPM				Willems, J. H.; Bik, L. P. M.			Restoration of high species density in calcareous grassland: the role of seed rain and soil seed bank	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. A small-scale restoration experiment concerning a species-rich calcareous grassland was conducted over a 7-yr period. 20 yr of abandonment (1971-1990) resulted in both a strong reduction of the number of species and an absolute dominance of the shrub Crataegus monogyna and the grass Brachypodium pinnatum - which contributed 98% of the above-ground herb phytomass. The plot (3 m x 6 m) was cleared in September 1990 and thereafter yearly mown in autumn. Small soil seed bank samples were taken immediately after clearing and again in the autumn of 1996. The inner part of the plot showed a reduced soil seed bank compared to the plot underneath the vegetation outside the plot in 1990. Six years later an increased number of seeds in the soil in this inside area could be recorded mainly in the upper soil layer, although the amount was only 40% compared to the outside or control area. Ca. 20% of the species present in the restored vegetation were recorded in seed traps during the main seed dispersal period in 1997. Restoration of high species richness in the plot was a fast process during the first few years: from seven species in 1990 towards 39 three years later. This was significantly faster than the restoration process of the calcareous grassland at the same slope 20 yr earlier. This was probably due to the increased size of the community species pool at the site as a result of appropriate management during the last decades. Relative species number increase was highest at the largest scale during this experiment, viz. at the total plot area. The success of restoration of species-rich, dry grassland vegetation largely depends on the interaction between several conditions, e.g. seed availability, either originating from the seed rain or soil seed bank, favourable germination conditions and a successful development to a mature, seed producing individual. Germination and establishment strongly depend on suitable vegetation structure as a result of sustainable management.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				MAY	1998	1	1					91	100		10.2307/1479088							WOS:000208471800011						
J	Mortimer, SR; Hollier, JA; Brown, VK				Mortimer, Simon R.; Hollier, John A.; Brown, Valerie K.			Interactions between plant and insect diversity in the restoration of lowland calcareous grasslands in southern Britain	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. The lowland calcareous grasslands of northwestern Europe are highly prized by ecologists and conservationists as a result of the diversity of their plant and invertebrate communities. Large areas of such grasslands have been lost this century as a result of changes in agricultural land use. Recent changes in agricultural policies, in particular the introduction of agri-environmental incentive schemes, have resulted in an increasing area being managed for the restoration of these communities. This paper reviews the management techniques employed in the restoration of lowland calcareous grasslands and the factors that govern their success. Constraints on the enhancement of the plant diversity of restoration sites include high soil fertility and the presence of undesirable species in the soil seed bank. However, it is thought that the primary constraint is the availability of propagules from which new populations can be established. Similarly, the dispersal mode and ability of insect species is likely to be the major factor limiting the enhancement of insect diversity. Evaluation of the success of restoration management usually involves monitoring changes in the plant community. However, as a result of their short life-cycles and sensitivity to small-scale environmental conditions, insects may respond more rapidly to changes resulting from restoration management and therefore provide better indicators of success. With the exception of a few high-profile butterfly species, the use of insects as indicator taxa has largely been neglected in terrestrial systems. This paper illustrates their potential use with reference to lowland calcareous grasslands in southern Britain.

A multidisciplinary evaluation of restoration measures in a degraded Cirsio-Molinietum fen meadow	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. An integrated multidisciplinary approach including descriptive and experimental research of environmental and biotic factors was used to evaluate an attempt to restore a species-rich fen meadow, phytosociologically belonging to the Cirsio-Molinietum. Expert judgement and preliminary research indicated that soil acidification, due to drainage in the surrounding area, caused the degeneration of the fen meadow. Flooding the meadow with surface water was applied in order to stop acidification. A small irrigated wetland (helophyte filter) was constructed to reduce nutrient availability in the surface water. Sod cutting was applied in a small area as well. The two measures were evaluated through: (1) measurements of hydrological and soil factors, (2) seed bank analysis, (3) recording species composition in permanent plots, (4) assessing the type and extent of nutrient limitation using a full-factorial fertilization experiment, (5) assessing the effect of liming on vegetation biomass, and (6) recording the growth of three introduced fen meadow species in the liming experiment. The research was carried out in a degraded site with intact vegetation, a degraded site where the top soil was removed by sod cutting and a reference site with intact Cirsio-Molinietum vegetation. Groundwater levels in the degraded and the stripped site differed slightly from those of the reference site but they were within the range of Cirsio-Molinietum requirements. Groundwater quality slightly improved in the stripped site. Top-soil removal considerably reduced the macro-nutrient contents and caused a stronger P-deficiency. No increase in soil pH was observed immediately after top-soil removal. A small increase in soil pH was found after five years in the stripped site, indicating a slight recovery from acidification. Liming after top-soil removal had little effect on the soil pH after six months but stimulated the growth of established species such as Agrostis canina. Few viable seeds of characteristic fen meadow species were present in the seed banks of both degraded and well developed fen meadow sites. The species composition after top soil removal reflected the seed bank of the degraded fen meadow and establishment of characteristic fen meadow species was poor, even after five years. The introduced species (Carex hostiana, C. panicea, Cirsium dissectum) survived during the first year in both the degraded and the stripped site. Liming initially stimulated the growth of two species, but in the second year this effect disappeared. After two years, none of the introduced species survived at the stripped site. The restoration measures failed so far, probably because acidification could not be counteracted satisfactorily. Finally, it was concluded that our multidisciplinary approach enables us to draw proper conclusions and that it is suitable for other restoration attempts as well.

Plant species richness in calcareous grasslands as affected by dispersability in space and time	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Species richness in calcareous grassland is discussed against the background of historical dispersal processes associated with traditional land-use management such as grazing, but also the artificial establishment by hayseed. Important vectors in the traditionally man-made landscape were sheep and cattle or other livestock such as goats. Calcareous grasslands were not only connected to each other but also to other habitats such as villages, forests, arable fields and heathlands by these vectors which could cover large distances (e.g. transhumance shepherding), which is not the case in the current man-made landscape. Species richness after restoration management of abandoned and afforested calcareous grasslands was predicted by using characters of dispersability in space and time. These were the persistence of the species in the vegetation and the diaspore bank after abandonment or afforestation and the dispersal capacity through wind and sheep. The results reveal that reintroduction of sheep grazing is necessary to reestablish the original species richness. The first validation of the prediction of the succession on clear-cut sites and a comparison with data of species composition in abandoned quarries and the surroundings made it obvious that a species' own dispersal capacity in space is very low except for some well wind-dispersed species. Therefore, it is recommended to include and to simulate dispersal processes in future management to be able to restore the original species richness.

J	Qi, MQ; Scarratt, JB				Qi, MQ; Scarratt, JB			Effect of harvesting method on seed bank dynamics in a boreal mixedwood forest in northwestern Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The effects of harvesting on seed bank dynamics in a boreal mixedwood forest were studied on replicated 10-ha treatment blocks harvested by different clear-cutting or partial-cutting systems in the fall of 1993. From 1994 to 1995 we monitored seed rain, soil seed banks, and seasonal changes in species composition in understory vegetation and seed banks in all harvest blocks plus three uncut controls. No persistent conifers were found in the soil seed banks of any treatment. The number of seeds of other species generally decreased with soil depth in all treatments, with the lower layer of organic soil yielding the highest numbers of seedlings. Many seeds of sedges and some herbs were found in the upper mineral soil horizon, indicating significant longevity. While disturbance by harvesting operations altered the distribution of seeds in the soil profile, harvesting method had little effect on the total number of species present in post-harvest seed banks or understory vegetation. There were no differences in seasonal compositional changes between treatments. Seed rain monitoring indicated that few conifer seeds were added to the seed bank. Betula papyrifera Marsh. was the dominant tree species in seed rain in the partial cutting treatments. However, in the second post-harvest year on clear cut sites sedges and grasses increased from less than 1 to 14% of seed rain. The results suggest that predominantly hardwood stands with prolific understory vegetation will initially develop on the treated sites, with a variable, but depleted conifer content.																	0008-4026					MAY	1998	76	5					872	883		10.1139/b98-061							WOS:000076135800015

This is due to the fact that these ecosystems, among the most diversified in temperate climates, are extremely threatened; in some areas, they have almost disappeared. The re-establishment of these habitats implies to know the living conditions of the associations to be recreated. Very often, the typical species of these communities have become so rarefied that the seed bank or the seed rain are not sufficient to recreate the plant community. Most of the time, to achieve the restoration of these communities, they have to be totally recreated by sowing. For the restoration or the maintenance of the community, the soil chemical characteristics have also to be appropriate or if not modified. This research tends to establish a relation between some soil chemical factors and the plant diversity of a great number of stations. This research has illuminated the relationship between soil extractable phosphorus and potassium and plant diversity. Over 5 mg of phosphorus per 100 g of dry soil (acetate + EDTA extraction), no station containing more than 20 species per 100 m(2) has been found. The highest number of species is found below the optimum content of the soil for plant nutrition (5-8 mg P/100 g). Concerning the potassium, the highest number of species is found at 20 mg/100, a value corresponcing to an optimum content of the soil for plant nutrition. High potassium contents, in opposition to phosphorus contents, are thus compatible with high values of diversity. Other factors (i.e. pH, organic matter, total nitrogen and calcium) do not show so clearly a relation with plant diversity. Excess of N-NO3 is known for its negative effect on the diversity of plant communities. In these environments, apart from the atmospheric deposits which can be important in some areas, N-NO3 is derived mainly from the symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by legumes as well as from the mineralization of the organic matter of the soil. It is possible that, when in small quantities, the available soil phosphorus could be a limiting factor of the N-NO3 supply by these two sources. In this hypothesis, nitrogen would remain the main element limitating plant diversity but its availability would be controlled by phosphorus.

J	Davies, A; Waite, S				Davies, A; Waite, S			The persistence of calcareous grassland species in the soil seed bank under developing and established scrub	PLANT ECOLOGY												The relationships between the composition of the soil seed bank, the field layer vegetation, and the scrub canopy were investigated along a 69 m transect, grading from incipient woodland, through scrub, into intensively rabbit-grazed calcareous grassland. The results are used to assess the persistence of species associated with open calcareous grassland in the seed bank under developing scrub. Scrub age, composition and density, changed along the transect from the woodland to open grassland. A total of 35 forb and grass species were found in the field layer. The pattern evident in the scrub layer was also reflected in the herbaceous vegetation. The field layer in the most closed portion of the transect, where the scrub was oldest, was dominated by shade-tolerant species normally associated with woodland habitats. The abundance of these species decreased along the transect as the scrub age declined, and the field layer became increasingly dominated by species typical of open grassland. A total of 47 species germinated from the seed bank. Few species were recorded in the seed bank along the entire length of the transect. Overall, the seed bank was dominated by Hypericum perforatum and Centaurium erythraea, which accounted for 38.2% and 28.6% of emerging seedlings respectively. As with a number of similar studies, the composition of the seed bank had a low correspondence with the composition of the field layer vegetation. The results also emphasise that the composition of the seed bank can be viewed as an 'ecological palimpsest', with germinable seed of species from each stage of the old-field succession occurring in the soil. The seed bank is an important component in the re-vegetation of an area after disturbance such as scrub removal. This study supports the findings of previous research in showing that relatively few characteristic calcareous grassland species form persistent seed banks. The soil seed bank would therefore appear to be of limited value in the restoration of such grassland following scrub removal.																	1385-0237					MAY	1998	136	1					27	39		10.1023/A:1009759227900							WOS:000073976100003						
J	Kotiluoto, R				Kotiluoto, R			Vegetation changes in restored semi-natural meadows in the turku Archipelago of SW Finland	PLANT ECOLOGY												In the Turku Archipelago of SW Finland the traditional animal husbandry dramatically decreased in 1950s after which the unused semi-natural pastures and meadows began to develop into less species rich shrub and tree communities. Restoration of some semi-natural meadows and pastures started in the late 1970s. Removing trees and shrubs, grazing, mowing, and pollarding deciduous trees were used as restoration of practises. Vegetation changes were followed from forty-one permanent sample plots established on restored areas. In this paper the data before restoration and 7-8 years after the first monitoring was analysed with parametric tests. The sample plots were divided into three restoration groups where the main restoration practises were: group 1. grazing, group 2. thinning (clearing plots from shrubs and removing some trees), group 3. thinning, mowing, and grazing told wooded meadows). The results showed that: (1) The vegetation changed during analysed time. The number of species increased in all restored areas even though the changes were more pronounced in grazed areas and wooded meadows than in thinned areas. During restoration many common herb and grass species immigrated into the sample plots, but very few new indicator species of meadows were recorded. Most of the new species were found in few numbers in a sample plot which led to the significant increase in the number of sparse species (percentage cover < 1) in all restoration groups. The grasses benefited more from the restoration than herbs increasing their percentage cover significantly in grazed areas and in wooded meadows. In thinned areas the total percentage cover of the ten most dominant herb and grass species increased significantly. (2) The different restoration groups changed vegetation quite similarly. In grazed areas and in wooded meadows significant changes were slightly more numerous than in thinned areas. (3) The differences between the islands in vegetation changes were not pronounced. The added variance components among islands increased during restoration which probably indicated that the restoration practises as well as the species pool of the islands influenced the success of restoration.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				MAY	1998	136	1					53	67		10.1023/A:1009781217847							WOS:000073976100005

The seed banks were estimated from numbers of seedlings emerging from soil samples over one growing season. (1) Our results confirm the hypothesis that persistent seed banks are mainly formed by species with high light requirements. Of the species found predominantly in the seed bank and absent from the herb layer or occurring there very rarely in both communities 83% of species and 70% of seedlings were strongly light-demanding (Ellenberg's light index 6-9). However, the results do not support the hypothesis that seed banks in natural deciduous forest communities are small, poor in species and do not reflect the species composition of herb layer. (2) The seed banks of both communities were rich in species and relatively large. Species richness in the oak forest turned out to be higher than in the hornbeam forest (51 vs 45 species/2.4 m(2)), but size was smaller (2659 vs 5789 seedlings/2.4 m(2)). In the oak forest the most abundant spec:ies in the seed bank was Galium boreale, but it constituted only 19% of the total number of seedlings, whereas in the hornbeam forest the dominant species, Urtica dioica, constituted 57% of the total. (3) In each community the species composition of the seed bank and the herb layer was very similar (>70%). (4) The seed bank was more diverse in the oak forest than in the hornbeam forest (H' 2.34 vs 1.68). (5) The seed banks of both communities differed in the contribution of species with varied light requirements; in the sunny oak forest species with high light requirements dominated, whereas in the shady hornbeam forest both strongly and moderately light-demanding species had similar contributions.

J	Roche, S; Dixon, KW; Pate, JS				Roche, S; Dixon, KW; Pate, JS			For everything a season: Smoke-induced seed germination and seedling recruitment in a Western Australian Banksia woodland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The influence of factors associated with fire on seed germination of Australian native species is generally well documented, but examples involving the use of smoke as a fire analogue for ecological research remain limited. The role of season of treatment in the efficacy of smoke as a promotive germination agent was investigated over two growing seasons using natural soil stored seedbanks in Banksia woodland near Perth, Western Australia. Smoke was applied to unburnt sites in the autumn, winter and spring of 1994. Germinant emergence and seedling survival of 37 species representing 18 families was monitored in both unburnt sites and in adjacent, recently burnt sites until the second spring after treatment (October 1995). Recruitment from seed was found to be profoundly affected by the season in which dormancy breaking treatment had been applied. The promotive effect extended beyond the initial year of application. For the majority of the species investigated, application of smoke to unburnt sites in autumn promoted a significantly greater germination response than treatment in winter or spring. In only three cases (introduced annuals, the Fabaceae and Hibbertia amplexicaulis) did autumn smoke treatment not yield better germination than in summer-burnt counterparts. However, in almost half of the cases examined, proportions of seedlings surviving past their first summer after emergence in burnt areas were consistently greater than those in smoked or untreated sites. Most notably, no seedlings emerging during the spring of the first year of study survived into the following summer. Implications of the results with respect to future seed bank research and management of native vegetation are discussed.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011; Pate, John S/K-2154-2012	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; 												0307-692X					APR	1998	23	2					111	120		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00709.x							WOS:000072758800002						
J	Brown, SC				Brown, SC			Remnant seed banks and vegetation as predictors of restored marsh vegetation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Selection of sites for wetland restoration requires analysis of probable success at recreating diverse natural vegetation. We studied the seed banks and the remnant vegetation at restoration sites to determine their degree of similarity to the vegetation that developed following restoration of wetland hydrology. The study sites had been used for forage crops and pasture following long-term drainage. The seed bank was a very poor predictor of plant species abundances following restoration. Similarity between remnant vegetation and restored vegetation was consistently higher than similarity values using seed banks at both restored and natural wetlands. Our results suggest that seed-bank analysis is an inefficient technique for predicting restored vegetation in sites with prolonged disturbance, and that analysis of remnant vegetation on the sites is probably more useful. However, results would probably differ at sites with tile drainage that have limited remnant vegetation or created wetlands with bare soil where seed germination would playa greater role in revegetation. In addition, seed-bank studies are important to determine if aggressive invasive species are present at potential restoration sites.																	0008-4026					APR	1998	76	4					620	629		10.1139/b98-038							WOS:000075420600008						
J	Houle, G				Houle, G			Seed dispersal and seedling recruitment of Betula alleghaniensis: Spatial inconsistency in time	ECOLOGY												Recruitment in plants is the result of several processes operating from the time the seeds are mature and ready to be released from the parent plant to the time the seedlings emerge and become photosynthetically self-sufficient. In most species of strongly seasonal climates (e.g., trees of the cold temperate forests of North America and Japan), seed dispersal and seedling establishment are processes separated in time by at least a few weeks and more typically by a few months. This leaves ample opportunity for various factors to affect the spatial patterns of seed dispersal, survival and germination, and seedling emergence. Spatial uncoupling between these sequential processes leads to spatial independence (i.e., absence of a relationship) in the abundance patterns of life stages. Along a topographical gradient in an old-growth cold temperate forest of northeastern North America, I analyzed the spatial patterns of seed rain, seed bank, and seedling emergence of a major tree component, Betula alleghaniensis, over a 4-yr period. I examined the degree of consistency through time of the spatial patterns of each life stage and of their relationships with one another. Seed rain and seedling spatial patterns were quite variable through time, but that of the seed bank was relatively consistent despite large interyear fluctuations in abundance. Overall, two major spatial patterns emerged along the topographical gradient: one that emphasized the three peaks of density of mature Betula trees, and one with a single peak in the middle section of the gradient, where Betula tree density was higher. Correlations between the spatial patterns of seed and seedling abundance were significant in some years, but not in others. Seed survival was practically constant in space in one year, but quite variable in another; yet, it was consistently density independent. Spatial uncoupling was important between processes as reflected by the spatial independence between life-stage abundance patterns. This uncoupling significantly contributes to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the system and complicates fine-scale modeling of population and community dynamics.																	0012-9658					APR	1998	79	3					807	818		10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0807:SDASRO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000073060300005						
J	Grandin, U; Rydin, H				Grandin, U; Rydin, H			Attributes of the seed bank after a century of primary succession on islands in Lake Hjalmaren, Sweden	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 A large number of islands was created when the water table of Lake Hjalmaren, south central Sweden, was lowered between 1882 and 1886. We have complete lists of vascular plant species for 40 of these islands from 1886, 1892, 1903-04, 1927-28 and 1984-85. 2 We have investigated the seed bank on nine of these islands and compared species composition at different soil depths with the species lists from the islands in 1886-1985, and with the present vegetation in the area of seed bank sampling. We have also investigated the distribution in the soil of seeds from species with different ecological attributes, including seed longevity, successional status, seed weight, seed form and species longevity. 3 Seeds in soil samples were allowed to germinate over the course of two summers with an intermediate cold storage. We found 1944 seeds representing 65 taxa. The mean seed density was 84 seeds dm(-2). 4 The similarity between the surface soil (0-3 cm) seed bank and the vegetation at the different vegetation analyses increased from 1886 to 1993. The similarity between the present vegetation and the seed bank decreased with increasing soil depth, and the soil at 12-15 cm had no species in common with the present vegetation. Several species now absent from the vegetation were found in the seed bank. 5 Deeply buried seeds came from early successional, annual species with long-term persistent and low-weight seeds, as expected from seed bank theories, but were slightly elongated, which was in contrast to theories. Spherical seeds were associated with the surface soil, as were short-lived and high-weight seeds from late successional, perennial species.

J	Morgan, JW				Morgan, JW			Composition and seasonal flux of the soil seed bank of species-rich Themeda triandra grasslands in relation to burning history	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Most species-rich grasslands dominated by Themeda triandra in southeastern Australia have been ungrazed and frequently burnt for decades. The seedling emergence technique was used to determine the size and taxonomic composition of the soil seed bank of five grasslands that had different fire histories (i.e. burnt at 1 yr, 3 yr and greater than or equal to 10 yr intervals) and this was compared to the standing vegetation at each sire. A nested sampling design (subplot, plot, site) was used to determine the effect of spatial scale on the patterns observed in both the vegetation and the seed bank. Temporal variation in the seed bank was assessed by repeated soil sampling over a two year period. 61 native and 30 exotic species were recorded in the vegetation. Richness varied more between sites than within sites. Sites were therefore internally homogeneous for species richness. However, no correlation between burning frequency and richness was found. DCA ordination separated the sites into distinct groups, but sites with similar fire history did not necessarily group closely. 60 taxa germinated from the soil seed bank, comprising 32 native and 28 exotic species; 11 species, mostly therophytes, were restricted to the seed bank. The richness of the seed bank was significantly lower than the vegetation at all spatial scales. No correlation between seed bank richness and fire history was found. The seed bank of species-rich grasslands is dominated by a limited number of widespread, highly clumped, annual, native and exotic monocots. Most native hemicryptophytes, and perennials in general, were represented in the soil by a transient seed bank. Only 12 % of study species, all therophytes, were considered to form large, persistent seed banks, the size of which was greater in unburnt grasslands at all times of the year. The distinct floristic patterns observed in the vegetation are less clearly represented in the seed bank. The seed bank represents a floristically distinct (and less variable) component of the vegetation when compared to the standing flora. The size of the long-term. soil seed bank suggests that it has little functional importance for many native species and probably contributes little to seedling regeneration processes following disturbance. Altering established fire regimes is likely to only change the composition and small-scale richness of the existing site vegetation and will not re-integrate species previously lost from the vegetation due to past management. It is suggested that the maintenance of vegetation remnants and processes that encompass a range of long-term burning histories will be necessary if the flora is to be conserved in situ. Restoration of degraded grasslands cannot rely on the soil seed bank but rather, will be dependent on the reintroduction of propagules.																	1100-9233					APR	1998	9	2					145	156		10.2307/3237113							WOS:000073995400001						
J	Iida, S; Nakashizuka, T				Iida, S; Nakashizuka, T			Spatial and temporal dispersal of Kalopanax pictus seeds in a temperate deciduous forest, central Japan	PLANT ECOLOGY												We determined the role of bird dispersal in seed and seedling dynamics of the tree Kalopanax pictus from 7 years of observing seed rain and seedling emergence in a broad-leaved deciduous forest in central Japan. We also performed an experiment on the influence of seed pulp on germination of seeds of K. pictus. Seeds of this species can lie dormant for several pears, and this causes rather constant yearly seedling emergence in spite of irregular seed production. The spatial distribution of the seedlings that emerged each year (maximum distance from nearest conspecific seed-bearing tree of 90 m) was wider than that of gravity-dispersed seeds (max. distance of 37 m): suggesting seed dispersal by birds in winter. Emerged seedling densities at sites over 20 m from the nearest conspecific seed-bearing tree were highest in the spring of 1991, about half a year after the largest seed fall of the observation period. However, emerged seedling densities within 20 m from seed-bearing trees were highest in 1992, 1.5 years after the largest seed fall. These field observations may be explained by the experimental results on the effects of seed pulp on germination. Intact seeds germinate slowly at low germination rates, while seeds without seed pulp germinate quickly at high germination rates. Fallen seeds with seed pulp thus appear to form a seed bank near seed sources (temporal dispersal), while seeds scattered by birds appear to increase the possibility of reaching the present safe sites in distant areas with quick germination (spatial dispersal).																	1385-0237					APR	1998	135	2					243	248		10.1023/A:1009779921463							WOS:000073345300010						
J	Anderson, RL				Anderson, RL			Seedling emergence of winter annual grasses as affected by limited tillage and crop canopy	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Jointed goatgrass and downy brome continue to plague winter wheat producers in the western United States. Because there are no effective herbicides for in-crop control of these weeds, producers are seeking cultural practices that stimulate seed germination and deplete the soil seed bank. We determined the effect of Limited tillage and crop canopy on seedling emergence of these grasses. One tillage operation with a sweep plow increased jointed goatgrass seedling emergence 74% in the first year but did not affect emergence in later years. Downy brome emergence was not affected by tillage. Jointed goatgrass seedlings emerged over 5 yr, whereas downy brome did not emerge after 3 yr. Seedling emergence of both species was two times greater in corn and barley than in prose millet. Producers will accrue more benefit for seedbank management with cultural strategies such as alternative rotations and competitive wheat canopies than with limited tillage using a sweep plow.																	0890-037X					APR-JUN	1998	12	2					262	267									WOS:000075005700011

We cannot overemphasize their importance. The value of plant genome initiatives is self-evident. The need is to identify priorities for action. The angiosperm genome is highly variable, but the extent of this variability is unknown. Uncertainties remain about the number of genes and the number of species living. Many plants will become extinct before they are discovered. We risk losing both genes and vital information about plant uses. There are also major gaps in our karyotypic knowledge. No chromosome count exists for >70% of angiosperm species. DNA C values are known for only approximate to 1% of angiosperms, a sample unrepresentative of the global flora. Researchers reported new relationships between genome size and characters of major interest for plant breeding and the environment and the need for more data. In 1997, a Royal Botanic Gardens Kew workshop identified gaps and planned international collaboration to fill them. An electronic version of the Angiosperm DNA C value database also was published. Another initiative, which will make a very significant contribution to the conservation of plant genetic diversity on a global scale is Kew's Millennium Seed Bank, partly funded by the U.K. Millennium Commission, celebrating the year 2000. Costing up to pound 80 million (pound 1 = $1.62), its main aims are to collect and conserve the seed of almost all of the U.K. spermatophyte flora by the year 2000, to collect and conserve a further 10% of the world spermatophyte flora principally from the drylands by 2009, and to provide a world class building as the focus of this activity by 2000.																	0027-8424					MAR 3	1998	95	5					2011	2016		10.1073/pnas.95.5.2011							WOS:000072366600012	9482826

This study revealed that arable weed communities have long-lived seeds compared to the transient seed bank of deciduous woodland; species-rich grassland communities tend to have a short-lived soil seed bank, intermediate between the latter two communities, Moreover, the present study showed that significant differences in community longevity exist between weed communities as well as between grassland communities. The approach based on soil seed bank spectra of plant communities gives support to existing phytosociological theories on different strategies of plant communities sensu Stortelder (1992) and Schaminee & Stortelder (1996). The information on seed longevity of communities is essential to the practice of nature conservation and nature development because it reveals the possible vulnerability of plant communities to extinction, including their soil seed banks, the necessity of their conservation and their possibilities for regeneration.

Knowledge of seed dispersal and seed survival of species with nature conservation interest is necessary to anticipate measures to enhance their establishment. The interpretation of the results from seed bank and seed dispersal research for conservation purposes is not always easy. In this paper, an overview is given of methods used to estimate the importance of seed bank and seed dispersal during vegetation restoration. The consequences of the methodology of seed bank and seed dispersal research for decision making in nature management are discussed. Qualitative as well as quantitative methods only provide for rough estimations of seed availability. However, such rough estimations could still prove to be very useful in restoration management.																	0044-5983					MAR	1998	47	1					57	70									WOS:000073830300006

In this Plan, target communities and target plant species are mentioned. For the 'Drentse A brook valley system', target communities were assessed by the Province of Drenthe. In the present study, a model is described that predicts the number of target plant species for four seminatural target communities, namely: species-rich meadow, heathland, arable field and species-rich woodland. Information is used on the present and past occurrence of target plant species in the study area. An estimate is made for the probability of germination from the seed bank and for the probability of seed dispersal for each of the four target communities. The model predicts a large deficit between the number of predicted plant species and a completely developed target community. Only half the target plant species can be expected at a maximum (for species-rich meadow). For heathland, 38% of the target plant species can be expected, while for species ich woodland and arable field not more than 16% and, respectively, 8% of the target species are predicted to occur. Therefore, if nature policy in The Netherlands aims at completely developed target communities, there is an evident need for extra measures such as active introduction of species.																	0044-5983					MAR	1998	47	1					71	88									WOS:000073830300007						
J	Kalamees, R; Zobel, M				Kalamees, R; Zobel, M			Soil seed bank composition in different successional stages of a species rich wooded meadow in Laelatu, western Estonia	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We studied the seed bank of a calcareous grassland in four sites with different management history: original old grassland, which has been described as one of the richest plant communities in Europe, long-term restored grassland, which has been overgrown in the seventies, recently overgrown (ca. 20 years ago) and long-term overgrown grasslands. The seed banks in grassland sites at Laelatu were small both in size and number of species. The number of species and seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from managed grasslands to closed overgrown community. The highest species richness of the soil seed bank (number of species per soil volume) was found in the managed grassland sites, the seed density in the bank was the highest in the long-term restored grassland site. About one third of ail the grassland species were found in the seed bank. The proportion of species in the established vegetation - represented also in the bank - was higher in overgrown sites. However, ordination (Correspondence Analysis), which also took into account species frequencies, showed that the similarity between established vegetation on plots and seed bank samples decreased from original grassland to closed overgrown grassland. The persistence of the seeds of only 8-10 typical grassland species in the seed bank of overgrown grassland sites makes the significance of the seed bank for community restoration quite small.

The purpose of the first experiment was to assess the effect of temperature on the rate of emergence and the second was designed to study the effect of light on the competition during the established phase. P. pectinatus tubers sprouted after about 4 days at 16 degrees C and 9 days at 10 degrees C, which was sooner than either oospores or bulbils of C. aspera (about 15 days at 16 degrees C and 27 days at 10 degrees C). When the irradiance was 36 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the ash-free dry weight biomass of both species was about 80% lower than at 416 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and the biomass was not affected by neighbouring plants. However, in the higher light treatment the presence of P. pectinatus suppressed the biomass of C. aspera by maximally 63%. The individual biomass of P. pectinatus at high initial plant densities was reduced by maximally 70% by other plants of the same species, but was not affected by C. aspera. It is concluded that P. pectinatus rather than C. aspera has an advantage in the phase of emergence during spring. Furthermore, under higher light conditions and high inorganic carbon concentrations P. pectinatus may be a better competitor for light than C. aspera, because of its canopy placement near the water surface.

J	Dalling, JW; Swaine, MD; Garwood, NC				Dalling, JW; Swaine, MD; Garwood, NC			Dispersal patterns and seed bank dynamics of pioneer trees in moist tropical forest	ECOLOGY												Seed dispersal patterns and seed persistence in the soil should strongly influence the distribution of pioneer tree recruits in gaps. Nonetheless, seed distribution patterns for pioneers are poorly known, and processes controlling the fate of seeds in the soil have been little explored. We examined patterns of seed rain, seed abundance in the soil, and seed mortality of two common pioneer trees, Miconia argentea (Melastomataceae) and Cecropia insignis (Moraceae), on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. For each species, we selected four isolated, reproductive trees within a 50-ha forest dynamics plot. Seed rain and soil seed bank samples were collected, respectively, in mesh traps and from soil cores sampled along transects radiating away from the tree crowns. At below-crown sites, seed rain inputs far exceeded soil seed bank densities measured at the end of the fruiting season. For Miconia, the below-crown seed bank in the surface 3 cm of soil accounted for only 23% of seed rain, and for Cecropia, only 2%. However for Miconia, at distances >5 m from the crown seed bank densities exceeded the annual seed rain input. For both species log seed densities in the seed bank declined linearly with log distance from the crown and also decreased dramatically through the year. The annual loss rate of Miconia seeds was >90% below the crown and declined to 65% at 30 m from the crown. The annual loss rate for Cecropia was >90% at all distances. Seed losses in the seed bank could be largely attributed to mortality from pathogenic fungi. Fungicide treatment significantly increased seed survival in the soil for both species. For these two gap-dependent pioneer species, rapid seed-bank turnover rates and logarithmic declines in soil seed density with distance from adults suggested that both the spatial distribution and timing of gap formation may have influenced their chances of successful gap colonization. Recruitment from distant seed sources, or from seeds surviving in the soil after the death of the parent tree, may be relatively rare for these species.																	0012-9658					MAR	1998	79	2					564	578		10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0564:DPASBD]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000072387600016						
J	Guo, QF; Rundel, PW; Goodall, DW				Guo, QF; Rundel, PW; Goodall, DW			Horizontal and vertical distribution of desert seed banks: patterns, causes, and implications	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												This study examined small-scale seed distribution using published data collected using the same techniques and the same group of observers in four locations in North American deserts (Curlew Valley, Utah in the Great Basin Desert; Rock Valley, Nevada in the Mojave Desert; Silverbell, Arizona in the Sonoran Desert; and Jornada, New Mexico in the Chihuahuan Desert). The distribution patterns were examined horizontally (under shrub canopy to open areas) and vertically (measured at the soil surface and at four depth intervals) in relation to seed morphology. At all four sites, seed distribution of individual species was positively related to seed abundance. Horizontally, total number of seeds per unit area decreased from under the shrub canopy to intershrub areas. Vertically, total number of seeds declined as soil depth increased. Most species were only present in a small proportion of samples. Small seeds were either abundant and broadly distributed or rare and found in a few samples, but larger seeds were always low in abundance and restricted to a small proportion of samples. For annual species, significantly higher proportions of larger seeds than smaller seeds were found deeper in the soil. However, when much larger-seeded species, i.e. herbaceous perennials and shrubs, were included in the analyses, most very small or very large seeds were found in the upper-most layers of soils and intermediate to large-sized seeds deeper in the soils. Such seed distribution related to seed morphology and soil factors may have significant ecological implications in plant population dynamics and community structure in desert ecosystems.

J	Thorhallsdottir, TE				Thorhallsdottir, TE			Flowering phenology in the central highland of Iceland and implications for climatic warming in the Arctic	OECOLOGIA												The cool and short growing season that characterizes Arctic climates puts severe constraints on life cycles and reproduction in the Arctic flora. The timing of flowering is particularly critical and may affect both breeding system and reproductive success through the heavy penalties associated with later flowering. An 11-year study of 75 species in the central highland of Iceland showed that the onset of flowering varies greatly among years. The number of species in flower by the first week of July was closely correlated with air temperature (degree days above zero) in the preceding 5 weeks, but no correlations were found with degree days in May or with total degree days in the previous growing season. Time of snowmelt, which has widely been regarded as the environmental event initiating growth and flowering in alpine and arctic tundra, only had a significant effect when two exceptionally cold and late summers were included. The species studied, most of which have a wide distribution in the Arctic, are predicted to respond quickly to warmer spring and early summer temperatures. Accelerated phenologies may alter patterns of resource allocation, have implications for pollinators and pollinator-competition, and could increase the size, species richness and intraspecific genetic diversity of the soil seed bank.																	0029-8549					MAR	1998	114	1					43	49		10.1007/s004420050418							WOS:000072725300006	28307556

The restoration of such ecosystems has been tested in many regions and after many sorts of degradation. According to the level of initial degradation, different responses can be envisioned. Some variations are presented of a general model of restoration and rehabilitation: (1) rejuvenation of fallow land by grazing with rustic animal breeds in wetlands or chalk grasslands in south and northwestern France, (2) restoration by recovery of extensive agricultural management in intensive agricultural areas such as the Rhone or Meuse Valleys, and (3) rehabilitation by appropriate ecological engineering carried out in grasslands degraded by intensification, ski-track, or civil engineering installations. Despite some positive results, these undertakings have not always had the expected effects and therefore should not provide alibis for the destruction of natural grasslands. In general, the success of such undertakings depends on the maintenance in the surrounding areas of protected seed source reservoirs and on the persistence of a diversified landscape pattern permitting connectivity between these seed sources and the restoration or rehabilitation sites.

J	Andersson, L; Milberg, P				Andersson, L; Milberg, P			Variation in seed dormancy among mother plants, populations and years of seed collection	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Variation in dormancy level was tested in seeds of four species, each collected from three populations in 1994 and 1995 (experiment 1). Germination was tested in light and darkness on recently-harvested seeds and on those after-ripened in dry storage for one year. In addition, seeds from each of eight individual plants within each of eight populations were tested for germination when recently harvested and after warm stratification or cold stratification followed by a drying period (experiment 2). Seeds from the two years differed in dormancy level in Silene noctiflora, Sinapis arvensis and Spergula arvensis. Germination percentage differed significantly among populations in Sinapis arvensis and Spergula arvensis in both experiments and in Thlaspi arvense in experiment 2. Furthermore, dormancy level in seeds from different mother plants also varied in the three species tested in experiment 2. Variations at the three levels tested (year, population and mother plant) indicate that these species have a random pattern of variation in dormancy level. It is concluded that variation in seed dormancy among mother plants, populations and years must be taken into account when testing the germination characteristics of a species and also when attempting to model weed seed bank dynamics.

J	Bertiller, MB				Bertiller, MB			Spatial patterns of the germinable soil seed bank in northern Patagonia	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The spatial variation of the soil seed bank in the steppe of Larrea divaricata and Stipa spp. was evaluated in relation to the spatial pattern of the established vegetation, over two years. Plant distribution was expected to affect the spatial pattern of the soil seed bank. It was hypothesized that patches of bare soil are seed-limited, while soil beneath the external crown of vegetation patches contains greater numbers of seeds. The soil seed bank of the steppe of Larrea divaricata and Stipa spp. displayed a patchy distribution associated with the spatial pattern of above-ground vegetation. Seed banks in areas of bare soil showed lower numbers of seeds than those beneath vegetation. The soil seed bank was dominated by annuals, both in open areas of soil and under vegetation canopies. The relative composition of the soil seed bank varied spatially. Annuals (dicots and grasses) were more abundant in grass-shrub patches (GSP) and grass patches (GP) than in incipient grass-shrub patches (IGSP) and bare soil (BS). Seeds of perennial grasses were more abundant under GP, less abundant under grass-shrub mixed canopies (IGSP and GSP) and practically absent in BS. In addition, seeds of perennial dicots were more frequent in grass-shrub mixed canopies, scarcely represented in GP and absent in BS. The concentration of seeds of perennial grasses in GP and GSP indicates that these are essential for the maintenance of the size of grass populations. Sustainable management should be focused to maintain the structure and function of these types of vegetation patches.																	0960-2585					MAR	1998	8	1					39	45		10.1017/S0960258500003895							WOS:000072945200005						
J	Masaki, T; Tanaka, H; Shibata, M; Nakashizuka, T				Masaki, T; Tanaka, H; Shibata, M; Nakashizuka, T			The seed bank dynamics of Cornus controversa and their role in regeneration	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed-bank dynamics of C. controversa, a common tree in Japanese temperate forests, were investigated at Ogawa Forest Reserve by direct measurement of seed input, soil seed density, and seedling output (germination of soil seeds), together with two field experiments on postdispersal seed mortality. Soil seed density varied from 4 to 233 m(-2) in the site near conspecific adults (<5 m horizontally from crown edge), and 0 to 18 m(-2) in far sites (greater than or equal to 5 m) during the 1988-92 period. Seed input occurred only in 1988 and 1990: 190-740 m(-2) at the sites near conspecific adults, and 4-20 m(-2) at the far sites. Seedling output was observed every year and accounted for 0-15% of the loss from the seed bank, occasionally 30-60%. Seeds buried at 5-cm depth suffered moderate mortality (c. 0.2 year(-1)) by fungal pathogens. In contrast, seeds experimentally placed on the ground suffered higher mortality (0.5-1 year(-1)) through predation by ground mammals, probably wood mice. In the experiment, seeds whose mesocarp was removed survived much better. On the other hand, distance itself did not appear to affect post-dispersal mortality of seeds. Seeds in canopy gaps also tended to suffer higher mortality. Current spatial pattern and mode of seed dispersal should decrease the potential ability of the seed bank of this species to colonize safe sites. Rare and unpredictable events might increase the contribution of the seed-bank strategy to regeneration in this forest.																	0960-2585					MAR	1998	8	1					53	63		10.1017/S0960258500003913							WOS:000072945200007						
J	Walck, JL; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC				Walck, JL; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC			A comparative study of the seed germination biology of a narrow endemic and two geographically-widespread species of Solidago (Asteraceae). 6. Seed bank	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seeds of the geographically-widespread Solidago altissima and S. nemoralis and the narrow-endemic S. shortii were buried in pots of soil and placed in a glasshouse without temperature control. After 0.3-4.3 years of burial, some seeds (21-60%) of all three species were viable and they germinated to 75-100% during 2 weeks of incubation in light at 30/15 degrees C. Soil samples collected from several population sites of S. altissima, S. nemoralis and S. shortii were placed in the glasshouse and monitored for seedling emergence. During the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth springs, the number of S. altissima seedlings m(-2) emerging was 108-1080, 8-494, 0-520, 0-69, 0-6 and 3, respectively, of S. nemoralis was 108-1122, 17-667, 0-42, 0-6, 0 and 0, respectively, and of S. shortii was 61-1753, 0-25, 0-6, 0, 0 and 0, respectively. More seedlings emerged from disturbed than from non-disturbed soil, but the differences were not significant. Thus, although some seeds of all three species buried in pots remained viable in soil throughout the 4.3-year burial period, longevity was greater and size of seed bank larger in field-collected soil samples containing seeds of the geographically-widespread species than in those containing seeds of the narrow endemic. Although 34 studies have reported seeds of 17 species of Solidago present in soil seed banks, the present study is the first to show conclusively that Solidago can form a persistent seed bank.																	0960-2585					MAR	1998	8	1					65	74		10.1017/S0960258500003925							WOS:000072945200008						
J	Gallandt, ER; Liebman, M; Corson, S; Porter, GA; Ullrich, SD				Gallandt, ER; Liebman, M; Corson, S; Porter, GA; Ullrich, SD			Effects of pest and soil management systems on weed dynamics in potato	WEED SCIENCE												Results from the "Potato Ecosystem Project," a cropping systems study in northern Maine, were used to test the hypothesis that greater reliance on organic nutrient sources and less reliance on synthetic fertilizer sources can benefit weed management efforts. 'Atlantic' potato was grown in a 2-yr rotation within a factorial arrangement of three pest management systems, two soil management systems, and both rotation entry points. Weed control in the conventional (CONV) pest management system relied on full rates of herbicides, whereas the biointensive (BIO) system relied exclusively on cultivation. The reduced input (RI) pest management system relied on cultivation in 1991 and 1992 and on 50% of standard herbicide rates plus cultivation from 1993 to 1995. The two soil management systems, unamended (barley/red clover rotation crop; 1x synthetic fertilizer for potato) and amended (pea/oat/hairy vetch green manure rotation crop; manure, compost, and 0.5x synthetic fertilizer for potato) contrasted practices typical for the region to those designed to achieve rapid improvements in soil quality. Midseason weed biomass in potato was dominated by common lambsquarters. In 1991 and 1992, weed biomass in potato was least in the CONV system and did not differ between the RI and BIO systems. In 1993, weeds in both RI and CONV potatoes were effectively suppressed below the level measured in the BIO system. Soil management had no effect on weed biomass from 1991 to 1993 but became an important factor affecting weeds in the BIO system in 1994 and 1995. Weed biomass was 77% lower in 1994 and 72% lower in 1995 in the amended soil management system than in the unamended system. No significant yield loss due to weeds was detected in the 1994 BIO system, but in 1995 yield loss due to weeds was 37% in the unamended system compared to 12% in the amended system. Soil management effects on weeds in the 1994 BIO pest management system carried through to the following season's germinable seed bank. Density of germinable common lambsquarters seed (0 to 10 cm soil depth) in the 1995 BIO system was 4,082 m(-2) in the unamended soil management system compared to 1,280 m(-2) in the amended soil management system. We suggest that organic amendments and green manure promote a potato crop better able to compete with weeds and that these inputs be considered as potentially important components of integrated weed management systems that have minimal reliance on herbicides.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	1998	46	2					238	248		10.1017/S0043174500090482							WOS:000073371800016

The critical patch size of an annual plant population residing in a finite homogeneous habitat, using an integro-difference equation model is considered and this is found to be dependent on the basic population growth rate and dispersal characteristics. General analytical and numerical methods for the calculation of the critical patch size are presented with the inclusion of a simple new approximation technique. These methods are illustrated in the context of a species dispersing seeds on a Gaussian distribution. The approach is extended to incorporate a persistent seed-bank. Where the dispersion of seeds entering the seed-bank and those giving rise to adult plants is identical, the possession of a seed-bank influences the critical patch size through a scaling of the basic population growth rate. The wider implications of the approach are discussed in the context of metapopulation dynamics.

The design of the study separated vertebrate and nonvertebrate causes of overwinter seed mortality over three spatial scales. Vertebrate activity reduced seed survivorship more in disturbed than in intact forest, and within disturbed forest seed survival in patch types differed by transect, suggesting that vertebrate foraging behavior varies within the landscape context. Nonvertebrate and abiotic effects also suppressed seed survival within disturbed forest to a small but significant extent more than in intact forest, and transects within the disturbed area varied in their effects on survivorship. A second study examined the short-term spatial patterns of vertebrate predation only and showed transect-level patterns of seed predation that differed from those found in the longer term study. These results illustrate not only large spatial variation in vertebrate predation, but also the potentially important influence of less frequently measured effects of seasonal changes, abiotic conditions, and invertebrate and pathogenic attack on seed survival.																	0008-4026					FEB	1998	76	2					197	203		10.1139/b97-170							WOS:000073722300003						
J	Boeken, B; Shachak, M				Boeken, B; Shachak, M			The dynamics of abundance and incidence of annual plant species during colonization in a desert	ECOGRAPHY												We studied colonization of annual plants in small-scale disturbances and undisturbed soil for four years in the northern Negev desert. The experiment consisted of 24 patches of 1 m(2): eight undisturbed patches, eight 30 cm deep pits and eight 20 cm high mounds. Disturbance removed the seed bank from the pits and mounds. Rainfall was average during 1992 and 1993 (163.5 and 157.0 mm), very low in 1994 (97.5 mm) and very high in 1995 (283.0 mm). For all ca 100 species in the assemblage, we measured abundance, as the average local density in patches occupied by the species, and incidence, the proportion of patches occupied. Abundance and incidence were positively correlated in the four years of the study (R-2 = 0.71, 0.56, 0.56 and 0.64). The relationship became steeper during the course of colonization. A minority of species colonized all patches rapidly and increased exponentially in abundance. These high incidence and abundance species responded little or not al all to variations in rainfall. Most of the species experienced frequent local extinctions and colonizations in few patches. These low abundance and low to medium incidence species responded strongly to rainfall by fluctuations in abundance. Differences per species between abundance and/or incidence in pits, mounds and matrix were evident in many species along the entire relationship. These were mostly in favor of pits. We propose that the positions and trajectories of the individual species in the abundance-incidence phase plane signify constraints on population growth along the abundance axis, and on colonization and population persistence along the incidence axis. Since species with lower incidence and abundance respond strongly to rainfall variation, we conclude that their local populations and spatial distribution are to a large extent site-limited. High-abundance and high-incidence species have few or weak constraints and experience density-independent population growth, which is only seed-limited. The causes of site limitation and its effect on population growth and on colonization and extinction processes differ for different species. In a number of species, abundance and incidence may be limited by dispersal, in conjunction with dispersal mode and patch-specific seed capture. Based on our case study we suggest that the trajectories of the species in the abundance-incidence phase plane are a useful tool for investigating assemblage dynamics.																	0906-7590					FEB	1998	21	1					63	73		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00394.x							WOS:000072501600007

Collections from warm desert habitats were more chilling-responsive and after-ripened more rapidly than those from cold desert habitats. In a field seed bank experiment, germination did not take place until the second spring, and 30% of the seeds remained viable and ungerminated after five springs. Cold desert collections showed highest seed bank carryover. Spring germination and seed bank carryover across years are important aspects of shadscale life history.

J	Thompson, K; Bakker, JP; Bekker, RM; Hodgson, JG				Thompson, K; Bakker, JP; Bekker, RM; Hodgson, JG			Ecological correlates of seed persistence in soil in the north-west European flora	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												I Using the data in a recently published seed bank database for north-west Europe, we describe how a species' seed bank behaviour can be characterized by a single 'longevity index', and investigate how representative the information in the database is of the north-west European flora. We also test the hypotheses that seeds of short-lived species are more persistent than those of long-lived species, and long-lived seeds are characteristic of species living in disturbed habitats. 2 The data are not representative of the north-west European flora as a whole; they are a fair reflection of a research effort that has been largely directed towards grassland and arable weeds. Data for rare species, non-agricultural habitats in general and wetlands, rocky habitats and native woodland in particular, are scarce or absent. 3 Annuals and biennials almost always have more persistent seeds than related perennials, and this difference is most striking when, as in Anagallis arvensis and Aphanes arvensis, the short-lived species have moved well away from the 'core' habitat of the family. Confamilial monocarps and polycarps do not differ consistently in seed mass. 4 Gradients of habitat disturbance are accompanied by predictable changes in seed persistence, which are themselves often (but not always) accompanied by parallel shifts in seed size. These results suggest that increasing habitat disturbance (i.e. increasing density-independent mortality) always selects for increased seed persistence, confirming both theory and previous analyses. However, increased seed persistence is not always associated with reduced seed size. This is because persistence depends not only on seed size, but on other traits, many of them physiological. In many habitats the probability of seed burial is strongly linked to seed size and shape, but in arable habitats cultural practices have broken this link.																	0022-0477					FEB	1998	86	1					163	169		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00240.x							WOS:000072549200014						
J	Onipchenko, VG; Semenova, GV; van der Maarel, E				Onipchenko, VG; Semenova, GV; van der Maarel, E			Population strategies in severe environments: Alpine plants in the northwestern Caucasus	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												This study attempts to show a differentiation into strategy types among plant species of four alpine communities in the northwestern Caucasus, Russia. Four groups of population characteristics (traits) were examined: above-ground biomass, seed size, seed yield and occurrence of a persistent seed bank. In addition, values for relative growth rate and a morphology index were estimated. Agglomerative Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis were applied to a data set with 42 species from these communities and six species characteristics. In the Geranium gymnocaulon meadow, the most productive community, large gaps occur created by wild boars and bears. Here, the response of 13 species to disturbance was also analysed. Strategy types were approached both according to Grime: 'competitive', 'ruderal', 'stress-tolerating' and according to Ramensky, Rabotnov and Romanovsky: 'violent' dominant (V),'explerent' explorative(E) and 'patient' endurant (P). Differentiation into strategy types was more obvious in productive alpine grasslands than in lichen heaths and snowbed communities. The grassland dominants Festuca val-ia, Geranium gymnocaulon and Hedysarum caucasicum showed a more or less 'violent' strategy. Species approaching an E-strategy, e.g. Matrical ia caucasica, Sibbaldia procumbens and Gnaphalium supinum, were also found in the grasslands but prevailed in the snowbed communities. Species with a 'patient' strategy prevailed in the lichen heaths. We conclude that plant strategy types are well-differentiated, this is also seen in plant communities occurring under severe high-mountain conditions. We also suggest that the approaches by Crime and Ramensky/Rabotnov/Romanovsky are not so similar as has been assumed earlier and that the R/R/R types are better differentiated and ecologically better interpretable. We emphasize the gradient character of strategy 'types' and would characterize plant species by the degree of adaptation to conditions: (I) from small seed size and large persistent seed bank to large seed size and absence of a seed bank; (2) from high to low biomass and seed production, with relative growth rate as a less important partially correlated trait.

J	Drake, DR				Drake, DR			Relationships among the seed rain, seed bank and vegetation of a Hawaiian forest	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Hawaiian ecosystems are prone to invasion by alien plant species. I compared the seed rain, seed bank, and vegetation of a native Hawaiian forest to examine the potential role that seed ecology plays in allowing alien species to invade native forest. Absolute cover of seed plants in the forest was 126 %, annual seed rain was 5 713 seeds m(-2) yr(-1), and the mean density of seedlings emerging from the seed bank averaged across four seasons was 1020/m(2). The endemic tree Metrosideros polymorpha was the most abundant species in the vegetation, seed rain and winter seed bank. Overall, native seed plants comprised 95 % of the relative cover in the vegetation and 99 % of the seeds in the seed rain, but alien species comprised 67 % of the seeds in the seed bank. Alien species tended to form persistent seed banks while native species formed transient or pseudo-persistent seed banks. Dominance of the seed bank by alien species with persistent seed banks suggests that aliens are favorably placed to increase in abundance in the vegetation if the forest is disturbed.																	1100-9233					FEB	1998	9	1					103	112		10.2307/3237228							WOS:000072873800011

Season-long weed interference caused significant decreases in fresh pod yield. Length of the weed-free period required to prevent more than 5 % yield Loss ranged from 34-36 and 14-54 DAE for pole beans in wet and dry seasons, respectively. If the same yield loss level is accepted for bush beans, the effective weed-free period is between 9-42 and 4- end of harvest in two seasons, respectively. Leaf area index (LAI) and crop growth rates (CGR) were more affected than other growth indices. Season-Long weed interference reduced crop LAI more than 50 % in bath bean cultivars. Crop growth rates of bush and pole beans were reduced by 65 % and 55 %, respectively. Weeding frequencies did not affect relative growth rate and net assimilation rates. The heights of bush bean plants were greater in season-long weed interference situation followed by the other early season weed interference situations. The number of pods per plant was the most affected yield component in both cultivars. Pole bean suppressed weeds better than bush bean. The timing of the change in LAI and CGR between weedy and weed-free bean treatment coincided with the timing of the critical period of weed removal. This study revealed that LAI, CGR and the number of pods per plant are good indicators of weed interference in common beans.																	0368-9697						1998	50		1-4				829	831									WOS:000077553300090

Presently there are no efficient management methods to alleviate the agronomical problem posed by witchweeds. In a multidisciplinary research program addressed to the Striga problem, we conducted histological work to study the effects of a weevil (Smicronyx spp.) on Striga seed production. The embryological development of Striga hermonthica was studied in normal (unattacked) and attacked (by Smicronyx weevils) capsules. The results on the impact of Smicronyx weevils on Striga fruit are described. Our findings should be of interest in implementing a Shiga management program based on seed bank control. Seed bank management should be integrated with other control tactics to achieve a practical and agronomical impact on Striga populations.																	0001-5296						1998	40						9	13									WOS:000079168600001						
J	Falinska, K				Falinska, K			Long-term changes in size and composition of seed bank during succession: From meadow to forest	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Studies of the relation between the size and floristic composition of the Seed bank and the vegetation during succession were conducted in the years 1976-1996. The results of the research did not confirm the hypothesis of directional changes in the density of seeds as the observed changes were of fluctuating nature. At the start of succession the seed bank was small (2970 seeds/m(2)), and in subsequent years the density of seeds increased successively to reach the highest level after 15 years (9170/m(2)), then dropped again. After 20 years the density of seeds reached the value recorded at the initial stage (2468/m(2)). Successional changes in floristic richness of seed bank were directional with the number of species falling from 52 to 24. All data indicate that the floristic composition of the seed bank is not a mirror reflection of the vegetation structure, but rather a record of a long-term turnover of species and many different events which in various periods of time influenced the inflow of seeds to the soil (spatial dynamics of the necromass, perennial herb and willow canopy structure, seed migration).																	0001-6977						1998	67	3-4					301	311									WOS:000077823800016						
J	Jankowska-Blaszczuk, M				Jankowska-Blaszczuk, M			Variability of the soil seed banks in the natural deciduous forest in the Bialowieza National Park	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Using the germination method, the species diversity, density of the soil seed bank and its relation to cover vegetation in a natural deciduous forest with primary and secondary tree stand were compared. It was found that the mean density and species composition of the soil seed bank in the forest with secondary tree stand that has spontaneously been overgrown over the last 90 years after clear-cubing does not differ from the soil seed bank derived from primeval forest (3167m(-2) vs. 3827m(-2)). In both stands there were 46 species altogether and 36 were common and seed banks were dominated by herbs. The most abundant in this group were: UI-rica dioica, Chrysosplenium alternifolium, Geranium robertianum, Oxalis acetosella. In both cases it was found that the species structure of the herb layer was similar to that of the seed bank in about 70%. The seed banks of species absent from the herb layer or present there only sporadically were much more abundant. The seedlings of these species constituted more than one third of all seedlings that emerged in the samples from the secondary tree stand and only 5% those from the primary one. The analysis of seed bank in heavily rooted places under primary and secondary tree stands showed that in places with a totally distroyed herb layer the density of the soil seed bank in primeval forest was three times lower than in places with fully developed herb layer structure (102.60+/-22.61 vs. 307.0+/-206.5 per sample). This difference under secondary tree stand turned out to be much lower (415.8+/-137.8 vs. 358.2+/-126.0 per sample).

The disturbance regime is made up of dry periods in the marshes and of predation. Mechanisms of species diversity maintenance in these communities have been analysed using the theoretical framework of the non-equilibrium models. Regeneration patterns of populations (including germination, growth and reproduction) are determined to understand the relative abundance of each species and its variability, interacting with habitat conditions. Phenology appears to be an especially decisive parameter of the regeneration pattern. The variability of the community structure is compatible with the maintenance of all species if buffer mechanisms allow populations to be maintained on the site even when they are at a very low density following several unfavourable years. For the studied populations, such mechanisms occurred at the regeneration and the reproduction stage, which include a density-dependent parameter, and especially at the seed bank level. A detailed study of the spatial and temporal pattern of the seed bank shows its great importance in the maintenance of species diversity. The seed bank introduces a storage effect by magnifying the effect of the "favourable years" in comparison with the "bad years".																	0071-1128		3-510-47054-0				1998	52						53	69									WOS:000089402600004

Few address the importance of individual variation in the timing of germination. Here I examined the rate of germination within and among clones of dormant propagules (sessoblasts) of the freshwater bryozoan Plumatella emarginata. Germination rate was not significantly affected by either the initial density of sessoblasts or by recently germinated clonemates. Instead, germination rate appeared to be imposed by clonal lineage. Clones placed in a common garden experiment varied in the time to maximum germination (g(max)) by as many as 91 days, while the magnitude of g(max) varied from 25-100 %. Variation in the timing of emergence within and among clones may explain previously documented population-wide asynchrony. Clones germinating asynchronously had significantly greater survivorship and produced significantly more offspring per colony than did synchronously germinating clones, suggesting that asynchronous germination may be a strategy to spread the risk of local extinction in an unpredictably disturbed stream environment.																	0071-1128		3-510-47054-0				1998	52						85	96									WOS:000089402600006

Recent theory has examined how dormancy call trade off with other mechanisms for coping with risk, such as dispersal, seed or egg size, and adult longevity. Here we show that in many circumstances a tradeoff is not expected to occur between long-term diapause and a conservative (i.e., monomorphic) bet-hedging strategy during the active phase of the lift: cycle. We model a quantitative trait expressed during the active phase of the life cycle that affects relative reproductive success. Higher long-term diapause provides a 'safety net' and allows adults to adopt riskier traits. However in the absence of certain correlations between dormant-stage and active-stage fitness components, the ESS trait value is unaffected by the degree of long-term diapause, and is characterized as maximizing the geometric mean of relative fitness. For high temporal variance in the environment, the ESS may become polymorphic: either a diversified bet-hedging strategy, or a genetic polymorphism. A tradeoff then typically occurs within the population, with genetic correlation between dormant-stage and active-stage trait values. The distinction between conservative and diversified bet-hedging strategies may thus be important for determining whether tradeoffs occur between bet-hedging at different stages of the life cycle.																	0071-1128		3-510-47054-0				1998	52						297	312									WOS:000089402600023						
J	McCue, KA; Holtsford, TP				McCue, KA; Holtsford, TP			Seed bank influences on genetic diversity in the rare annual Clarkia springvillensis (Onagraceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The potential for seed banks to significantly affect the genetic structure of populations was recognized nearly two decades ago. However, there has been little empirical work that examines the problem. In this study, we explore the possibility that the seed bank of a rare annual, Clarkia springvillensis, could act as a buffer against the genetic consequences of small population size. We examined the adult and seed bank cohort in three natural populations. The seed bank was surveyed by collecting soil cores twice during the growing season: postgermination and post seed set. The genetic constitution of the adults and seed bank cohort was determined by examining eight polymorphic isozyme loci via starch,eel electrophoresis. The total genetic diversity in the seed bank (H-t = 0.355) was significantly higher than in the adults (H-t = 0.260). Additionally, F-st estimates of genetic differentiation among populations showed significantly less differentiation among population seed banks (F-st = 0.008) than among adults (F-st = 0.045). These results are in agreement with the expectation that seed banks would act to maintain genetic diversity in populations as well as have the effect of slowing differentiation of populations.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				JAN	1998	85	1					30	36		10.2307/2446551							WOS:000071684600005	21684877					
J	Jauhiainen, S				Jauhiainen, S			Seed and spore banks of two boreal mires	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The importance of the seed bank as a regenerative strategy in disturbed mires and the viability of seeds and spores in peat stratigraphy on two drained mires were studied prior to restoration. Most of the seedlings developed from the surface sample but still viable seeds occurred in the deepest layer sampled (50 cm). Germination from seeds, however, remained low. Six species of vascular plants: Betula pubescens Ehrh., Eriophorum vaginatum L., Rubus chamaemorus L., Vaccinium myrtillus L., V. uliginosum L., and Andromeda polifolia L. with a maximum of 367 seedlings per m(2) germinated. The regenerative strategy of these plants seems to be vegetative expansion from adventitious roots and buried propagules rather than germination from seeds. It was found, however, that some seeds in the peat profile may preserve their viability for centuries.																	0003-3847						1998	35	3					197	201									WOS:000077339400007

The study examined seeds of 4 accessions of serradella from separate growing sites (Pindar, Merredin, and Badgingarra), and included the effect of pod burial (only for accessions grown at Merredin). Pods were placed on the soil surface in December 1992 and sampled in March, June, and October for the next 3 years. Burial treatments (2 and 6 cm beneath the surface) commenced in June 1993 after pods had been on the soil surface for one summer. Samples were collected in June for the next 2 years. Softening of seeds over the first summer in the field was compared with that obtained in the laboratory with 16 weeks at a diurnally alternating temperature of 60/15 degrees C. Few seeds of any accession softened (generally <6%) at the soil surface during the first summer, but the rate of softening increased over the next 2 years. The highest annual rate of softening was about 55% in the third year in accessions GEH72-1A and GEH72-2A. Accession of serradella had more influence on pattern of seed softening than site at which seeds were produced. Burial of pods at 2 cm markedly accelerated seed softening in all strains, particularly GEH72-1A and cv. Madeira, in which over 95% of hard seeds softened during the first year of burial. Softening at 6 cm was similar to that at the soil surface. Shallow burial of pods, as would occur during cereal cropping in one year, could improve regeneration of serradella, but reduce the longevity of its seed bank. Laboratory treatment at 60/15 degrees C generally over-estimated field softening during the first summer. The spread of germination in time in laboratory tests differed between accessions and was much wider in GEH72-2A than in others, extending up to 35 days. Such behaviour could provide insurance against total seedling loss following false breaks of season.

J	Morgan, JW				Morgan, JW			Comparative germination responses of 28 temperate grassland species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The comparative germination biology of 28 perennial species native to the temperate grasslands of southern Victoria was tested using a single temperature regime (20/10 degrees C) in either constant darkness or 12 h diurnal white-light conditions. This temperature regime was chosen because it corresponds to the temperature found to produce substantial or optimal germination in other germination studies of grassland plants. Four germination attributes-time to the beginning of germination (germination lag), time taken to achieve 50% of final germination (germination speed -t(50)), percentage germination in diurnal light conditions and percentage germination in continuous darkness-were calculated for each species and correlated to three plant attributes: plant family, life form and seed weight. Germination lag was short for many species: 50% had a lag of less than 7 days, whilst 96% of species had begun germinating within 28 days. Germination speed was moderately fast for most species: 75% of species had a t(50) of less than 28 days. Total percentage germination in diurnal light or continuous darkness was variable (0-98%), but many species (64%) germinated readily (> 50%) in at least one treatment. Twenty-four percent of species had germination substantially inhibited by darkness (i.e. Acaena echinata, Bulbine bulbosa, Eryngium ovinum, Podolepis sp. aff. jaceoides, Velleia paradoxa and Wahlenbergia luteola). No species had its germination promoted by darkness. Few correlations between plant and germination attributes were detected. Seed weight was not correlated with any of the three germination attributes, nor was life form or plant family correlated with germination speed or percentage germination in the light or dark. Germination lag, however, was significantly associated with plant family and, in a related way, with life form: species from the Liliaceae (geophytes) took longer to begin germination than species from the Asteraceae (hemicryptophytes). The ecological implications of the observed germination biology on the potential formation of persistent soil seed banks and seedling recruitment dynamics are discussed.																	0067-1924						1998	46	2					209	219		10.1071/BT96117							WOS:000074445700005						
J	Cowling, RM; Lamont, BB				Cowling, RM; Lamont, BB			On the nature of Gondwanan species flocks: Diversity of Proteaceae in Mediterranean south-western Australia and South Africa	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY					Proteaceae Symposium	1996	UNIV MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA		UNIV MELBOURNE			The Proteaceae, a Gondwanan family, are richly represented in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR) (331 species, 14 genera) and Australia's South West Botanical Province (SWBP) (682 species, 16 genera). Both of these regions have mediterranean-type climates, infertile soils, similar geomorphic and climatic histories, and show strong convergences in plant form and function. There are many similarities in the patterns and ecological correlates of diversity in the CFR and SWBP Proteaceae. First, both floras are overwhelmingly endemic, with many large genera and correspondingly high species to genus ratios, indicating massive in situ diversification (species flocks). Second, on both continents, high habitat (mainly edaphic) specialisation leads to similar levels of beta diversity. Third, most species are non-sprouters (i.e. killed by fire) and of intermediate size. There are, however, several divergences in these patterns and correlates. First, in the SWBP, Proteaceae invariably emerge as one of the largest families in florulas, whereas they occupy a much lower rank in the CFR. Second, species numbers in the SWBP peak in landscapes having intermediate levels of annual rainfall, whereas CFR Proteaceae diversity peaks in the wettest areas. Third, local diversity is higher in the SWBP where Proteaceae have exploited a wider array of temporal and spatial habitats than in the CFR. Fourth, despite lower environmental heterogeneity in the SWBP, gamma (geographical) diversity is higher there. Fifth, as a result of higher local and gamma diversity, regional richness in the SWBP is more than double that of the CFR. Finally, sprouting, serotiny, bird-pollination and tall stature are proportionally more important traits in the SWBP than the CFR where most species are low, non-sprouting, myrmecochorous, insect-pollinated shrubs. Subtle differences in the historical and contemporary climates of the two regions have resulted in different processes leading to the origin of these species flocks. In the CFR, milder conditions have favoured non-sprouters (short generation times): species have accumulated largely as a result of lineage turnover. Harsher conditions in the SWBP have favoured sprouters: here species have accumulated as a result of both persistence and turnover.

A recently developed field sowing technique makes it possible to explore a variety of topics such as the length of time that seeds spend as part of the soil seed bank, the phenology of seed germination: substrate requirements for germination, dependence of germination on fungal availability, substrate requirements and growth rate of seedlings, seedling phenology and development, and seedling-fungus specificity patterns in the soil. Several of these applications are relevant for conservation issues. Studies of Goodgera pubescens, Corallorhiza odontorhiza and Liparis lilifolia show considerable variation in germination strategies, patterns of seedling development and establishment, substrate requirements, and levels of specificity with the fungi.

J	Staniforth, RJ; Griller, N; Lajzerowicz, C				Staniforth, RJ; Griller, N; Lajzerowicz, C			Soil seed banks from coastal subarctic ecosystems of Bird Cove, Hudson Bay	ECOSCIENCE												Coastal ecosystems at high latitudes are exposed to physical disturbances (abrasion by ice, tides, waves, and wind) and to degradation due to the grazing activities of waterfowl. The frequency of disturbance and the regenerative capacity of plants determine the recovery potential for the plant community. Since there have been no previous soil seed bank studies of coastal subarctic ecosystems, we examined the seed bank in soil samples collected from a beach ridge, a drift zone, a sand bar and a salt marsh at Bird Cove, near Churchill, Manitoba, on the western shoreline of Hudson Bay. Seedling emergence from soil samples after four successive periods of stratification at 5 degrees C totalled 2968 seedlings of 19 species. Mean emerged seedling densities for each ecosystem were (i) 786 seedlings/m(2) (beach ridge), (ii) 699 seedlings/m(2) (drift zone), (iii) 2875 seedlings/m(2) (sand bar), and (iv) 39 204 seedlings/m(2) (salt marsh). These densities are much higher than those for temperate coastal ecosystems and for most terrestrial, subarctic ecosystems. Ninety-seven percent of the 2772 identifiable emergents were of three ruderal species: Juncus bufonius, Senecio congestus and Spergularia marina. Juncus bufonius and S. marina are on the extreme northern limits of their ranges. These three common species were found from samples collected from all ecosystems except the beach ridge, which had no species in common with the other ecosystems and was dominated by Sagina nodosa and Saxifraga tricuspidata in its seed bank. There was little correlation between abundances of species in the seed bank and those in the aboveground vegetation except in the drift zone. Ninety-five percent of the seedlings emerged from the top 5 cm of the sand bar and salt marsh soils, whereas 91% within the drift were deeper than 85 cm. Seedling emergences increased with time and cold storage treatment; freshest samples (i.e., those with 35 days of cold storage) gave 6% of the ultimate emergence but this rose to 57% after two stratification episodes and then to 100% after three. This suggested that seed bank analysis using the emergence method should consider the germination requirements of each potential seed bank species.																	1195-6860						1998	5	2					241	249		10.1080/11956860.1998.11682457							WOS:000075128800013

In order to avoid problems in seed conservation due to seed-borne fungi, and to minimise/eradicate the risk of dissemination by infected seeds in germplasm exchange, detection of seed-associated fungi has been conducted on this material. Twenty-eight accessions of C. melo were analysed without any previous treatment. Two hundred seeds of each accession were tested using the Ulster method on two culture media; 100 were plated on PDA (general mycological medium) and 100 on Komada medium (selective for Fusarium oxysporum). After incubation, fungal identification was conducted by direct microscopic examination of colonies or slides preparations. A total of 5600 melon seeds were examined. Examination of seeds plated on PDA showed the presence of 15 genera of fungi, the highest percentages represented by the following : Aspergillus (11%), Alternaria (7%), Rhizopus (6%), Cladosporium (3%), Stemphylium (2%), Penicillium (2%), Fusarium (1%), and Helminthosporium (0.6%). F. moniliforme (1.6%), F. equiseti (0.9), F. solani (0.03) and F. oxysporum (0.03) were isolated on specific Komada medium. Most of these fungi are saprophytes and are common to different species, but F. moniliforme and F. oxysporum can be pathogenic, resulting in seed rot and death of melon seedlings. Three times more Fusarium spp. colonies were recorded on Komada medium than on PDA.																	0567-7572		90-6605-911-7				1998		492					201	205									WOS:000081942700025

Thirty accessions fi om Spanish seed bank collection have been tested through two inoculation methods. In the first method, all genotypes were inoculated with each race fungus suspension of about 1 x 10(4) propagules/ml. The inoculum was poured on the sterilized vermiculite substrate with 12 plants of each genotype/race at first true leaf stage. Plant pots were then placed in a green house (5-35 degrees C) and growth chamber at 15-20 degrees C (night/day). Accessions with less than 25% dead or diseased plants were selected to inoculated by a second method. In this second method seedlings grown for 10 days in sterile vermiculite were removed and their roots dipped into the same inoculum suspension for 1 hour (10 seedlings/race/accession). Then the seedlings were transferred to vermiculite substrate and placed in a growth chamber. Roots of control plants were dipped in tap water only. Final assessments of symptom severity were made after 30 days of inoculation. In addition, reisolations of the pathogen were attempted by culturing disc of stem taken from surviving plants. The results showed that a number of accessions may possess resistant genes to some of Fom four races. In the first inoculation we selected 10 accessions resistant to race 0 of Fom, 12 to race 1, 15 to race 2 and 3 to race 1,2; these selected accessions were reduced by using the second inoculation method: 6, 1, 4 and none accessions to race 0, 1, 2 and 1,2 respectively. These results were compared with Fom reisolations.																	0567-7572		90-6605-911-7				1998		492					329	334									WOS:000081942700045						
J	Tu, M; Titus, JH; Tsuyuzaki, S; del Moral, R				Tu, M; Titus, JH; Tsuyuzaki, S; del Moral, R			Composition and dynamics of wetland seed banks on Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens deposited new substrates upon which wetlands are now developing. We collected soil from five wetlands south of Spirit Lake, Mount St. Helens, Washington, to examine the seed banks. Seedling emergence density in the top 5 cm was highly variable, and ranged from (mean +/- s.d.) 15,700 +/- 15,200 to 38,000 +/- 31,500 per m(2.). Seedling emergence from soil at 5 to 10 cm depth varied from 800 +/- 600 to 18,000 +/- 24,800 per m(2), and averaged 1/3 as many seeds as the surface. The high proportion of buried seeds may be due to continuing deposition of upland sediments. We identified 17 taxa from the wetland soil samples with Epilobium ciliatum, Juncus bufonias, Agrostis exarata and Juncus ensifolius being the dominant species. Wetland vegetation was dominated by Equisetum arvense, Salix sitchensis, Typha latifolia and the four dominant species in the seed bank. Correlations between vegetation and seed bank were not significant for four of the five wetlands, and the dominance by Typha latifolia in two wetlands contributed to the low correlations. Thus, vegetation of these early successional wetlands generally was not similar to seed bank composition. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate soil parameters to vegetation and seed bank data. The vegetation was correlated primarily with soil particle size and secondarily to water temperature, while the seed bank was correlated to pH, texture and temperature.

J	McFarland, DG; Rogers, SJ				McFarland, DG; Rogers, SJ			The aquatic macrophyte seed bank in Lake Onalaska, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Submersed aquatic vegetation, dominated by Vallisneria americana Michx., declined dramatically in Lake Onalaska (Navigation Pool 7, on the Upper Mississippi River) following drought conditions in the late 1980s. Coinciding with the decline were marked increases in the abundance of phyllum spicatum L., particularly in areas vacated by A. americana. Recent evidence indicates that much of the lake has remained unvegetated, but that since 1994, beds of V. americana have made a partial recovery. While the production of vegetative propagules may largely account for increases in populations of both species, the extent to which seed production may contribute to their expansion in the lake is unknown. To assess the germination potential and distribution of the aquatic macrophyte seed bank in Lake Onalaska, sediment cores (5 cm deep) were collected from 74 sampling sites in July 1996. Seedling emergence from sediments was observed in an environmental growth chamber operated at 25 C and a 14-hr photoperiod over a period of eight weeks. Fifteen species of aquatic macrophytes germinated in sediments from 55 sites. V. americana seedlings emerged from sediments from 36 sites throughout the lake, but were most prevalent in sediments collected within or downstream (within 250 m) of established V. americana beds. Seedlings of M. spicatum emerged from only two collected sediments that had supported this species in protected areas. These findings suggest that seed production may play a greater role in the dispersal of V. americana than M. spicatum, and further emphasize basic differences in their survival strategies, particularly in flowing water systems.																	0146-6623					JAN	1998	36						33	39									WOS:000074549400009

J	Khan, MA; Aziz, S				Khan, MA; Aziz, S			Some aspects of salinity, plant density, and nutrient effects on Cressa cretica L.	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												The effects of salinity, density, and nutrient on the growth, reproduction, and ecophysiology of a perennial halophyte, Cressa cretica L., were studied. Lower salinity concentration (425 mM) promoted the growth, but the highest salinity (850 mM) did not have a significant effect. Plants grew faster and were healthier at low density treatment. Lack of nitrogen (N) in the medium substantially inhibited shoot growth. Higher rhizome length and increased dry weight were some of the symptoms of N-deficiency. Phosphorus (P)-free plants also showed higher dry weight and higher ratio of rhizomes to shoots. Reproductive capacity of Cressa cretica plants was not affected by the absence of P. Growth and reproduction of Cressa cretica plants were significantly inhibited by potassium (K) deficiency. Optimal plant growth was recorded in complete nutrient solution. Higher concentrations of oxalate were found in plants growing under low density conditions and in non-saline controls. Proline concentration increased with the increase in salinity of the medium. Chlorophyll a and b synthesis were inhibited by high salinity treatments whereas changes in density regimes did not have an effect.

The relationships among seedbank composition, seedbank depth, seed dormancy, and vegetative expression were evaluated for a range site on a Valentine fine sand soil (mixed, mesic Typic Ustipsamments) in the Sandhills Prairie. Twenty soil samples were collected at each of 2 depths (0 to 5, 15 to 20 cm) in early June 1990 and 1991 from 12 macroplots (32 X 32 m) representing 3 range condition classes. A seed extraction and germination trial was conducted to determine the diversity, size, and germinability of the persistent seedbank. Seedling emergence was counted in a greenhouse, with and without a 14-day prechilling(3 to 5 degrees C) stratification treatment, to characterize seedbank dormancy. Fourteen grass species, 17 forb species, and Schweinitz flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii Torr.) were identified in the seed bank. Two additional genera (Carer and Euphorbia) also occurred in the seedbank. Only 10 species occurred in 8 or more macroplots in both years. Aboveground botanical composition was not correlated with (P > 0.10) seedbank species composition. More germinable seeds occurred in the 0 to 5 cm depth (P < 0.01) than the 15 to 20 cm depth. Also, the species diversity and seed number were greater in the shallower depth. Germination percentage was low for all types of vegetation. Lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and annual eriogonum (Eriogonum annuum Nutt) had the largest seedbanks, but germination was less than 6%. Sand dropseed [Sporobolus cryptandrus (Torr.) Gray] and sand lovegrass [Eragrostis trichodes (Nutt.) Wood] were the most abundant perennial grasses and accounted for about 60% of the germinated seeds. Prechilling increased seedling emergence of grasses CP < 0.01), forbs (P < 0.01), and grass-like species (P < 0.01). Perennial grasses emerged first, forbs later, and grasslike species exhibited a bimodal emergence pattern. Based on germination percentage and emergence data, sand dropseed has the potential to colonize openings in the Sandhills prairie, possibly to the exclusion of many annuals occurring in the seedbank.																	0022-409X					JAN	1998	51	1					55	62		10.2307/4003564							WOS:000071419200010						
J	Leck, MA; Leck, CF				Leck, MA; Leck, CF			A ten-year seed bank study of old field succession in central New Jersey	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Seed bank and vegetation dynamics of a newly abandoned agricultural field were studied for a decade (1984-1994). Seed bank densities ranged from 3540 m(-2) (yr 1) to 50,182 m(-2) (yr 3), and species richness from 26 (yr 1) to 39 species (yr 7). Over the decade 55 taxa occurred in seed bank samples and 61 species in field quadrats. (The entire 15 ha field had 181 species of which only 67 were added after the first year. Four other species occurred only in seed bank samples). Of the 55 seed bank taxa, 15 made up 81 to 95% of the seed bank; of these, the most common were Aster pilosus, Conyza canadensis, Juncus spp., Lobelia inflata, Setaria faberi, and Veronica peregrina, which were 72% of the total. Densities of individual species varied significantly over the decade and with depth (0-3, 3-6, and 6-9 cm). Elimination of seed rain using exclosures maintained for one year caused a significant decrease in both seed bank density and species richness, Comparisons of seed bank species composition with the held vegetation showed divergence after the first year. Patterns of species importance (relative frequency) in the seed bank and in the vegetation varied over time. Importance of particular growth forms also varied with stage: in the seed bank the proportion of annual and perennial species remained similar, while in the vegetation, annual species declined as perennial and woody species increased, Exotic species were an important component of the seed bank (29.0 +/- 0.9%), vegetation (26.4 +/- 1.2%), and combined flora (37.7 +/- 3.1%). Seed bank dynamics and vegetation dynamics of early old field species were not similar, nor did seed bank patterns and life history strategies appear related.																	0040-9618					JAN-MAR	1998	125	1					11	32		10.2307/2997228							WOS:000072698800002

J	Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC				Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC			Greenhouse and laboratory studies on the ecological life cycle of Dalea foliosa (Fabaceae), a federal endangered species	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Certain aspects of the seed and flowering stages of the ecological life cycle of the endangered species Dalea foliosa (Gray) Barneby were investigated under greenhouse and laboratory conditions. Seed dormancy in this species is due to a water-impermeable ("hard") seed coat that can be broken completely by mechanical scarification. Nondormant seeds germinated over a wide range of temperatures in both light and darkness. Soaking in concentrated sulfuric acid for 5 min, dry-heating at 80-100 degrees C for 25-80 min, and dipping in boiling water for 1 min broke dormancy in 52%, 50-77%, and 29%, respectively, of the seeds. Fire caused breakdown of the hard seed coat of seeds on the soil surface, but killed the seeds. Dormancy was not broken by freezing and thawing, soaking in absolute ethanol, or exposing seeds to simulated-summer followed by winter-stratifying temperatures. Seeds sown in a nonheated greenhouse and those in soil samples collected at a population site germinated over a several-year period, mostly in March and April. Thus, the species can form a persistent seed bank. No plants of D. foliosa flowered under a 10-h daily photoperiod (short day), whereas 100% of those given an 8-h photoperiod plus a 2-h night interruption (long day) flowered. One-hundred percent of the plants kept in a heated greenhouse all winter and 100% of those exposed to winter cold in a nonheated greenhouse flowered. Thus, D. foliosa is an obligate long-day plant that does not require exposure to low temperatures for bud break, shoot growth, or flowering. Management implications of this study are discussed.																	0885-8608					JAN	1998	18	1					54	62									WOS:000071965000007						
J	Jerling, L				Jerling, L			Linnaeus' flora Kofsoensis revisited - floristic changes during 260 years in a small island of the Lake Malaren	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In 1731 Linnaeus made a total inventory of a small island in Lake Malaren, Sweden. In 1952 a new inventory was made. I repealed this 1982 and 1992. The present study compares 17 characteristics of the species which are persisting during the whole period to those which are colonising and those which go extinct. The turnover of species is high and only 40 percent of the 86 species initially found are still present in the last observation. The number of species increases from 86 in 1731 to 105 in 1952, 122 in 1982 and to 127 in 1992. Some species found in the seed bank are not represented in the present vegetation. The classification spectra to some extent reflect the changes of the surrounding landscape, from strong antropogenic influence to relaxed but later again intensified, but the classifications seem overall to be too crude to have an acceptable explanatory power for changes in species composition.																	0107-055X						1998	18	6					667	680		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1998.tb01549.x							WOS:000079215900003

Propagules were separated from harvested plants or from sediment collected in the artificial canal system. In the laboratory, propagule germination was examined at temperatures ranging from 2 to 41 degrees C during 30 days, followed by an additional 30 days at 19 degrees C. No germination was found at 2 degrees C, 36 degrees C and 41 degrees C in the first 30 days. Except for P. pectinatus seeds from the bank, there was no germination at 19 degrees C in propagules maintained at 36 degrees C or 41 degrees C. Those propagules which had been kept at low temperatures germinated between days 30-60. The optimum germination (p< 0.05) range fluctuated among propagules. In P. pectinatus germination was Door, but at 14 - 27 degrees C, 82% of the tubers sprouted in the first 10 days. In the first 30 days, seeds of Z. palustris germinated 66.8% between 6 and 27 degrees C and those of R. maritima 52.3% between 19 and 24 degrees C. Oospores of C. contraria germinated a maximum of 36.6% in the optimum range 24 - 27 degrees C. We conclude that winter temperatures at VIRC would allow seed germination of Z. palustris. Optimum germination range for all propagules coincide with mean spring and summer temperatures, although oospores of C, contraria would require higher temperatures.																	0031-9457						1998	63	1-2					167	178									WOS:000078394300024						
J	Stephanou, M; Manetas, Y				Stephanou, M; Manetas, Y			Enhanced UV-B radiation increases the reproductive effort in the Mediterranean shrub Cistus creticus under field conditions	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seedlings of the Mediterranean shrub Cistus creticus L. were grown in the field under ambient or ambient plus supplemental UV-B radiation (simulating a 15% ozone depletion over Patras, 38.3 degrees W, 29.1 degrees E) for 20 months. During this period, measurements of photosynthetic capacity, photochemical efficiency of PS II, chlorophylls and carotenoids were performed once per season. Supplemental UV-B radiation had no significant effect on these parameters nor on the total, above ground biomass accumulation, plant height and leaf specific mass measured at plant harvest. It was observed, however, that UV-B supplementation increased the number of seeds per fruit as well as mean individual seed mass. As a result, seed number and total seed mass per plant were considerably increased. Germination rates of produced seeds were not affected. We may conclude that C. creticus is a UV-B resistant plant whose competitive ability may be improved by enhanced UV-B radiation through an increase in its reproductive effort and a higher contribution to the seed bank.																	1385-0237					JAN	1998	134	1					91	96		10.1023/A:1009773105854							WOS:000072005400008

PLANT INVASIONS: ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND HUMAN RESPONSES					4th International Conference on the Ecology of Invasive Alien Plants	OCT 01-04, 1997	BERLIN, GERMANY	Bot Soc Berlin & Brandenburg, Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Okologie & Biol				Seed bank dynamics, stand regeneration and life stage transitions of the perennial alien forb Bunias orientalis, which is invasive in lowland limestone regions of Central Europe, were investigated at various habitats differentiated by type and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. At every phase of its lifecycle, the species profited from anthropogenic disturbance, such as mowing or soil disruption, based on species-specific traits such as rapid exploitation of resources provided by disturbance, high regeneration capacity and high growth rates. These opportunistic traits, combined with a permanent seed bank and polycarpic life-form, apparently contribute to the persistence and propagation of the stands of B. orientalis despite the rather low competitive ability of the species. Disturbance regimes of intermediate frequency, which repeatedly provide gaps for regeneration of adults, recruitment of seedlings and establishment of juvenile plants simultaneously seem to be most favorable and, therefore, promote further spread of the species.																			90-5782-005-6				1998							169	184									WOS:000079157800016

A field experiment was conducted to determine the influence of tillage practice and interference level on seed production potential, emergence pattern and soil seed bank of S. obtusifolia and X. strumarium and to determine the dominant species after introduction into a weed-free field. Interference level did not influence the soil seed bank except for S, obtusifolia under tilled conditions. Under tilled conditions, X. strumarium was the dominant species, and S. obtusifolia was dominant under no-till conditions. Soil seed bank loss was greater for both species with tillage. Three years after initial seed deposition, the remaining S. obtusifolia seeds were 100% viable while X. strumarium burs were not viable. Thus, under no-till conditions, the X, strumarium soil seed bank was depleted while S. obtusifolia was not.																	0571-0189						1998		186					83	86									WOS:000075355400020

The coastal populations maintained a persistent seed bank. There is a close relationship between seed bank flora and existing vegetation. The size of the seed bank varies with the species dominating the population. Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, which dominated the coastal swamps, had the highest seed density, 940,000 seed m(-2), followed by Halopyrum mucronatum, which showed 75,000 seed m(-2). For all other species (Suaeda fruticosa, Cressa cretica, Atriplex griffithii, and Aeluropus lagopoides), seed bank varies from 20,000 to 35,000 seed m(-2). Seed bank of all species substantially reduced a few months after dispersal.																							1998		11					227	230									WOS:000084980500039

SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The moisture relations of seed longevity in two populations of Astronium urundeuva (Fr. All.) Engl. (aroeira) from the Pernambuco region of Brazil were studied. The classification of aroeira seeds as orthodox and their potential for long-term storage under seed bank conditions (15% relative humidity (rh), -20 degrees C) were confirmed. A single regression adequately described the negative logarithmic relation between seed moisture content and longevity for the two populations. Analysis of the predicted longevity of 11 trees and 11 nontrees, a here predictions were based on moisture contents in equilibrium with standard seed bank drying conditions (15% rh) and storage at -20 degrees C, gave similar estimates of mean longevity for the two groups (trees: 643 years; non-trees: 737 years) with considerable variation in the estimates for individual species. Whilst there was a significant positive correlation between predicted longevity and oil content for trees, there was no relationship between these parameters accross all 22 species. The semi-logarithmic relation between equilibrium relative humidity and longevity for aroeira is discussed in relation to published data for herbaceous crops.																	0251-0952						1998	26	2					289	298									WOS:000077681800002

Seeds of all three species had mean emergence times of 23 to 52 d on 1% agar-water at 26 degrees C. Soaking seeds in water reduced emergence times by 21 to 56%. Within species, low electrical conductivity of the steep water was not a reliable indicator of germination potential. Seeds were long-lived in dry warm storage (+/- 21 degrees C and +/- 55% RH); some germinability was retained after 2-5 y. Some seeds (no more than 15 to 60%) of all three species exhibited either a sensitivity to desiccation to low RH (+/- 21-30%) or susceptibility to -20 degrees C freezing. The latter response was rapid (7 d). The results indicate that the seed conservation of these species under conventional seed bank conditions is not yet guaranteed for all seeds in the population.																	0251-0952						1998	26	3					823	828									WOS:000079879100025						
J	Pita, JM; Sanz, V; Escudero, A				Pita, JM; Sanz, V; Escudero, A			Seed cryopreservation of seven Spanish native pine species	SILVAE GENETICA												Progressive forest decline requires the development of conservation strategies to avoid the loss of genetic diversity. Among the ex situ methods for the preservation of forest tree germplasm, conventional seed banking is considered the most efficient method for the majority of species. However, in some forest trees the rapid decrease of seed viability requires new storage methods. Cryopreservation (storage at ultralow temperatures, < -130 degrees C) offers great promise for long-term storage of forest tree seeds. In this paper the effect of storage in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) on seven Spanish pines was evaluated. For most of these species, no significant differences were found in seed germination before and after cryopreservation. Only in P. pinea did cryopreservation negatively affect seed viability.

Ten populations across the range of the species were subjected to allozyme analysis for eleven loci. The species exhibits low variability (P-95 = 9.1-45.5) and one third of the loci tested did not conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations. The species also exhibited a high degree of genetic differentiation between populations. F-ST values (fixation index) for most pairs of populations were above 0.25 (0.036-0.889). Low genetic variability and high genetic structure may result from low gene flow and founder effects due to habitat fragmentation and the lack of potential vectors for cyst dispersal. The unpredictable rainfall of the region also creates potential for variable population sizes which could affect structure and variability.																	0018-8158					DEC 30	1997	359						149	158		10.1023/A:1003150517472							WOS:000073478100016						
J	Strykstra, RJ; Verweij, GL; Bakker, JP				Strykstra, RJ; Verweij, GL; Bakker, JP			Seed dispersal by mowing machinery in a Dutch brook valley system	ACTA BOTANICA NEERLANDICA												Seed dispersal by mowing machinery was investigated within a grassland reserve. Transported seed numbers amounted to hundreds of thousands. Seeds of 26 species were found on the machinery, including species that play an important role in succession during vegetation restoration (Holcus lanatus, Rhinanthus angustifolius, Anthoxanthum odoratum). Species occurrence was related to field abundance, but not to plant size, seed size or month of first flowering. Species seed amounts were also positively correlated only to their abundance within fields. Several abundant species were not found because they carried no seeds at the cutting date (Caltha palustris, Juncus acutiflorus). There was a difference in species composition within material accumulating in two machinery parts, which was related to their height above ground level. It was concluded that dispersal by mowing machinery is moderately selective towards and against certain species. Seeds were transported from species-rich fields into species-poor fields and vice versa. The seeds transported after mowing a field were partially deposited in the next field. Dispersal by machinery may have a larger impact on the speed of succession in the hay-fields of the Drentse A reserve than any other form of dispersal and establishment from the seed bank. Therefore, it is important for vegetation restoration in practice. However, machinery does not always connect seed sources with restoration areas. Large-scale machinery movement also creates a new form of vegetation dynamics compared to the days of former, more primitive, agricultural use. Both factors have to be considered when attempts are made to restore species-rich vegetation types. It is probable that new methods will not produce the vegetation that once existed.																	0044-5983					DEC	1997	46	4					387	401									WOS:000071186200005						
J	Wang, L				Wang, L			The soil seed bank and understorey regeneration in Eucalyptus regnans forest, Victoria	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The soil seed bank and its relation to the extant vegetation in a Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. forest in the Central Highlands of Victoria were examined. The average seed density was 430 germinable seeds m(-2) to a depth of 2 cm. There was a polynomial regression relationship between the density and species richness of seeds in soil and forest age (0.6-54 years). Species richness was not significantly different among soil depths (0-2, 2-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm) in the forest stand of 54 years old. More seeds germinated from the 5-10 cm depth than from the other depths. Forbs accounted for 73% of the total germinable seeds and there was no germination of E. regnans. The number of species, particularly woody plant species, germinating from the soil seed bank were significantly lower than in the extant vegetation. However, almost all species present in the soil seed bank were present in the vegetation. The soil seed bank provides an important source for the rapid regeneration of understorey vegetation following clear-cutting and slash-burning in the E. regnans forest. The rapid understorey establishment may play an important role in protecting soil from erosion, in nutrient conservation, replacement and redistribution. The soil seed bank may also be a necessary source of maintaining genetic diversity in the forest over the long term.																	0307-692X					DEC	1997	22	4					404	411		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1997.tb00690.x							WOS:000071079300004						
J	Panetta, FD; McKee, J				Panetta, FD; McKee, J			Recruitment of the invasive ornamental, Schinus terebinthifolius, is dependent upon frugivores	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Generalist avian frugivores often play an important role in the processes of naturalization and invasion for plants introduced for ornamental and landscaping purposes. We investigated the potential role of Australian birds in the current invasion of riparian habitats and coastal wetlands by the ornamental Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi. Feeding trials in captivity predicted silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis Latham) as dispersal vectors for this weed. There were no differences in either total germination or germination rate between seeds voided by caged silvereyes and those from which exocarps had been removed manually. Germination of seeds incubated within entire fruits was minimal, as was emergence from intact fruits in a held experiment. Seed banks of S. terebinthifolius were relatively transient under field conditions, with no seeds surviving for 9 months. Since fewer than 5% of the seeds in sown whole fruits gave rise to seedlings (cf. 20-42% for sown bare seeds), we conclude that recruitment potential of S. terebinthifolius is highly dependent upon the consumption of its fruits by frugivores.																	0307-692X					DEC	1997	22	4					432	438		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1997.tb00694.x							WOS:000071079300008						
J	Lane, AM; Williams, RJ; Muller, WJ; Lonsdale, WM				Lane, AM; Williams, RJ; Muller, WJ; Lonsdale, WM			The effects of the herbicide tebuthiuron on seedlings of Mimosa pigra and native floodplain vegetation in northern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We studied the seedbank of floodplain vegetation in three major tropical river systems in northern Australia, which had been variously invaded by the tropical woody weed Mimosa pigra. The sites selected had not previously been treated with tebuthiuron, a herbicide which is widely used in northern Australia to control Mimosa. We collected soil seedbank samples from two floodplain vegetation types (Melaleuca swamp and sedgeland), and, within each type, from areas in which Mimosa was either present or absent. The effects of treatment with tebuthiuron at 15 kg ha(-1), twice the usual recommended rate, was subsequently assessed in the laboratory on the soil-seedbank samples. Ordination of the species composition of seedlings which emerged from the soil seedbank samples showed no effect of (i) the vegetation community from which the samples were collected, (ii) the presence of adult Mimosa, or (iii) treatment with tebuthiuron. The effect of tebuthiuron on the emergence and mortality of seedlings from four functional groups (grasses, sedges, forbs and Mimosa) was also tested on the seed bank samples. Emergence was significantly decreased by tebuthiuron only for forbs from Melaleuca swamps. The mortality of Mimosa was significantly higher than that of the other functional groups, but there was some mortality of forb and grass seedlings. Sedges, however, were unaffected. The impact of tebuthiuron on Mimosa depended on soil clay content-in the soils with lowest clay content, tebuthiuron was the most effective in killing Mimosa seedlings. Mortality in forb and grass seedlings, in contrast, was not affected by soil clay content. Tebuthiuron was therefore selective against Mimosa seedlings. However, even at twice the recommended rate of application for killing adult Mimosa, under ideal conditions for distribution of the herbicide through the soil, 43% of Mimosa seedlings survived. Given the size of the Mimosa seedbank under held conditions (similar to 10 000 seeds/m(2)), tebuthiuron can therefore not be considered an effective herbicide against Mimosa seedlings.

J	Buckley, GP; Howell, R; Anderson, MA				Buckley, GP; Howell, R; Anderson, MA			Vegetation succession following ride edge management in lowland plantations and woods .2. The seed bank resource	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The composition and distribution of the buried soil seed bank was examined across the edges of II lowland plantations and woods in southern England from which portions of the tree canopy were removed. Species most frequently germinating in soil samples were those with known or suspected persistent soil seed banks, which included a number of ancient woodland indicators. Both the number of individuals and species were stimulated by the cutting treatments, especially in the areas cleared of trees, where initial germination temporarily depleted the seed bank. Recharge followed rapidly over successive growing seasons, with several species showing consistently strong zonation across the edge gradient. These results suggest that edge management has a positive role in restoring and maintaining populations of seed bank species in plantations and neglected coppice woods, but the frequency of cutting needs to be carefully balanced against the requirements of other, less mobile species of both permanently open and shady habitats.

J	Chapman, CA; Chapman, LJ				Chapman, CA; Chapman, LJ			Forest regeneration in logged and unlogged forests of Kibale National Park, Uganda	BIOTROPICA												Processes of forest regeneration in two unlogged areas and in three areas that were logged nearly 25 years ago were quantified in Kibale National Park, Uganda. For forests to recover from logging, one would predict recruitment and growth processes to be accelerated in logged areas relative to unlogged areas, facilitating increased recruitment of trees into the adult size classes. We examined this prediction first by determining the growth of 4733 trees over a 51 to 56 month period and found that growth rates in the most heavily logged area were consistently slower than in the two unlogged areas. In contrast, the lightly logged forest had similar growth races to unlogged areas in the small size classes, but trees in the 30 to 50 cm DBH size cohort exhibited elevated growth rates relative to the unlogged areas. Mortality was highest in the heavily logged areas, with many deaths occurring when healthy trees were knocked over by neighboring treefalls. We found no difference in the density or species richness of seedlings in the logged and unlogged forests. The number of seedlings that emerged from the disturbed soil (seed bank+seed rain) and initially seed-free soil (seed rain) was greater in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest. However, sapling density was lower in the heavily logged areas, suggesting that there is a high level of seedling mortality in logged areas. We suggest that the level of canopy opening created during logging, the lack of aggressive colonizing tree species, elephant activity that is concentrated in logged areas, and an aggressive herb community, all combine to delay vegetation recovery in Kibale Forest.

Int Union Forestry Res Org, Res Grp Restorat Degraded Sites, USDA, Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, World Bank, Agr & Forestry Syst Div, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Overseas Dev Adm, UK				The nature of vegetation colonisation in four small rehabilitations and adjacent, protected control sites in tropical north Queensland were studied. Seven-year-old rehabilitation plots contiguous with forest had recruited up to seventy-two plant species across all growth forms and successional phases. Recruitment in 5-year-old plots was less abundant and diverse. Control sites by comparison were dominated by disclimax grasses and diversity of recruitment was reduced to only nineteen species at the upland control site. The effect of isolation on reducing abundance and diversity were demonstrated at one site located over,500 m from intact forest. Soil seed bank analysis was undertaken to examine any cumulative effect. Samples contained large numbers of weeds and grasses and only two native trees were recorded. The majority of species recorded in the plots were fleshy fruited zoochorous taxa, typical of plants in the early and intermediate stages of successional development, although a number of late successional species were also recorded. Fruit size and type suggests birds are responsible for most of the effective dispersal. The ability of ecologically rehabilitated areas to recruit and sustain new life forms is a true measure of their contribution to biodiversity conservation. In the tropics, the process of plant colonisation may be accelerated by establishing combinations of fleshy fruited native plant species from different stages of a normal forest succession, which attract seed dispersing birds and mammals.

J	Hodkinson, DJ; Thompson, K				Hodkinson, DJ; Thompson, K			Plant dispersal: the role of man	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1, Human activity is an increasingly important mechanism of plant dispersal, particularly in densely populated countries such as England. We investigated which species are commonly dispersed by the following vectors: (i) soil carried on motor vehicles, (ii) topsoil, (iii) sugar factory topsoil, (iv) horticultural stock, and (v) garden throw-outs. 2, We compared the ecological traits of the species associated with each vector with those of a representative sample of the regional flora. Traits examined were life history, canopy height, lateral spread, flowering start, flowering period, seed persistence in the soil, vegetative reproduction, wind dispersal, log seed weight and specific leaf area. 3. We identified two major anthropogenic dispersal pathways, each associated with a clearly defined group of species. Species associated with topsoil, cars and horticulture depend essentially on soil movement, and are often small and fast-growing, but their most consistent unifying characteristic is the production of numerous, small,persistent seeds. In contrast, garden throw-outs, which are themselves functionally similar to increasing garden escapes, tend to be tall, Spreading perennials with transient seed banks, attributes which are almost the exact opposite of the soil-borne group. 4, Some recent studies of the British flora have failed to find any dispersal-related differences between those species with increasing or decreasing ranges, or between natives and invasive aliens. Others have found contradictory attributes of aliens; they were more likely to have bigger seeds than natives, but also more likely to have a persistent seed bank. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that there exist two contrasting groups of successful alien invaders: tall, spreading competitors and small, short-lived, fast-growing species with high reproductive outputs. The parallel with the two groups of species identified here is remarkable, and is further evidence of the probable importance of anthropogenic dispersal in the modern landscape.																	0021-8901					DEC	1997	34	6					1484	1496		10.2307/2405264							WOS:000071556000015						
J	White, TA; Campbell, BD; Kemp, PD				White, TA; Campbell, BD; Kemp, PD			Invasion of temperate grassland by a subtropical annual grass across an experimental matrix of water stress and disturbance	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												An experimental matrix of water stress and disturbance was superimposed on a Lolium perenne-Tifolium repens grassland using a crossed-gradient design, and the annual subtropical grass Digitaria sanguinalis was introduced into the pasture as seeds and transplanted seedlings. Digitaria plants achieved maximum biomass at high water availability and high disturbance. Digitaria plants grown from transplanted seedlings attained greater biomass further from the conditions of high water availability and high disturbance, compared with those that had grown from seed. The biomass of the temperate species was maximized with high water availability and low to intermediate disturbance conditions. The reproductive effort of Digitaria was maximized under intermediate to high water availability and intermediate to low disturbance. Combinations of water stress and disturbance that gave rise to maximum growth of the temperate and subtropical species were consistent with those predicted by C-S-R theory. Results suggest that processes in the regenerative phase of the plant life cycle were constraining the success of Digitaria in New Zealand grassland. Addition of seed to the soil seed bank would probably be maximized in patches of grassland with high disturbance and water availability; these patches will subsequently act as foci for future invasions by Digital in.

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The pattern of distribution of the invasive vine Clematis vitalba in a typical New Zealand native forest remnant and the influence of chilling duration (chilling), nitrate (NO3-), and light on germination of C vitalba were investigated. In the forest remnant, C. vitalba was not established in undisturbed forest where light levels were less than or equal to 3% full sunlight and rarely established where light levels were less than or equal to 5%. Clematis vitalba was, however, established in forest gaps and margins where light levels exceeded 5%, particularly when these areas were associated with recent soil disturbance. Under controlled environment conditions, germination in the absence of chilling, NO3-, or light was low (3%). When applied alone, chilling and NO3- increased germination. Light, however, only increased germination when applied with one or both other factors. In the presence of light, germination increased up to c. 80% with increased chilling (0-12 weeks), and increased up to c. 50% with increased applied NO3- in the range 0.1-2.5 mol/m(3) but then changed little with additional NO3- up to 50.0 mol/m(3). In general, germination in the presence of two or three factors was greater than when either factor was applied alone. In the field, seeds remaining on vines over winter retained a high degree of dormancy and viability. We suggest that sporadic release of this seed effectively produces a seed bank. By comparing the levels of chilling, NO3-, and light that can be expected in the field with the levels that influence germination under controlled environment conditions, and considering a seed bank, we argue that C vitalba is likely to rapidly establish following soil disturbance. We suggest that rapid establishment may account for the distribution of C vitalba in recently disturbed, high light sites and, to some extent, the success of C. vitalba in New Zealand native forest remnants.

J	Hay, FR; Probert, RJ; Smith, RD				Hay, FR; Probert, RJ; Smith, RD			The effect of maturity on the moisture relations of seed longevity in foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.)	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Controlled aging experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the changes in seed longevity occurring following the attainment of maximum seed dry weight in foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.). Seeds harvested in three successive years were stored at similar to 5% moisture content (fresh weight basis) and 50 degrees C. Seed longevity was greater the later the seeds were harvested. When the data were modelled using the predictive viability model of Ellis and Roberts, these increases were attributable to increases in both the theoretical initial viability (in probits) of the seed-lot, K-i, and in the standard deviation of the normal distribution of seed deaths in time. a. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between K-i and sigma which was independent of the year of harvest (r = 0.9016, for 11 d.f., P < 0.001). These results do not support the predictive model which relies on the assumption that a will not differ between seed lots of the same species stored under identical conditions. When seeds were stored at a range of moisture contents (between 5 and 10%) at 50 degrees C, increases in sigma during seed development were manifest as changes in the negative logarithmic relationship between sigma and moisture content; below an upper limit, the regressions for seed lots at different stages of maturity were significantly different (P < 0.05) but could be constrained to either a common intercept or to a common slope (P > 0.05). It is proposed that it was the inherent variation in individual seed lifespans which increased during seed development. These results raise important concerns regarding the use of predetermined 'species constants' to predict the longevity of seed lots during long-term storage in seed banks.

J	Doucet, C; Cavers, PB				Doucet, C; Cavers, PB			Induced dormancy and colour polymorphism in seeds of the bull thistle Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												To colonize newly disturbed areas, weedy species must disperse their seeds in space and/or in time. Cirsium vulgare has poor dispersal in space, but can form a persistent seed bank. Fresh seeds are capable of germinating in either light/dark or constant dark conditions under favourable diurnal temperatures of 25 degrees C : 10 degrees C. Despite this lack of dormancy, a large proportion of seeds do not germinate in the autumn after dispersal. Variation in germination requirements according to seed colour was also examined. Fresh seeds were placed under one of two overwintering treatments at 5 degrees C, alternating light/dark or constant darkness. Some seeds of all colours: white, light, intermediate, dark and black germinated under these conditions. Six months later, ungerminated seeds subjected to the light/dark treatment did not require light for germination when placed under optimal temperatures. However, most seeds that had overwintered in constant darkness required light for germination. In the field, this induced dormancy would prevent seeds from germinating if buried or located in deep shade. Such seeds have the potential of forming a persistent seed bank. The proportion of dormant seeds did not appear to be associated with seed colour. Seeds incubated at 10 degrees C following overwintering under light/dark conditions germinated to a higher percentage than seeds overwintered in darkness, regardless of the light conditions for germination. The results of this study help to explain the contradiction between delayed germination in the field and the lack of seed dormancy.																	0960-2585					DEC	1997	7	4					399	407		10.1017/S0960258500003810							WOS:A1997YL53200010

Differences in sites where H. koelmaniorum was found compared with similar sites where it did not occur were assessed by the quantification of biotic and abiotic variables at the plant and community scales. Population size varied from 25 to 588, with 1591 plants in total. Size structures (leaf number per plant or rosette diameter) did not vary between populations, but no seedlings were found. Overall, 67% of plants were damaged by fire and herbivory, but ail appeared to survive fire. The percentage of plants flowering per population varied from 24-76%. Percentage germination was high (78-88%), but seeds apparently have short-term (5-7 month) persistence and thus no seed bank is formed. Plants grow preferentially on northern aspects above the mid-slope position of quartzite ridges and within rock fissures. These were characterized by a high cover of fixed and exposed rock, high overstorey shade, low understorey shade and live vegetation cover. Reduced competition from herbaceous plants and reduced probability of fire damage are distinctive features of these sites. Population dynamics may be characterized by adult persistence as seedling establishment is most likely episodic, linked to high rainfall periods, and coinciding with dispersal of seeds produced in the same year to the few suitable rock fissures (safe sites) available. Present threats, small population sizes, low rates of seedling establishment and a very restricted distribution, dictate that H. koelmaniorum remains in the Vulnerable IUCN category.

J	Garner, RD; Witkowski, ETF				Garner, RD; Witkowski, ETF			Variations in seed size and shape in relation to depth of burial in the soil and pre-dispersal predation in Acacia nilotica, A-tortilis and Dichrostachys cinerea	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Little is known about the persistence of seeds in the soil of spinescent trees/shrubs in the savannas of South Africa. Thompson at al. (1993) show that seed size and shape can be used to predict long-term persistence (> 5 years) in the soil at the species level, with persistence related to ease of burial. Furthermore, pre-dispersal seed predators have been shown to be influenced by seed size/shape at the species level. We determined seed mass, seed shape ratio and the variance in seed dimensions (based on axiometric dimensions) in relation to depth of burial for three common spinescent savanna trees/shrubs, Acacia nilotica, A. tortilis and Dichrostachys cinerea. These species are hard-seeded and form at least short-term persistent (1-5 years) soil seed banks. There was a consistent tendency for seed size within species to increase with depth of burial, which is interpreted as showing that larger seeds within species may have greater longevities in the soil than smaller seeds. In most cases seeds tended to greater sphericity (using both measures) with depth, except for A. nilotica which showed no difference. Current season's seeds predated by endophagous bruchid beetles tended to be smaller (in terms of volume), and for A, tortilis, more aspherical. The size/shape of seeds, which directly affects ease of burial, appears to be a useful barometer in determining persistence in the soil, but it is largely through burial that persistence is confered.

The Echinacea and Ilamna species are very close relatives, and the Solidago species are in the same subsection of the genus. Particular attention was given to the Echinacea species. No differences were found in ecological, morphological, physiological, cytological, genetic or life history characteristics per se of E. tennesseensis and E. angustifolia that reasonably could account for differences in their geographical distribution. Thus, a scenario based on historical factors was used in conjunction with the autecology of E. tennesseensis to explain development and maintenance of endemism in this species. Likewise, no difference in species biology was identified in the two fire-dependent, fire-adapted Iliamna species, and thus endemism in I. corei also probably is related to both autecological and historical factors. In contrast to the species pairs in Echinacea and Iliamna, the widespread Solidago altissima has, a greater potential to form a persistent seed bank and is a better competitor than the narrow endemic S. shortii. However, these autecological differences per se should be used with caution in any attempt to explain maintenance of narrow endemism in S. shortii. We conclude that both autecological and historical factors are needed to explain endemism in many plant species.																	0038-4909					DEC	1997	42	4					384	399									WOS:000072506600004						
J	Odland, A				Odland, A			Development of vegetation in created wetlands in western Norway	AQUATIC BOTANY												The Myrkdalen lake, western Norway was subjected to a permanent 1.4 m drawdown in June 1987. After the drawdown, channels and artificial islands were constructed within the exposed floodplain system. Two permanent transects were established within this man-made environment, and these have been analyzed annually until 1995. The quadrats lie all on the same type of substrate, are at different elevations in relation to the water-level. This paper describes vegetation development on these newly created islands. The investigation shows major vegetational changes during the eight year period. Two main processes have taken place, vegetation zonation and primary succession. The first year after the construction, most of the created sites had a similar floristic composition, regardless of elevation. Major dominants during the first three years (e.g., Subularia aquatica, Marchantia polymorpha, Blasia pusilla, and numerous acrocarpous mosses) disappeared or were greatly reduced, and they were gradually replaced by species which were climax species in the wetland communities before the drawdown (e.g., Carex rostrata, C. vesicaria, Phalaris arundinacea, Salix nigricans). The main vegetational change occurred between the third and the fourth year. After three years characteristic vegetation zones were differentiated, with aquatic plants and helophytes in the lowermost parts, and willow shrubs in the uppermost parts of the islands.

J	Schutz, W				Schutz, W			Primary dormancy and annual dormancy cycles in seeds of six temperate wetland sedges	AQUATIC BOTANY												The effects of dry after-ripening and burial in the soil on seed germination of six temperate wetland Carer spp. were investigated. Freshly matured seeds, seeds stored dry for 4 or 8 weeks, and seeds buried at 7-cm depth in a small woodlot, and exhumed at approximately bimonthly intervals over a 2-year period, were tested under a fluctuating (22 degrees/10 degrees C) and a constant temperature regime (15 degrees C) in light and darkness, respectively. Fresh and dry-stored seeds of all species were conditionally dormant at 22 degrees/10 degrees in the light, dormant at 15 degrees in light and darkness and at 22 degrees/10 degrees C in darkness. Dry after-ripening increased significantly germination percentages in three species. Buried seeds of all six species exhibited annual dormancy cycles at 22 degrees/10 degrees C in darkness and 15 degrees C in the light, whereas, no germination occurred at 15 degrees C in darkness. Seeds came out of dormancy in late autumn or winter and entered dormancy in late spring or early summer. Germinability did not show any cyclicity at 22 degrees/10 degrees C in the light in four species and showed weak cyclicity in two species. Seed mortality was low, and no germination occurred during burial. This implies that the six species can accumulate a persistent seed bank.

J	Teketay, D; Granstrom, A				Teketay, D; Granstrom, A			Germination ecology of forest species from the highlands of Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												A comparative study of seed germination was performed on 25 species of trees, shrubs, woody climbers and herbs from the dry Afromontane forest zone of Ethiopia. Despite the restricted geographical range of the species tested, the optimum constant temperature for germination varied considerably. For 17 of the species studied, it was between 20 and 25 degrees C while for three, germination was highest at 30 degrees C. Germination was virtually inhibited (<20%) for eight of the species at 10 degrees C and eight of the species at 30 degrees C. There was no clear division in temperature response between plants differing in habitat. For four out of 12 species tested, fluctuating temperatures (20/12 degrees C) resulted in significantly higher germination than the constant temperature treatment (20 degrees C), suggesting that field-germination would be favoured by disturbance to the canopy or soil. Speed of germination was negatively correlated with the logarithum of seed size. Most species lay in the range 3-15 d to reach 50% of final germination at their optimum temperature for germination. Germination was significantly suppressed in darkness for a large number of species, particularly for those with seed size less than c. 3 mg. When these were incubated under leaf-filtered light, germination was in most cases even more effectively suppressed. Most of these species are known to have large soil seed banks. Mechanical scarification improved germination over the control in nine species. Five of these also reponded to heat or sulphuric acid scarification. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the species showing heat-induced germination may be fire adapted, although fire is probably a rare natural phenomenon in the Afromontane forest proper. Only one species, Bersama abyssinica, showed a classic recalcitrant behaviour. Germination dropped from 88% when the seeds were fresh to less than 20% after 1 mo of dry storage and 0% after 3 mo. Germinability of seeds of Ekebergia capensis also declined significantly with increasing storage time, although less rapidly; after 24 mo of dry storage, germination was 4%. In contrast, germinability of Juniperus procera was not significantly altered during 54 mo of storage. The results indicate that dormancy plays a major role in regulating germination in dry Afromontane species. Out of the 25 species studied, 15 (60%) showed some degree of initial dormancy. In most of the species with initially non-dormant seeds, dormancy would evidently be induced if the seeds are dispersed under a closed forest canopy or buried in the soil. These patterns of dormancy may have evolved in response to a highly unpredictable climate and small-scale disturbances, and should make the Afromontane forest flora relatively resilent also to anthropogenic disturbances.																	0266-4674					NOV	1997	13		6				805	831		10.1017/S0266467400011019							WOS:000071413000003

In order to manage resistant populations, some farmers have adopted a two-to-three-year pasture phase which allows use of grazing by sheep, and non-selective herbicides to deplete the weed seed-bank. However, in low-to-medium rainfall zones, where financial returns from pastures are relatively low, farmers have generally combined cultural practices for weed management with the use of alternative herbicides, mainly trifluralin. Used singly, none of the currently available cultural techniques provides an adequate level of weed control. However, when used in carefully planned combinations, extremely effective ryegrass control can be achieved. Some of the important cultural practices for ryegrass control include delayed sowing (sometimes in conjunction with a shallow autumn cultivation); stubble burning; cutting the crop for hay or green manure, increased crop density and capture of weed seeds at harvest. Selection of crop species and cultivars with superior weed suppression potential is also receiving considerable attention.																	0031-613X					NOV	1997	51	3					352	358		10.1002/(SICI)1096-9063(199711)51:3<352::AID-PS648>3.0.CO;2-M							WOS:A1997YJ39800021						
J	Holmes, PM; Cowling, RM				Holmes, PM; Cowling, RM			Diversity, composition and guild structure relationships between soil-stored seed banks and mature vegetation in alien plant-invaded South African fynbos shrublands	PLANT ECOLOGY												We investigated vegetation-seed bank relationships at three fynbos sites on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, and the impacts to these sites of invasion by the alien tree Acacia saligna. Soil-stored seed banks in uninvaded fynbos were of a similar density to those previously measured in fynbos (ca. 1100-1500 seeds m(-2)) and were dominated by mostly short-lived species. Lack of similarity between mature vegetation and seed banks, suggests that seed banks are poor predictors of mature vegetation composition and structure in fynbos. This lack of correspondence was attributed to the ephemerals (present only in the soil seed bank) and the dominance of serotinous (aerial seed bank) and sprouting (soil seed bank low to absent) species, in mature vegetation. Long-lived seeders were among the 10 most abundant species in the seed banks at all sites and at two sites shrub species contributed more to seed bank richness than any other growth form. Soil-stored seed banks, therefore, boost species richness and diversity both in early post-fire and later seral stages. There was a decline in fynbos species richness, diversity and abundance both in the standing vegetation and seed banks with increasing duration of invasion by the alien tree, Acacia saligna. However, the rate of decline was higher for the vegetation than the seed banks, suggesting that many fynbos species have long-term persistent seed banks. At two sites, there was no obvious shift in community composition associated with Acacia invasion: invaded sites were depauperate versions of the uninvaded site. However, at a third site, the vegetation composition shifted towards a community dominated by bird-dispersed thicket species and its seed bank shifted towards a community dominated by wind-dispersed perennials. Community composition of the soil seed banks under dense, recent Acacia was very similar to that of the corresponding uninvaded fynbos at all sites, indicating that there is good potential to return to species-rich fynbos vegetation after removal of the alien Acacia. Most seed bank species persisted in the soil seed bank of the long-invaded fynbos at low frequency and density, indicating high seed longevity in many species. We suggest that either a thick Acacia litter layer or a deep (>5 cm) burial moderated the fire and ambient temperature effects, preventing these seeds from germinating after fire and thus preventing loss from the seed bank.																	1385-0237					NOV	1997	133	1					107	122		10.1023/A:1009734026612							WOS:A1997YD40300011

For highly clonal aquatic macrophytes, however, there is a lack of information on seed production and seed fate as compared with annual sexual species. The seed bank for three populations of Vallisneria americana in the Huron-Erie corridor of the Great Lakes was sampled and quantified in the spring of 1994, and related to seed production in the previous season at these sites. Seed deposition rates during 1994 were also assessed. Sites varied in the proportion of plants flowering and in their tertiary sex ratios, but did not differ in seed numbers produced per unit area. The size of the seed bank was not significantly related to the previous season's seed output, and estimates of seed deposition in the following year tended to be approximately tenfold greater than seed densities found in the seed bank. The stages between seed production and subsequent seed germination are generally very dynamic, with dispersal, mortality, and predation as likely regulating factors. The potential for seedling establishment in V. americana needs to be assessed more fully before the role of seeds in population processes can be determined.

J	Dougall, TAG; Dodd, JC				Dougall, TAG; Dodd, JC			A study of species richness and diversity in seed banks and its use for the environmental mitigation of a proposed holiday village development in a coniferized woodland in south east England	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												A survey was carried out to determine the density and species composition of germinable seed in the surface soil layers of 30 plots within a coniferized lowland woodland in East Kent in order to establish the resources available for habitat creation in the event of some areas being modified during a proposed holiday village development. The selected plots included conifer plantations (up to 69 years old), broad-leaved plantations and the semi-natural broad-leaved edges that remain on parts of the perimeter of the site which were used as the control, A total of 13 682 seedlings emerged from the soil samples during the four-month germination trials, Fifty-two species were identified of which eight were ancient woodland indicator species for south-east England, The most abundant species represented in the seed banks were: Juncus effusus, Rubus fruticosus, Carer sylvatica, Betula pendula and Agrostis tenuis. Between-site comparisons of coniferous plots of different ages revealed a marked reduction in the seed species and seed density in plantations over 65 years old, Results of soil nutrient and texture analyses ruled out the likelihood of edaphic factors being responsible for between-site differences in seed bank composition. Seed species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity index) were greatest in the semi-natural broad-leaved edges, but the diversity index used also showed that two replanted conifer sites had high values despite few species being present. The usefulness and limitations of diversity indices in the context of seed bank studies is discussed. From the results of the study, management proposals for the site have been put forward in order to maintain floristic diversity and mitigate the impact of the proposed development.																	0960-3115					OCT	1997	6	10					1413	1428		10.1023/A:1018345915418							WOS:A1997YB23200008						
J	Washitani, I; Takenaka, A; Kuramoto, N; Inoue, K				Washitani, I; Takenaka, A; Kuramoto, N; Inoue, K			Aster kantoensis Kitam, an endangered flood plain endemic plant in Japan: Its ability to form persistent soil seed banks	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												we examined dormancy/germination traits of the seeds of Aster kantoensis, an endangered local endemic on the gravelly flood plains of a few, eastern central Japanese rivers, to assess its ability to form persistent soil seed banks in its natural habitats. Immediately after the seed collection from the largest remaining population of the River Tama in early, winter, the seeds showed a low level of relative dormancy, which disappeared within a month under the prevailing conditions in the natural habitat. After a few months' dry chilling storage, the seeds became germinable over a wide temperature range, i.e. 6-36 degrees C. The seeds showed neither requirement for temperature fluctuation nor sensitivity to leaf canopy light. The thermal time required for 50% germination at temperatures below 30 degrees C was less than 70 Kd (Kelvin days calculated with a base temperature of 5 degrees C). Since such requirements for germination of seeds naturally dispersed and overwintered will be satisfied by a spell of spring rain, we cannot expect the formation of persistent soil seed banks. Correspondingly, after spring germination, no or negligible firm intact seeds could be detected in the surface soils sampled. Safe-sites for the recruitment of the species are known to be new areas created by fluvial disturbance, which may occur sporadically in space and time. Without persistent soil seed banks, successful dispersal of the seeds to these safe-sites is of crucial importance for the persistence of the metapopulation composed of ephemeral subpopulations. Recent decrease in the colonization Fate of new subpopulations due to diminishing seed sources might accelerate the decline of the metapopulation. To break the extinction vortex in which the species has been involved, we propose human-aided seed dispersal to safe-sites in order to strengthen the conservation of this threatened species.

J	Morris, MJ				Morris, MJ			Impact of the gall-forming rust fungus Uromycladium tepperianum on the invasive tree Acacia saligna in South Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The impact of an introduced, gall-forming rust fungus, Uromycladium tepperianum, on an invasive tree Acacia saligna was evaluated in the Western Cape Province. The number of infected trees, rust galls per tree, state of trees (dead or alive), stem diameter of trees, and number of seeds in the soil were recorded along transects at yearly intervals from 1991 to 1996 at eight sites where the fungus had been inoculated during 1988 or 1989. The levels of disease increased rapidly after 1992 at all sites. By 1995, the mean number of galls per tree varied from 5 to approximately 1500 per tree depending on tree size. Tree density decreased by at least 80% at all sites over the period, although young seedlings started to grow at some sites. The seed number in the soil seed bank stabilized after 1992 at most sites, except where fires occurred which reduced the number of seeds. U. tepperianum therefore is proving to be a highly effective biological control agent, as shown by greatly reduced population densities of A. saligna in South Africa.

The age of the oldest specimen was 56 years. Approximately 90% of the Fruits and seeds collected in seed traps were dispersed directly beneath the canopy of the mature shrubs. The mean germination rate of these seeds was 85% with a mean emergence time of 42 days. The buried seed bank beneath mature shrubs averaged 670 seed/m(2) and was composed entirely of European Buckthorn which favours the development of the characteristic monospecific ground cover. However: there was little evidence that the species is allelopathic. Cutting and application of "Round-up" to the stumps, or spraying "Garlon 4" to the basal bark, proved to be the most effective methods of killing European Buckthorn.																	0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1997	111	4					617	621									WOS:000070989500012						
J	Cabin, RJ; Evans, AS; Mitchell, RJ				Cabin, RJ; Evans, AS; Mitchell, RJ			Genetic effects of germination timing and environment: An experimental investigation	EVOLUTION												Seeds of many species do not germinate immediately after dispersal, bur instead may remain indefinitely in a dormant but viable state. Although it is well established that seeds often exhibit diversified patterns of dormancy and germination, the causes and consequences of this variation remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the extent to which seed genotypes of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri differentially germinate and establish under experimental conditions in a greenhouse. We used a two-way factorial design to compare genotypes of Lesquerella plants derived from seeds that germinated and established at different times and under different soil water regimes. Overall allozyme allele frequencies of Lesquerella plants varied significantly with both germination time and initial soil water availability. Single-locus heterozygosity analyses revealed that seeds sown into initially low water conditions produced plants that were significantly more heterozygous than plants derived from seeds experiencing constantly high water conditions, but heterozygosity did not differ significantly among plants originating from early- and late-germinating seeds. This is the first study to experimentally demonstrate that germination timing and environment can significantly affect the generic structure of emerging plant populations. The study suggests that germination and survival behavior may (1) play an important role in generating and maintaining the generic structure of natural plant populations and (2) set the stage for subsequent evolution.

Six wild populations were selected in the four mainly representative ecological zones of this region and several 1 m(2) quadrats were demarcated in order to determine the vital rates (fecundity, survival, growth and mortality) of the individuals within each population. These data were collected during two years from 3000 labelled individuals and combined with those relative to the soil seed bank and the seed dormancy to propose a demographic model for a hypothetical ''mean wild population'' based on the projection matrix theory. This model helps to determine the growth rate of the population, the stability of its structure and, by using a sensitivity analysis, reveals also the factors most constraining for the population survival. Population behaviour under natural conditions and human pressure are simulated, which allow to propose management practices for in situ conservation.																	0925-9864					OCT	1997	44	5					429	438		10.1023/A:1008623521755							WOS:A1997XW65400004						
J	Rees, M; Paynter, Q				Rees, M; Paynter, Q			Biological control of Scotch broom: modelling the determinants of abundance and the potential impact of introduced insect herbivores	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Simulation and analytical models are developed for the European shrub Scotch broom Cytisus scoparius Link (Fabaceae). The simulation model is spatially explicit and allows us to explore not only changes in population size but also the proportion of ground covered by the weed. The simulation model incorporates spatially local density-dependent competition, asymmetric competition between seedlings and established plants, a seed bank, local seed dispersal and an age-structured established plant population. This model is designed to incorporate much of the known population biology of broom. The analytical models are simple approximations of the simulation. 2. The basic model contains nine parameters: the probability a site is disturbed, p(dist); the probability a seed becomes a seedling, g; the probability a seedling survives the first year, s; the probability a seed is lost from the seed bank, d; the minimum age for reproduction, A(min); maximum plant age, A(max); seed production per site, F; the probability a seed is retained in the parental site, f(h); and the probability a site becomes suitable for colonization after broom senesces, p(so). 3. We review published data on the demography of broom from studies around the world, and also present some previously unpublished data. These data suggest that broom in some exotic habitats can achieve higher fecundities and live longer than in its native range. 4. Analytical approximations provide a good description of the simulation results over a wide range of biologically reasonable parameter values. Specifically, the analytical models work well when plants are long-lived or highly fecund. 5. Analysis of the models indicates that when broom colonizes all suitable sites with probability one, that the fraction of sites occupied by broom is determined by only three parameters: the probability of disturbance, p(dist); the probability a site becomes suitable for colonization following plant senescence, p(so); and maximum longevity, A(max). In exotic habitats, where individual broom plants can produce several thousand seeds, differences in these parameters are the most likely reason why broom populations are more weedy than in the native range. 6. The impact of insect herbivores, which reduce plant fecundity, on broom abundance is explored for several environmental scenarios. This analysis suggests that potential biological control agents are most likely to have a substantial impact if the disturbance rate is high, plant fecundity is low, and seedling survival is low. Even herbivores that reduce seed production by only 75% can have a dramatic impact on broom abundance, in contrast to several published predictions. 7. Extensions to the models to allow for arbitrary patterns of age-dependent senescence, and site-specific probabilities of disturbance are presented.																	0021-8901					OCT	1997	34	5					1203	1221		10.2307/2405232							WOS:A1997YD84700008

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Soil seed banks of 38 grassland sites in western Europe were sampled and species composition was determined. All sites differed in geographical region, soil type and intensity of management. 2. Relationships between the composition of the seed bank, the established vegetation, and soil and management parameters were analysed using different ordination techniques. 3. Common species in the seed bank of extensively managed grasslands were Juncus without septa, Plantago lanceolata, Holcus lanatus and Cerastium fontanum. General differences in the species composition reflected the country of origin of the sites. 4. Differences between sites within a chronosequence were used to interpret the impact of management on the proportion of species in the seed bank representing different functional groups. Seed banks were generally dominated by species of mid-range nutrient conditions. Species associated with poor nutrient conditions were relatively scarce at most sites. 5. Intensive agricultural management had a negative effect on the soil seed bank of grassland species, whereas lack of management or abandonment resulted in the loss of grassland species from both the vegetation and the soil seed bank owing to the invasion of woodland species. Restoration management, following long periods of intensive use, took more than 20 years to establish a significant increase in species of poor nutrient conditions. 6. A regeneration index was calculated for each chronosequence to estimate the relative 'distance' between a degraded site and a species-rich target site in the same series. These regeneration indices provide an indication of the timescales required for the restoration of sites towards the species-rich target grassland community types. However, for most agriculturally improved grassland sites, the study indicated that restoration of unimproved or semi-natural types of grassland cannot depend on a high level of recruitment from the seed bank of species which have disappeared from the established vegetation. This implies that maintenance of existing species-rich grassland resources should be given high priority. 7. The results of this seed bank study show that grassland sites with a short history of agricultural improvement or biodiversity degradation are likely to be the most worthwhile for restoration purposes.																	0021-8901					OCT	1997	34	5					1293	1310		10.2307/2405239							WOS:A1997YD84700015						
J	Izhaki, I; Neeman, G				Izhaki, I; Neeman, G			Hares (Lepus spp.) as seed dispersers of Retama raetam (Fabaceae) in a sandy landscape	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Hares in the sandy ecosystem of the Mediterranean coastal plain in Israel consume pods of the widespread desert plant Retama raetam. The aim of this study was to explore some of its qualities as a dispersal agent of such an important component of the vegetation of Mediterranean arid habitats. Although the pericarp acts as the nutritious 'reward', the hares do not select the most profitable pods with the highest pericarp/seed mass ratio. Of the 718 randomly collected hare pellets 43% contained H. raetam seeds. More than half (55%) of those containing seeds had only one seed, 43% contained two to three seeds and the other 2% contained four to five seeds. Seeds from hare pellets imbibed water more slowly than either exposed seeds which were collected from the sand surface, or manually scarified seeds, but faster than intact seeds which were removed from pods. Untreated seeds from pods had low germination (6%), but most were alive, as indicated by high (70%) germination when scarified. While only 6% of seeds obtained from hare pellets germinated, 44% of them germinated after scarification. Thus, hares did not have a lethal effect on seed viability. It should be emphasized that the difference between these two values (38%) is added to the soil seed bank as 'exposed seeds'. The height and growth rate of seedlings that emerged from hare pellets in pots did not differ from those of seedlings receiving other treatments. Hence, the hypothesis that seedlings in pellets may be favoured by the nutrient pool available to them was not confirmed. We conclude that hares have the potential to act as a legitimate dispersal agent for R. raetam, especially as a carrier of seeds away from the parent plant. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

J	Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC				Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC			Methods of breaking seed dormancy in endangered species Iliamna corei (Sherff) Sherff (Malvaceae), with special attention to heating	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Iliamna corei (Sherff) Sherff, an herbaceous perennial plant listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as endangered, is known only from a single site, on Peters Mountain in Giles County, Virginia. Seed dormancy in this species is due to a water-impermeable seed coat. Dormancy was broken in a high percentage of seeds by mechanical scarification, dipping in boiling water, dry-heating, and soaking in concentrated sulfuric acid. However, soaking in absolute ethanol, shifting from low to high temperature regimes, or alternate freezing and thawing did not break seed dormancy. Fire was effective in breaking dormancy of seeds on the soil surface, but not in those covered with 3 cm of soil. Seeds matured and sown in 1989 in greenhouse flats and burned each June from 1990 to 1995 had germinated to the following percentages by September 1995: buried and nonburned-2%, nonburied and nonburned-3%, buried and burned-3%, and nonburied and burned-39%. After five heating (to 80-90 degrees C)/incubation (25/15 degrees C) cycles, germination in flats from the burning experiment had increased to the following: buried and nonburned-60%, nonburied and nonburned-61%, buried and burned-45%, and nonburied and burned-71%. Furthermore, at least 65% of 1,800 seeds were viable and germinable after more than 3 years in the ''seed bank.'' Thus, seeds of I. corei (1) require fire to germinate, (2) are capable of forming a long-lived seed bank, and (3) exhibit a continuum with regard to degree of seed coat dormancy. These results and those of others on the biology of I. corei and two of its closely related species, I. remota Greene and I. rivularis(Dougl.) Greene, were used to modify Buttrick's (1992) conceptual model of the population dynamics of I. corei in relation to fire and canopy development.																	0885-8608					OCT	1997	17	4					313	323									WOS:A1997YC99700004

Hull were assessed by means of seven allozyme loci scored in 18 populations from the South-Western area of the species' range. Genetic diversity was lower (H-T = 0.20) than reported for long-lived widespread species but was characterized by a high number of alleles per locus (5.60 at the species level) of which more than 70% were rare. More than 95% of genetic variation was found at the intrapopulation level (G(ST) = 0.047). High levels of past gene flow were inferred, based on the allozyme data (N-m = 5.2 from G(ST), N-m = 10.2 from the 'private allele' method). Calluna vulgaris exhibited several geographic patterns of genetic variation. Both cluster analysis, constructed with various genetic distances and principal components analysis showed that Spanish and Pyrenean populations were clearly different from those collected in the Massif Central and Belgium. Also, a trend for decreasing genetic diversity towards Northern populations was detected. These patterns might be related to the post-glacial history of Calluna. In addition, it is shown that isolation by distance has played a role in the geographic shaping of genetic variation in this species.

J	Wrubleski, DA; Murkin, HR; vanderValk, AG; Nelson, JW				Wrubleski, DA; Murkin, HR; vanderValk, AG; Nelson, JW			Decomposition of emergent macrophyte roots and rhizomes in a northern prairie marsh	AQUATIC BOTANY												Dry mass, nitrogen and phosphorus content in belowground litter of four emergent macrophytes (Typha glauca Godr., Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin., Scolochloa feslucacea (Willd.) Link and Scirpus lacustris L.) were followed for 1.2 years in a series of experimental marshes, Delta Marsh, Manitoba. Litter bags containing roots and rhizome materials of each species were buried in unflooded soil, or soil flooded at three water depths (1-30, 31-60, > 60 cm). There were few differences in dry mass loss in unflooded or flooded soils, and depth of flooding also had little effect on decomposition rates. In the flooded sites, Scolochloa and Phragmites roots lost more mass (48.9-63.8% and 59.2-85.5%, respectively) after 112 days than Typha and Scirpus (36.3-43.6 and 37.0-47.2%, respectively). These differences continued through to the end of the study, except in the shallow sites where Scirpus roots lost more mass and had comparable mass remaining as Scolochloa and Phragmites. In the unflooded sites, there was little difference between species. All litters lost nitrogen (22.9-90.0%) and phosphorus (46.3-92.7%) during the first 112 days, then levels tended to remain constant. Decay rates for our belowground root and rhizome litters were comparable to published literature values for aboveground shoot litter of the same species, except for Phragmites roots and rhizomes which decomposed at a faster rate (-k = 0.0014-0.0032) than shoots (-k = 0.0003-0.0007, [van der Valk, A.G., Rhymer, J.M., Murkin, H.R., 1991.

J	Shaw, WB; Burns, BR				Shaw, WB; Burns, BR			The ecology and conservation of the endangered endemic shrub, kowhai ngutukaka Clianthus puniceus in New Zealand	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Common in cultivation in New Zealand and elsewhere, natural populations of kowhai ngutukaka Clianthus puniceus (Fabaceae), an endangered New Zealand shrub, are rare in the wild (29 populations). Populations are generally composed of only a few plants occurring on north-facing (sunny) bluffs, cliffs, and lake and river margins, or on hillslopes in seral scrub communities. At these remaining sites, plants were found to be mostly multi-stemmed, with a low, spreading growth habit. Turnover of stems was high, each plant losing and gaining approximately two stems per year. Asexual reproduction occurred within populations by layering of branches up to 4 m from the parent plant. This characteristic improves persistence on sites, but genetic variability within populations is probably low. Populations produce abundant seed, suggesting adequate pollination, but passive dispersal appears to limit spread. However, seed can survive for decades dormant within soil seed banks before germination. High foliar element concentrations suggest high herbivore preference. Continuing threats to C. puniceus populations are loss of habitat, browsing by introduced mammals and molluscs, competition with adventive weed species for establishment on open sites, and overtopping within seral communities.

J	Aparicio, A; Guisande, R				Aparicio, A; Guisande, R			Replenishment of the endangered Echinospartum algibicum (Genisteae, Fabaceae) from the soil seed bank	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Echinospartum algibicum is a very recently described species, It is currently only known from one population in southern Spain and is in serious danger of extinction as only three out of 92 living plants are able to flower and set fruit because of grazing. The aim of the work presented in this paper was to study the seed density and distribution in the permanent soil seed bank, and to assess the possibility of replenishing this species from the seed bank. A total of 101.25 litres of soil from 90 soil cores at three different depth levels (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm) in three different plots was sampled within the population. Each recovered buried seed was individually weighed and tested for viability, together with a sample of 30 freshly collected seeds, seedling development was also monitored. One hundred and thirteen seeds (167 seeds m(-2)) were recovered and the number of seeds was not statistically different among plots. Mean seed mass of buried seeds was significantly different between plots and also compared to fresh seeds. Scarification significantly increased seedling emergence, after a 20-day test. Germination differed among plots but not among the soil layers at different depths. Viable seeds had greater mean seed mass than non-viable seeds, but there did not seem to be a critical seed mass for germination. Most seedlings died before 20 weeks; therefore, despite the high germination percentages observed in this study both in buried and fresh seeds, seedling survival was extremely low. In-situ conservation measures and studies are suggested.

J	GarayArroyo, A; AlvarezBuylla, ER				GarayArroyo, A; AlvarezBuylla, ER			Isozyme variation in a tropical pioneer tree species (Cecropia obtusifolia, Moraceae) with high contents of secondary compounds	BIOTROPICA												We define 48 allozyme loci for a tropical pioneer tree species, Cecropia obtusifolia Bertol, which has high contents of secondary compounds. Our goals were to find the effects of extraction procedures on artifacts and variation in resolution of enzyme banding patterns; to explore the relationship among the variation of the loci sampled and the enzymes' molecular structure, metabolic function and substrate; to obtain estimates of the genetic variation in this species at Los Tuxtlas rain forest (Mexico) and to explore the variation of allelic frequencies in six successive life-history stages of the species. The resolution of the isozymes bands and the actual banding pattern varied with the type and age of tissue, the collection and storage procedures, the extraction buffer, and other loading and running procedural derails. However, artifactual variation was eliminated with a new extraction buffer for species with high contents of secondary compounds. Of the 26 enzymes resolved for C. obtusifolia, we found that enzymes with a greater number of substrates and an oligomeric quaternary structure tended to be more variable than their counterparts, but the relationship was not statistically significant. The proportion of polymorphic systems varied significantly with the metabolic pathway and the function of the enzymes. Enzymes involved in starch synthesis are significantly more variable (p < 0.05) than all others, except those involved in amino acids metabolism and the proportion of polymorphic enzymes is also significantly associated with the function of the enzyme, the hydrolases and isomerases are significantly more variable than lyases and oxidoreductases enzymes. The percentage of polymorphic loci for C. obtusifolia was estimated at P = 27.1%. The effective number of alleles was estimated at ne = 1.3 and ne = 2.4 for all loci and only polymorphic ones respectively and the average heterozygosity (H) for all 48 loci was estimated at H = 0.05. Allele frequencies varied throughout the life-cycle of the species, with significant differences for some alleles and loci among some life-cycle stages. ''Tree seeds'' allele frequencies differ significantly (P < 0.05) from ''rainy dispersed seeds'' in 7 of 8 loci and from ''soil seeds'' in six of eight loci. Allele frequencies of all three seed categories (''tree seeds'', ''rainy dispersed seeds'', and ''soil seeds'') differed strongly from established individuals (seedlings, juveniles and adults), while allele frequencies of established individuals are relatively similar to one another. Seedling allele frequencies at most loci were also significantly different from those found in seeds collected from trees, seed-rain, and soil. Two alleles (at GOT-2 and FE-2) were only found in soil seeds and one allele (at LAP-2) was only found in seedlings.

J	Dalling, JW; Swaine, MD; Garwood, NC				Dalling, JW; Swaine, MD; Garwood, NC			Soil seed bank community dynamics in seasonally moist lowland tropical forest, Panama	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Seasonal changes in the densities of dormant seeds in the soil around eight pioneer trees in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot, on Barro Colorado Island, Panama were studied, and how seed dispersal and seed dormancy influenced patterns of seed abundance and distribution were examined. Twenty-four, 3-cm-deep soil samples were collected on 30 m transects radiating out from each of the trees in each of four time-intervals through the year, and four 21-cm-deep samples were collected beneath the focal tree crowns. In the surface 0-3 cm of soil, germinable seed densities of all species combined declined from a peak of 1090 seeds m(-2) in the mid-wet season in August, to 330 seeds m(-2) by the end of the wet season in November. In contrast, at soil depths >3 cm, there was little variation in soil seed bank density through the year. Some variation in soil seed bank density for individual species could be accounted for by distance to reproductive conspecifics. Among species, abundance in the soil was negatively correlated with seed size. Seed persistence varied greatly among species at this site; after 1 y of burial in mesh bags, seed germinability of four species was near zero, while four other species showed no consistent decline in seed germinability after >2 y of burial. For at least one species, Trema micrantha, prolonged seed dormancy was also possible under natural conditions. Twenty-five percent of Trema seeds extracted from the soil at a site occupied by an isolated Trema tree that died between 1982 and 1985 were still germinable in 1994.																	0266-4674					SEP	1997	13		5				659	680		10.1017/S0266467400010853							WOS:A1997YC71000002

The objective of this work was to determine the survival period and emergence rates of seeds of Acanthospermum hispidum DC. for predictive management uses in weed control. Soil management practices such as conventional tillage, moldboard tillage, scarification and heavy disc and no-till; postemergence herbicide management practices, present or not in soybeans, followed by wheat, were established during five years. Acanthospermum hispidum estimated survival periods for soil management practices, with herbicides or Brachiaria plantaginea (Link.) Hitch. competition, were of 10.9 years on average. Seed bank annual decreasing rate was about 37.0%. Emergence rates changed with year and soil management practices; the lowest rate was observed in no-tillage. Maximum emergence rate was of 1.0%, before soybean sowing; after sowing, emergence rates were between 0.6% and 6.5%. Seeds initial vertical distribution in soil was of no importance for management practices.

J	Roche, S; Koch, JM; Dixon, KW				Roche, S; Koch, JM; Dixon, KW			Smoke enhanced seed germination for mine rehabilitation in the southwest of Western Australia	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Cool smoke treatments were applied to unmined Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) forest soils, rehabilitated bauxite mine soils, and broadcast seed to determine if enhancement in germination could be effected with a view toward maximizng the establishment of species in; bauxite mines in Western Australia. Forest sites showed a 48-fold increase in total germinants from the soil seed bank when treated with aerosol smoke. Newly returned bauxite mine soils showed a greater than threefold increase in total germinants after the same treatment. There were also significant increases in the number of species germinating in response to the aerosol smoke treatment in both the forest and the mined soils. Similarly, application of smoked water to the soil seed bank in previously mined sites elicited a significant positive germination response, increasing total germinants and species numbers by 56 and 33%, respectively. Treatment of mixed seed lots with aerosol smoke before broadcast resulted in highly significant improvement in germination when compared to untreated seed. Both total number of germinants, and number of species emerging from mined sites were positively influenced (85% and 34% increases, respectively). Ten target species were used to determine the relative effectiveness of different methods of smoke treatment on the germination of broadcast seed. Nine of the species involved displayed a promotive effect with at least two of the treatments. Generally, however, aerosol smoking of seed before broadcast proved to be the more effective approach. As a result of these findings, all broadcast seed for use in Alcoa's bauxite mined areas in the southwest of Western Australia is now routinely smoke treated before application.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; 												1061-2971					SEP	1997	5	3					191	203		10.1046/j.1526-100X.1997.09724.x							WOS:A1997XZ55300001						
J	JankowskaBlaszczuk, M; Grubb, PJ				JankowskaBlaszczuk, M; Grubb, PJ			Soil seed banks in primary and secondary deciduous forest in Bialowieza, Poland	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Germination over 3 years was followed in 25 soil samples of 31 x 31 x 5 cm each from primary and secondary stands in Bialowieza forest, Poland. The number of seedlings emerging and the number of species declined over the 3 years. In year 1 the mean densities of emerging seedlings for the primary and secondary stands were similar (2142 m(-2) and 2488 m(-2) respectively); in year 3 the difference was greater (248 vs 498 m(-2)) but not statistically significant. The trend reflected the greater longevity of the seed bank species characteristic of the secondary forest. Two functional groups of herb and shrub species were distinguished in the seed bank based on (a) frequency as adults in the present vegetation, and (b) relative abundance in the seed banks of primary and secondary forest. Group A species need large-scale gaps in the tree canopy; most have very small seeds (<0.15 mg mean dry mass) and are very persistent in the soil. Group B species benefit from single-treefall gaps in the tree canopy, but appear to be suited primarily to gaps in the canopy of the herb layer and in the root layer made mainly by animals; their seeds are not as small (mostly >0.15 mg) and not as persistent in the soil. Group B species made up 86% of the seedlings emerging over 3 years in soil from the primary stand, and 56% of those from the secondary stand. In the laboratory all five Group B species tested showed some inhibition of germination in darkness, but only one showed unequivocal inhibition by far-red-enrichment of low irradiance light.

Photoecology of germination	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Regardless of whether or not seeds geographically-widespread Solidago altissima nemoralis were exposed to light in autumn, those 'dispersed' in autumn (15/6 degrees C) or winter (5 degrees C) required 12 weeks of light in winter to germinate to greater than or equal to 80% in darkness in spring (2 weeks at 20/10 degrees C). On the other hand, seeds of the narrow-endemic S. shortii dispersed in autumn and exposed to greater than or equal to 2 weeks of light in early winter germinated to greater than or equal to 77% in darkness in spring, and those dispersed in winter and exposed to greater than or equal to 6 weeks of light germinated to greater than or equal to 82%. S. altissima and S. nemoralis seeds not exposed to light during any season germinated to only 0-1% in darkness in spring, whereas S. shortii seeds germinated to 45-56%. Seeds of S. altissima and S. nemoralis kept in darkness in autumn and winter needed a 1-day (14-h photoperiod) light exposure in spring to germinate to greater than or equal to 75% in darkness, whereas those of S. shortii required only one 5-s exposure. Cold-stratified (nondormant) seeds of S. altissima, S. nemoralis and S. shortii exposed to light with a high far-red/red ratio germinated to significantly higher percentages than dark controls and freshly-matured and lab-stored seeds. Results of this study suggest that a soil seed bank of S. shortii should be smaller and be depleted at a faster rate than those of S. altissima and S. nemoralis, and portions of the seeds of the three species can germinate in the far-red-enriched light under plant canopies.																	0960-2585					SEP	1997	7	3					293	301		10.1017/S0960258500003640							WOS:A1997XU75000007						
J	Brown, SC; Bedford, BL				Brown, SC; Bedford, BL			Restoration of wetland vegetation with transplanted wetland soil: An experimental study	WETLANDS												Restoration of drained wetlands requires the re-establishment of a native wetland plant community. This can be difficult in areas where long-term drainage has eliminated wetland vegetation and significantly reduced the number of viable wetland plant seeds in the seed bank. This study of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wetland restoration sites in northern New York examines the effectiveness of transplanting wetland soil from small remnant wetlands in the drainage ditches to the area that becomes shallow marsh following reflooding. The results of two experiments are reported, including a small-scale study of transplantation techniques using small plots with treatments and controls established by hand, and a large-scale application of soil transplantation and site-preparation techniques using heavy equipment to establish large plots across entire wetland basins. In the small-scale study, the transplant plots had significantly lower wetland index values, indicating greater dominance of wetland plants, after one growing season but not after two. Transplant plots also had more wetland plant species and more wetland plant cover than natural control plots, and these differences persisted through the second growing season. Litter removal and soil disturbance also lowered the wetland index values and increased wetland plant species number and cover, but only for the first growing season. In the large-scale study, soil transplantation significantly increased both the number of species and the amount of cover of wetland plants and of plants valuable as wildlife food sources. Mowing and plowing treatments increased wetland plant establishment, but much less than soil transplantation, and plowing significantly increased the establishment of cattail (Typha spp.), an undesirable invasive species in small wildlife marshes. Soil transplantation should be a particularly effective technique for improving wetland plant establishment and limiting cattail encroachment in areas disturbed by dike construction.																	0277-5212					SEP	1997	17	3					424	437		10.1007/BF03161432							WOS:A1997XX56200010

J	Kirkham, FW; Kent, M				Kirkham, FW; Kent, M			Soil seed bank composition in relation to the above-ground vegetation in fertilized and unfertilized hay meadows on a Somerset peat moor	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1, This study was carried out on a peat moor in Somerset in the south-west of England (51 degrees 12'N, 2 degrees 49'W) in 1991. Assessments were made of the soil seed bank in March, and of the above-ground vegetation in the following May. Meadows that had received repeated applications of inorganic fertilizers during the preceding 5 years were compared to those that were unfertilized. The meadows had been cut for hay followed by aftermath grazing each year. 2, A substantial number of seeds of species that normally germinate soon after shedding (i.e. type I species) had survived in the soil until March. This was probably due to a rapid change from very dry to waterlogged soil in the autumn, with both conditions inhibiting germination. Type I species accounted for a disproportionately large fraction of total ground cover relative to the number of species involved, compared with more persistent species, 3. Based upon variance between individual 8-m(2) plots, the type I group showed the closest correspondence between vegetation cover and seed bank abundance, while the type IV (long-term persistent seed bank) group showed the least. However, this relationship was close within both the Juncaceae and the Cyperaceae species groups, most of which are type IV species. This was attributed to marked between-plot variation in the specific hydrological conditions to which these species are preferentially adapted. 4. Fertilizer application increased the vegetation abundance of a few species and reduced the abundance of a larger number. These effects were mirrored by differences in seed bank composition, The effects of fertilizer application were greatest within the type I group, This result was more pronounced when species were further subdivided into those that had reacted positively or negatively to applied N in previous experiments in the same meadows. Fertilizers caused a fourfold shift in the balance of species in the seed bank towards those that were previously identified as responding positively to N in terms of vegetation cover, with a smaller concomitant shift from type IV species to type III. 5. Where the aim is to restore high species diversity to previously fertilized meadows, these results show the importance both of reducing soil fertility and of encouraging seed production in those species that have declined.																	0021-8901					AUG	1997	34	4					889	902		10.2307/2405280							WOS:A1997XT34800006						
J	Pywell, RF; Putwain, PD; Webb, NR				Pywell, RF; Putwain, PD; Webb, NR			The decline of heathland seed populations following the conversion to agriculture	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1, The composition and size of the germinable seed populations of undisturbed heathland soils were compared to those of adjacent farmland which was formerly heathland. The distribution of seeds with soil depth was also examined under the different land use types. 2. In heathland soil, the seed populations of heathland species were very large (17 500-33 700 seed m(-2)) and were concentrated in the litter and top 40 mm of the undisturbed soil profile. Repeated ploughing was found to redistribute the seed population throughout the soil profile. 3. Heathland seed populations exhibited an exponential decay with time under more intensive agricultural management, with an estimated half-life of 10 years. This was compared to half-life estimates of 13 years under nearby conifer plantations. It was thought that the natural decay of heathland seed populations with time was accelerated by cultivation. Each ploughing event brings buried seed to the surface where it germinates and is lost. Despite this, heathland seed populations were found to survive for at least 30-40 years under permanent pasture with occasional periods of arable farming. 4, The redistribution and loss of heathland seed was accompanied by a large increase in the size of the non-heathland seed population. This, together with the increased fertility of farmland soils, makes the restoration of heathland vegetation from relic heathland seed populations problematical and uncertain.

J	Marone, L; Horno, M				Marone, L; Horno, M			Seed reserves in the central Monte Desert, Argentina: implications for granivory	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												It has been suggested that lower rates of granivory in South American warm deserts compared to their Noah American counterparts arose from a reduction of seed reserves in the former owing to the extinction of argyrolagid marsupials. We measured seed reserves in two habitats of the central Monte Desert in an attempt to detect such seed decline, but to no avail. After moderate rainfall, maximum seed standing crops reached 16,000 and 23,000 seeds m(-2) in shrublands and open forests, respectively. Under the canopy of trees and shrubs there were 19,000 and 37,000 seeds m(-2); whereas in exposed areas there were c. 10,000 seeds m(-2) in both habitats. Seed banks in other South American semi-arid areas showed similar values. Total grass seeds as well as those presumably preferred by ants also seem to be similar in both continents. Hence, granivory in South America, as has been already reported for Australia, is lower than in North America in spite of the great similarity of seed bank sizes. Moreover, argyrolagids were unlikely seed-hoarding granivores, therefore some other reason than argyrolagid extinction should be sought to explain the lack of specialized seed-eating mammals, and the smaller overall seed consumption rates in South American deserts.

Galium aparine has been chosen as a model to study this kind of ant-plant association. In order to understand benefits to ants and plants, we have studied removal rates of fruits by ant workers, and compared soil seed material, seedling pattern and development of plants of the nest versus forest. Ant workers remove fruits at very low rates; removal time for half of the sample of 10 seeds was on average 5 h. Removed fruits were usually lost within 20-30 cm distance of the ant route. The soil samples from the nests contained a higher number of fruits, than those from randomly chosen sites in the forest. Seeds start to germinate in late August; on the F. polyctena mounds significantly earlier than at surrounding places. The seedling density was higher within experimental quadrats located on mound sites especially in late September-early October. The highest density of seedlings was on the slope of the mound. Plants from mounds are significantly longer, have a higher number of nodes during all stages of development and a higher mortality rate than that at surrounding places. The interactions between G. aparine and F. polyctena ants are asymmetrical. In spite of higher mortality rate of seedlings on mounds, ants provide some benefits to the plant. Firstly, workers are additional dispersal agents for G. aparine fruits. Furthermore, the soil peculiarities of ant mounds are beneficial for seed germination and seedling growth. G. aparine does not provide ants with energetically valuable food like plants with elaiosome-bearing seeds. Moreover, the high density of seedlings and plants on the mounds shades the nest.																	1385-0237					AUG	1997	131	2					215	221		10.1023/A:1009789202189							WOS:A1997XP33400008						
J	Whittle, CA; Duchesne, LC; Needham, T				Whittle, CA; Duchesne, LC; Needham, T			Comparison of emergence methods to evaluate viable plant propagules in forest soils following fire	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												A comparison of immediate emergence with stratified emergence to evaluate soil seed banks from forest soils was made for 163 emergents from 12 vascular species. Significantly more plants emerged through the immediate than through the stratified method. Vaccinium spp. (blueberry) and Maianthemum canadense (Wild Lily-of-the-Valley) were favoured by immediate emergence whereas Oryzopsis pungens (a grass) was favoured by the stratified method. Germination of all other species remained unaffected by the emergence method. Depth of seed burial in the soil profile affected seed emergence.																	0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1997	111	3					436	439									WOS:A1997XR58800013						
J	Witkowski, ETF; Lamont, BB				Witkowski, ETF; Lamont, BB			Does the rare Banksia goodii have inferior vegetative, reproductive or ecological attributes compared with its widespread co-occurring relative B-gardneri?	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Banksia goodii (rare) and B. gardneri var. gardneri (widespread) are closely related rhizomatous evergreen subshrubs of south western Australian scrub-heath and woodland. B. goodii is restricted to sixteen populations, most of which are remnants on roadsides due to landscape fragmentation from agricultural activities. Bioclimatic profiles indicate that B. gardneri spans a wider range of climates than B. goodii. However, their post-fire survival and resprouting vigour, rates of seedling growth and soil penetration and susceptibility to seedling predators are similar. Both have the potential for geographic range extension, especially B. goodi. Seedlings of both species survived for at least 3 years at sites with 2 (but not 3) months shorter and 1 month longer growing seasons than experienced by natural B. goodii populations. Seedling establishment did not occur in the absence of fire and was low (1.3% of released intact seeds for B. goodii) even following en masse release of seeds after fire. Sowing of intact seeds, especially in cleared areas and with protection from herbivores, increased this to 35%. Fire survival among adults of both species was 100% following two fires. B. goodii, which roots along its rhizomes, produces ramets, while B. gardneri, with a lignotuber instead, does not. Seed production, pre-dispersal granivory and canopy seed storage are low but similar for both species, although B. gardneri has a superior level of germination. The biology of B. gardneri thus provides few insights as to why B. goodii is rare. There were no differences in topo-edaphic attributes, community structure, shading or litter cover between localized sites where either species occurred alone or together. Differences in present or prehistoric fire regimes, clearing (habitat fragmentation), susceptibility to generalist fungal pathogens, or impacts of alien invasives, cannot explain the distribution of B. goodii relative to B. gardneri. The rarity of B. goodii may be a result of its recent origin, habitat specialization (dense woodland), and the impacts of habitat fragmentation within its current range, rather than inferior vegetative, reproductive and/or ecological attributes.

J	Olson, BE; Wallander, RT; Lacey, JR				Olson, BE; Wallander, RT; Lacey, JR			Effects of sheep grazing on a spotted knapweed-infested Idaho fescue community	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam,), a Eurasian perennial forb, is replacing many native perennial grasses, such as Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer,), in foothills of the Northern Rocky Mountain region, Our objective was to determine if 3 summers of repeated sheep grazing would reduce spotted knapweed without impacting the dominant, associated native perennial grass, Each summer, small pastures were grazed for 1-7 days in mid-June, mid-duly, and early September, Areas repeatedly grazed by sheep had lower densities of seedlings, rosettes, and mature spotted knapweed plants than ungrazed areas. In addition, the proportion of young plants in the population was less in grazed than ungrazed areas, Basal areas of spotted knapweed plants were greater in grazed (8.2 cm(2)) than ungrazed areas (4.0 cm(2)), There were fewer spotted knapweed seeds in soil samples from grazed areas (12 seeds m(-2)) than from ungrazed (49 seeds m(-2)), Idaho fescue plant density increased 40% in grazed areas from 1991 to 1994, but leaves and flower stems on these plants were 38% and 17% shorter, respectively, than in ungrazed areas. By 1994, frequency of Kentucky bluegrass (Pea pratensis L,) was 35% greater in grazed than ungrazed areas, Grazing did not alter the amount of litter; however the amount of bare soil increased from 2.2 to 5.6% in grazed areas, while it decreased from 4 to 1% in ungrazed areas, Three summers of repeated sheep grazing negatively impacted spotted knapweed, but minimally affected the native grass community, A long term commitment to repeated sheep grazing may slow the rate of increase of spotted knapweed in native plant communities.																	0022-409X					JUL	1997	50	4					386	390		10.2307/4003305							WOS:A1997XK18200010						
J	Knox, JS				Knox, JS			A nine year demographic study of Helenium virginicum (Asteraceae), a narrow endemic seasonal wetland plant	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												I carried out a nine year demographic study of Helenium virginicum Blake using permanent quadrats at one sinkhole pond in the eastern United Stares to gain insight into factors controlling the distribution and abundance of this plant. I monitored recruitment and mortality of genets, their stage classes, and their distribution in relation to water depth and overstory cover. The occurrence and distribution of a seed bank was studied as well as the survival and demography of transplants. Comparisons of soil chemistry and general patterns of distribution and abundance within sites were made between the study site and other populations. The annual hydroperiod at the sinkhole pond varied from 4-16 months of continuous inundation during winter and summer with plants growing at sites with low overstory cover and at maximum water depths of from 49-59 cm. After 16 months of continuous inundation and heavy accumulation of floating aquatic vegetation, all H, virginicum plants had died at the study site. At the same time, other neighboring populations with inundation as long and deep did not accumulate a cover of floating vegetation and their populations did not decline noticeably. These data suggest that H, virginicum is intolerant of shade. Following death of all H. virginicum plants at the study site, soil sampling and a large pulse of recruitment gave evidence of a seed bank which was at least two years old. Annual recruitment and the proportion of plants in stage classes was highly variable; survival of the early stage plants was low. A highly variable population size suggests a high probability of local extinction of the population at the study site if future investment in the seed bank should fail to occur Chemical analyses of soils from 19 of the 21 sites in which H. virginicum grows, revealed a low pH, high levels of Al and As, and low levels of B, Ca, K, Mg, and P. Endemism of this plant may result from it being limited to refugia where competition is reduced by a stressful soil and a variable hydroperiod, and where the variable hydroperiod leads to high rates of local extinction.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL-SEP	1997	124	3					236	245		10.2307/2996611							WOS:A1997XY71500003

J	Albrecht, H; Pilgram, M				Albrecht, H; Pilgram, M			The weed seed bank of soils in a landscape segment in southern Bavaria .2. Relation to environmental variables and to the surface vegetation	PLANT ECOLOGY												In the first part of their investigations of the weed seed bank in a 110 ha landscape segment in southern Bavaria, Albrecht & Forster (1996) showed that there was a tremendous spatial variability in seed density as well as in species composition. The intention of the present paper was to elucidate the reasons for this variability. For this purpose, the influence of soil conditions, land use practices, and soil fauna, all of which are environmental factors potentially affecting the weed seed bank, were investigated. Highly significant correlations were observed between the soil seed bank, preceding management variables, and the available field capacity. In contrast, multiple regression analyses between seed banks and the chemical characteristics of the soil, soil fauna, and actual management showed either minor correlation or none at all. Thus, prior management and water supply must be supposed to have had the most decisive influence on the soil seed bank. Several environmental variables affect arable weed populations, not so much through the soil seed bank but through the germination, establishment, and reproduction phases in the field. For this reason the relations between the 'apparent' weed flora and the 'potential' vegetation in the soil also were investigated. The correlation of the soil seed content and the density of individuals on the soil surface was highly significant. The analysis for a single species revealed that the seed bank/field density-ratios of different taxa vary from below 10:1 up to 100:1 and more. This wide range may be related to the life-forms and ecological requirements characteristic for each species. Finally, comparisons of the environmental variables with the soil seed bank and surface vegetation allowed ranking of the variables as to their importance for these two stadia of plant population development. These investigations indicated that the preceding management by different farmers exerted a more decisive influence on the number of seeds in the soil. In contrast, the actual grain yield and N-content in a soil showed a closer relationship to the soil surface vegetation. With regard to the species composition, no distinct differences in the environmental relationships between the soil seed bank and the soil surface vegetation could be observed.

J	Sharew, H; Legg, CJ; Grace, J				Sharew, H; Legg, CJ; Grace, J			Effects of ground preparation and microenvironment on germination and natural regeneration of Juniperus procera and Afrocarpus gracilior in Ethiopia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The seedling establishment of Juniperus procera Hochst. ex Endl. and Afrocarpus gracilior (Pilger) C. N. Page was assessed in the Afromontane forests of Ethiopia. Percent Light transmission, litter depth and percentage cover of vegetation were assessed for seedling microsites in five sites with different levels and history of disturbance. The response of natural and artificial regeneration to burning, mechanical scarification (removal of all logging waste and ground vegetation) and cultivation following clear felling and timber extraction was assessed 19 months after treatment. There was no evidence that regeneration was correlated with light intensity. Despite the presence of a viable seed bank in the undisturbed forest floor, removal of the overstorey vegetation by clear felling did not encourage natural regeneration of J. procera. This suggests that light may not be the main factor limiting regeneration of J. procera. Natural regeneration of J. procera can withstand exposure and is compatible with management by 'clear cutting with seeding from adjacent stands' together with ground treatment, particularly controlled burning which exposes the mineral soil and releases nutrients. In contrast, both clear felling and surface disturbance will discourage the natural (or artificial) regeneration of A. gracilior suggesting that J. procera is a pioneer species which is more exposure-tolerant, whilst A. gracilior is more shade-tolerant and exposure-intolerant.

J	Lloret, F; Vila, M				Lloret, F; Vila, M			Clearing of vegetation in Mediterranean garrigue: Response after a wildfire	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Plant resprouting and seedling establishment one year after a wildfire was evaluated in plots in which all vegetation was dipped three times a year for 5 years before the fire. Vegetation regeneration was compared between burned-cleared plots and: i) burned-uncleared plots; ii) unburned-cleared plots. Ground cover was not influenced by the vegetation clipping carried on before fire, except that there was less resprouting of the dominant resprouter Quercus coccifera in cleared-burned than in uncleared-burned plots. Number of seedlings and species richness was not significantly influenced by clearing treatments. When comparing burned-cleared plots with unburned-cleared plots, fire increased the ground cover of shrubs and resprouting species, but not the total ground cover and the cover of forbs, grasses or e. coccifera. Seedlings were more abundant and species richness greater in burned-cleared plots than in unburned-cleared ones. Vegetation clearing does not appear to strongly affect the regeneration ability of the community, except for the decrease of some dominant species. Our results suggest that before the fire, the seed bank in burned-uncleared plots may be larger than in burned-cleared ones, but the higher temperatures reached in uncleared areas would deplete the seed bank able to germinate, leading to the observed lack of differences in seedling establishment. Seedling establishment in long-term cleared areas is largely dependent upon the seed output from neighbouring well-structured communities and, consequently, it may be affected by the size of cleared areas.

J	Osumi, K; Sakurai, S				Osumi, K; Sakurai, S			Seedling emergence of Betula maximowicziana following human disturbance and the role of buried viable seeds	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We observed seed rain and seedling emergence of a pioneer tree species, Betula maximowicziana Regel., for 5 years at various sites differing in canopy and soil surface conditions, and clarified that a buried seed bank contributed to the recruitment of B. maximowicziana seedlings. More seedlings emerged at sites where the soil surface had been disturbed than at sites where the soil surface had not been disturbed. Within each soil surface condition, the densities of the emerged seedlings were generally proportional to the densities of the seeds dispersed the previous year. However, the seedling densities were disproportionately higher than the dispersed seed densities at the sites where the soil surface had been disturbed in the previous year. Soil samples taken during different seasons indicated that B. maximowicziana maintained a persistent seed bank in the soil below 1 cm deep, while it formed a more transient seed bank in the top 1 cm of the soil. The seed rain in the previous year was the primary contributor to the establishment of B. maximowicziana seedlings in a year after a mast seed year. On the other hand, the soil seed bank had a compensational role in a year after a poor seed year. Canopy cover did not affect seedling emergence. Therefore, the previously reported lack of a persistent seedling bank of B. maximowicziana under a canopy will be partially attributed to a relatively rare soil surface disturbance in a stable stand.

J	Kleijn, D; Joenje, W; Kropff, MJ				Kleijn, D; Joenje, W; Kropff, MJ			Patterns in species composition of arable field boundary vegetation	ACTA BOTANICA NEERLANDICA												Vegetation composition in contrasting held boundary plots was analysed by means of transects perpendicular to the arable field 3 years after establishment. Plots were established on the outer meters of an arable field next to a pre-existing field boundary and sown with (1) a mixture of 30 forbs, (2) Lolium perenne* and (3) plots left regenerating naturally. Tall, competitive species concentrated biomass production in a zone within Im from the arable field, while small, stress tolerant species were predominantly found in a zone 3-4 m from the field. The tall species were able to increase total vegetation biomass production significantly in the zone bordering the arable held, probably by means of capturing nutrients from the arable field. The two major arable weeds found in the boundary plots, Elymus repens and Cirsium arvense, colonized the plots with different strategies but both were seriously reduced in vigour when plots were sown with Lolium perenne or with forbs at the onset of the experiment. Species richness in the forbs-plots was relatively high but rather low in the grass- and regeneration-plots caused by a very limited colonization of potential field boundary species; only two species colonizing the boundary plots were new to the original field boundary, while 30% of the species from the original field boundary were not found in the boundary plots after 3 years. This limited colonization ability may seriously hamper efforts to restore held boundary diversity.

J	Ward, SC; Koch, JM; Grant, CD				Ward, SC; Koch, JM; Grant, CD			Ecological aspects of soil seed-banks in relation to bauxite mining .1. Unmined jarrah forest	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Germinable seed stores were measured in jarrah forest soils at six sites during one year. The overall mean seed content to a depth of 5 cm was 292 seeds m(-2). There was a significant seasonal difference, with a maximum of 435 seeds m(-2) in summer, after the majority of species in this Mediterranean ecosystem had flowered and set seed, and a minimum of 207 seeds m(-2) in winter. There were also large site differences in both the densities of seed present and the species represented in the soil seed store. More than 85 species were represented in the germinable seed store from a total sampling area of 17.28 m(2). The germination of Acacia drummondii, Acacia pulchella, Bossiaea aquifolium, Kennedia coccinea, Lasiopetalum floribundum and Trymalium ledifolium were significantly increased by heating the soil. Smoke produced a significant positive germination response in one species (Trymalium ledifolium). To maximize the contribution of the soil seed store to mine rehabilitation, the ideal revegetation sequence is to collect the topsoil immediately after clearing the vegetation in summer, immediately return the soil to an area to be revegetated, and carry out all earthmoving, landscaping and seedbed preparations prior to the onset of the autumn rains.																	0307-692X					JUN	1997	22	2					169	176		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1997.tb00656.x							WOS:A1997XE93800006						
J	Grant, CD; Koch, JM				Grant, CD; Koch, JM			Ecological aspects of soil seed-banks in relation to bauxite mining .2. Twelve year old rehabilitated mines	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Germinable seed stores were estimated for 12-13 year old rehabilitation sites in the jarrah forest over two seasons (autumn and spring). Collected soils were subjected to combinations of smoking and heating treatments before the germination procedure was commenced. The mean topsoil seed reserve to a depth of 10 cm was 1938 seeds m(-2). Of this total reserve, more than 80% was found in the upper 5 cm of soil. The topsoil seed reserve of these rehabilitation areas was almost seven times that of the adjacent native jarrah forest (292 seeds m(-2); Ward et al. 1997). There was a seasonal effect with autumn-collected soils having significantly more germinable seeds (2723 seeds m(-2)) than soils collected in spring (1153 seeds m(-2)). More than half (53%) of the topsoil seed reserve in rehabilitated areas was composed of annual weed species, dominated by Aira caryophyllea, Centaurium erythraea and the native Levenhookia pusilla. Of the total of 70 species identified, 13 species showed significantly higher germination in smoked trays while 11 species exhibited significantly higher germination in heated trays. Species responding to the smoking treatment tended to be annuals while those responding to the heating treatment were typically legume shrub species. Examination of the topsoil seed reserve and the vegetation present in these areas showed that while the species composition was similar between the seed store and the vegetation, there was a large difference in densities, with species occurring at much higher densities in the topsoil than in the vegetation. However, the rankings of species were significantly correlated between the topsoil seed reserve and the vegetation present at the site. The implications of these results to prescribed burning of these rehabilitated areas is discussed.																	0307-692X					JUN	1997	22	2					177	184		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1997.tb00657.x							WOS:A1997XE93800007

Why this sudden advent? To which species do they belong? Vegetation records were made in a 12-year-old mixed pine forest of Pinus halepensis and P. pinaster. At the same time, soil samples were collected (5 cm deep). The direct method (identification with binocular lens of all encountered seeds after soil screening) was used to identify seeds to species. Seeds of species encountered in large quantity were subjected to viability tests. The seeds of two therophytes (Trifolium glomeratum, T. campestre) were subjected to thermal treatments. The soil seed bank was only partially reflecting the floristic composition of the pine forest. Three groups of plants were distinguished: (i) species observed both in aboveground vegetation and in the soil seed bank (21.9%); all were perennials, (ii) species encountered only in the vegetation (58.5%); those preferentially regenerated by vegetative means, and (iii) species observed only in the soil seed bank (19.5%); most reproduced only from seeds. The number of seeds in the soil was high and their distribution very variable. The higher the number of plots in which seeds of a species appeared, the more numerous were the total seeds of that species recorded. Thus, Cistus ladanifer was present in great quantity in all samples. In seeds of species subjected to thermal treatments, low temperatures (50-90 degrees C) did not increase germination rates, but exposure to high temperatures (130-150 degrees C) for long duration (10 min) killed the embryo. In conclusion, numerous seeds are present in a dormant stage in the soil. When a disturbance such as fire eliminates temporarily the aboveground vegetation, these seeds germinate. Thus, after a fire, the seedlings of these species proliferate, then these species disappear with representation by seeds in latent form in the soil when perennial aboveground vegetation has reoccupied burned areas.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218												0008-4026					JUN	1997	75	6					1012	1021		10.1139/b97-112							WOS:A1997XP66700017						
J	Breck, SW; Jenkins, SH				Breck, SW; Jenkins, SH			Use of an ecotone to test the effects of soil and desert rodents on the distribution of Indian ricegrass	ECOGRAPHY												Effects of soil factors and seed-dispersing heteromyid rodents on the distribution of Indian ricegrass Achnatherum hymenoides were studied at a sharp ecotone between a sandy area with abundant Indian ricegrass and a rocky area where Indian ricegrass was scarce. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) Soil factors limited the recruitment rate of Indian ricegrass in the rocky habitat; and 2) Heteromyid rodents limited the distribution of Indian ricegrass because they did not scatterhoard seeds in the rocky habitat. Seed-planting experiments and soil analyses showed that soil characteristics, especially texture and salinity, limited the distribution of Indian ricegrass, but also that microsites existed in the rocky habitat that were suitable for germination and growth of Indian ricegrass. In particular, as many plants survived over their first winter in the rocky habitat as in the sandy habitat, although. surviving plants were taller in the sandy habitat. Analysis of the soil seed bank indicated that fewer seeds were dispersed to the rocky habitat than to the sandy habitat. To determine whether scatterhoards were being made in the rocky habitat, seeds dyed with fluorescent powder were placed along the ecotone and the fates of these seeds were assessed. Twice as many of these seeds were scatterhoarded in the sandy habitat as in the rocky habitat and seeds were cached further from the ecotone in the sandy habitat. The results suggest that both soil characteristics and heteromyid rodents influence the distribution of Indian ricegrass in western Nevada.																	0906-7590					JUN	1997	20	3					253	263		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00369.x							WOS:A1997WZ35900006						
J	Amezaga, I; Onaindia, M				Amezaga, I; Onaindia, M			The effect of evergreen and deciduous coniferous plantations on the field layer and seed bank of native woodlands	ECOGRAPHY												Vegetation and seed bank changes due to the replacement of a native woodland 29 yr ago by coniferous plantations (evergreen coniferous Pinus radiata and deciduous coniferous Larix kaempferi) were studied in a replicated experiment in the Basque Country, northern Spain. In the vegetation the species richness was lower in both coniferous plantations than in the native woodland but there was no significant difference in species richness between the two coniferous plantations. The highest similarity between the vegetation and the seed bank was in the P. radiata plantations (0.51). There was higher vegetation similarity between the native woodland and the larch plantation (0.65) than that with the pine plantation (0.58). Seed bank species richness was higher in the arch plantation than in the native woodland but species richness in the seed bank did not differ between the coniferous plantations. The seed bank showed no difference in the species similarity between the plantations and the native woodland. This was mainly due to the similarity between the broad ranged species. In the coniferous plantations the vegetation diversity was lower than in the native woodland; however, in the seed bank the diversity was higher. Coniferous plantations affected mainly the shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant vernals (Caltha palustris, Galium odoratum, Heleborus viridis and Saxifiaga hirsuta), which disappeared from the field layer of plantations while the shade-intolerant not vernals were favoured by the plantations (Blackstonia perfoliata, Danthonia decumbens, Deschampsia flexuosa, Hypericum androsaemum, Holcus lanatus, Lotus corniculatus and Plantago lanceolata). There was no significant difference in vegetation or seed bank between the two types of coniferous plantations.

J	Hegazy, AK				Hegazy, AK			Plant succession and its optimization on tar-polluted coasts in the Arabian Gulf region	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal ecosystems in the Arabian Gulf region are under increasing pressures from hostilities and other developmental activities; the region has a long history of crude-oil pollution. Because of the high ambient temperature, oil deposited along the coastline or inland evaporates, leaving a semi-solid tar. In Qatar, to clean up the polluted sites, the deposited tar is stripped off and dumped in the coastal marshes as confluent dome-shaped piles. Flowering plant colonization of tar-piles is described here as a chronosequence, ranging in age from 2 to 14 years. The successional patterns in vegetation, seed bank, species diversity and plant growth were predicted from tar-pile disturbances with different ages and tar content. The success of natural plant colonization and the establishment of plant communities on the tar-pile disturbances depend upon: (1) age of the tar-pile disturbances, (2) tar content of the piles and soil physicochemical properties, (3) soil moisture content, (4) structure of plant communities in the surrounding landscape, (5) size of the disposal sites and the method of dumping, and (6) prevailing environmental conditions. A management and restoration framework is proposed to optimize the natural recolonization of tar-piles. To retain these ecosystems in a self-sustaining state, some native plant species might be used including: Aeloropus lagopoides, Aizoon canariense, Anabasis setifera, Fagonia indica, Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum, Reichardia tingitana, Salsola imbricata, Suaeda aegyptiaca, Senecio glaucus, Sporobolus arabicus, Zygophyllum quatarense, and Zygophyllum simpler. To clarify the biological and chemical aspects of the problem, further research on the chemistry of tar-polluted soil and its vegetation in relation to the food web is needed.																	0376-8929					JUN	1997	24	2					149	158		10.1017/S0376892997000210							WOS:A1997YJ45000007						
J	Gutterman, Y				Gutterman, Y			Spring and summer daily subsurface temperatures in three microhabitats in a flat natural loess area in the Negev Desert, Israel	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In this study soil temperatures were measured 1 mm below the soil surface by microsensors in three locations on the matrix and in depressions on a natural area near a flat loess of Sede Boker in the Negev and recorded daily every 10 min. In this area many seeds of desert annual's seed banks germinate on or close to the soil surface. Temperatures over 2 days in the spring, one with rain, were compared with 2 hot days during a 'hamsin' at the beginning of summer. Temperatures in these microhabitats may affect the spread of germination over time according to seed location during storage and germination.

Seeds having primary dormancy do not germinate, even if adequate environmental and dispersal conditions are met, until an after-ripening period is completed. This study examined the effects on germination rates of seed dispersal by vertebrates and primary dormancy (i.e. how germination rates changed in time) in the prickly pear Opuntia rastrera from the southern Chihuahuan Desert. Ripe fruits, seats of coyote, mule deer, woodrat, common pig and pellets of the northern raven were collected in 1992 during the ripe fruit peak (August). A factorial design was used to assess the effect of disperser and seed age on germination rates using these seeds collected in 1992. In 1992, 1993 and 1994 (fresh, 1- and 2-year-old seeds, respectively) germination success after 3 months was determined for 100 seeds of each disperser, plus a control of uneaten seeds. We found differences in germination rates both between dispersers and years. All but one disperser (deer) decreased germination rates with respect to the control. Germination steadily increased with ageing of seeds, implying the presence of primary dormancy (embryo immaturity). Our results show that despite the large disperser coterie associated with Opuntia rastrera, seeds have an obligate primary dormancy which seems to result in seed bank formation. Seed germination and seedling establishment will depend on selection pressures caused mainly by environmental variability in deserts (unpredictable rainfall, extreme temperatures, safe-site availability). Nevertheless, endozoochorous dispersal provides some additional advantages (e.g. habitat colonization, genetic variability, avoidance of long-term local extinction) that needs further research.

J	Treweek, JR; Watt, TA; Hambler, C				Treweek, JR; Watt, TA; Hambler, C			Integration of sheep production and nature conservation: Experimental management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This experiment studied the effects of sheep grazing a formerly fertilized lowland neutral grassland near Oxford in southern England at different intensities and times of year on sheep production, the flora and invertebrates. The aim was to identify regimes that enhanced species-richness while also supporting average levels of sheep production. Grazing in either winter or spring increased the number of plant species the following summer and autumn. However the soil seed bank largely consisted of species common in the sward or of weeds from adjacent arable crops, so diversification requires an external seed source. Sward heights were monitored weekly in summer and sheep numbers adjusted to achieve either high (6 cm) or low (3 cm) target sward heights. There were generally more invertebrates in paddocks grazed to a target sward height of 6 cm rather than 3 cm in summer, but not as many as in adjacent, ungrazed grassland. Target sward heights took longer to achieve and swards were more heterogeneous when grazing had not occurred in the previous season. Sward surface height measurements are a potentially useful tool for linking nature conservation and livestock management. In this experiment sheep weights in summer and autumn were higher when swards were grazed in either the previous winter or spring.

J	Tsuyuzaki, S				Tsuyuzaki, S			Wetland development in early stages of volcanic succession	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Wetland vegetation developed in the crater of Mount Usu, northern Japan, soon after the 1977-1978 eruptions which destroyed the vegetation. The cover of each species was measured in 1994 in 118 50 cm x 50 cm plots situated in transects and related to environmental factors (elevation, water depth, soil texture, soil compaction, soil organic matter, and soil pH) to clarify vegetation development. Five vegetation types were recognized dominated by Eleocharis kamtschatica, Equisetum arvense, Lythrum salicaria, Juncus fauriensis and Phragmites australis respectively. Sedge/grass marsh and reed swamp dominated deep-water sites; willow swamp and wet meadow vegetation characterized shallow-water sites, indicating that vegetation zonation developed soon after the eruption. Since those wetland plants were derived neither from seed banks nor from vegetative propagules, they had to immigrate from outside the summit areas. However, except for willows, most species lack the ability for long-distance dispersal. Late successional species, such as P. australis established in the early stages of the primary succession. The water depth varied by 27.5 cm among the plots. Coarse soil particles accumulated, and pH (5.22-6.55) was low on the elevated sites. Organic matter ranged from 2.8 % to 19.1 %, and was high on the elevated sites. Water depth was responsible for the establishment of large-scale vegetation patterns, while edaphic factors, i.e. soil compaction, pH, and organic matter, were determinants of small-scale vegetation patterns. Among the edaphic factors, soil compaction appeared to have a strong influence on vegetation development.

J	Froborg, H; Eriksson, O				Froborg, H; Eriksson, O			Local colonization and extinction of field layer plants in a deciduous forest and their dependence upon life history features	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												In this study we used species inventory data collected in 1970 and 1993 from 132 plots in a 14.5 ha deciduous forest to examine local extinction and colonization processes among 45 field layer species. Local colonization rate was positively related to both seed size and seed dispersal features. Local extinction rate was negatively related to seed size. Growth form (clonal vs. non-clonal) and presence of a seed bank were not found to be associated with local dynamics. Despite an overall constancy in species composition during this period, plants exhibited a considerable mobility among the 132 plots. This pattern conformed to a suggested 'carousel model' of species mobility in grasslands. A tentative suggestion is that this mobility acts on a comparatively broader spatio-temporal scale in deciduous forests as compared with grasslands. Additional data are presented indicating that species abundance (frequency) among field layer plants in deciduous forest communities is consistent among forest fragments, and when comparing local and regional scales. The main conclusion is that life history features of the seed dispersal/recruitment phase, particularly seed size, are causally associated with abundance patterns at least at a local scale, but possibly also on a broader regional scale.																	1100-9233					JUN	1997	8	3					395	400		10.2307/3237329							WOS:A1997XL27800010						
J	Itakura, S; Imai, I; Itoh, K				Itakura, S; Imai, I; Itoh, K			''Seed bank'' of coastal planktonic diatoms in bottom sediments of Hiroshima bay, Seto inland sea, Japan	MARINE BIOLOGY												Abundance and temporal distribution of viable (able to germinate) resting stage cells of planktonic diatoms in bottom sediments have been investigated almost monthly during 1989 to 1992 in Hiroshima Bay, western part of Seto Inland Sea, Japan. The abundance of viable resting stages in bottom sediments was enumerated with the extinction dilution method (most probable number method, MPN). In bottom sediments of Hiroshima Bay, dominantly distributed species and/or genera of the diatom resting stages were Skeletonema costatum, Chaetoceros spp. and Thalassiosira spp. Viable resting stages of these diatoms were densely distributed on the orders of 10(3) to 10(6) (MPN g(-1) wet sediments), and persisted in bottom sediments throughout the investigation period. Conversely, vegetative cells of these diatoms fluctuated remarkably in the water column and disappeared sporadically. Survival of the resting stages in a collected sediment sample was also determined with the MPN method, at different storage temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 degrees C). The survival test demonstrated that the diatom resting stages could survive in the dark for several months or years in sediments. Resting stages survived longer at the lower storage temperature, and the order of longevity was consistent within three diatoms (Chaetoceros spp. > Thalassiosira spp. > S. costatum) at each storage temperature. The present study suggests that these diatom resting stages in the coastal bottom sediments could serve as a ''seed bank'', analogous to those of terrestrial plants. The seed bank would ensure the survival of diatoms within highly fluctuating coastal environments, while it would also be the source of sporadic and autochthonous diatom blooms in coastal waters.																	0025-3162					JUN	1997	128	3					497	508		10.1007/s002270050116							WOS:A1997XE76500016						
J	Maron, JL; Simms, EL				Maron, JL; Simms, EL			Effect of seed predation on seed bank size and seedling recruitment of bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus)	OECOLOGIA												Whether seed consumers affect plant establishment is an important unresolved question in plant population biology. Seed consumption is ubiquitous; at issue is whether seedling recruitment is limited by safe-sites or seeds. If most seeds inhabit sites unsuitable for germination, post-dispersal seed consumption primarily removes seeds that would otherwise never contribute to the population and granivory has minimal impacts on plant abundance. Alternatively, if most seeds ultimately germinate before they lose viability, there is greater potential for seed consumption to affect plant recruitment. Of the many studies on seed consumption, few ask how seed loss affects seedling recruitment for species with long-lived seed banks. We examined postdispersal seed predation and seedling emergence in bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), a woody leguminous shrub of coastal grasslands and dunes in California. We followed the fate of seeds in paired experimental seed plots that were either protected or exposed to rodent granivores in grassland and dune habitats. Significantly more seeds were removed by rodents in dunes than grasslands. In dunes, where rodent granivory was greatest (65% and 86% of seeds removed from plots by rodents in two successive years), there is a sparse seed bank (6.6 sleds m(-2)), and granivory significantly reduced seedling emergence (in the same two years, 18% and 19.4% fewer seedlings emerged from exposed versus protected plots), suggesting seed rather than safe-site limited seedling recruitment. In contrast, rodents removed an average of 6% and 56% of seeds from grassland plots during the same two years, and the grassland seed bank is 43-fold that of the dunes (288 seeds m(-2)). Even high seed consumption in the second year of the study only marginally influenced recruitment because seeds that escaped predation remained dormant. Burial of seeds in both habitats significantly reduced the percentage of seeds removed by rodents. Results suggest that granivores exert strong but habitat-dependent effects on lupine seed survival and seedling emergence.																	0029-8549					JUN	1997	111	1					76	83		10.1007/s004420050210							WOS:A1997XF86000010	28307508					
J	Hulme, PE				Hulme, PE			Post-dispersal seed predation and the establishment of vertebrate dispersed plants in Mediterranean scrublands	OECOLOGIA												The post-dispersal fate of seeds and fruit (diaspores) of three vertebrate-dispersed trees, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus mahaleb and Taxus baccata, was studied in the Andalusian highlands, south-eastern Spain. Exclosures were used to quantify separately the impact of vertebrates and invertebrates on seed removal in relation to diaspore density and microhabitat. The three plant species showed marked differences in the percentage of diaspores removed, ranging from only 5% for C. monogyna to 87% for T. baccata. Although chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) fed on diaspores, rodents (Apodemus sylvaticus) were the main vertebrate removers of seed and fruit. Two species of ant (Cataglyphis velox and Aphaenogaster iberica) were the only invertebrates observed to remove diaspores. However, the impact of ants was strongly seasonal and they only removed P. mahaleb fruit to any significant extent. While removal of seed by rodents was equivalent to predation, ants were responsible for secondary dispersal. However, their role was limited to infrequent, small-scale redistribution of fruit in the vicinity of parent trees. Rodents and ants differed in their use of different microhabitats. Rodents foraged mostly beneath trees and low shrubs and avoided open areas while the reverse was true of ants. Thus, patterns of post-dispersal seed removal will be contigent on the relative abundance and distribution of ants and rodents. Studies which neglect to quantify separately the impacts of these two guilds of seed removers may fail to elucidate the mechanisms underlying patterns of post-dispersal seed removal. The coincidence of both increased seed deposition by the main avian dispersers (Turdus spp.) and increased seed predation with increasing vegetation height suggested that selection pressures other than post-dispersal seed predation shape the spatial pattern of seed dispersal. Rather than providing a means of escaping post-dispersal seed predators, dispersal appears to direct seeds to microhabitats most suitable for seedling survival. Nevertheless, the reliance of most vertebrate-dispersed trees on regeneration by seed and the absence of persistent soil seed banks imply that post-dispersal seed predators may exert a strong influence on the demography of the plants whose seeds they consume. Even where microsites are limited, the coincidence of the most suitable microhabitats for seedling establishment with those where seed predation is highest provide a means by which selective seed predators can influence community composition.

This paper provides an interpretation of the most consistent patterns in the resulting matrix by means of correlation, ordination and classification analyses. Only a weak coupling was observed between attributes of the regenerative and established phases of the life history. However, within each phase, attributes were strongly aggregated into sets and a high proportion of the variation between species coincided with a single axis. Attributes of the established phase displayed remarkably consistent trends, with a strong 'Axis 1' being identified by three different multivariate methods. There was a marked correlation between foliar concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, high concentrations of which coincided with the capacity for rapid growth in productive conditions and an inability to sustain yield under limiting supplies of nutrients. A diverse array of other traits, less immediately involving mineral nutrients, were also entrained in Axis 1; these included life history, root and shoot foraging, the morphology, longevity, tensile strength and palatability of leaves, and the decomposition rate of leaf litter. This pattern occurred in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons and appeared to reflect a tradeoff between attributes conferring an ability for high rates of resource acquisition in productive habitats and those responsible for retention of resource capital in unproductive conditions. The second axis of variation evident in the established phase was related to phylogeny and distinguished between monocotyledons and dicotyledons on the basis of a diverse set of traits including genome size, cell size, root and shoot foraging characteristics and vascular tissues. A third axis was detected in which ephemerals and perennials were separated by differences in attributes such as breeding system, leaf decomposition rate and a set of traits reflecting the small stature of many short-lived plants. In the regenerative phase, the leading axis was clearly related to the widely recognised tradeoff between seed size and seed number and was consistent with current understanding of seed banks, and with modern theories explaining species coexistence in terms of complementary responses to temporal and spatial variation in vegetation gap dynamics. The data provide strong evidence of functional integration between evolutionary specialisations in root and shoot and support Donald's unified theory of competitive ability. The data are not consistent with theories of functional types based upon evolutionary tradeoffs in allocation between root and shoot. We suggest that the evidence assembled here and elsewhere in the current literature points to the existence of primary functional types, including those recognised by Ramenskii and Grime. These functional types can be reconciled with the individuality of plant ecologies in the field and provide an effective basis For interpretation and prediction at various scales from the plant community to regional floras. There are particular opportunities for prediction of successional trajectories, the role of herbivores in vegetation succession and the response of vegetation to eutrophication and extreme climatic events. It is also suggested that aspects of this investigation may provide a Darwinian underpinning for Odum's theory of ecosystem maturation.

Germination responses of buried seeds in relation to seasonal temperature cycles	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH					2nd International Workshop on Desiccation Tolerance and Sensitivity of Seeds and Vegetative Plant Tissues	JAN 06-11, 1997	FRANSCHHOEK, SOUTH AFRICA	Int Plant Genet Resources Inst (IPGRI)				Seeds of the narrow-endemic Solidago shortii and of the geographically-widespread S. altissima and S. nemoralis collected and buried in 1992 and 1993 were incubated in light and in darkness at 15/6 degrees, 20/10 degrees, 25/15 degrees, 30/15 degrees or 35/20 degrees C following various periods of burial in soil in a non-temperature-controlled glasshouse. At maturity in November, seeds of the three species germinated to 0-1% in light at 15/6 degrees C and to 10-77% at 20/10 degrees, 25/15 degrees, 30/15 degrees and 35/20 degrees C. Seeds exhumed each April from 1993 to 1996 and incubated in light at 15/6 degrees and 20/10 degrees C germinated to greater than or equal to 83% and greater than or equal to 90%, respectively, whereas those exhumed each September of 1993-96 germinated to less than or equal to 2% and less than or equal to 40%, respectively. At 25/15 degrees, 30/15 degrees and 35/20 degrees C in light, seeds of S. altissima and S. shortii germinated to greater than or equal to 52% and those of S. nemoralis to greater than or equal to 19%, regardless of when they were exhumed. Timson's index, which integrates percentages, rates and times for onset of germination, was higher at all temperature regimes for seeds exhumed in April 1995 than for those exhumed in September 1995. Freshly-matured seeds of the three species germinated to 0-11% in darkness. Furthermore, regardless of when they were exhumed, seeds of S. altissima and S. nemoralis incubated in darkness germinated mostly to only 0-9% over the range of temperature regimes. In contrast, less than or equal to 88% and less than or equal to 6% of the seeds of S. shortii exhumed and incubated in darkness each April and September of 1993-96, respectively, germinated, less than or equal to 1% of them germinating while buried in soil. Thus, although buried seeds of all three species exhibited an annual conditional dormancy/non-dormancy cycle, only those of S. shortii exhibited cyclic changes in their germination response in darkness.																	0960-2585					JUN	1997	7	2					209	220		10.1017/S0960258500003548							WOS:A1997XH01700016						
J	VanAuken, OW				VanAuken, OW			Germination requirements of aerial chasmogamous florets and seeds of Nassella leucotricha (Poaceae)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Freshly matured, aerial, chasmogamous florets (caryopses or seeds enclosed within the lemma and palea) of Nassella Leucotricha (formerly Stipa leucotricha) are dormant. Removal of the lemma and palea did not increase germination; thus, the seeds exhibit primary dormancy High temperatures are required to break dormancy Removal of the lemma and palea after 174 days of dry storage at 4 degrees C in low light did not increase germination. Removal of the lemma and palea after dry storage at 35/23 degrees C (12/12 h) for 109 days increased germination to 96%; however, removal of the lemma and palea after dry storage at 25 degrees C required 174 days to increase germination to the same level. If the floret is intact and the fruit stored dry at 25 degrees C for as long as 9 years, germination is approximately 20%, but with removal of the lemma and palea, germination increased to 83%. There appear to be two factors responsible for the dormancy in seeds of N. leucotricha. Exposure to temperatures of 25 to 35 degrees C or possibly higher for 3 to 6 months after the seeds are mature is required to break dormancy and promote germination. In addition, the lemma and palea of the floret seem to be impermeable or inhibitory, also preventing germination. Nassella leucotricha will not germinate the first summer or early fall after dispersal because the time-temperature requirement to break dormancy has not been satisfied. Nassella leucotricha will only germinate in the first fall or winter after dispersal if the time-temperature requirement for breaking dormancy is met and the floret is scarified, breaking the permeability or inhibition barrier im posed by the lemma and palea. Thus, florets of N. leucotricha can potentially remain dormant and viable in the seed bank for a considerable time and could be moved a considerable distance from the site of maturation prior to germination.																	0038-4909					JUN	1997	42	2					194	200									WOS:A1997XT48300011						
J	vanderValk, AG; Rosburg, TR				vanderValk, AG; Rosburg, TR			Seed bank composition along a phosphorus gradient in the northern Florida Everglades	WETLANDS												Seed-bank samples were collected in the northern Everglades along a phosphorus gradient with three vegetation zones (cattail with the highest phosphorus levels, mixed cattail-sawgrass (transition), and sawgrass with the lowest phosphorus levels). The size and composition of the seed banks were estimated using both a direct seed separation (seed assay) and a seedling emergence technique (seedling assay). In the seedling assay, seed-bank samples were kept under two moisture regimes, saturated soil and shallowly flooded. In the seed assay, whole seed of 21 species were found, with a mean of about 8 species per sample in the cattail zone and about 5 in the transition and sawgrass zones. On the basis of their appearance, seeds of 18 species were judged to be intact, that is, probably viable. There were about 7 species per sample with intact seed in the cattail zone, and 3 and 4 in the transition and sawgrass zones, respectively. In the seedling assay, seedlings of only II species were found. All II were found in the saturated soil treatment, and 7 were also found in the shallowly flooded treatment. in the seed assay, the mean total number of whole and intact seeds in the cattail zone was estimated to be 78,400 and 44,400 seeds m(-2), respectively. The mean total number of whole and intact seeds in the transition zone was much lower, 14,200 and 10,500 seeds m(-2) respectively, and in the sawgrass zone, it was slightly higher at 20,900 and 14,700 seeds m(-2), respectively. In the seedling assay, seed densities were much lower and were estimated to be only 3,700, 800, and 1,300 seeds m(-2), respectively, in the cattail, transition, and sawgrass zones. The seedling assay results suggest that only about 1.3% of the intact seed had germinated. Overall, the composition of the seed banks of the transition and sawgrass zones were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly different from that of the cattail zone. Seeds of several species were restricted primarily or exclusively to cattail-dominated areas, including seeds of Typha sp.																	0277-5212					JUN	1997	17	2					228	236		10.1007/BF03161411							WOS:A1997XG35600005

This review examines the various biotechnological strategies which may be currently employed in plant germplasm conservation Particular emphasis is given to the development of in vitro conservation techniques in genebanks which are dedicated to the storage of vegetatively propagated crop plant species. The role of biotechnology in the conservation of potato genetic resources is highlighted This crop is vegetatively propagated and cannot be easily conserved using seed banking procedures. A range of biotechnological approaches ale appraised tissue culture, slow growth, molecular biology, cryopreservation and germplasm collection. New advances in in vitro plant genetic resource management are presented and the value of fundamental research in underpining conservation biotechnology development is discussed. The importance of conservation biotechnology in supporting plant breeding programmes is addressed. The full potential of plant conservation biotechnology will only be realised through the interdisciplinary co-operation of genetic resource managers, biotechnologists and plant breeders.																	1722-6996	2035-4606				MAY-JUN	1997	8	3					24	29									WOS:A1997XQ84200006

Both species were found to have a substantial seed bank (107-1648 seeds m(-2)), comparable in size to those of arctic and alpine species. The buried seed density was not correlated with the local aboveground abundance where both species were present, although at one site where a species was absent from the vegetation it was also not found in the seed community. Antarctic seed banks have important implications for both the decline and spread of plant populations in response to a changing climate.

The role of Polytrichum mosses in the natural regeneration of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) was investigated through a comparative study of seedbed effects on seedling emergence, survival, morphology and the presence of competing vegetation. Intact monoliths of Polytrichum moss, mineral soil and undisturbed litter were collected from the forest floor of a mixed conifer stand in Central Ontario. Half of the litter seedbeds were later burned with a propane torch. Replicates of the four seedbeds (n = 24) were placed in a greenhouse and hand sown with white spruce seed. Percent effective seedling emergence was significantly higher on mineral soil than on the other three seedbeds but did not differ among moss, liner and burned litter. Seedling survival under a watering regime representative of the seedbed collection site did not differ among seedbeds. Survival of a short drought stress treatment, however, was significantly improved in mineral soil and moss as compared with the litter and burned liner seedbeds. Differential survival was related in part to the biomass of herbaceous and woody competition that developed from the seed bank and rhizomes present in the four seedbeds. Above- and below-ground biomass of competition on the litter and burned litter seedbeds were significantly higher and ten times that of mineral soil and moss seedbeds. This difference in biomass of competition was associated with lower average daily soil water potentials in the two litter seedbeds. Seedlings growing in mineral soil, and to a lesser extent burned litter, generally exhibited larger shoot, root and total dry mass and produced more robust shoots of higher mechanical strength (i.e. shoot dry mass/shoot length). Seedlings grown on moss were taller with smaller epicotyls and stem diameters, indicative of an etiolation response associated with steep light gradients in this seedbed. Seedlings grown in mineral soil and mass had higher root/shoot ratios and showed trends toward greater total root length and root branching. The ecological relationship between white spruce and Polytrichum mosses and the comparative value of Polytrichum seedbed in silvicultural systems to promote natural regeneration of white spruce are discussed.																	0378-1127					MAY	1997	92	1-3					19	28		10.1016/S0378-1127(96)03956-4							WOS:A1997XA85300003						
J	Pascarella, JB				Pascarella, JB			Hurricane disturbance and the regeneration of Lysiloma latisiliquum (Fabaceae): A tropical tree in south Florida	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Large-scale catastrophic disturbances such as hurricanes may be critical events for the regeneration of late secondary canopy tree species. The impact of Hurricane Andrew, a severe Category 4 hurricane, on the tropical tree Lysiloma latisiliquum was examined in three south Florida subtropical forests along a gradient of hurricane disturbance (high, moderate, none). The population closest to the northern eye wall of the hurricane had the highest mortality and most severe structural damage while the population near the southern eye wall of the hurricane experienced less mortality and damage. Posthurricane reproduction was least in the disturbed sites while the undisturbed site had extensive reproduction in both 1993 and 1994. Average seed production was low due to seed predation by a bruchid beetle but some populations experienced spatial and temporal escape from this seed predator. Germination from a dormant seed bank occurred only at the most severely disturbed site in 1992. Seed germination was associated with both tip-up pits and high understory light levels. in experimental trials, fluctuating heat treatments for 5 days increased seed germination. Severe hurricane disturbance is believed to have triggered germination from a dormant seed bank through strong diurnal soil temperature fluctuations resulting from extensive canopy removal. In south Florida, the temporal and spatial dynamics of both hurricane and fire disturbance are predicted jointly to influence the population dynamics of this canopy tree species.

J	Schutz, W; Milberg, P				Schutz, W; Milberg, P			Seed germination in Launaea arborescens: A continuously flowering semi-desert shrub	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Achenes (seeds) of the perennial shrub Launaea arborescens (Asteraceae) germinated under a wide range of environmental conditions. None of the seeds were dormant, nor was there any evidence that dormancy could be induced. Apparently, this semi-desert species has no means of preventing immediate germination. Achenes are produced and dispersed throughout the year, and we suggest that the timing of germination is regulated by the duration and degree of wetting and the presence of moderate soil temperatures. This germination behaviour suggests that there is no mechanism by which the germination of seeds formed one year can be delayed until subsequent years. By contrast, most desert plants accumulate persistent seed banks. The germination strategy of L. arborescens must be considered opportunistic, and we suggest that the survival of populations is ensured by other life history traits like continuous iteroparity and effective dispersal by wind.

J	Prach, K; Pysek, P; Smilauer, P				Prach, K; Pysek, P; Smilauer, P			Changes in species traits during succession: A search for pattern	OIKOS												Cover data from 13 successional seres starting on bare ground in the western part of the Czech Republic sere analysed. The following questions were addressed: (1) whether the participation of species with particular traits exhibits some trends, and (2) whether primary and secondary seres differ from each other in the course of the first 10 yr of succession. Primary seres were distinguished from secondary ones a priori on the basis of absence or presence of (a) organic topsoil, and (b) soil seed bank at the onset of succession. Traits important for the course of succession were considered, their relative importance expressed for each sere and year on the basis of species quantities, and tested for trends (increase, decrease, unimodal response, no evident trend or absence). The majority of traits considered exhibited some trends in the course of succession. Participation of C-strategists, phanerophytes, intensity of lateral spread, presence of VA mycorrhizae, dispersal by animals and wind, and height of plants significantly increased during the first 10 yr of succession, whereas the participation of R-strategists, therophytes, propagule weight, and capability of forming persistent seed bank decreased. Participation of S-strategists, geophytes, hemicryptophytes, and all relevant types of pollination did not exhibit any significant trend. Primary and secondary seres differed from each other neither in trends in life-history characteristics of constituent species nor in their relative importance after the first 10 yr of succession.

J	Lunt, ID				Lunt, ID			Germinable soil seed basks of anthropogenic native grasslands and grassy forest remnants in temperate south-eastern Australia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks of anthropogenic native grassland and grassy forest remnants on the Gippsland Plain in southeastern Australia were studied using the seedling emergence method. Intact examples of both ecosystems are rare, owing to extensive agricultural development. Both ecosystems are assumed to have been derived since European settlement from the same original, grassy forest ecosystem. It was hypothesised that species now restricted to grassland remnants might persist in the soil seed bank of forest remnants, and vice versa. This hypothesis was not supported. In total, 25 554 seedlings of at least 155 species emerged from forest and grassland seed banks collectively. Small-seeded, annual and perennial herbs were most abundant. Forest seedbanks differed substantially in composition from grassland seedbanks, and both essentially contained a subset of the species in the vegetation. Forest seedbanks contained significantly more species and individuals of annual and perennial native dicotyledons than grassland seedbanks. Seedbanks made a major contribution to local diversity, since many species in the seed bank at each quadrat were not recorded from the vegetation, but only a minor contribution to regional diversity. Species in the seedbank that were absent from all vegetation samples were recorded at few quadrats, except Juncus species; which were widespread and abundant in the seedbank. The apparent absence from forest seed banks of species that are best represented in grassland remnants (and vice versa), suggests that there is little opportunity of recruiting grassland-restricted species in forest remnants by instigating grassland management practices.																	1385-0237					MAY	1997	130	1					21	34		10.1023/A:1009780301775							WOS:A1997WX80900003

Weed biology relates to plant attributes such as morphology, seed dormancy and germination, physiology of growth, competitive ability, and reproductive biology. Concepts of population biology such as seedbank dynamics for annuals and root reserves, dormancy, and longevity of vegetative propagules for perennials can be used to predict weed infestations better and to evaluate sustainable management strategies. Integrated approaches that give priority to depletion of root reserves or seedbanks through interfering with dormancy or germination requirements have great potential to enhance weed management strategies in the future.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	1997	45	3					349	356		10.1017/S0043174500092973							WOS:A1997XG95700006

Describing, predicting, and managing weed populations requires an understanding of how weeds are distributed spatially and the consequences of this distribution for population processes. Semivariograms and kriged maps of weed populations in several fields have helped describe spatial structure, but few generalizations can be drawn except that populations are aggregated at one or more scales. Limited information is available on the effect of weed arrangement, pattern, or field location on weed population processes. Because weeds are neither regular nor uniform in distribution, mean density alone is of limited value in estimating yield loss or describing population dynamics over a whole field. Sampling strategies that account for spatial distribution can increase sampling efficiency. Further research should focus on understanding processes that cause changes in spatial distributions over time to help predict rates of invasion and potential extent of colonization.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	1997	45	3					364	373		10.1017/S0043174500092997							WOS:A1997XG95700008						
J	Bertiller, MB; Aloia, DA				Bertiller, MB; Aloia, DA			Seed bank strategies in Patagonian semi-arid grasslands in relation to their management and conservation	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												We addressed the following questions: (a) May different seed bank functional types (SBFT), defined on the basis of singularities of their persistence in soil, be identified in the Festuca pallescens grasslands? (b) Do different above-ground vegetation states modify the expression of SBFT singularities? (c) Is the potential for vegetation recovery from the soil seed bank associated with the characteristics of their SBFT? To address these questions we examined the sizes of immediately and non-immediately-germinable seed banks (IGSB and NIGSB, respectively) in four different vegetation states of the steppe of F. pallescens resulting from the combined effects of topography and grazing. The results show that four lifeforms (perennial grasses, perennial graminoid non-grasses, annual dicots and annual grasses) display three characteristic SBFT. These are: (1) a transient type constituted by perennial grasses (SBFT1), (2) an intermediate type represented by annuals (SBFT2), and (3) a persistent type characteristic of one perennial graminoid non-grass (SBFT3). Other lifeforms (perennial dicots and biennials) could not be assigned to any of these types or characterized into a definite one. Seed bank functional types do not change among vegetation states in terms of the relative proportions of IGSB and NIGSB, although differences in the absolute and the relative size of each SBFT could be found. Species with persistent or mixed persistent/non-persistent seed bank types (SBFT2, SBFT3, etc.) colonize habitats disturbed by grazing with more success than those with non-persistent seed banks (SBFT1). Species with persistent seed banks are over-represented in the soil seed bank in relation to their contribution to above-ground cover. Management strategies for conservation in these grasslands could conveniently be targeted to increase the seed rain of perennial grasses as well as to the creation of suitable micro-environmental conditions to enhance their establishment.																	0960-3115					APR	1997	6	4					639	650		10.1023/A:1018397615476							WOS:A1997WV93800011						
J	Moro, MJ; Pugnaire, FI; Haase, P; Puigdefabregas, J				Moro, MJ; Pugnaire, FI; Haase, P; Puigdefabregas, J			Mechanisms of interaction between a leguminous shrub and its understorey in a semi-arid environment	ECOGRAPHY												Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs in semi-arid environments often have a dense understorey of annual and perennial herbs forming so-called ''islands of fertility.'' The effect of the canopy on soil fertility and microclimate and the combined effect of canopy and litter on species diversity and productivity were assessed under Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs in a semi-arid environment in southeast Spain. Soil chemical properties differed significantly among three positions under the canopy, particularly between inner and outer positions. The potential mineralization rate of organic matter was significantly higher in soils from an intermediate position under the canopy than in soils from either the centre and the edge. Soil chemical fertility and estimated soil seed bank were highest also in soil at an intermediate position and lowest in soil from the edge. The understorey flora was favoured by the lower temperature and irradiation and increased soil fertility under the shrubs canopies. Species emerging from the soil seed bank separated clearly into two groups which occupied inner and outer positions under the canopy. Different levels of addition of Retaina litter significantly decreased species richness and the number of emerged seedlings. In the field, pots placed near the centre, at an intermediate position and at the edge of the canopy of Retama shrubs differed significantly in species richness and biomass production. Overall, micro-climatic conditions combined with increased chemical fertility of the soil and inhibitory effects of litter to produce a large biomass of herbs at intermediate positions between the centre and the edge of the canopy. The high proportion of litter from annual species in that position increases the mineralization rate and hence nutrient dynamics in a process which also could benefit the shrub.

J	Price, MV; Joyner, JW				Price, MV; Joyner, JW			What resources are available to desert granivores: Seed rain or soil seed bank?	ECOLOGY												Patterns of resource availability mold many ecological processes, but we know little about the availability of resources to consumers in nature, even for well-studied systems such as the granivorous animals of North American deserts. What we do know about seed resources in deserts is based primarily on seeds extracted from soil samples, but this might present a distorted view of resource availability if animals mostly harvest newly produced seeds before they enter the soil seed bank. In order to assess how large the distortion might be, we simultaneously monitored the seed bank and ''seed rain'' over a 19-mo period in the eastern Mojave Desert of California. The seed bank averaged approximate to 106 000 seeds/m(2) and 38 g/m(2), much higher than values reported for other North American desert sites. This corresponds roughly to the seed production of a single year, since daily seed rain averaged 262 seeds/m(2) and 0.26 g/m(2). However, input from the seed rain did not accumulate in the soil. Instead, the seed bank decreased by a daily average of 114 seeds/m(2) and 0.007 g/m(2) during our study. This suggests that virtually all seeds germinate, die, or are harvested by granivores soon after being dispersed. Large seeds comprised a greater fraction of the seed rain than of the seed bank, suggesting that such seeds are differentially depleted, probably by granivores, before they enter the soil. Because seed drop was seasonal, temporal variation comprised a significant component of among-sample variance in the seed rain. Temporal variance in the seed bank was much smaller, presumably because granivores harvested most of the seed rain. Conversely, spatial variance was a significant component for the seed bank, but not the seed rain, perhaps as a result of spatial patterns of seed harvest or seed caching by granivores. By virtue of these variance patterns, as well as other attributes, seeds in the soil present different challenges to granivores than do newly produced seeds. Our understanding of desert granivore foraging and community ecology, and of granivore-seed interactions, depends critically on choosing the appropriate measure of seed availability to granivores.																	0012-9658					APR	1997	78	3					764	773									WOS:A1997WU82900010						
J	Holmes, PM; Cowling, RM				Holmes, PM; Cowling, RM			The effects of invasion by Acacia saligna on the guild structure and regeneration capabilities of South African fynbos shrublands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The impact of dense stands of the alien invasive species Acacia saligna (Labill) Wendl. on the guild structure of indigenous fynbos vegetation was investigated at three sites on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Two Acacia stands of either recent (1-2 fire cycles) or longer (> 2 fire cycles) origin were compared with neighbouring uninvaded vegetation. 2. At one site fynbos recruitment was monitored following complete removal of vegetation in the three different stands in order to assess the restoration potential of invaded vegetation. 3. Fynbos species richness, cover and frequency all declined through each invasion stage in the standing vegetation. Guild structure also changed: species with vertebrate-dispersed seeds were relatively more frequent in long-invaded stands and at two of the three sites long-invaded stands had relatively more tall shrubs and fewer shrubs with leptophyllous (ericoid) leaves compared to fynbos. Serotinous shrubs were virtually absent in long-invaded stands. 4. Richness per plot of species recruited by seedlings was highest in fynbos and declined both with stage of invasion and time after clearing. However, the total stand species richness was nearly as high in recently invaded as in uninvaded fynbos. 5. Ephemeral forbs constituted the majority of seedlings in all stands, but after two years they remained the most important growth form in terms of density and cover only in the long-invaded stand. 6. At 18 months after clearing, indigenous canopy cover was about 50% in all stands, but only in uninvaded fynbos did this continue to increase over the second summer: After two years, resprouters formed about half the canopy cover in fynbos and recently invaded stands, but were insignificant in the long-invaded stand. 7. After clearing, many species recruiting in the long-invaded stand were not present in the standing vegetation, indicating that persistent seed banks exist. 8. As representatives of all the major fynbos growth forms were recruited into the long-invaded stand after clearing, albeit at a low density, such stands could revert to vegetation resembling fynbos in structure. However, in order to speed up the restoration process and to improve the probability of a fully functioning ecosystem being established, guilds which have been eliminated, such as serotinous Proteaceae, should be reintroduced.																	0021-8901					APR	1997	34	2					317	332		10.2307/2404879							WOS:A1997XB02800004						
J	Smith, MC; Reeder, RH; Thomas, MB				Smith, MC; Reeder, RH; Thomas, MB			A model to determine the potential for biological control of Rottbaellia cochinchinensis with the head smut Sporisorium ophiuri	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Itch grass Rottboellia cochinchinensis is a serious weed in the humid tropics. However, the seed bank is short-lived (approximately 3 years) and control methods that effectively prevent inputs to the seed bank should have a long-term impact on the weed. The head smut Sporisorium ophiuri, which forms systemic infections sterilizing the weed, has therefore been proposed as a potential classical biological control agent. 2. A difference equation model of the population dynamics of the weed R. cochinchinensis was developed for a maize cropping system. The model was used to estimate the constant annual infection rate by the S. ophiuri that would be necessary to provide long-term control of the weed. 3. The model suggested that with the smut as the sole control agent, an annual infection rate of about 88% would be required to reduce R. cochinchinensis density to 10% of the level achieved with no control. 4. However, when combined with one or two weedings per year, the level of infection necessary for satisfactory control could be reduced. Since the maximum infection rate achieved in experiments was about 80%, the smut is unlikely to achieve satisfactory control when used alone, but these results suggest that S. ophiuri could be a useful adjunct in integrated control programmes. 5. The extent to which the effectiveness of the smut was improved by combining it with weeding depended on the seed set in the R. cochinchinensis flush emerging after weeding and on seedling mortality, Where seed set or seedling survival were low, the required infection rate could be substantially reduced. 6. These results are discussed in the context of future prospects for biological control of R. cochinchinensis and areas for further research to improve the utility of the population dynamic model are highlighted.																	0021-8901					APR	1997	34	2					388	398		10.2307/2404884							WOS:A1997XB02800009

Density and composition of seedbanks varied according to tillage system and depth. The mouldboard plough crop had seedbanks with the lowest seed density and there was no difference in density or composition at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depth whereas no-tillage had a more dense seed bank, especially in the upper part of the soil profile. Diversity of seedbanks also increased from mouldboard plough, to disk, to chisel, to no-tillage, which had the most diverse bank. Therefore, the data strongly support the hypothesis that the systems causing less disturbance allow the build-up of a larger and more diverse soil seed bank.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				APR	1997	37	2					71	76									WOS:A1997XA57400002

A total of 763 individuals from 56 species were recorded from the surface soil samples (which covered a total area of 1 m(2)). Both species richness and density of seedlings was greater for smoke- and heat-treated samples than for controls and ash-treated samples. However, only the density differences were significant. Mean seed bank densities for the smoke and heat treatments ranged from 855+/-70 m(-2) to 1080+/-58 m(-2) and are similar to estimates obtained elsewhere in Australia for heat-treated soils from dry sclerophyll communities. Of the 56 species recorded, 46 occurred in the smoke and heat treatments but only 33 in the control and ash treatments. The sudden increase in surface soil pH, exchangeable cations and extractable phosphorus which was associated with the ash treatment did not act as a trigger for germination in any of the species recorded here. Chemical constituents from smoke do appear to provide a stimulus separate from the effects of heat, but were not identified with any particular taxa.

Twenty-six core samples were taken in each of three disturbed marshes with sparse submerged vegetation, and the number of seeds was compared with samples from three reference marshes containing abundant submerged vegetation. Six cores from each of six marshes were examined to determine whether there was a difference between disturbed and reference marshes in seed density or seed distribution, and germination assays were used to assess differences in seed viability. Seeds of five submerged macrophyte taxa were identified in substrate samples of the six marshes. Mean seed density was significantly higher in the three reference marshes (4082 - 47 623 seeds/m(2)) than in the three disturbed marshes (0-2041 seeds/m(2)). The density of seedlings of submerged macrophytes germinating in reference marsh samples ranged from 333 to 2406 seedlings/m(2), whereas no seedlings germinated from disturbed marsh samples. The deeper sediments (7 - 14 cm sediment depth) in the reference marshes had comparable seed densities to those in the shallower sediments, whereas seeds were found in only the deeper sediments of the disturbed marshes. These data suggest that regeneration from buried seeds is unlikely in the disturbed marshes, even if improvements occur in the environmental conditions that have historically inhibited the growth of submerged macrophytes.																	0008-4026					MAR	1997	75	3					451	456		10.1139/b97-048							WOS:A1997XD78500009						
J	Ortega, M; Levassor, C; Peco, B				Ortega, M; Levassor, C; Peco, B			Seasonal dynamics of Mediterranean pasture seed banks along environmental gradients	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												The size and dynamics of seed banks were studied in grazed and ungrazed Mediterranean pastures at different altitudes and topography positions. The soil samples were collected in autumn and spring and the seed banks composition was determined by greenhouse germination over a 9-month period. The percentage of bare ground and the presence of new seedlings were recorded monthly from October to July in the field. A fall in seed density and species richness in the banks and a tendency for seeds to remain in the banks were linked to a rise in altitude. Germination in lower pastures mainly occurred in October in the numerous gaps left by the summer drought. At higher altitudes, the scarcity of gaps and the harsh climate led to an autumn-spring segregation of germination. On a local scale, the low slope positions and the ungrazed plots had a. larger number of persistent seed bank species and a lower percentage of bare ground where seeds could germinate than their respective plots in the upper positions and grazed plots. A higher seed density in ungrazed than grazed plots was only detected in the three highest plots. No seed bank species richness trend was detected. In populations of the same species in different types of environments, the seasonal variation of seed numbers was environment-dependent for the majority of the species. In general, perennial grassland and its related low gaps availability appear to favour persistent seed banks.

J	Bai, YG; Romo, JT				Bai, YG; Romo, JT			Seed production, seed rain, and the seedbank of fringed sagebrush	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Increases in fringed sagebrush (Artemisia frigida Willd,) following disturbance on Northern Mixed Prairie are due to enhanced growth of established plants and seedling recruitment, The roles of seed production and the soil seedbank in population dynamics of fringed sagebrush following disturbance are, however, unknown, Furthermore, seed rain has not been documented for this species, The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the effect of disturbances in the sward on seed production; 2) relationships between the soil seedbank and current seed production; and 3) seed rain over time for fringed sagebrush, Disturbances of clipping, litter removal, tillage, and a combination of clipping and litter removal were imposed on a sandy range site in central Saskatchewan, Following disturbance seed production plant either increased or was unchanged compared to the undisturbed control, Greater seed production resulted from increased production of seeds head(-1), heads inflorescence(-1) and inflorescences plant(-1), The timing of seed rain varied considerably among individual plants, Five temporal patterns of seed rain were identified for individual fringed sagebrush plants: 1) 5.2% of the plants began and completed dispersing seeds within 6 to 8 weeks of powering; 2) 20.8% began dispersing within 6 to 8 weeks of flowering and completed dispersal before snow was received in autumn; 3) 37.7% began dispersing seeds within 6 to 8 weeks of flowering and continued over the winter; 4) 29.9% delayed dispersal of seeds more than 8 weeks after flowering and continued over the winter; and 5) 6.5% began and completed seed dispersal during the winter, The number of fringed sagebrush seeds in the soil was correlated with seed production only when many seeds were produced (r = 0.76), indicating that annual seed production is of limited importance for maintaining a seed-bank. A persistent seedbank is important in maintaining fringed sagebrush populations when seed production is limited. Diverse rates and times of seed rain along with a persistent seedbank may enable fringed sagebrush to occupy safe sites that develop in time.																	0022-409X					MAR	1997	50	2					151	155		10.2307/4002372							WOS:A1997WM00300007						
J	Jaksic, FM; Silva, SI; Meserve, PL; Gutierrez, JR				Jaksic, FM; Silva, SI; Meserve, PL; Gutierrez, JR			A long-term study of vertebrate predator responses to an El Nino (ENSO) disturbance in western South America	OIKOS												We analyzed the putative effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) of 1991-92 in a semi-arid locality of northern Chile. We obtained 30 months of pre ENSO data, followed by 36 months of peak and post ENSO data (total = 5.5 yr). The rainy winter of 1991 resulted in a three-fold increase in total seed bank (perennial and ephemerals pooled) and in ephemeral (but not perennial) herb cover. Seed and herbage eaters (rodents) irrupted to population levels ca 20 times higher during the breeding season of 1991 than the preceding wintering season. Diurnal carnivorous predators (hawks, owls, and foxes) showed a delayed response to the irruption, increasing from seven individuals sighted during the wintering season of 1991 to 13 during the wintering season of 1992. A seemingly counterclockwise trajectory of predator abundance versus prey levels suggested a pattern of prey-driven dynamics, but confidence intervals were likely broad. In this semiarid locality, it appears that ENSO effects did not cascade down from higher to lower trophic levels, but rather the opposite. In this bottom-up scenario, we predict that as primary productivity varies with rainfall, so should secondary (mammal prey densities), and tertiary productivity (vertebrate predators). Long-term monitoring of this terrestrial ecosystem is needed to test this prediction.				jaksic, Fabian m/G-1705-2014													0030-1299					MAR	1997	78	2					341	354		10.2307/3546302							WOS:A1997WJ76900016						
J	Stevenson, MJ; Ward, LK; Pywell, RF				Stevenson, MJ; Ward, LK; Pywell, RF			Re-creating semi-natural communities: Vacuum harvesting and hand collection of seed on calcareous grassland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Agricultural set-aside and compensation land provide restoration ecologists with opportunities to re-create semi-natural habitats. Restoration sites often have high soil fertility and inadequate seed banks of desirable species. Sawing additional seed is a proven method for establishing chalk grassland vegetation. If seed of local. provenance is required, it may be collected by hand or by using specialized machines. Ultimately, the mix collected must provide seed suitable for recreating vegetation similar to that of the donor site. We examine the ability of a vacuum machine to meet this requirement by comparison with hand collection, and we discuss possible effects on invertebrates. Microscope analysis and glasshouse and field trials were used to compare the abundance of seed of different species in harvested mixes with the vegetation composition of the donor site. Seed heads of individual species were examined to determine the number of viable seeds per head and attack rates by phytophagous insects. The mix contained seed of over half the species recorded on the donor site, The seed of taller, more common species was overrepresented in the mix, at the expense of some smaller, mat-forming plants. After one season, however ever, the vegetation of the field trial plots was of the same type as that of the donor site, although the preportions of the constituent species differed slightly and certain species were absent, Mechanical collection more efficient than hand collection. Endophagous in vertebrates are unlikely to be affected by the machine Seed collection requires a combination of method precise timing, and careful planning to provide a range of species and to minimize impacts on plan and invertebrate populations.

J	Marone, L; DeCasenave, JL; Cueto, VR				Marone, L; DeCasenave, JL; Cueto, VR			Patterns of habitat selection by wintering and breeding granivorous birds in the central Monte desert, Argentina	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												We report on 6-yr patterns of habitat occupancy by wintering- and breeding-granivorous birds over two habitats in the central Monte desert, Argentina: an open forest and a shrubland, both with abundant grass cover. We examine the hypothesis that the pattern of habitat occupancy changes seasonally in a way that is consistent with the distinct habitat requirements of wintering (i.e., mostly food) and breeding birds (i.e., food but also nesting sites). The seasonal change was widely corroborated for the whole guild, which did not distinguish between habitats in winter but was significantly more abundant in the open forest in spring. Similar changes were apparent for several individual species as well. Seed availability during 1993 and 1994, measured over two mesohabitats, usually did not differ between open forest and shrubland; whereas nest-site availability (i.e., trees and tall thorny shrubs) was quite greater in the open forest. This evidence suggests that the seasonal modification of habitat occupancy here reported may reflect changes in the template of what constitutes a suitable habitat for wintering- and breeding-granivorous birds inhabiting the Monte desert.																	0716-078X					MAR	1997	70	1					73	81									WOS:A1997XA17300008						
J	GarciaFranco, JG; RicoGray, V				GarciaFranco, JG; RicoGray, V			Dispersal, viability, germination and seed bank of Bdallophyton bambusarum (Rafflesiaceae) in the coast of Veracruz, Mexico	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Seed dispersers, seed viability, germination and seed presence in the soil seed bank are unknown aspects for most holoparasitic plants. In the subdeciduous tropical forest at the CICOLMA field station in Veracruz, Mexico, seeds of Bdallophyton bambusarum Liebm. are dispersed by Peromyscus mexicanus mexicanus, and occasionally by ants (Atta sp.). Fruit is available during the time of lowest resource availability in the forest, when land crabs are abundant (Gecarcinus lateralis Frem.), butseeds are not dispersed by crabs. Seeds of B. bambusarum are present in the soil seed bank, but only near around the inflorescences (both sexes). To trigger seed germination, we applied scarification with sulfuric acid, hot and water inbivision and root exhudated contact to 40 lots of seeds (total ca. 54 200 seeds). Only eight seeds broke the seed test and they died soon afterwards. Seeds did not germinate experimentally in culture media (30 seeds lots, total cn. 19 960 seeds in mixtures of agar, agar-potato-dextrose, and root extracts with and without the parasite), and when in direct root contact (20 lots, ca. 6 656 seeds). The two viability tests failed. Apparently germination not only requires proximity or contact with the host roots but also particular soil characteristics.

There were more individuals than would be expected by chance under the canopy of Larrea divaricata, Aphyllocladus spartioides and Prosopis ferox.

The weedy biotypes exhibit a wide range of seed colours, but the strains with the most persistent seeds are distinguished by darker seeds. This paper compares the seed biology of a range of biotypes from Canada and demonstrates that darker seeds have heavier seed coats, imbibe and germinate more slowly, and suffer less imbibition damage (measured as electrolyte leakage). It is concluded that all these attributes contribute to the increased persistence in the soil of the dark-seeded weedy biotypes. Imbibition damage is widely implicated in poor emergence and low vigour of crop seeds, but has not previously been considered in the context of weed seed persistence.																	0960-2585					MAR	1997	7	1					21	25		10.1017/S0960258500003329							WOS:A1997XC22000003						
J	Mulugeta, D; Stoltenberg, DE				Mulugeta, D; Stoltenberg, DE			Increased weed emergence and seed bank depletion by soil disturbance in a no-tillage system	WEED SCIENCE												The influence of secondary soil disturbance on the emergence pattern and seed bank depletion of an annual weed community in a long-term, no-tillage corn cropping system was determined in 1992 and 1993. As a component of this research, the seed bank was characterized prior to implementation of soil disturbance treatments. The seed bank was initially composed of common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, and giant foxtail, with approximately 55, 36, and 8% of the total viable seeds, respectively. The remaining 1% was comprised of five other species in 1992 and eight in 1993. The spatial distribution of viable seeds of each species, except common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed, was described by a negative binomial distribution. Three dispersion indices indicated that seeds of individual and total weed species were aggregated and that the level of aggregation of viable seeds of a species was associated with seed density; at lower seed densities, the level of aggregation was greater. Soil disturbance increased common lambsquarters emergence 6-fold in 1992 relative to nondisturbed soil, but did not influence emergence in 1993. Rainfall was about 50% less in 1993. In contrast, soil disturbance increased giant foxtail and redroot pigweed emergence approximately 6- and 3-fold in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Seedling emergence associated with soil disturbance, relative to nondisturbed soil, increased seed bank depletion of common lambsquarters 16-fold in 1992, and giant foxtail and redroot pigweed and average of 6- and 3-fold in 1992 and 1993, respectively. These results indicated that soil disturbance increased seedling emergence and seed bank depletion of the predominant species in the weed community of a long-term, no-tillage system, but that this response was dependent on rainfall for common lambsquarters.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	1997	45	2					234	241		10.1017/S0043174500092778							WOS:A1997WZ22200009						
J	Stauffer, AL; Brooks, RP				Stauffer, AL; Brooks, RP			Plant and soil responses to salvaged marsh surface and organic matter amendments at a created wetland in central Pennsylvania	WETLANDS												To evaluate the efficiency of different methods of wetland plant establishment and different soil amendments, 16 experimental plots in 4 treatment groups were established at a 6-ha created palustrine wetland in Tipton, PA. Response of vegetation, soil, and hydrology were evaluated. The first objective of the study was to determine if salvaged marsh surface (SMS) from a donor wetland can be used to effectivly vegetate experimental plots. The results were compared with control plots. In addition, the possibility of using a non-toxic organic waste (leaf litter compost) as a soil amendment to created wetland projects was examined. Lurid sedge (Carer lurida) tubers were hand-planted in the leaf litter plots and in the existing mineral soils of the remaining experimental plots. SMS plots had significantly greater plant species richness, total vegetative coverage, and diversity than control plots. SMS plots contained more hydrophytic vegetation and less undesirable vegetation than control plots. SMS added significant amounts of organic matter and soil nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) to the soils in treated plots. Survivorship of hand-planted Carer was greater (79.0 +/- 5.0 % for both July and August 1992) on plots treated with leaf litter compost than on plots with existing mineral soils (45.0 +/- 20.0% in July and 38.0 +/- 20.0 % in August 1992). Organic matter, pH, total N, and NO, levels were all significantly greater on leaf litter plots than on hand-planted plots after the 1991 growing season. At the end of the 1992 growing season, organic matter, pH, NO3, and NH4 levels were significantly greater on leaf litter plots than on hand-planted plots. The results of the study suggest that SMS can be used as a method to successfully revegetate created wetlands. Also, the addition of leaf litter compost to experimental plots helped to retain soil moisture and provide nutrients that enhanced survivorship of hand-planted Carex.																	0277-5212					MAR	1997	17	1					90	105		10.1007/BF03160721							WOS:A1997WQ46800009

We examined three hypotheses relating to these changes: (I) thickets of fleshy-fruited plants develop around planted trees as a result of ornithochory and local soil and site amelioration, (2) woody plants have long-term effects on soil fertility, and (3) thicket development reduces the plant-species diversity of semi-dry grassland between the trees. Field observations and nursery experiments supported the first and second hypotheses. Increased soil fertility, a seed rain of fleshy-fruited shrubs, and shrub establishment occurred mainly around planted fruit trees. Soils from old tree-planting sites remained fertile after the trees had died and disappeared. The third hypothesis was rejected because no decrease in species' richness or diversity occurred during the initial stages of thicket formation. Nevertheless, herbaceous plant species characteristic of the Festuco-Brometea community were absent from the vegetation and seed bank of shaded, nutrient-enriched sites. Conservation of semi-dry grasslands following orchard abandonment will therefore require active control of woody plants.

J	Kotanen, PM				Kotanen, PM			Effects of gap area and shape on recolonization by grassland plants with differing reproductive strategies	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Species with poor dispersal ability initially should be slower to colonize larger or rounder gaps than smaller or less circular gaps. Conversely, dispersive and seed-banking species should be less sensitive than poor dispersers to gap size and shape, and less confined near the edges of a gap. I tested these ideas with a 3-year experiment in which I monitored the revegetation of gaps in grassland vegetation. Initially, species reproducing largely by clonal growth (bulbs and perennial graminoids) were the most sensitive to gap size and (to a lesser extent) shape, reaching their greatest abundances in small and (or) rectangular openings. Species relying on seed dispersal (annual grasses) also tended to do best in smaller plots, but were less concentrated near the edges of the plots. Species relying on seed dormancy (dicots and Juncus bufonius) were least sensitive to plot size, shape, and distance from an edge. In subsequent years, these patterns often were obscured or reversed, reflecting continuing seed immigration and environmental and competitive conditions within gaps. These results indicate that species respond to gap size and shape in ways consistent with their reproductive biologies, and suggest that the importance of the dimensions of gaps may vary among plant communities.

J	Pagnotta, MA; Snaydon, RW; Cocks, PS				Pagnotta, MA; Snaydon, RW; Cocks, PS			The effects of environmental factors on components and attributes of a Mediterranean grassland	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The associations of six environmental factors with vegetative attributes on a species-rich Syrian grassland were investigated during 2 years with contrasting climatic conditions using an unreplicated factorial experiment. The six factors were (i) phosphate supply (nil or 25 kg ha(-1) P2O5); (ii) grazing severity (0.8 or 1.7 sheep ha(-1)); (iii) pre-existing growth conditions as defined by initial biomass (low or high); (iv) preexisting stone cover (low or high); (v) final stone cover, modified by the addition or removal of stone to 20% or 80% stone cover; and (vi) experimental protection or non-protection from grazing. 2. 127 species were present, 56 of which were legumes, 21 grasses and 50 other species. The most common species were Trifolium campestre, T. tomentosum, T. stellatum and several species of Bromus and Avena. Overall, the frequency of only a minority of species was changed by environmental differences. 3. Initial growth conditions (as measured by initial biomass) most affected subsequent performance, although the effect was less marked in the second year. Pre-existing stone cover also resulted in large differences in subsequent growth, greater stone cover reducing growth, probably because it was associated with shallow soil and low soil fertility. Experimental addition of stones increased biomass, probably because the stones protected the vegetation from grazing. Individual species differed in their response to both pre-existing and added stone cover, the most frequent species being the most affected. High stocking rate reduced the biomass of most species, and application of P2O5 increased it. Protection from grazing increased plant cover but individual species differed in their response. An abundance of stones was not necessarily harmful, and some species were favoured by their presence. 4. It is concluded that Mediterranean grasslands are less fragile than they appear since they have mechanisms that buffer them from environmental change, These mechanisms include the presence of a long-lived seed bank and certain adaptations such as the production of abundant small seeds and early flowering, but continued over-grazing clearly results in degradation.

The soil seed bank and the seedling recruitment of the weed vegetation were monitored over 9 years at two fixed plots (a shallowly ploughed plot and a deeply ploughed plot) within a regular three-course crop rotation without chemical weed control at Dijon (France). 2. The composition of the soil seed bank and weed seedling floras were compared qualitatively (Jaccard's index), quantitatively (Steinhaus's index) and in dominance (Kendall correlation coefficient) using three indices of 'similarity'. 3. Over time, the seed bank density increased fivefold on the shallowly ploughed plot and twofold on the deeply ploughed plot. Meanwhile the seedling density increased fourfold on the shallowly ploughed plot and threefold on the deeply ploughed plot. However, seedlings accounted for only a small fraction of the seeds present: from 9.0 to 28.1% of the viable seeds, depending on the years. 4. At the community level, a close correspondence was found between the annual species composition of the seed bank and the associated seedling vegetation (Jaccard's index: mean value 0.71, Steinhaus's index: mean value 0.68 and Kendall correlation coefficient: mean value 0.60). 5. Generally, the similarity between seed bank and seedling assemblage increased over time, with more or less variability according to the year.

J	Simovich, MA; Hathaway, SA				Simovich, MA; Hathaway, SA			Diversified bet-hedging as a reproductive strategy of some ephemeral pool anostracans (Branchiopoda)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												In California, most anostracan crustaceans inhabit ephemeral wetlands, such as vernal peels, mountain meadows, and desert playas with biphasic wet/dry cycles. The shrimps hatch and mature during the aquatic phase and deposit dormant cysts which remain in the soil through the dry phase. In some habitats, due to the variable nature of local rainfall patterns, pools at times fill only partially and dry quickly before the shrimp are able to mature and reproduce. Species in such unpredictable environments produce cysts that do not all hatch when first hydrated. A portion remain dormant and hatch in later pool fillings. We investigated the hatching pattern of two newly described species of anostracans found in unpredictable vernal pools in southern California, U.S.A., Branchinecta sandiegonensis Fugate and Streptocephalus woottoni Eng et al. Hatching rates for these species were among the lowest yet reported for anostracans. Initial hatch from the soil cyst bank was 6% for B. sandiegonensis and 0.18% for S. woottani and cumulative totals were 28% and 2.8%, respectively, over 3 hydrations. Furthermore, hatching variability was demonstrated for the cysts of single pairs. This life-history pattern conforms to the 3 major predictions of models of diversified risk-spreading or bet-hedging strategies as developed for annual plants.																	0278-0372					FEB	1997	17	1					38	44		10.2307/1549460							WOS:A1997WH61800007						
J	VivianSmith, G				VivianSmith, G			Microtopographic heterogeneity and floristic diversity in experimental wetland communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Coexistence is thought to be facilitated in heterogeneous environments due to interspecific differences in habitat preference. Microtopographic heterogeneity is a major factor structuring natural freshwater wetland communities and is thought to influence diversity. I tested whether interspecific differences existed in habitat preference for different microtopographic positions and whether diversity was associated with small-scale spatial microtopographic heterogeneity in experimental wetland communities. 2 I manipulated microtopographic heterogeneity to produce 'homogeneous' (flat surface) and 'heterogeneous' (hummock-hollow) treatments. Three propagule source treatments (seed bank, seeds, seed bank + seeds) were incorporated to determine if responses to heterogeneity depended on the propagule source. Habitat preferences for microhabitats within heterogeneous treatments were determined for each species by recording the number of individuals located on 'hummocks' or in 'hollows'. Responses to heterogeneity and propagule source were quantified by measuring richness, evenness, species abundances and above-ground biomass, 3 Small-scale variability in microtopography, on the order of 1-3 cm, produced highly significant differences in plant community structure. Both components of floristic diversity, species richness and evenness, were consistently greater in communities with heterogeneous microtopography. 4 Community composition, abundance of individuals and above-ground biomass responded differentially to heterogeneity and propagule source. Most species reached greater abundances in heterogeneous environments than homogeneous environments; however, species that were similarly abundant in both included Eleocharis ovata, Alisma triviale and Sparganium americanum. 5 Most species growing within the heterogeneous environments showed distinct habitat preferences for hummock or hollow microhabitats, with many rarer species, particularly woody perennials, favouring hummocks.																	0022-0477					FEB	1997	85	1					71	82		10.2307/2960628							WOS:A1997WQ18800006

Although both richness and species composition of the plant community at the study site were largely determined by abiotic factors (mainly rainfall and soil nutrients), predator and herbivore exclusion had significant effects on the relative abundance of several plant species. Experimental exclusion of herbivores was associated with increased cover of some shrubs and a perennial grass, and decreased cover and seed densities of several ephemerals, especially those exotic or restricted to areas underneath shrubs. Herbivores apparently reduced shrubs through browsing and indirectly affected herb cover and seed densities by opening up areas under shrubs and/or modifying physical and chemical conditions of the soil. Plant responses to predator exclusion were less clear. Nevertheless, higher cover of some shrubs and ephemerals in the presence of predators suggests tritrophic effects through changes in small mammal densities and/or foraging behavior.				jaksic, Fabian m/G-1705-2014													0029-8549					FEB	1997	109	3					398	406		10.1007/s004420050099							WOS:A1997WJ88400010	28307537

It stimulated the germination of high numbers of Striga seeds. However, no immediate effect of a single Sudan grass catch-crop on Striga populations in the following growth period was detected. Competition with Sudan grass for 50 days reduced maize yields considerably while 30 days did not affect yield. Inorganic fertiliser generally increased maize yields but high N rates (100 kg ha(-1)) rarely resulted in superior maize performance due to Striga competition and drought. A combined food-crop catch-crop system seems feasible under low-input conditions but the management of Sudan grass in intercropping systems and its direct effect on Striga infestation and the Striga seed bank in the soil needs further investigation.																	0955-1506		1-901396-45-2				1997							227	232									WOS:000071437600033

The resistant biotypes of P. minor require an 8-18 times higher dose of isoproturon for the same level of control to that of the susceptible biotypes. Consequently, the higher dose is phytotoxic to wheat and results in a 30-80 % reduction in yield and complete crop failure under heavy infestations. The physiological and biochemical basis of resistance is a consequence of enhanced metabolic degradation of isoproturon in resistant species. Recommendations for weed management include crop rotations which include competitive crops, herbicide rotations and introducing alternative herbicides such as chlorotoluron and other graminicides e.g. tralkoxydim. The integration of agronomic practices, including manipulating the seed bank reserves of P. minor, are also discussed in relation to minimising the impact of isoproturon-resistant P. minor in wheat production.																	0955-1506		1-901396-45-2				1997							357	362									WOS:000071437600050

A stochastic, spatial weed population dynamics model is used to derive an empirical relationship between the observed proportion of weed presence (POP) and seed bank density. POP is treated as a continuous spatial function and estimated at each point in the field. The estimation procedure takes account of the spatial scale of variation in the presence/absence data, which is assessed using a 2-dimensional discrete Fourier transform technique.																	0955-1506		1-901396-45-2				1997							621	624									WOS:000071437600086

However, we believe that early spring may be another bottleneck for food availability for granivorous birds. During March 1996 and 1997 we collected nearly 300 0.25m(2) by 1 cm deep soil samples from arable and set-aside fields on 16 sites across southern and eastern England to assess availability of seeds to birds. Total seed numbers varied by site (P<0.001), year (P<0.002) and crop type (P=0.067). Set-aside contained more seeds than winter or spring tilled fields. Waste grain densities were low in all field types and were found in only 7.8% of samples. Our data suggest that the seed bank available in arable fields during spring is insufficient to maintain adequate food resources for pheasants and other granivorous birds, but that set-aside, although extremely variable, might help mitigate these problems if managed carefully.

A study was carried out an selected plots of the :TALISMAN experiment to assess the effects of different rotations and herbicide inputs on the seed bank and weed nora. Higher seed densities were recorded on different rotations at Boxworth and High Mowthorpe. Within rotations higher seed densities were recorded at lower herbicide rates. Weight of seeds did not correspond to differences in seed densities. Vegetation assessments at Boxworth and Drayton were generally higher on the alternative rotation and low herbicide inputs, but results were more variable at High Mowthorpe. These results are discussed in relation to the availability of food for birds during autumn and winter.																	0955-1506		1-901396-45-2				1997							1161	1166									WOS:000071437600179						
J	Teketay, D				Teketay, D			The impact of clearing and conversion of dry Afromontane forests into arable land on the composition and density of soil seed banks	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The soil seed bank was sampled in forest, recent gaps and arable land at a site within the dry Afromontane forest belt in eastern Ethiopia. The regeneration in the gaps was also followed for three years. At least 132 species of flowering plants were identified in the 0-3 cm soil layer with total densities ranging between 9400 and 20740 seeds/m(2). The highest number of species was recorded from the forest while the highest seed density was found in the arable land. Herbs were represented by the largest numbers of species and seeds in the seed bank in all three sampling areas. In all cases, the seed bank was dominated by a few species, reflecting differences in seed longevity and movement of seeds in the soil. Contribution of woody species to the soil seed bank was 15% in the forest while it was less than 1% in gaps and arable land. Seed density and number of species decreased with increasing depth, although species differed in the depth distribution of their seeds. The gaps were colonized by dense vegetation within three years by herbaceous species originating from the soil seed bank and newly dispersed seeds as well as by woody species sprouting from stumps and/or from pre-existing seedlings. However, if clearing of forests is followed by permanent cultivation which is typically the case, almost all of the woody and a part of the herbaceous components of the forest soil seed bank diminish through time and are largely replaced by a new set of herbaceous species. Regeneration of woody species by sprouting is also prevented by the complete removal of stumps from the arable land. This implies that natural regeneration of dry Afromontane forest areas converted into permanent arable land will be very difficult if the adjacent parches of forests are completely removed.																	1146-609X						1997	18	5					557	573		10.1016/S1146-609X(97)80041-0							WOS:A1997YJ17200004						
J	Falinska, K				Falinska, K			Life history variation in Cirsium palustre and its consequences for the population demography in vegetation succession	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The objective of the study was to describe the rife-history pattern of the biennial species Cirsium palustre. It has been demonstrated that under optimum conditions in the greenhouse individuals live 1.5 to 2 years, in a mown meadow 2 to 3 years, and during the plant succession in abandoned meadows they prolong their life to several years. This is accompanied by a gradual decrease of C. palustre population size. A relationship between the life-history pattern differences during a plant succession and the population abundance dynamics has been found. Reproductive-phase age is correlated with the rosette size. In spite of the occurrence of many limiting factors during a succession (closed plant cover, shading by macroforbs, willows) C. palustre survives until the formation of forest communities. Its persistence is favoured by: protracted life history, attainment the reproductive phase at different ages (not only in the second year), formation of a permanent seed bank, airborne seeds and the emergence and survival of seedlings under the canopy of several-year old rosettes during a strong competition. The arresting of juvenile individuals under the rosettes for several years has been termed the ''rosette mechanism''. Cirsium palustre can be included among facultative biennials. In every conditions a proportion of individuals in a population attain the flowering phase in life year 2. During a succession the proportions of ''triennial'' and ''quadriennial'' forms, and at the terminal stage - of perennial monocarpic forms increase.																	0001-6977						1997	66	2					207	220									WOS:A1997XP76300013

The aim of the experiment was to study the effect of nitrogen and choice of cultivar on sod production and sod quality on peat bogs. The N fertilization rates were 50, 100 and 150 kg ha(-1). The Poa pratensis cultivars were 'Conni', 'Cynthia', 'Haga' and 'Julia', the Festuca rubra cultivars were 'Center', 'Juliska', 'Koket' and 'Napsa' and the Agrostis capillaris cultivar was 'Rasti'. Two mixtures of P. pratensis/F. rubra and one of A. capillaris/F. rubra imitated commercial sod products. Increasing of N fertilization from 50 kg up to 150 kg ha(-1) a had positive effect on general the quality of sod as well as on the green cover before and after transplanting. It increased the thatch formation. The positive effect of N on the number of tillers and green cover in the year following transplanting was dependent on the species and the cultivar. Species and cultivar affected all measured variables excluding thatch formation. Generally, the P. pratensis cultivars tested suited better for sod production than cultivars of F. rubra, but there were clear differences between cultivars within species as well. Although the soil was infertile, the contents of Ca, K, Mg, P, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Zn in the herbage samples were within normal range. The botanical purity was high, which supports the hypothesis that the absence of seed bank of weeds on peat bogs immediately after harvesting the peat can be utilized.																	1239-0992						1997	6	3					269	281		10.23986/afsci.72790							WOS:A1997YH38200007

At the time of normal maturity in September, 45-85% of A. luciae-brauniae achenes germinated in light and 0-22% germinated in darkness at 12/12 h daily thermoperiods of 15/6, 20/10, 25/15, 30/15 and 35/20 C. In contrast, at the time of normal maturity in October, 0-53% of A. altissima achenes germinated in light, and 0% germinated in darkness over the same range of thermoperiods. After 12 wk of cold stratification in light at 5 C, 96-100% and 97-100% of the achenes of A. luciae-brauniae germinated in light and darkness, respectively, over the range of the thermoperiods, and after stratification in darkness, 73-100% and 34-92% germinated in light and darkness, respectively After 12 wk of cold stratification in light at 5 C, 64-99% and 22-73% of the achenes of A. altissima germinated in light and darkness, respectively over the range of the thermoperiods, and after stratification in darkness, 55-99% and 1-13% germinated in light and darkness, respectively. Peak germination of A. luciae-brauniae achenes sown in a greenhouse at near-natural temperatures in early October 1987 occurred in late October 1987, whereas peak germination of A. altissima achenes sown in late October 1994 occurred in mid-March 1995. Germination characteristics do not explain why A. luciae-brauniae is an endemic or why A. altissima is widespread. However, they do suggest why achenes of A. luciae-brauniae could germinate in rockhouses in autumn and why those of A. altissima do not germinate until spring.																	0003-0031					JAN	1997	137	1					1	12		10.2307/2426750							WOS:A1997WH05200001

Abundances and spatial distributions of seeds in the soil and of adult plants were quantified in three sites burned 1 or 2 yr before data collection, and in five sites unburned for at least 40 yr. Median density of germinants from soil samples was 20 seeds/m(2), with 10 taxa represented. Seed bank densities were not different between recently burned and long unburned sites. Percent cover of grasses and sedges did not differ between burned and long unburned sites, but stem densities of dicotyledonous herbaceous plants were lower in long unburned sites. The soil seed bank in sand pine scrub has three components, based on patterns of seed and conspecific adult occurrence in samples-monocotyledonous perennials with both seeds and adults present, ''weedy'' species with only seeds present, and species with poor seed dispersal with only seeds present.																	0003-0031					JAN	1997	137	1					39	47		10.2307/2426753							WOS:A1997WH05200004

Altogether 61 different vascular plant species germinated from soil samples from the five linear habitats, while only 16 species germinated from the agricultural fields. The low species number and low seed densities in the fields probably reflect modern weed management. Each linear habitat contained more or less specific subsets of plant species. The relative abundance of the different species exhibited an approximately log-normal distribution. Species composition in the seed banks of the linear habitats was compared with the aboveground vegetation. The seed bank had a higher frequency of annual species than the vegetation. Surveys restricted to the aboveground vegetation will tend to underestimate the number of species present by 15-30%.																	0003-3847						1997	34	2					77	90									WOS:A1997XG43300001						
J	Gibberd, MR; Cocks, PS				Gibberd, MR; Cocks, PS			Effect of waterlogging and soil pH on the micro-distribution of naturalised annual legumes	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Variation in the size and composition of the soil seed bank of 3 naturalised legumes, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.), woolly clover (T. tomentosum L.), and cluster clover (T. glomeratum L.), was related to soil characteristics on a transect that ascended from a winter waterlogged area in a wheatbelt pasture. Growth of the 3 species was compared with other species from section Vesicaria (T. resupinatum and T. clusii) in waterlogged and freely drained pots for 34 days. Of the 3 naturalised legumes present in the transect, cluster clover was rare, and woolly and subterranean clovers were separated on the basis of their response to soil pH and the likelihood of winter waterlogging. Subterranean clover was absent from soil with pH > 7 . 0; these areas were dominated by woolly clover. Areas with pH < 7 . 0 were dominated by subterranean clover, except where winter waterlogging was likely, in which case they were once again dominated by woolly clover. The waterlogging tolerance of woolly clover, together with that of other species in section Vesicaria, was confirmed in the pot experiment. After 34 days, shoot drg weight of the waterlogged Vesicaria species was an average of 39% greater than the beery drained controls. Root length continued to increase for the duration of the waterlogging treatment with much of the new root growth as laterals. Conversely, shoot and root growth in subterranean and cluster clovers was severely reduced by waterlogging. The patchy distribution of woolly clover in many wheatbelt pastures can be explained by its response to high pH and winter waterlogging compared with subterranean clover.																	0004-9409						1997	48	2					223	229		10.1071/A96074							WOS:A1997WH45200011						
J	Heap, JW				Heap, JW			Biology and control of Reseda lutea L .1. Seed biology and seedling growth	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Reseda lutea L. is a major perennial weed of alkaline cropping soils in South Australia. Seed biology and early seedling growth of R. lutea. were studied in field and laboratory experiments to gain information needed for effective control strategies. Recovery of intact seeds buried for 4 years in the field at 50 and 150 mm was 77-96%. Germination of this seed was 33-63% (50 mm) and 0% (150 mm). Germination patterns differed markedly between seed collected from 2 populations. Seed germinated at all constant and fluctuating temperatures between 10 and 35 degrees C with the maximum (88%) at 25 degrees C constant. Mean temperature, rather than constancy or fluctuation, determined the germination rate. Light strongly inhibited germination. Seedling shoot growth was slow but tap root growth was rapid, reaching 350 mm within 28 days of emergence. Secondary roots arose 3-7 days after emergence and shoot buds formed on the roots within 28 days. R. lutea was found to be well adapted for persistence in cultivated fields with a temperate climate.																	0004-9409						1997	48	4					511	515		10.1071/A96107							WOS:A1997WW29600014

With the discovery of smoke-mediated germination, it is now possible to better understand the heterogeneity in germination patterns for a wide range of species both in situ and ex situ. In the present study, over 180 species were examined as to viability and smoke responsiveness of freshly collected seed. Soil storage and a number of commonly used seed pre-treatments were employed in combination with smoke to examine both longevity in artificially constructed seed banks, and the role of seed ageing in improved germination. Methods of smoke application for commercial use were also investigated. Viability decline over 1 year varied between 10% and 80%. Reductions of as little as 15% were found to compromise the ability of a number of species to successfully recruit in consecutive seasons. When fresh seed was used, almost 70% of species tested responded positively to smoke whether applied prior to or after sowing. Variation in success between the two methods confirmed earlier conclusions that substances contained in plant-derived smoke may be inhibitory at high concentrations for particularly sensitive species. Only 10% of species under investigation recorded optimum germination with seed ageing alone but when smoke was applied as a treatment after soil storage, 60% of species responded positively. Implications for horticulture, rehabilitation, seed bank research and habitat management are discussed.

Fresh seeds were innately dormant. Highest germination of non-dormant seeds occurred in the light at a temperature regime of approximately 35/25 degrees C. The results of field experiments indicated that there was no strongly seasonal effect on germination. Predators, such as ants, removed <20% seeds, thereby suggesting that post-dispersal seed predation is relatively unimportant in the dynamics of H. gramineum populations. Seeds that escape predation and that fail to germinate after dispersal may be incorporated into a persistent soil seed bank.																	0067-1924						1997	45	6					1009	1022		10.1071/BT96074							WOS:000072050200005						
J	Navie, SC; Rogers, RW				Navie, SC; Rogers, RW			The relationship between attributes of plants represented in the germinable seed bank and stocking pressure in a semi-arid subtropical rangeland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A range of diaspore and mature plant attributes of the species represented in the germinable seed bank of a semi-arid subtropical Queensland sheep rangeland was investigated. The attributes of both the diaspores themselves and the plants that produced them changed as distance from water increased. Close to the water source, species with prostrate or erect growth habit and with low palatability and capsular fruits were common, whereas further from the water source plants with ascending growth habits, high palatability and mericarpic fruits were more frequent. At close proximity to water, species with diaspores that germinated rapidly, were unornamented, with unassisted dispersal and rounded in shape were common, whereas at greater distance from water, species tended to possess diaspores which germinated slowly, were ornamented (possessed awns, barbs, or hairs), with an elongated shape. Longevity of the plants (annual or perennial) was not significantly affected by distance from water. The dormant, vegetative and reproductive phases of plants that are successfully incorporated into the germinable soil seed bank can, therefore, be related to success under the different stocking intensities present at different distances from water.																	0067-1924						1997	45	6					1055	1071		10.1071/BT96067							WOS:000072050200009

Two were var. yanninicum (Trikkala and Larisa) and 4 were var. subterraneum (Denmark, Goulburn, Karridale and Leura). Seed was sampled in late summer-early autumn 1993, between 6 and 10 years after the sites were established and between 3 and 7 years after the sites were abandoned. The collected seed was separated into black and white seed, and a sample of the black seed was grown in a glasshouse and identified as either belonging to the sown cultivar or belonging to another cultivar/genotype. All white seed was assumed to belong to the sown cultivar. The aim was to determine if these widely used cultivars were persisting under farm management conditions and competition from perennial grass, other subterranean clover and annual weeds. With some variation between sites all cultivars were found to be persisting satisfactorily. Over the 3 sites, white-seeded cultivars averaged 460 kg/ha and 6640 seeds/m(2); black-seeded cultivars averaged 260 kg/ha and 5590 seeds/m(2). Contamination with other subterranean clover cultivars/ecotypes was generally low, except at Macarthur where the white-seeded cultivars were heavily contaminated (Trikkala 39% pure; Larisa 57% pure) with black seeds highlighting the poor adaptation of var. yanninicum to light soil types. Of the black seeds, over the 3 sites, average contamination level was 13% and ranged from 41% (Goulburn at Macarthur) to 1% (Leura at Timboon). The study indicates that in south-western Victoria, all the recently released cultivars are likely to persist and be productive, and that the small-plot evaluation techniques used to identify potential new cultivars are likely to be adequate if replicated in space and if the clovers are sown in mixed swards with perennial grass.																	0816-1089						1997	37	5					531	536		10.1071/EA97012							WOS:A1997XU36700005						
J	Jones, R; Medd, R				Jones, R; Medd, R			Economic analysis of integrated management of wild oats involving fallow, herbicide and crop rotational options	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												The primary objective of this study was to estimate the economic benefits associated with an integrated weed management approach for wild oats (Avena fatua and A. ludoviciana) in northern New South Wales involving chemical and non-chemical controls. The paper presents a framework for assessing the population dynamics of wild oats and the economics of a range of control options over 15 years. Wild oats is a weed primarily of winter crops which, as a consequence of its persistence and its impact upon yields, leads to significant economic losses in the grain growing regions of Australia. In this study, a dynamic programming model is developed to examine the impact of a range of management strategies for the control of wild oats in wheat. The strategies evaluated include conventional herbicide control to reduce weed densities, the use of selective herbicides to reduce seed set of the weed, and summer crop and winter fallow rotational options which provide a break in the cereal cycle and allow accelerated control of wild oat populations. The hypothesis for the study, that strategies which involve measures that directly reduce seed production and minimise wild oats seed bank populations will yield the greatest economic benefit, is acceptable based on the findings of the study. The work also shows that a dynamic programming model provides a means of determining the optimal combination of strategies over time for various initial values of the seed bank. The methodology is considered to have general application as a framework for evaluating the economics of weed control problems in annual cropping systems.																	0816-1089						1997	37	6					683	691		10.1071/EA97036							WOS:A1997YB43500010

Electron paramagnetic resonance spin label studies revealed extensive membrane damage in the aged, nonviable seeds. In contrast, Fourier self-deconvolved infrared spectra of the proteins in these embryos did not reveal changes in relative peak height and band position of the different protein secondary structures with ageing. Extended beta-sheet structures typical of protein denaturation were also not observed. We conclude that in spite of the loss of membrane integrity with seed ageing the protein secondary structure in desiccation tolerant (orthodox) dry seeds is maintained during several decades of open storage.																			0-7923-4363-8				1997	30						787	796									WOS:A1997BH23T00087						
J	Daniels, RE; Raybould, AF; Farkas, JM				Daniels, RE; Raybould, AF; Farkas, JM			Conserving genetic variation in British populations of Lobelia urens	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Conservation of genetic variation in a species which occurs as a few disjunct populations poses particular problems related to both the separation of those populations and their size. Lobelia urens is rare in Britain and occurs in only six widely separated populations. The distribution of genetic variation within and among these populations was examined using enzyme electrophoresis. The results showed that much of the variation was held among populations (G(ST) = 0.265) and that gene flow among populations was low. The populations therefore require conservation as independent units. No link was found between geographical distance and genetic distance, adding weight to the theory that the British populations were established independently. Evidence was found that the smaller, unmanaged, populations contained less variation, although all had passed through a series of bottlenecks during the past 50 years. As surrounding vegetation becomes more dense, fewer individuals contribute to variation in population size and it is suggested that periodic disturbance should be used as a management tool in order to release variation accumulated in the seed bank and so prevent depletion of genetic diversity.

J	Schott, GW; Hamburg, SP				Schott, GW; Hamburg, SP			The seed rain and seed bank of an adjacent native tallgrass prairie and old field	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The ability of a grassland to regenerate following disturbance depends on the presence of seeds:of native plants and the ability of the seeds to germinate. To examine whether the presence or absence of plant propagules influences reestablishment of tallgrass prairie on abandoned agricultural lands, we sampled the seed rain and soil seed bank across a transition from native tallgrass prairie to unmanaged successional grassland (old field). The native prairie seed rain was seven times greater than that of the old field, richer in species (33 vs. 27), and more diverse (diversity index 0.96 vs. 0.73). In addition, the native tallgrass prairie seed bank was three times as dense as the old-field seed bank and contained the seeds of more species (23 vs. 19), but had a lower index than did the old field (0.81 vs. 1.08). One species, Sphenopholis obtusata, present in the prairie, was observed dispersing to the old-field plot, but was absent in the old-field plot; this observation suggests that at least some species are unable to establish on the old-field plot. Thus, the ability of a native grassland to reestablish may be limited by the dispersal ability of native species and the ability to establish once dispersed.																	0008-4026					JAN	1997	75	1					1	7		10.1139/b97-001							WOS:A1997XD78300001						
J	Sans, FX; Masalles, RM				Sans, FX; Masalles, RM			Demography of the arable weed Diplotaxis erucoides in central Catalonia, Spain	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The demographic performance of a Mediterranean annual arable weed (Diplotaxis erucoides) related to both environmental conditions and disturbance was studied in an agricultural system disturbed by ploughing at various times in the year. Comparative analysis of survival curves reveals that mortality rates are dependent on a variety of environmental conditions, namely competition with neighbouring plants, frost, and availability of water resources. The demographic response of D. erucoides may vary depending upon how the unfavourableness of the environment compares with its physiological tolerance. Under environmental conditions not exceeding its physiological tolerance, D. erucoides reacts through phenotypic plasticity. However, in arable fields where periodic mechanical disturbance removed all individuals before reproduction, or unfavourable environmental conditions such as frost and drought exceeded the physiological tolerance of D. erucoides, widespread mortality occurred. Persistence then depended on high fecundity, low emergence rates, and high year-to-year seed survival. The results of our study show that different cultivation treatments will affect the persistence of D. erucoides. Long-term high-disturbance regimes could produce a progressive decrease in numbers due to drastic reduction, even the absence, of new fresh seed shed onto the field and consequently a progressive depletion of the seed bank. Similarly, low-disturbance regimes or absence of disturbance could produce a rapid decrease in numbers related to an increase of associated species and the low competitive ability of D. erucoides.

The more salt sensitive species, A. prostrata and H. jubatum, had significant (P < 0.05) density-dependent mortality. Density significantly reduced biomass production for all species, except for H. jubatum in the high-salinity treatment. Succulence in Suaeda calceoliformis shoots increased in the high-salinity treatment, but H. jubatum plants were desiccated at the time of harvest. The ash, sodium, and chloride contents of shoots increased with salinity for all species. Sodium and Cl- ion contents for all species-treatment combinations were an order of magnitude higher than that of Mg2+, Ca2+, and K. Although A. prostrata, Salicornia europaea, and Suaeda calceoliformis accumulated similar levels of Na+ in their shoots, Suaeda calceoliformis plants from the two higher densities in the low-salinity treatment accumulated twice as much total Na+ per pot than A. prostrata, and seven times more Na+ than Salicornia europaea. Based on these laboratory studies, Suaeda calceoliformis planted in densities ranging from 15 to 30 plants . 100 cm(-2) would accumulate more Na+ from saline-contaminated soils than the other species.																	0008-4026					JAN	1997	75	1					96	107		10.1139/b97-012							WOS:A1997XD78300012

This study began in 1990 with the discovery of numerous seedlings in the California populations, challenging the previous assumption that reproduction is primarily vegetative. Greenhouse plantings and seedlings in the field were monitored to try to identify environmental factors associated with germination and survival. When early results suggested that germination is facilitated by light, the study narrowed to focus on the role of light on the ecology of bensoniella. Additional work showed that seed buried in pots can remain viable for several years, and confirmed that older plants have a limited tolerance for direct sunlight. The study suggests that bensoniella may form persistent seed banks. The apparently narrow range of suitable light and moisture levels helps account for the small size and fragmentation of the populations.																			0-9656852-0-9				1997							48	55									WOS:000078270700008

Seed of F. albicaulis was freshly collected from wild populations and either examined immediately or stored for subsequent study. Seed of F. umpquaensis was obtained from accessions that had previously been stored in the seed bank at the Berry Botanic Garden. Detailed structural analyses using techniques of light and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine seeds for stage of embryonic development, size, and surface morphology. Elucidation of structural features in conjunction with information from two recent studies of an eastern relative, F. caroliniensis, facilitated development of successful germination regimens (stratification). Structural data indicated that matured disseminules from both taxa are approximately the same size, have similar surface morphology, and possess immature embryos. Embryos required long periods (7-14 weeks) of cold stratification (5 degrees C), for postdispersal development before germination occurred. The results are of significance to basic science, applied land management, and seed bank managers.																			0-9656852-0-9				1997							62	65									WOS:000078270700010

Toward that end, the Garden has operated a regional seed bank for rare and endangered plant species since 1983. The Garden is the participating institution in the Pacific Northwest of the Center for Plant Conservation. Garden staff also conduct a wide range of conservation related scientific research on rare plants, a small portion of which will be described in the context of how stored seed might be used for reintroduction. Banking seed begins with the choice of species, and proceeds through collection and transportation to the seed bank, where initial drying, cleaning and seed counting are done. It culminates when seeds are packaged and placed in frozen storage. Germination and growth trials follow. Stored seed are a means to an end-the conservation of rare and endangered plant taxa and populations in the wild. Our work is intended to offer a complementary tool to increase the chances that irreplaceable on-site efforts by land managers will succeed. The conservation value of stored seed can be realized in a variety of ways. Only if appropriate collections exist can stored seed be used to reintroduce extirpated populations or extinct species. Stored seed can also be used to augment (i.e., increase population size and growth rate) of extant populations. Reintroduction may have considerable conservation value in recovery, but is less likely to be of benefit and may even be harmful if used to mitigate and thus facilitate habitat destruction. A framework for getting the most out of reintroduction is discussed, as are several means stored seed might be used to intervene demographically.																			0-9656852-0-9				1997							105	114									WOS:000078270700017						
J	Aguiar, MR; Sala, OE				Aguiar, MR; Sala, OE			Seed distribution constrains the dynamics of the Patagonian steppe	ECOLOGY												The Patagonian steppe is formed by tussock grasses and shrubs in a bare-soil matrix (50% cover), and as in other arid and semiarid systems, vegetation is arranged in patches. Although there is a good understanding of the probabilities of seedling establishment of Bromus pictus in relation to location within these patches, these probabilities account for only a portion of the spatial dynamics of the community. The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We first evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (less than or equal to 10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analysed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bare-ground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals. Vegetation patches play an important role in modifying ecological processes in arid and semiarid communities. Our results highlight the importance of seed distribution in the formation and maintenance of these patches.

J	Kalamees, R; Zobel, M				Kalamees, R; Zobel, M			The seed bank in an Estonian calcareous grassland: Comparison of different successional stages	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA & PHYTOTAXONOMICA												Seed bank species-composition and seed-density were determined in a successional calcareous (alvar) grassland in western Estonia. Three similar study areas were chosen to compare two different successional stages: open alvar grassland and overgrown areas with young pine forest 30 to 40 years old. In both successional stages, the centre and the edge of a relatively uniform stand were examined. Fifteen soil samples (7 cm in diameter, 5 cm deep) were taken from each of twelve sampling sites. The seedling emergence method was used to estimate seeds in the soil samples. A total of 69 species were detected in the seed bank, of which 18 did not occur in the: vegetation. Eighty-nine taxa were recorded in the vegetation and of these 38 were not detected in the seed bank. Fifty-one species occurred both in the seed bank and in the vegetation. The three most abundant taxa :in the seed bank were Carer tomentosa, Linum catharticum and Planiago media, which together made up 49% of the seedlings recorded. Differences in the species compositions of seed bank samples from grassland and forest sites were negligible, although the species richness per area of the above-ground vegetation was significantly higher in the open grassland. The only species tending to be lost from forest site vegetation but still occurring in the forest soil seed bank were Arenaria serpylifolia, Cerastium fontanum and Linum cathalticum. About half of all the emerged species from all samples belonged to the transient or short-term persistent seed bank. In the grassland sites there were more species which belonged to the transient seed bank than in the forest sites, where the seed bank contained more short-term persistent type seeds. The seed density was significantly higher in forest sites and lower in grassland sites, which may be explained by the better germination conditions in well-illuminated communities. On the basis of the current study it might be assumed that the soil seed banks of overgrown alvar grasslands which include young pine forests can play a certain role in grassland restoration management.

J	Kellman, M; Meave, J				Kellman, M; Meave, J			Fire in the tropical gallery forests of Belize	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Historical records of burning, field observations, and a manipulation experiment were used to evaluate the extent and impact of fire in a system of gallery forests in the Mountain Pine Ridge savanna, Belize. The outer boundaries of gallery forests are fire-prone zones, but fires rarely intrude into these forests. This is attributed to the existence of fire-tolerant trees in the outer zone, which preserve a forest interior of low flammability. Occasional fire incursions are patchily distributed and partially inhibited by slope convexities. Intrusions consume litter and root mats and destroy seedlings and saplings, but create a wide variety of subsequent light regimes depending upon the degree of canopy destruction. At most sites, partial canopy cover persists and seedlings of a subset of forest tree species establish preferentially. Early survivorship of these seedlings is comparable to those established in undamaged forest. Where canopy opening is severe, a secondary succession is initiated, with large numbers of herbaceous plants deriving from the seed bank. Gallery forests contain core zones into which fire very rarely intrudes, and peripheral zones that experience fire incursions that are patchily distributed in space and time. In the latter zones fire incursions play a role comparable to that of canopy gaps in continuous forests, but also create a unique class of micro-habitats to which a subset of tree species is specialized. The fire regime over the recent past in this gallery forest system appears to have had an enriching, rather than a depauperizing, effect on the forest communities, and such systems represent plausible refugia for forest species in fire-prone landscapes.

Physiologists have focused on understanding the mechanisms involved in seed dormancy induction and release. Agronomists have found seed dormancy to be problematic since it is related to the development of persistent weed seed banks and to the problems in predicting establishment of weed stands. If the crop seed has dormancy, its germination is restricted to a very narrow range of micro-environmental conditions. In this paper, we discuss bow seed dormancy and the knowledge of its nature could be used to improve agronomic practices for grain and forage production. Crops selected to have dormant seeds, or artificially generated dormant seeds, could be sown at any time. When seedling establishment is desired, seed dormancy level could be lowered to produce synchronic germination and seedling emergence by modifying the environment, (i.e., changing the light and thermal environment of the seeds) so that physiological changes could occur and trigger germination. Seed germination could be naturally induced by seasonal changes or artificially induced by sonication. Selecting crops with dormant seeds during ripening and storage could also prevent seeds from germinating in moist environments. Artificially induced seed dormancy could be achieved by spraying hormones or oils. With adequate knowledge about the seed dormancy characteristics of plant populations, environmental situations can be engineered to encourage release from seed dormancy, to promote or inhibit certain species in weed and range management.																	0890-8524					JAN-MAR	1997	10	1					111	117		10.2134/jpa1997.0111							WOS:A1997WQ39800012						
J	Eriksson, A; Eriksson, O				Eriksson, A; Eriksson, O			Seedling recruitment in semi-natural pastures: the effects of disturbance, seed size, phenology and seed bank	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We examined recruitment patterns in semi-natural pastures and their relationships to disturbance and species composition at different spatial scales (0.01 m(2) up to 4 m(2)) of both the vegetation and the seed bank. Possible associations between seedling recruitment and phenology were also studied. The study was performed in four pastures with different management history. Seedling recruitment was generally enhanced by disturbance, with the greatest effect for small-seeded species that germinate in the autumn. The local species-pool contributed to a large extent to seedling recruitment; 83 % of the recruited species were found in the vegetation, whereas 44 % of the recruited species were found in the seed bank. There were a total of 88 species found in the vegetation at different spatial scales; 61 % were recorded al the smallest spatial scale (0.01 m(2)). The area sampled at this scale comprised 1.25 % of the area examined, indicating a small scale structuring of diversity in the pastures. The species number in the vegetation varied between 7 and 14 for the smallest scale (0.01 m(2)), and between 23 and 42 for the largest scale (4 m(2)), in the four pastures. The species number in the seed bank was less variable. Like most studies of perennial grasslands, we found no close correspondence between species distribution in the vegetation and in the seed bank. Two of the pastures had a joint management history and exhibited a close similarity of species in the seed bank, despite that one of the pastures was abandoned already in the beginning of this century.																	0107-055X						1997	17	5					469	482		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1997.tb00344.x							WOS:000071443600002

In the same area the natural vegetation before human interference was predominantly forest in which the majority of these species were probably confined to temporary openings of the canopy (gaps), or to forest edges where trees are excluded for edaphic or climatic reasons (rocky outcrops, alpine timberline, riversides). Shrubs and herbaceous species of these primary edges became abundant under human influence in extensively used grasslands, hedgerows and scrublands. At these sites the grassland-scrub edge shifts spatially depending on the intensity of agricultural management, i.e. either cutting of woody species or abandonment of grassland. Primary forest edges, on the other hand, are long-lasting habitats with only minor successional changes, but even here temporary shifts of the edge are to be expected after hurricanes, fire, floods or unusual drought which are detrimental for woody species. The vegetation of primary and secondary forest edges has been frequently described. However, studies of the population processes along and across these ecotones are scarce, although these processes are of pivotal importance for the response of grassland and scrub communities to changes in the edge structure. This contribution reviews research on population dynamics at the grassland-scrub interface. The results are discussed with respect to management and to nature conservation.

This paper examines whether the key to effective management lies in understanding the reasons for their persistence. In addition to being protected against grazing by spines, thistles form competitive rosettes which maintain niches for future recruitment and produce numerous wind-borne seeds. Their persistence, however, is dictated mostly by long-lived seed banks at depth and the annual replenishment of seeds to surface soil. Thistle management should aim to increase the level of control by combining the suppressive effects of competitive pastures with techniques which cause high seed loss.																							1997							453	456									WOS:A1997BJ70Z00086

In the same area the natural vegetation before human interference was predominantly forest in which the majority of the fleshy fruited species were probably confined to temporary openings of the canopy (gaps), and to forest edges where trees are excluded for edaphic or climatic reasons, e.g. rocky outcrops, alpine timberline, river-sides. Gaps are predictable in time, but rather unpredictable in space and undergo a quick succession. Therefore, gap species have probably evolved mechanisms to compensate for isolation in time. Forest edges, on the other hand, are predictable in space, but their formation is unpredictable in time, i.e. changes in the course of a river or a landslide creating a new cliff. Since edges are stable habitats with only minor successional changes, edge species are expected to compensate for isolation in space. The central hypothesis is that adaptations for isolation in space or time are reflected by the seed size, since seed size integrates several steps during regeneration of fleshy-fruited species. Actually, the seed size of gap species is significantly smaller than that of edge species. This result is discussed with respect to the effects on dispersal, predation, seed bank, germination and establishment of seedlings.

B	Gill, GS		DePrado, R; Jorrin, J; GarciaTorres, L		Gill, GS			Prevention and control of herbicide resistant weeds in Australia	WEED AND CROP RESISTANCE TO HERBICIDES					International Symposium on Weed and Crop Resistance to Herbicides	APR, 1995	CORDOBA, SPAIN					Herbicide resistance has now developed in several monocot and dicot weed species in southern Australia. Of these, annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) has developed resistance to most of the selective herbicides available for its control and, therefore, has had the biggest impact on farm profitability. The seed-bank of ryegrass is relatively short-lived and can be depleted to low levels by effective management in the pasture phase. However, it is much more difficult to manage resistant populations of this weed under continuous cropping. Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the use of alternative herbicide groups, such as the dinitroanilines to which resistance is still uncommon. Innovative techniques such as capture of weed seeds during the harvesting operation and preventing seed-set of weeds in crops by the application of non-selective herbicides (e.g. paraquat after anthesis of ryegrass) are also being adopted by some farmers. So far, dicot weeds have only evolved resistance to the ALS inhibiting herbicides and can, therefore, still be managed effectively with several other herbicides. There is a growing appreciation in the farming community of the need to reduce reliance on selective herbicides and, instead, employ a wider range of weed control methods to delay the onset of herbicide resistance in weed populations.																			0-7923-4581-9				1997							305	313									WOS:A1997BJ58A00034						
J	Mulugeta, D; Stoltenberg, DE				Mulugeta, D; Stoltenberg, DE			Seed bank characterization and emergence of a weed community in a moldboard plow system	WEED SCIENCE												Field experiments were conducted in 1992 and 1993 to characterize the weed seed bank, to determine the influence of moldboard plowing and secondary soil disturbance on the emergence pattern of weeds, and to measure weed seed bank depletion by emergence in a long-term moldboard plow corn cropping system. Viable seeds of common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, and each of 10 other species accounted for about 85, about 9, and less than 1%, respectively, of the total weed species in the seed bank. A negative binomial distribution described che spacial distribution of viable seeds of 10 species, but not of common lambsquarters or of redroot pigweed. Decreased density of seeds among species was associated with increased aggregation. Secondary soil disturbance increased the rate and magnitude of common lambsquarters emergence in 1992 but did not influence emergence in 1993. Secondary soil disturbance did not influence the magnitude and rate of emergence of redroot pigweed or velvetleaf. Whereas cumulative growing degree days from April through July were similar between years, the amount of rainfall was about 50% less in 1992 than in 1993. Secondary soil disturbance may have increased common lambsquarters emergence by increasing the availability of soil moisture and improving conditions for seed germination during the dry year. Even though seed bank depletion by seedling emergence was relatively low for all species, secondary soil disturbance increased seed bank depletion of common lambsquarters and redroot: pigweed about 7- and 3-fold, respectively, in 1992. Seasonal variation in the amount of rainfall may have influenced the effect of soil disturbance on emergence and seed bank depletion of common lambsquarters, which is the most abundant species in the weed community.																	0043-1745					JAN-FEB	1997	45	1					54	60		10.1017/S004317450009247X							WOS:A1997WT49100008

Early spring seedbank densities were estimated through direct extraction of viable seeds from soil cores. Emerged seedlings were recorded periodically, as were daily Values for air and soil temperature, and precipitation. Percentages of weed seedbanks that emerged as seedlings were calculated from seedbank and seedling data for each species, and relationships between seedbank emergence and microclimatic variables were sought. Fifteen species were found in 3 or more site-years. Average emergence percentages (and coefficients of variation) of these species were as follows: giant foxtail, 31.2 (84%); velvetleaf, 28.2 (66); kochia, 25.7 (79); Pennsylvania smartweed, 25.1 (65); common purslane, 15.4 (135); common ragweed, 15.0 (110); green foxtail, 8.5 (72); wild prose miller, 6.6 (104); hairy nightshade, 5.2 (62); common sunflower, 5.0 (26); yellow foxtail, 3.4 (67); pigweed species, 3.3 (103); common lambsquarters, 2.7 (111); wild buckwheat, 2.5 (63), and prostrate knot-weed, 0.6 (79). Variation among site-years, for some species, could be attributed to microclimate variables thought to induce secondary dormancy in spring. For example, total seasonal emergence percentage of giant foxtail was related positively to the Ist date at which average daily soil temperature at 5 to 10 cm soil depth reached 16 C. Thus, if soil warmed before mid April, secondary dormancy was induced and few seedlings emerged, whereas many seedlings emerged if soil remained cool until June.																	0043-1745					JAN-FEB	1997	45	1					67	76		10.1017/S0043174500092493							WOS:A1997WT49100010

After two years Giant Hogweed cover was much reduced and a typical meadow vegetation was established. By 1993 Giant Hogweed was completely eliminated though total species diversity was much reduced. Soil sampled from the grazed area developed no Giant Hogweed seedlings in a germination test and contained no viable seeds of the species. In contrast soil from adjacent stands produced numerous seedlings with a peak emergence from samples taken after the winter. Seeds collected in October showed a viability in tetrazolium test of 88%. Germination averaged 22% after storage at room temperature an 25% following three weeks treatment at -18 degrees C. It was concluded that the persistence of Giant Hogweed seeds in Danish meadow soils is less than seven years.																	0018-8158					DEC 6	1996	340	1-3					277	284		10.1007/BF00012768							WOS:A1996WJ83800045

J	French, K; Westoby, M				French, K; Westoby, M			Vertebrate-dispersed species in a fire-prone environment	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												It is hypothesized that plant species that produce vertebrate-dispersed seeds (fleshy fruits and brightly coloured arillate seeds) would not be common in fire-prone vegetation because seeds are deposited on the soil surface and are unlikely to survive fires. They have not previously been known to have any means of burial that would enable them to await the next fire as a buried soil seed-bank. We studied vertebrate-dispersed species in fire-prone sclerophyll vegetation to look at mechanisms used by vertebrate-dispersed plants for persisting in these environments. Seeds do not survive heating to 150 degrees C, although species from fire-prone environments are more likely to tolerate moderate heating (80 degrees C) without affecting viability than vertebrate-dispersed species from environments where fire is rare. Most vertebrate-dispersed species have the capacity to regenerate vegetatively, although they are not more likely to have this strategy than ant-dispersed species. Finally, ants do take vertebrate-dispersed seeds and fruits (particularly small ones) indicating the potential for the formation of a soil seed-bank. Some species only persist in fire-prone environments by recolonizing from unburnt areas.

J	Takenaka, A; Washitani, I; Kuramoto, N; Inoue, K				Takenaka, A; Washitani, I; Kuramoto, N; Inoue, K			Life history and demographic features of Aster kantoensis, an endangered local endemic of floodplains	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Aster kantoensis, an endanger ed plant species, is a local endemic on floodplains of a few rivers in eastern central Japan. Three years' demographic study (1989-1991) on several subpopulations (discrete patches of the plants) revealed that it is a monocarpic perennial with a 2- to 4-year vegetative growth phase before flowering. Its distribution on the floodplain is restricted to sparsely vegetated gravelly areas. A relatively high light requirement and low competitive ability to gain light are likely to be responsible for the distribution pattern. Demographic parameters obtained for the studied period indicate a decline of the subpopulations of A. kantoensis. In a transect covering 76 m(2), mean viable seed production per flowering plant was 450 (1990) and 780 (1991), but less than 0.027% of dispersed seeds survived to the reproductive stage, The spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance are of critical importance for the maintenance of the metapopulation of this short-lived species without a persistent seed bank or vegetative reproduction.

Erechtites hieracifolia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												At maturity in September, about half the seeds (achenes) of Erechtites hieracifolia (Asteraceae) collected in Kentucky were dormant (did not germinate at any test condition), whereas the others were conditionally dormant (germinated only at a narrow range of test conditions). Seeds sown on top of soil in an unheated greenhouse in September failed to germinate in autumn because temperatures were below those required for germination; however, they germinated at comparable temperatures the following spring. Seeds buried in soil in September 1987 and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes were nondormant (germinated over full range of test conditions) by April 1988, but they entered conditional dormancy by October 1988. Each October through 1995, exhumed seeds exhibited conditional dormancy. Since 89% of the seeds were viable after 8 years of burial, it appears that although seeds of this species are wind dispersed, they also have the potential to form a long-lived seed bank. Thus, soil disturbance at any time from May to September could result in establishment of plants from seeds in the seed bank.																	0008-4026					DEC	1996	74	12					2002	2005		10.1139/b96-240							WOS:A1996WA93000018						
J	Hairston, NG; Kearns, CM; Ellner, SP				Hairston, NG; Kearns, CM; Ellner, SP			Phenotypic variation in a zooplankton egg bank	ECOLOGY												Dormant propagule pools may store potentially significant genetic variation that can influence the rate and direction of microevolution via directional selection, temporally fluctuating selection, and evolution of trait covariance between timing of emergence from the propagule pool and fitness characters expressed in the active population. The third process can interact with either of the first two to produce distinct effects. Each process can lead to a different distribution of genotypes and phenotypes between active and dormant subpopulations. We compared the phenotypic distributions of an important fitness character for individuals collected from active and diapausing subpopulations of a freshwater copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, with a long-lived egg bank. The character, seasonal timing of the switch from production of immediately hatching eggs to diapausing eggs, determines the relative representation of copepods with different switch dates in future generations and is subject to fluctuating selection due to year-to-year changes in the timing and intensity of the seasonal onset of fish predation. The mean timing of diapause is significantly later in the season for copepods reared eggs than it is for copepods reared from individuals collected from the water column. Phenotypic variance for diapause timing does not differ between the two subpopulations. Within the sediment subpopulation, the distribution gf diapause timing depends upon two features of the diapausing eggs: (1) individuals originating from eggs near the sediment surface exhibit a slightly earlier switch date with greater phenotypic variance than individuals from deep in the sediments, and (2) individuals from eggs that hatched shortly after they were collected from sediments have a later seasonal switch to diapause than those that hatched later in time. We hypothesize that our results are explained bg adaptive covariance between traits that influences how long an egg spends in the sediments before hatching and traits that influence the seasonal timing of diapause. The covariance may result from either phenotypic plasticity or from genetic covariance between diapause timing and hatching probability.																	0012-9658					DEC	1996	77	8					2382	2392		10.2307/2265740							WOS:A1996VY49700011

Seed and plant densities and dry matter yield	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Trifolium balansae cv. Paradana and T. resupinatum lines SA 12240 and SA 14433 were sown as monospecific swards with and without irrigation; the field site had a red-brown earth soil. Seed bank and plant population densities and herbage yield were measured over a 3-year period. 2. Seed density in the seed bank was highest just after seed production and lowest during the growing season. Up to 65% (average of c. 40%) of seed present in the seed bank before summer disappeared during the mainly dry summer months between seed set and autumn regeneration. Another 31% decrease in seed density occurred during regeneration. 3. Seed impermeability was highest (95%) just after seed production and during the growing season and lowest (78-87%) just before regeneration. 4. Seedling density was very high (up to 10 000 plants per m(2)) after regeneration, but more than 90% of plants died during the growing season. In 1988 plant density during the growing season was two to three times higher than in 1989 and 1990. 5. Total dry matter yield did not differ significantly between the lines tested, but Paradana plots bad a significantly higher clover content than SA 12240 and SA 14433 plots, ranging from 2253 to 1068 kg per ha. 6. Paradana was better suited to the experimental environment than was either T. resupinatum line; differences in plant size and subsequent seed production were the major factors contributing to the successful persistence of Paradana.

Predicting long-term persistence from a demographic model	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Trifolium balansae and T. resupinatum are new to self-regenerating pastures. Little is known about the mechanisms whereby these species would be able to persist in pastures. 2. A model, based on data obtained from field measurements, was used to predict the persistence of T. balansae cv. Paradana and T. resupinatum lines SA 12240 and SA 14433. 3. This model showed that T. balansae cv. Paradana could persist in pastures in central west New South Wales, Australia, whereas T. resupinatum lines SA 12240 and SA 14433 could not. 4. Seed production was the most important factor determining persistence; all lines could be made to persist or fail by changing seed production. 5. SA 12240 could persist if plant recruitment increased from 14% to more than 30% or plant survival from 23% to more than 48%, or by an increase in seed production. SA 14433 was the least successful line and could only persist by an increase in seed production.

J	Scott, JK				Scott, JK			Population ecology of Chrysanthemoides monilifera in South Africa: Implications for its control in Australia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The population ecology of single species stands of Chrysanthemoides incana, C. monilifera monilifera, C. m. pisifera, and C. m. rotundata was examined at 12 study sites in South Africa. Comparisons are made with populations of C. m. monilifera and C. m. rotundata, which are introduced invasive weeds of native vegetation in Australia. 2. In South Africa, adult plant density averaged 0 . 2 plants m(-2). Plants in the sample were between 6 and 35 years old as determined by growth rings. Recruitment in Cape Province sites appeared to be restricted to a few years, probably following major disturbance such as fire. In Natal, recruitment declined as the population aged. Seedlings were rare, being present at only four sites and at densities lower than that of adult plants. 3. Insects and unidentified causes destroyed 10-58% of ovules before the flowers senesced. Larvae of seed-feeding flies, Mesoclanis species, destroyed a small fraction of the seeds (0 . 2-9% per site) and damage to seeds by other insects (chiefly larvae of Lepidoptera) accounted for 4-25% of ovules. Between 0 . 4 and 32% of ovules became viable seeds. 4. Over all sites the seed bank under the canopy of plants consisted of 410-4500 seeds m(-2), of which 0-6% were viable. There was a mean of 26 viable seeds m(-2) over all sites. Outside the canopy, total seed density ranged from 7 to 660 m(-2), of which 0-6% were viable. Identifiable post-dispersal damage was mainly due to rodents (up to 62% of dispersed seed) and was higher in Cape Province than in Natal. 5. Between 5 and 20% of the leaf surface area was consumed by herbivores. 6. Chrysanthemoides populations in South Africa attain similar adult plant densities to Australian populations of Chrysanthemoides, but have lower percentage ground cover and much reduced recruitment once a population is established. It is likely that biological control agents causing similar damage in Australia will need the help of other management techniques such as fire to reduce weed density and persistence.

The wheat and weeds were subjected to two treatments in a split-plot factorial design, organic contrasting with conventional fertilizer, and ploughing plus hand-roguing contrasting with minimum tillage plus herbicide. The minimum tilled plots developed in a uniform manner, and became dominated by very high densities of Anisantha sterilis. Agrostemma githago and Galium aparine also persisted in these plots at lower densities. The ploughed plots had a lower total density but a greater range of species. Stellaria media, Veronica persica and Avena fatua were the most common; other species occurred at lower densities. The major effect of fertilizer treatment was a greater initial increase by G. aparine on the organic, minimum tilled plots compared with the conventionally fertilized, minimum tilled plots. Species associated with minimum tillage were annuals with either no or a short term seed bank and autumn germination and rather predictable dynamics, whereas species that did well under ploughing were either spring germinating or had a persistent seed bank, implying greater annual variation in population size associated with weather conditions, There seemed no clear way to distinguish between those species which were abundant on the ploughed plots and those which were scarce under all conditions using readily accessible data.

J	RussellSmith, J				RussellSmith, J			Regeneration of monsoon rain forest in northern Australia: The sapling bank	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												As part of a wider study examining regeneration pathways in monsoon rain forest vegetation in northern Australia, a one-off, dry season census of saplings was undertaken along transects sampled at each of 33 relatively undisturbed sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic quadrat groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Subsequent analyses involved: (1) comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles occurring in different rain forest types, and their structural and environmental correlates; (2) comparison of the contributions of different life forms, and the influence of clonal reproduction in the sapling regeneration banks of different forest types; and (3) exploration of relationships between the distributions of saplings of common tree species with respect to seed bank, floristic, structural, and environmental variables. While data presented here require cautious interpretation given that processes of seedling/sapling recruitment and mortality are highly dynamic, sapling banks were found to be most dense on coarse-textured, moist soils, and least dense on coarse-textured, seasonally dry soils. Canopy cover and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on sapling distribution, especially for saplings of tree species and those growing on seasonally dry sites. Sapling densities were little influenced by proximity to rain forest margins, except for shrubs. The potential for clonal reproduction was significantly greater on dry sites, especially for trees. The majority of saplings sampled were derived from relatively few common, non-clonal, canopy tree species. Sapling distributions of 20 out of 23 common tree species were clumped in the vicinity of conspecific adults; for most species the strength of this relationship was greater than that for any other variable. These data support observations in the literature concerning the distribution of sapling banks in moist and dry tropical forests.																	1100-9233					DEC	1996	7	6					889	900		10.2307/3236464							WOS:A1996WH38600010						
J	Dhanapal, GN; Struik, PC				Dhanapal, GN; Struik, PC			Broomrape (Orobanche cernua) control before attachment to host through chemically or biologically manipulating seed germination	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												The germination phase of Orobanche cernua Loefl. is a critical period in the life cycle of this parasitic weed. By stimulating the germination through chemicals in the absence of hosts or through natural stimulants by exposing seeds to trap crops the seed bank can be reduced. Seven series of laboratory and glasshouse experiments were conducted to investigate different methods of testing and to study the effect of several chemicals, root exudates of germinating crop seeds, and their interactions on O. cernua. Compared to experiments in the incubator better results were obtained when germination was tested in the presence of seedlings of host plants under glasshouse conditions. GR24 at 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg was found most effective in stimulating the germination of the seeds followed by gibberellic acid at 10 and 20 mg/kg. Without addition of chemicals, trap crops strongly increased germination. Especially greengram (Vigna radiata) and sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea) were effective. The effects of (concentrations of) chemicals and trap crops interacted. The positive effect of trap crops was observed even when there was already a strong stimulation by GR24 at 1.0 mg/kg, but under these conditions trap crops were less effective at 0.1 mg/kg GR24. Within one host plant species, no differences between cultivars in their effect on Orobanche germination could be detected.																	0028-2928					DEC	1996	44	4					279	291									WOS:A1996WU93200003						
J	Burrows, CJ				Burrows, CJ			Germination behaviour of seeds of the New Zealand woody species Coprosma foetidissima, Freycinetia baueriana, Hoheria angustifolia, and Myrsine australis	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Germination rates,percentage germination success, and phenomena related to germination delay were examined for seeds from freshly collected fruit of the shrub Coprosma foetidissima, the vine Freycinetia baueriana, and the trees Hoheria angustifolia and Myrsine australis. The experimental conditions resembled those which seeds might experience after dispersal. Germination success was high (90-100%) for cleaned seeds of all species in moist, well-lit conditions. Hoheria seeds germinated well and Myrsine seeds moderately well in the dark, but seeds of Coprosma germinated poorly. Freycinetia seeds failed to germinate in the dark but remained alive and germinated when subsequently placed in the light. Seeds of all species except Freycinetia germinated moderately to very well on soil. Seeds in the achene-like disseminules of Hoheria germinated freely but seeds of all other species in the in-fruit treatment failed to germinate or success was very low. All Myrsine seeds, but no or few seeds of the other species, germinated after being kept dry for several months. Seeds of Myrsine which were buried 5 cm below the soil surface germinated in two episodes, in successive spring seasons. Some Hoheria seeds germinated in this treatment, but the seedlings died underground. Buried Freycinetia seeds failed to germinate. Coprosma, Hoheria, and Freycinetia are unlikely to form soil seed banks lasting more than a few months, but Myrsine could form seed banks of more than a year's duration.																	0028-825X					DEC	1996	34	4					499	508									WOS:A1996WB99600007						
J	Kotanen, PM				Kotanen, PM			Revegetation following sail disturbance in a California meadow: The vole of propagule supply	OECOLOGIA												Revegetation following a disturbance event initially should be constrained by the abundance and types of propagules available at the disturbed site. I tested this idea by conducting two experiments in which I created artificial soil disturbances by excavating or burying pre-existing grassland vegetation. In the first experiment, I varied disturbance intensity (depth), to investigate the consequences for revegetation when numbers of surviving propagules (dormant seeds and bulbs) were altered. In the second experiment, I varied the timing of disturbance, to investigate the consequences when disturbed sites experienced differing exposures to seasonal patterns of clonal growth and seed dispersal. I sampled these experiments from 1991 to 1993, and have interpret ed their results using measurements of the seed bank, the bulb bank, and the seed rain. In the first (depth) experiment, bulbs declined in abundance with burial depth and were scarcer in deeper excavations. In contrast, numbers of annual graminoids initially showed no trends with respect to disturbance depth. These results reflect the depth distributions of the seed and bulb banks. Since bulbs occur deeply in the soil, progressively deeper disturbances left fewer survivors. Similarly, perennial graminoids could grow through the shallowest burials. In contrast, since the annual-graminoid-dominated seed bank is concentrated near the soil surface, disturbance depth mattered less to these species: any disturbance removing the surface layer was equally destructive. In the second (timing) experiment, more annual graminoids initially occurred in older plots. This result reflects seasonal patterns of seed production: plots exposed to more of the annual-graminoid-dominated seed rain supported higher densities of annual graminoids as a result. In subsequent years, the vegetation of most plots in both experiments was increasingly dominated by annual graminoids, again as a consequence of their great abundance in the seed rain. These results indicate that interactions between soil disturbances and sources of propagules play an important role in controlling early stages of succession in newly created gaps. They also suggest that disturbance may play different roles in communities characterized by species with different reproductive strategies. Understanding sources of colonists will improve our ability to predict the effects of disturbance.

J	Brunet, J; FalkengrenGrerup, U; Tyler, G				Brunet, J; FalkengrenGrerup, U; Tyler, G			Herb layer vegetation of south Swedish beech and oak forests - Effects of management and soil acidity during one decade	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Effects of forest management and soil acidity on herb layer vegetation were studied after 10 years on 190 permanent plots in south Swedish beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus robur) forests. Species richness generally increased with management intensity, mainly due to establishment of ruderal species from the seed bank. Species richness of the typical forest flora was unaffected by management. Moderate management of oak stands favoured several species which are commonly found in semi-natural pastures. Classification and ordination of the data showed that the main floristic gradient within Swedish beech and oak forest vegetation is related to soil acidity. Species richness of the typical forest flora was strongly positively correlated with soil pH in beech forests, but this correlation was weaker in oak forests. The number of herbaceous plants with a broader habitat range increased with pH only in the oak forest plots. Long term changes in the forest environment, which may affect the vegetation, are the decline of grazing 150-50 years ago and soil acidification mainly caused by atmospheric pollutants during the last 50 years. In the one-decade perspective of this study, however, we did not find a general vend towards a more acid-tolerant flora. Neither could we find a general decrease of pasture species in currently ungrazed oak stands. The results indicate that most typical forest plants are well adapted to and partly depend on occurrence of canopy gaps and soil disturbance. If canopy thinning is followed by periods of canopy closure the characteristic shade tolerant flora of Swedish beech and oak forests may be able to persist as long as soil chemical limits of existence are not exceeded.

J	Ungar, IA; Woodell, SRJ				Ungar, IA; Woodell, SRJ			Similarity of seed banks to aboveground vegetation in grazed and ungrazed salt marsh communities on the Gower Peninsula, South Wales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Seed bank and aboveground species composition of four salt marsh plant communities on the Cower Peninsula, South Wales, were compared. Puccinellia maritima was the dominant or codominant species in the vegetation on all of the marshes investigated. Two of the marshes were ungrazed (Oxwich, Three Cliffs Bay), one lightly grazed by horses (Cwm Ivy), and one heavily grazed by sheep (Landimore). Two annual species, Salicornia europaea and Suaeda maritima, accounted for less than 15% of the plant cover in the four salt marshes, but their seeds accounted for over 60% of the seed bank in the Cwm Ivy, Oxwich, and Landimore marshes. The two annuals comprised 100% of the seed bank of the heavily grazed marsh, but only 13.6% of the total plant cover. Ungrazed and lightly grazed marshes had percentage similarities between seed bank and plant cover ranging from 1.7% to 12.3%, while the grazed marsh had a value of 13.7%. An unweighted pair group mean cluster analysis indicated that three of the four plant communities formed a cluster at 55% for vegetation and 65.3% for seed banks. However, because the dominant perennial grass species P. maritima did not produce a persistent seed bank, none of the plant communities formed clusters with their seed banks.																	1058-5893					NOV	1996	157	6					746	749		10.1086/297398							WOS:A1996WC48600011						
J	Honek, A; Martinkova, Z				Honek, A; Martinkova, Z			Geographic variation in seed dormancy among populations of Echinochloa crus-galli	OECOLOGIA												In 1991-1993, we investigated the incidence of seed dormancy in 25 local populations of barnyard grass, Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.Beauv., in the western Czech Republic. The percentage of germination after 4 months after:ripening of dry seeds at 25 degrees C varied between 0.0 and 83.6%. Although there were significant annual differences in the percentage of germination at some localities, typical proportions of dormant seeds persisted over 3 years at field sites where the seed bank was not disturbed. One-way ANOVA (using data from 14 cultivated or abandoned fields) revealed that 73.0% of variance in seed dormancy incidence could be attributed to the effect of locality (P < 0.001). Incidence of dormancy was not con-elated with mother plant stature (dry above-ground biomass, number of tillers, maximal stem height) nor seed mass. There was a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.403, P < 0.005) between dormancy incidence at natural localities in 1991 and in F-1 offspring sown at experimental grounds at Praha-Ruzyne in 1992. The results indicate that heredity is important in maintaining local variation in seed dormancy, probably favoured by the self-pollinating reproduction of barnyard grass.																	0029-8549					NOV	1996	108	3					419	423		10.1007/BF00333716							WOS:A1996VW51200003	28307856					
J	Eriksson, O				Eriksson, O			Regional dynamics of plants: A review of evidence for remnant, source-sink and metapopulations	OIKOS												Despite a long tradition in plant ecology of studies of patch dynamics, recent developments of models for large scale dynamics in source-sink and metapopulations have largely focused on animals. In contrast to mobile unitary animals, many plants resist extinction, even under conditions where only a part of the life cycle can be maintained. This model of remnant population dynamics adds to the two commonly recognized source-sink and metapopulations dynamics. A review of the literature suggests that all three types of dynamics are common in plants. Regional dynamics are related to life-cycle characteristics determining dispersal ability and longevity of life cycle stages. Short-lived or highly habitat specialized plants with good dispersal tend to build up metapopulations, i.e. systems of local populations and non-occupied but potentially suitable sites, interconnected with dispersal, and in a continuous flux of local colonization and extinction. At the other extreme, long-lived plants with clonal propagation, or plants with extensive seed banks, tend to build up remnant population systems, in which many local populations persist over periods long enough to bridge unfavourable phases of successional development, intervening periods of favourable conditions. Source-sink populations are a special case of metapopulations, in the sense that they comprise both persistent refuge populations and ephemeral populations maintained by dispersal. It is suggested that a concept of local population inertia in remnant population systems, scales to higher level phenomena of vegetation inertia, and to community stabilization (through enhanced recovery after perturbations). Such an inertia may contribute to explain cases of exceptionally high species diversity, and lack of pronounced mass extinctions of plants in the fossil record.																	0030-1299					NOV	1996	77	2					248	258		10.2307/3546063							WOS:A1996VW66000010						
J	vanTussenbroek, BI				vanTussenbroek, BI			Integrated growth patterns of turtle grass, Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig	AQUATIC BOTANY												Indications of physiological integration in the clonal plant Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig from the Puerto Morelos reef lagoon, Mexican Caribbean, were deduced from synchronisation in the formation of 'inactive shoots', lateral rhizomes and inflorescences. 'Inactive shoots' (i.e. bare, pointed shoots with live roots attached) on a rhizome section often had similar numbers of leaf scars. Lateral rhizome sections were generally found in similar positions when a rhizome had more than one shoot bearing a lateral rhizome. Additionally, the position of lateral rhizomes and the number of leaf scars on inactive shoots were often similar when encountered on the same rhizome section. Synchronisation of flowering events was suggested by the similar position of inflorescence scars on different shoots on the same rhizome section. It is suggested that inactive shoots can play a role in density regulation of the clonal population, and that they possibly constitute a 'dormant meristem bank' analogous to 'seed banks', or 'dormant bud banks'.				van Tussenbroek, Brigitta/P-2517-2017	van Tussenbroek, Brigitta/0000-0002-6447-7479												0304-3770					OCT	1996	55	2					139	144		10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01067-4							WOS:A1996VV49200006

Seeds in the latter regime remained dormant because of an absolute requirement of light for germination. Another experiment involved the storage of seeds of one of the species in a gradient of intermediate moisture conditions within glass chambers. Results indicate that water-imbibed seeds retain viability for a longer time than any of the other moisture levels employed. This agreed with observations made on photoblastic lettuce seeds by other authors.																	0008-4026					OCT	1996	74	10					1635	1639		10.1139/b96-198							WOS:A1996VN84900014						
J	Derksen, DA; Blackshaw, RE; Boyetchko, SM				Derksen, DA; Blackshaw, RE; Boyetchko, SM			Sustainability, conservation tillage and weeds in Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												The sustainability of conservation tillage is dependent on the extent of changes in weed community composition, the usage of herbicides, and the development of integrated weed management (IWM) strategies, including biological weed control. The objective of this paper is to review research on conservation tillage and weed management in light of these factors. Recent Canadian research has found that changes in weed communities due to the adoption of conservation tillage are not necessarily those expected and were not consistant by species, location, or year. Changes reflected the use of different selection pressures, such as different crop rotations and herbicides, within the studies to a greater extent than weed life cycle groupings. Therefore, research that determines the reasons for change or the lack of change in weed communities is required to provide the scientific basis for the development of IWM strategies. Documented herbicide usage in conservation tillage varies from less than to more than conventional-tillage systems. Potential to reduce herbicide usage in conservation-tillage systems exists: Furthermore, the herbicides used in western Canada are different from those causing ground water contamination in the United States, are less volatile, and are used at lower rates. The presence of surface crop residues in conservation tillage may provide a unique environment for classical and inundative biological control agents. Some insects, fungi, and bacteria have the potential to survive to a greater extent in undisturbed plant residues. Residue management and conservation tillage systems are evolving in Canada. Research must keep pace by providing weed management strategies that enchance the sustainability of these systems.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				OCT	1996	76	4					651	659		10.4141/cjps96-115							WOS:A1996VW71700014						
J	Tyler, CM				Tyler, CM			Relative importance of factors contributing to postfire seedling establishment in maritime chaparral	ECOLOGY												Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the postburn flush of seedlings in the chaparral; these include direct effects of fire, such as heating, of the soil and seed bank, and indirect effects of fire, such as a temporary reduction in competition by shrubs or herbivory by mammals. I conducted an experiment in burned and adjacent unburned chaparral to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms to seedling emergence and mortality of four functional plant groups: shrubs, subshrubs, perennial herbs, and annual herbs. I assessed direct effects of burning by comparing experimental plots in a burned area to plots in adjacent, unburned chaparral that were cleared of shrubs. In the unburned chaparral, competition with shrubs was manipulated by removing aboveground vegetation; herbivory by large mammals was manipulated using fence exclosures. The direct effects of burning enhanced emergence of shrub and subshrub seedlings, but reduced emergence of annual herbs. Shrub removal alone did not affect seedling emergence, but did improve survivorship of annuals. Exclusion of mammalian herbivores improved the survivorship of annual herbs and all seedlings combined. No single factor explained the high abundance of perennial herbs in the burn area; my results suggest that the combined removal of shrubs and herbivores following fire enhanced their growth and establishment. Thus, both the direct and indirect effects of fire contributed to the high postburn recruitment of seedlings in maritime chaparral, but different mechanisms were responsible for the increase in specific plant groups.																	0012-9658					OCT	1996	77	7					2182	2195		10.2307/2265711							WOS:A1996VM42100021

In a population from the northern foothills of the Pyrenees in southwestern France, a combined demographic and genetic investigation enabled the study not only of spatial genetic structure of the population, but also of the history of the population's spatial genetic structure over time. Excavation of all individuals allowed identification of clonemates. Age of each individual was determined by counting annual growth rings in the taproot, a method tested with individuals of known age planted in experimental gardens. Each individual was mapped, and genotypes of all individuals were determined using allozyme markers for a number of polymorphic loci. Distribution patterns and spatial genetic structure, both for all individuals and for different age classes, were analyzed using spatial autocorrelation statistics (Geary's Index, Moran's Index). Patterns of gene flow within the population were also studied using F-statistics and tests for random associations of alleles. Because age, allele frequencies, and location were known for each individual, it was possible to study how spatial genetic structure changed over lime. Results from all these diverse approaches are consistent with one another, and clearly show the following: (1) founder effects, with the study transect being first colonized by individuals at either end of the transect that were homozygous for different alleles at one marker locus; (2) a difference in spatial distribution of individuals originated from sexual reproduction (seedlings) and from clonal growth (connected individuals); (3) restricted gene flow, due to inbreeding among related, clumped individuals; and (4) increase in heterozygote deficit within the youngest cohort of individuals. The results indicate that genetic differentiation in time was much less marked than differentiation in space. Nevertheless, the results revealed that the studied population is experiencing demographic and genetic variation in time, suggesting that it is not at equilibrium. On the one hand, spatial structuring is becoming less marked due to the recombination of founder genotypes; on the other hand, as establishment of new individuals increases, a new spatial structure emerges due to mating between relatives.

J	Cabin, RJ				Cabin, RJ			Genetic comparisons of seed bank and seedling populations of a perennial desert mustard, Lesquerella fendleri	EVOLUTION												Soil seed banks may accumulate and store seed genotypes produced over many seasons. If germination and establishment of these soil seeds are influenced by seed genotypes, then seed bank and seedling populations may differ genetically. I compared the genetic structure of dormant but viable soil seeds of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri with the genetic structure of Lesquerella seedlings at the Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research Site. In 1991 and 1992, soil seeds and seedlings were mapped and genetically analyzed using starch gel electrophoresis. When data from all loci were lumped, there were highly significant differences in allele frequencies between soil seeds and seedlings at the population level (all plots) in both years, in all subpopulation (adjacent plots) comparisons in 1991, and three of five subpopulations in 1992. Differences at some individual loci were also detected in one or both years. Analysis of data pooled across both years revealed highly significant differences in the distribution of multilocus soil seed and seedling heterozygosity, but no significant differences in mean heterozygosity. F-st values showed small but statistically significant genetic differentiation within soil seeds and seedlings in both years. F-st values also showed significant genetic differentiation between these two groups at three of seven loci in 1991, and at one locus in 1992. Soil seeds and seedlings showed a general pattern of decreasing genetic relationship with distance, as estimated by the coefficient of coancestry analyses. In 1991, seedlings were roughly twice as genetically related to each other than were soil seeds at fine spatial scales (0-0.25 and 0.25-0.50 m). This study suggests that Lesquerella seedlings in this system represent a nonrandom genetic subset of the underlying Lesquerella seed bank. Such temporal genetic change may be an important yet frequently overlooked mechanism for generating population genetic structure.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				OCT	1996	50	5					1830	1841		10.2307/2410740							WOS:A1996VQ71900010	28565615

In some crop rotations common in northern Syria	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Simulations of the dynamics of the seed bank of Orobanche crenata Forsk. under different crop rotations are presented. Rotations studied involved four host species, lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), chickpea (Cicer, arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and woolly-pod vetch (Vicia villosa subsp. dasycarpa (Ten.) Cavill.), and non-host species. Simulation showed that the Orobanche seed bank dynamics in three-course crop rotations would result in a high Orobanche seed population and hence in low yields of the respective crops. Replacing the susceptible by resistant legumes such as woolly-pod vetch in some of the cycles of the rotations would keep the Orobanche infestation at a low level without reducing the proportion of legumes. A three-course crop rotation with faba bean would have to be changed to a 12-course rotation in which faba bean was grown every twelfth year but was replaced by woolly-pod vetch or other resistant legumes in seasons 3, 6, 9; 15, 18, 21; and so on. In the three-course rotations with chickpea or lentil, these susceptible legumes would be grown every ninth year but would have to be replaced in seasons 3 and 6: 12 and 15; 21 and 24; and so on, thus changing these three-course rotations into nine-course rotations.																	0014-4797					OCT	1996	32	4					395	403		10.1017/S0014479700001484							WOS:A1996VT15700002

J	Hutchings, MJ; Booth, KD				Hutchings, MJ; Booth, KD			Studies on the feasibility of re-creating chalk grassland vegetation on ex-arable land .1. The potential roles of the seed bank and the seed rain	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. This study is an investigation of the potential of the seed bank and the seed rain to promote the re-establishment of chalk grassland vegetation on an ex-arable site which had not been cultivated for 10 years. Comparisons are drawn with the composition of the seed bank as recorded in a study undertaken close to the current site 6 years after cultivation ceased. 2. The seed bank had the following composition: 46.6% grass seeds, 38.6% perennial forbs, 8.4% biennial forbs and 6.3% annual forbs. In comparison, annual forbs had accounted for 49.5% of the seed bank 6 years after cultivation ceased. The seed bank was concentrated near the top of the soil profile and grass seeds showed a more marked decline in abundance with depth than forb species. However, common annual forb species mostly germinated from the lower soil strata. The common grasses and perennial forbs were species with wide ecological amplitudes, characteristic of fertilized, neutral grassland. 3. Only 20 of the 68 forb species recorded in the seed bank were characteristic components of adjacent ancient chalk grassland. These species accounted for less than 20% of the total forb seed bank. Only two out of 11 recorded grass species were characteristic of the ancient chalk grassland, and these accounted for only 0.3% of all grass seedlings. The grass component of the seed bank was dominated by Agrostis stolonifera. 4. The species richness of the seed bank has increased in recent years due mainly to acquisition of seeds of non-annuals. However, species characteristic of the ancient chalk grassland have made little contribution either to the seed bank or to the vegetation growing on the site. Those chalk grassland species which were most abundant in the seed bank tended to be short-lived species and they occurred mainly at the margins of the ex-arable site, close to the adjacent chalk grassland. Even here they rarely accounted for more than 20% of the germinable seed bank. They were strongly concentrated at the soil surface, indicating their deposition since cultivation ceased. 5. Agrostis spp., Phleum pratense and Holcus lanatus accounted for over 50% of the recorded seed rain. Of the commonly trapped species, analyses of mean dispersal breadths indicated that forb species characteristic of the adjacent chalk grassland would be comparatively slow invaders of ex-arable habitats. 6. The vegetation on transects across the ex-arable site contained few of the species which occurred in the adjacent old chalk grassland. Chalk grassland species were more abundant in vegetation at the margins of the ex-arable site, but even here similarity indices between the ex-arable vegetation and the chalk grassland vegetation were normally below 25%. 7. The slow invasion of species from the adjacent chalk grassland into this ex-arable site, which is ideally placed for their colonization, suggests that seeds of such species will often need to be artificially introduced to prevent ex-arable sites becoming dominated by fast-growing more weedy species. Further management would also be necessary to prevent more weedy species subsequently invading and eliminating the chalk grassland species.																	0021-8901					OCT	1996	33	5					1171	1181		10.2307/2404696							WOS:A1996VY72900024						
J	Hutchings, MJ; Booth, KD				Hutchings, MJ; Booth, KD			Studies of the feasibility of re-creating chalk grassland vegetation on ex-arable land .2. Germination and early survivorship of seedlings under different management regimes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Germination and establishment of the chalk grassland perennials Pimpinella saxifraga, Scabiosa columbaria, Plantago media and Achillea millefolium were compared in undisturbed chalk grassland, and in ex-arable land where the vegetation was either uncut. cut and maintained at a height of 3 cm, or completely cleared. 2. Virtually no germination was recorded for all four species in uncut quadrats on ex-arable land. Germination of Achillea and Plantago was highest in cleared ex-arable and that of Pimpinella highest in cut ex-arable. The ratio of germination in cleared and cut ex-arable increased as size of seed decreased between the species. Germination of the largest-seeded species. Pimpinella, was not significantly different in cut exarable and in laboratory conditions. 3. Differences in seedling survival were sought between the vegetation types, using concurrently recruited cohorts of seedlings of each species. The significant results were consistent for all species: overall seedling survival was highest in cut ex-arable. intermediate in cleared ex-arable and lowest in chalk grassland. Analysis of residuals revealed that the greatest differences in proportional survivorship between treatments occurred during the first 2 weeks of cohort life, regardless of the date of cohort recruitment, suggesting that vegetation type is a more potent determinant of mortality risk than climatic conditions during this early period of growth, Comparisons of residuals also demonstrated that survivorship decreased from cut ex-arable to cleared ex-arable to chalk grassland. Sites where vegetation is short may be more favourable for seedling establishment than uncut sites because of lower competition, and better than cleared sites because the short vegetation cover moderates temperature Fluctuations and retains more soil moisture. 4. It is concluded from this and related studies, that sowing suitable species, and implementing a management regime which reduces. but does not remove all vegetation cover. will maximize the chances of establishing chalk grassland species on ex-arable sites. Management prescriptions which include mowing and razing on ex-arable land will make the best use of the environmental opportunities, presented by agricultural extensification, to restore ecologically valuable communities.																	0021-8901					OCT	1996	33	5					1182	1190		10.2307/2404697							WOS:A1996VY72900025

We report the results of two studies designed to increase our knowledge of the Invasion dynamics of this species. Smooth brome seedling establishment in unbroken native tallgrass vegetation did not occur even when conditions for establishment were optimal. The soil at a lowland smooth brome site had finer texture, greater percent water, lower pH, and lower potassium than did the soil at an upland site. Tiller, stem base, and root biomass were greater in smooth brome individuals transplanted into the lowland site than in individuals transplanted into the upland site. Although the total length of rhizomes of individuals was not different between the two sites, rhizome length per tiller was greater at the upland site. This result indicates that the rate of horizontal spread of smooth brome may be greater at upland sites than at lowland sites.																	0885-8608					OCT	1996	16	4					289	294									WOS:A1996VP61800003

Cecropia obtusifolia Bertol. forms a relatively persistent viable soil seed bank, whereas seeds of Ficus are seldom found in the soil. Both genera require light for seed germination; however, the species differ in their germination responses to far red (FR) light under laboratory and field conditions. Seeds of C. obtusifolia did not germinate in low red/far red (R/FR) or pure FR, whereas seeds of the Ficus species did. This suggests that Ficus seeds do not become dormant under the light conditions (low R/FR ratio) beneath the leaf canopy of the rain forest. This difference may explain why the species differ in their presence in the soil seed bank.																	0829-318X	1758-4469				OCT	1996	16	10					871	875									WOS:A1996VK97500011	14871679

Heterogeneity for a given mean population density was measured using the variance of the counts between sample units at different locations; relatively large values of sample variance imply aggregation. The dependence of variance on mean was measured using the relationship known as Taylor's power law, ubiquitous in animal ecology but seldom used for plant populations. This was fitted to an extensive set of plant counts and 69 estimates of its parameters b, an index of aggregation, and log(10)a were computed. Estimates were corrected for bias when the number of samples was small. Overall, b varied between 1.32 and 2.61, and log(10)a varied between -0.85 and 1.58, agreeing well with previous estimates for both plant and animal populations. Parameter estimates varied with sample size and spatial sample scale, but unpredictably. Parameter values when species counts were combined were compared with individual species analyses. Knowledge of the likely range of these parameters for weed populations provides an important basis for future modelling of the relationship between weed density and crop yield loss.

Weed control, corn yield, herbicide active ingredient applied, and economic return with model-generated treatments were compared to standard herbicide and mechanical control treatments, Effects of these treatments on weed populations and soybean yield the following year were also determined, In most cases, the model-generated treatments controlled weeds as well as the standard herbicide treatment, The quantity of herbicide active ingredient applied decreased 27% with the seed bank model and 68% with the seedling model relative to the standard herbicide treatment, However the frequency of herbicide application was not reduced, In 1 yr, seed bank model treatments did not control weeds as well as the standard herbicide or seedling model treatments, Corn yields reflected differences in weed control, Net economic return to weed control was not increased by using model-generated control recommendations. Weed control treatments the previous year affected weed density in the following soybean crop, In 2 of 3 yr, these differences did not alter weed control or soybean yield, Although tactics differed, the bioeconomic model generally resulted in weed control and corn yield similar to the standard herbicide. The model was responsive to differing weed populations, but did not greatly alter economic returns under the weed species and densities in this research.																	0043-1745					OCT-DEC	1996	44	4					915	923		10.1017/S0043174500094923							WOS:A1996WA91300025

In lakes, as well as in controlled laboratory experiments with low abundances of grazers, recruitment of certain flagellated algal species was high, whereas recruitment was negligible when grazer abundances were high. Hence, certain plants equipped with locomotion organelles can use cues released from herbivores to adjust the timing of recruitment from the 'seed-bank', thereby reducing the exposure to grazing. Such an adaptation may have important consequences for dominance and temporal succession in algal communities. In an evolutionary context, this study shows that consumer-avoidance behaviour is not an adaptation exclusive to animals.																	0962-8452					SEP 22	1996	263	1374					1241	1244		10.1098/rspb.1996.0182							WOS:A1996VK92900022						
J	Eriksson, O; Froborg, H				Eriksson, O; Froborg, H			''Windows of opportunity'' for recruitment in long-lived clonal plants: Experimental studies of seedling establishment in Vaccinium shrubs	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Two experiments were performed to analyse seedling recruitment in Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum, and Vaccinium oxycoccos. The purpose was to examine the probability of recruitment at ''windows of opportunity,'' i.e., spatially or temporally unpredictable conditions in which seedling recruitment is possible within stands of established conspecific adults. Seedling emergence in all four investigated species depended on a combination of seed and microsite (disturbance) availability. In V. myrtillus, which was studied in more detail than the other species, emergence and survivorship were similar on nonwood substrate and on decaying wood, but seedling growth was favored on the latter substrate. An experiment along an environmental gradient with all four species showed that recruitment required approximately similar conditions even though the adults of the species exhibited a clear zonation along the gradient. For all species except V. oxycoccos, recruitment was confined to only a part of the adults' range. Vaccinium species are generally good seed dispersers and have a high fecundity but usually lack developed seed banks. This behavior is interpreted as a response to occurring windows of opportunity for recruitment, i.e., small disturbances with high moisture and organic soil content. Recruitment at windows of opportunity is suggested as one distinct pattern of recruitment among clonal plants, along with previously suggested repeated and initial seedling recruitment patterns, and some implications of this distinction are briefly discussed.																	0008-4026					SEP	1996	74	9					1369	1374		10.1139/b96-166							WOS:A1996VH45300002						
J	Doucet, C; Cavers, PB				Doucet, C; Cavers, PB			A persistent seed bank of the bull thistle Cirsium vulgare	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Seeds of Cirsium vulgare were collected from two populations in southwestern Ontario and stored at the site of collection at three depths in the soil. After intervals of 6 to 30 months, seed samples were extracted, the seeds classed as germinated, dead, or firm, and then the firm seeds were set to germinate in a growth cabinet. Both populations established a persistent seed bank when left at the 15 cm depth; however, most seeds do not get buried at great depths. After storage at the surface or 3 cm deep, seeds in an arable sandy soil did not persist beyond 6 months. In contrast, some seeds stored in shaded conditions in a clay loam soil maintained viability for 30 months at the surface and at 3 cm. In some cases, the germination rate of seeds was retarded after storage, especially for seeds that were extracted from soils subjected to wetting and drying before seed retrieval. A separate experiment confirmed that wetting and drying can delay the germination of some seeds of C. vulgare.																	0008-4026					SEP	1996	74	9					1386	1391		10.1139/b96-168							WOS:A1996VH45300004						
J	Houle, G				Houle, G			Environmental filters and seedling recruitment on a coastal dune in subarctic Quebec (Canada)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												One important factor that often determines the presence of a plant species on a site is propagule availability. Afterwards, abiotic and biotic factors act as a series of filters operating sequentially from the seed to the adult stage, determining the pattern of recruitment. By comparing the spatial pattern of emerging seedlings to those of seed availability and of surviving seedlings, one can determine the relative importance of the environmental filters acting on the seed germination and the seedling establishment phases. On a coastal dune system in subarctic Quebec (Canada), sand accumulation, salt spray, and substrate physicochemistry, all affecting microsite quality for seeds and seedlings, vary along a short topographical gradient. My goal was to determine whether or not conditions changing along this gradient differentially affect the initial stages of population recruitment of two perennial herbaceous species for which adults are segregated along the gradient: Honckenya peploides and Elymus mollis. The spatial pattern of seeds in the seed bank and that of emerging seedlings were not related to one another for either Honckenya or Elymus. However, patterns of surviving seedlings were spatially correlated with those of emerging seedlings. Seed and seedling mortality were not density dependent; they were both spatially variable, although not clinal. These results suggest that the environmental filters acting on the germination stage are those that determine the spatial patterns of recruitment. Spatial segregation along the flank of the foredune between adults of the two species studied thus seems to be maintained in part (and maybe reinforced) by low seed mobility, or low seed retention, and the availability of suitable microsites for seed germination. Population progression towards the upper beach seems to depend mostly on seedling establishment for Honckenya but on clonal growth for Elymus.																	0008-4026					SEP	1996	74	9					1507	1513		10.1139/b96-181							WOS:A1996VH45300017						
J	Singer, DK; Jackson, ST; Madsen, BJ; Wilcox, DA				Singer, DK; Jackson, ST; Madsen, BJ; Wilcox, DA			Differentiating climatic and successional influences on long-term development of a marsh	ECOLOGY												Comparison of long-term records of local wetland vegetation dynamics with regional, climate-forced terrestrial vegetation changes can be used to differentiate the rates and effects of autogenic successional processes and allogenic environmental change on wetland vegetation dynamics. We studied Holocene plant macrofossil and pollen sequences from Portage Marsh, a shallow, 18-ha marsh in northeastern Indiana. Between 10 000 and 5700 yr BP the basin was occupied by a shallow, open lake, while upland vegetation consisted of mesic forests of Pinus, Quercus, Ulmus, and Carya. At 5700 yr BP the open lake was replaced rapidly by a shallow marsh, while simultaneously Quercus savanna developed on the surrounding uplands. The marsh was characterized by periodic drawdowns, and the uplands by periodic fires. Species composition of the marsh underwent further changes between 3000 and 2000 yr BP. Upland pollen spectra at Portage Marsh and other sites in the region shifted towards more mesic vegetation during that period. The consistency and temporal correspondence between the changes in upland vegetation and marsh vegetation indicate that the major vegetational changes in the marsh during the Holocene resulted from hydrologic changes forced by regional climate change. Progressive shallowing of the basin by autogenic accumulation of organic sediment constrained vegetational responses to climate change but did not serve as the direct mechanism of change.

J	Hegazy, AK				Hegazy, AK			Effects of cement-kiln dust pollution on the vegetation and seed-bank species diversity in the eastern desert of Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												There is very little information on effects of particulate pollution from cement factories in the Middle East and northeastern Africa. Variations of natural vegetation, germinable soil seed bank and species diversity were therefore investigated amongst four study sites situated at different distances from the Suez Cement Company factory, south of Suez, Egypt. The composition of plant life-forms was similar in both vegetation and seed-bank communities, with only site-dependent differences in their proportional values. For the standing vegetation, chamaephytes attained the highest relative density and cover, while hemicryptophytes and geophytes exhibited the lowest values. Germinable soil seed bank of all life-forms tended to increase with distance from the cement-dust pollution source. Vegetation, seed rain and seed banks of hemicryptophytes and geophytes were the most affected by cement-kiln dust accumulation in the area. The ratios of seed-bank/seed-rain in all life-forms were less than unity, with a narrow range of variation amongst sites and species. The germinable seed bank was more affected by cement-kiln dust accumulation than the seed rain in all species and life-forms. The species diversity of perennial plants was greater than chat of annuals, with values increasing as distance increased from the cement-dust pollution source. Diversity in the standing vegetation was higher than that of the germinable seed bank. Differences in the standing vegetation and seed-bank reserves were observed in the different study sites. According to their response to cement-dust accumulation, the plant species (listed in text) in the study area were separated into four major groups: (1) tolerant species; (2) non-tolerant species; (3) species having intermediate tolerance; and (4) in-different species. Management considerations for the conservation of vegetation in cement quarrying sites and around cement factories were put forward to optimize recovery and restoration of vegetation in sites polluted by cement dust.																	0376-8929					SEP	1996	23	3					249	258		10.1017/S0376892900038868							WOS:A1996WL65600009						
J	Smith, RS; Buckingham, H; Bullard, MJ; Shiel, RS; Younger, A				Smith, RS; Buckingham, H; Bullard, MJ; Shiel, RS; Younger, A			The conservation management of mesotrophic (meadow) grassland in northern England .1. Effects of grazing, cutting date and fertilizer on the vegetation of a traditionally managed sward	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												The results are reported from an experiment on the effects of cutting date (14 June, 21 July and 1 September), fertilizer application (none or 80 kg ha(-1) N plus 40 kg ha(-1) P and K) and grazing treat ments (none, autumn or autumn plus spring) on the vegetation of an upland mesotrophic grassland in Upper Teesdale, northern England, UK. Effects on plant species number and cover Ne reported for 4 years (1989-93) of treatment. Effects on 'species-attributes' are given for the fourth year. The cessation of grazing combined with the use of fertilizer progressively reduced species number by about 25%. Under traditional management (no fertilizer, cutting date on 21 July, autumn and spring grazing) the species number and cover remained relatively static over the 4 years. Comparison between treatments in the fourth year showed a reduction in species number under the fertilizer application, cutting date on 1 September and no-grazing treatments. Fertilizer use together with cutting date on 1 September particularly lowered species number and cover, Analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of treatment on species that occurred frequently in the sward. A cutting date of 1 September favoured Agrostis capillaris, Alopecurus pratensis, Poa trivialis, Phleum pratense and Trisetum flavescens. The absence of grazing favoured Dactylis glomerata and Holcus lanatus. The use of fertilizer particularly favoured A, pratensis and H, lanatus. Ordination methods were used to assess. the effect of treatment on the less frequent species. These were primarily associated with the treatment combination that matched 'traditional' management. Deviations from this 'traditional' regime acted separately, rather than in combination, and favoured different grass species. Traditional management was associated with ruderal, stress-tolerant ruderal and competitive ruderal strategists and with longer seed germination times, heavier seeds, some of which needed scarifying or chilling to break dormancy, and transient seed banks that germinated in the autumn. The original sward was an Anthoxanthum odoratum-Geranium sylvaticum grassland, Briza media subcommunity (MG3b). After 4 years, Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland, Holcus lanatus-Trifolium repens subcommunity (U4b) and Lolium perenne-Alopecurus pratensis-Festuca pratensis grassland (MG7c) were round in many of the fertilized and late-cutting treatments.																	0142-5242					SEP	1996	51	3					278	291		10.1111/j.1365-2494.1996.tb02063.x							WOS:A1996WJ54900007						
J	VazquezYanes, C; Arechiga, MR				VazquezYanes, C; Arechiga, MR			Ex situ conservation of tropical rain forest seed: Problems and perspectives	INTERCIENCIA												The tropical forest flora of the world is being destroyed very rapidly putting in danger of extinction a great number of species, so it is necessary to find alternatives for their conservation. Seed storage is a good possibility that allows germoplasm preservation of valuable and endangered plants which consists in keeping seed viability in storage optimal conditions. In other plant communities, different from tropical forests, seed storage at low temperature and dehydration conditions in seed banks is now a common procedure of germoplasm preservation mainly in botanical gardens of developed countries. Knowledge about seed longevity is essential to forest technicians or to anyone working with forest ecology because the seed represents the natural means for plant reproduction and for the preservation of the genetic variability of plant populations. According to tolerance dessication, seeds can be divided basically in three groups: orthodox, intermediate and recalcitrant. Dessication tolerance is controlled genetically and it may be controlled by several compounds such as hormones like gibberellic acid or abscisic acid or the proteins called LEA. Recalcitrant seeds keep their metabolic activity during the quiescent period so it is not possible to store them for long periods of time at temperatures below 0 degrees C because seeds water content is converted into ice crystals. Intermediate seeds can not resist freezing temperatures and only survive for some years at room temperature. Most tropical forest seeds are recalcitrant because the conditions for germination and development on their natural environment are favourable almost all the time, so they did not evolve any resistance mechanism. Unfortunately, seed storage research is scarce. For the seeds that can not be stored, in vitro culture techniques and cryopreservation are good alternatives that are being well studied by plant physiologist and biotechnologists and that in the future will complement ex situ storage techniques.																	0378-1844					SEP-OCT	1996	21	5					293	&									WOS:A1996VN07400005

Trends in botanical composition and agronomic characteristics (yield, quality, weed spreading, diseases and insect pests) inside and outside the field mar ins were investigated. The number of plant species in the field increased from 21 to 52. Most of the arable weeds grew in the conservation strips which were richer in species than both the control margin and the adjacent field. The plant species potential of the field, as determined by floristic and seed bank analyses, was 87 species, of which eight belonged to the group of rare and endangered species (Anthemis arvenis, Bryonia dioeca, Erucastrum gallicum, Kickxia spuria, Lamium amplexicaule, Legousia speculum-veneris, Saponaria officinalis, and Stachys annua). The 'red list' species only occurred within 6 m from the edge of the field and mostly in the conservation headlands. Neither seed bank build-up nor invasion of weeds from the crop margins into the field was observed. Compared to the control strip, crop yield in the field margins decreased steadily during the study. In the 5th year yield loss reached 70 %. Conservation strips had no effect on crop yield and on the incidence of insect pests and pathogens in the adjacent field. It is concluded that field margins promote the segetal flora without affecting important agronomic traits of the crops in the main field.																	0066-1759					SEP	1996	70	3-4					101	112									WOS:A1996VL11600002						
J	Coronato, FR; Bertiller, MB				Coronato, FR; Bertiller, MB			Precipitation and landscape related effects on soil moisture in semi-arid rangelands of Patagonia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The dynamics of soil water was evaluated in different landscapes during four growing seasons in a semi-arid grassland of Patagonia. At intervals of 60-90 days, the (gravimetric) soil moisture content was determined at four depths in uplands and north-eastern slopes of grazed and ungrazed areas. Climatic data (precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature) were recorded daily. Maximum and minimum soil temperature per sampling interval was also registered. Soil moisture was strongly influenced by the recharge through precipitation. Most precipitation occurred during autumn and winter and the highest soil moisture values were measured at the end of the winter (September) after snowmelt. The occurrence of wet and dry years was observed during the study period and, as occurs in other semi-arid ecosystems, it may be attributed to the amount of rain delivered in events exceeding 10 mm. Soil moisture varied spatially with the topographic site while maintaining a similar seasonal pattern. North-eastern slopes were drier than uplands. These differences may be traced back to the protection of these slopes from the strong westerly winds prevailing in the area that results in a more favourable thermic balance as compared with uplands. No grazing related effects on soil moisture were observed in this study. This fact may probably be explained by a variety of factors involved in the partition of soil water between transpiration and evaporation. These results show northeastern slopes to be sensitive places for land degradation which eventually may have a restricted restoration potential imposed not only by physical changes in the upper soil but also by limited soil water availability.

Seasonal variation in the seed bank was also studied for the 1989-90 and 1990-91 growing seasons. Most species demonstrated the persistent nature of the seed bank with their numbers increasing after seed dispersal and decreasing in subsequent months.

J	Scholl, EL; Kinucan, RJ				Scholl, EL; Kinucan, RJ			Grazing effects on reproductive characteristics of common curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Common curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri) is a stoloniferous per ennial shortgrass. Historically the species was considered sterile and only reproductive vegetatively; however, research has demonstrated that it produces viable seed. In this study reproductive characteristics, focusing on seed production and seed rain, of common curlymesquite were compared between grazed (moderately stocked, deferred rotation grazing) and ungrazed (exclosure) areas on the western Edwards Plateau, Texas. Absolute foliar cover and density were significantly higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) in grazed than in ungrazed treatments. Total seed (spikelet cluster) production was also significantly higher in grazed than in the ungrazed areas on three of four sample dates. Seed production on a per plant or per absolute foliar cover basis, however; did not differ between treatments. Regression analysis indicated a strong relationship between number of seed clusters and number of culms, but not between seed production and other plant characteristics. Seed rain from common curlymesquite, as ascertained. by sticky traps, was significantly greater in the grazed than ungrazed areas. High reproductive potential, as expressed by seed or vegetative propagation, map be a life-history characteristic which contributes to the persistence and successional dominance of common curlymesquite on many southwestern rangelands.																	0038-4909					SEP	1996	41	3					251	256									WOS:A1996WT89300006

As a consequence they no longer fulfil their function as habitats for specialised species and communities, nor as retention areas for water and solid materials. Therefore, a number of renaturation experiments are in progress, which intend to develop and test strategies and measures to improve this defect in landscape diversity. For this purpose experiments on re-wetting, nutrient depletion of eutrophicated areas and re-establishment of typical wetland plant species and phytocoenoses have been performed. An ecological development concept defining the aims and describing their feasibility precedes such experiments. Preliminary results indicate that the reconstruction of the former state (regeneration) is impossible within reasonable time spans. In drained raised bogs overgrown with heather, as well as in those which have been industrially exploited, the primary aim must always be to restore efficient peat formation as far as possible; as a rule one succeeds only with well-growing and nutrient-demanding fen and transitional bog species. In cultivated fens the aim is to reduce peat loss. As a first step this is accomplished by converting arable fields and sown meadows into permanent grassland, if possible with reduced fertilization and low mowing or grazing frequencies, and accompanied by rewetting during winter. Many experiments have sought to impoverish eutrophicated fen soils and introduce typical fen species by sowing or planting, so well tested techniques are available. However, the total prevention of peat loss is only possible by permanent rewetting throughout the year, so that peat accumulation can start again. Only in this way could fens regain their former function as sinks in landscape processes.																	0042-3106					SEP	1996	126	1					101	115									WOS:A1996VP65700009

Changes in the germinative capacity of S-faberii (poaceae) embryos with development from anthesis to after abscission	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Studies were conducted evaluating germinability states in giant foxtail (Setaria faberii) embryos, as well as surrounding tissues (hull, caryopsis), with germination assays. Further, seed age, fascicle arrangement, flowering patterns, and elongation in the inflorescence were evaluated. Both qualitatitive and quantitative morphological observations of the hull and the caryopsis were revealed by precisely determined fertilized spikelet age from anthesis until after seed abscission. Red coloration of the placental pad at approximate to 11 d after anthesis is probably a morphological indicator of physiological maturity. Germinability of giant foxtail embryos changed with development. Four qualitatively different types of embryo germination were observed during development of the seed: early disorganized callus growth at the basal, coleorhizal end of the embryo; germination of immature embryos with shortened and thickened axes; germination of the scutellum; and germination and growth of the coleoptile and coleorhiza in embryos aged 7 d after anthesis and older. Axis-specific embryo germinability was also observed. Inhibition of the embryo could be localized to the coleoptile, the coleorhiza, or both. These studies provide evidence for a complex model of germinability regulation based on the independent, asynchronous actions of the embryo, caryopsis, and hull compartments, as well as on their dependent, synchronous action. These studies provide evidence for a dynamic, developmental model of giant foxtail germinability regulation resulting in phenotypes with a wide range of germinability shed from an individual panicle. These diverse germinability phenotypes are found at all stages of development, but particularly when the seed is shed and the soil seed bank is replenished.

J	Casanova, MT; Brock, MA				Casanova, MT; Brock, MA			Can oospore germination patterns explain charophyte distribution in permanent and temporary wetlands?	AQUATIC BOTANY												The patterns of germination of oospores of several species of charophytes were investigated to explain the distribution of charophytes in permanent and temporary wetlands in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Germination from seed banks and after storage was evaluated, Seed banks were pre-treated with combinations of temperature and moisture to simulate the effect of inundation in different seasons, Oospores of five species of Nitella and two species of Chara germinated from the seed banks, Nitella cristata var. ambigua, N. sonderi and N. subtilissima germinated in large numbers and the pattern and timing of emergence of these species was analysed, Nitella cristata var, ambigua, a winter germinating species, had relatively synchronous and early germination from seed banks when exposed to cues for the onset of winter. Nitella sonderi and N. subtilissima displayed extended germination from seed banks of wetlands that have variable water regimes. Drying the seed bank enhanced germination of these three species. Oospores collected from plants of four species were subject to different storage treatments and were germinated in vitro after 1, 3, 7, 9, 12 and 18 months of treatment. Oospores of Chara muelleri and C. australis germinated after storage, Nitella cristata var. ambigua germinated only in the control treatment and Nitella subtilissima did not germinate at all. Highest germination of C. muelleri (76%) occurred after oospores were subject to fluctuations in light intensity and temperature, whereas highest germination of C. australis (41%) occurred after oospores were kept wet for 4 months. Small oospores (680 mu m) of C. muelleri germinated sooner than large (1000 mu m) oospores after 1 month of storage. Oospores of C. muelleri that were stored for a short period of time (1 month) germinated faster and more synchronously than did oospores that were stored for longer. Charophytes in these temporary wetlands reduce the risk that all offspring will die in one unfavourable season by contributing to a dormant oospore bank and by having a pattern of germination that increases the likelihood of survival. Oospore germination patterns can help explain the distribution of charophytes in space and time.																	0304-3770					AUG	1996	54	4					297	312		10.1016/0304-3770(96)01032-7							WOS:A1996VL39400004						
J	Creed, JC; Norton, TA; Harding, SP				Creed, JC; Norton, TA; Harding, SP			The development of size structure in a young Fucus serratus population	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Artificial discs were used to monitor the settlement and development of Fucus serratus propagules in five areas cleared of an adult canopy, in order to test the assumptions that sizes of recently settled propagules are normally distributed but that over time plant sizes become more variable and hierarchical. Settlement was spatially (3-20 m) variable only at the beginning and end of the settlement period, and at the time when most settlement took place (88% in a fortnight) no differences between areas were found. Increases in the skewness coefficient, Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation confirmed that there was not a size hierarchy in the recently settled population, but 8 months later sizes of plants were variable and a positive skew in plant sizes (many small and few big) developed. Mortality was high at first (70% in 1 month) but fell considerably later. F. serratus behaves like most higher plants with respect to changing population structure. The observed change in population structure provided evidence of how a ''seed bank'' develops in an algal population, as 1 year after settlement an estimated 37 000 plants m(-1) are still <1 mm in length.

Field measurements of seed and seedling distribution, growth, and age indicate that yew seeds may remain dormant in the soil seed bank for more than three years. Seeds tend to be concentrated under the crowns of mature yew trees, and they can produce abundant seedlings on some clearcut-and-burned sires. Clearcutting, burning, or other major stand disturbances are not essential for seed germination and seedling survival, however; Pacific yew can also regenerate in the understory of undisturbed stands.																	0029-344X					AUG	1996	70	3					223	229									WOS:A1996VM14200004						
J	Pake, CE; Venable, DL				Pake, CE; Venable, DL			Seed banks in desert annuals: Implications for persistence and coexistence in variable environments	ECOLOGY												It is widely believed that desert annual plants maintain between-year seed banks, yet few field studies actually have measured the proportion of the viable seed bank that remains dormant through a season. Dormancy and germination fractions were quantified for a guild of winter annuals on a creosote flat in the Sonoran Desert for three years. Predictions from two types of theoretical models applicable to temporally variable environments were examined: (1) the evolution of life history traits promoting persistence in the face of temporal variation and (2) the role of temporal variation in mediating species coexistence. The density of ungerminated seeds was estimated by collecting soil samples after germination, but prior to new seed set. Seedlings were followed in nearby plots to estimate the density of germinated seedlings and their reproductive success. Long-term data collected from permanent plots over a 10-yr period were used to calculate temporal variation in reproductive success for each species. Species with higher temporal variation in reproductive success had lower germination fractions and smaller seeds, consistent with the theory that seed dormancy and large seed size are partially substitutable bet-hedging strategies. The data also suggested that this system possesses traits that are necessary for temporal variation to promote coexistence. First, between-year seed banks, necessary to buffer populations in unfavorable years, were documented for 17 species. Second, there was a strong tendency for year-to-year variation in germination fractions to vary among species. Finally, plants germinated more in years of higher reproductive success. We discuss how a correlation between germination and reproductive success enhances the role of temporal variance in success hierarchies in promoting species coexistence.																	0012-9658					JUL	1996	77	5					1427	1435		10.2307/2265540							WOS:A1996UX39600013						
J	Schimmel, J; Granstrom, A				Schimmel, J; Granstrom, A			Fire severity and vegetation response in the boreal Swedish forest	ECOLOGY												We studied plant survival and colonization over an experimental gradient, from fire lightly scorching the soil to fire consuming most of the organic soil layer, at two forest sites in northern Sweden. The gradient was achieved by adding different amounts of fuel to small plots that were burned in 1988 and 1989. Temperature was recorded at four soil strata during burning. We analyzed survival of seeds and rhizomes in the soil immediately after fire, and followed vegetation cover and seedling establishment until 1993. During fire, there was a steep decline in maximum temperature with increasing depth below the char, irrespective of the depth of burn in the mor layer, indicating that burn depth can be used as a general indicator of heat impact below ground. Lethal temperature was not recorded deeper than 20-30 mm under the burn boundary. Plant survival was determined both by depth of burn and by depth distribution of regenerative structures in the soil. Three rhizomatous species, the dwarf shrubs Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea and the grass Deschampsia flexuosa, were dominant in the prefire vegetation. For all three species, the bulk of the soil bud bank was located within the mor layer, but was more superficial for D. flexuosa. Initial mortality in the bud bank was progressively higher with increasing depth of burn, and this determined the regrowth over the following years. After fires that consumed only the moss layer, cover of the Vaccinium species returned to prefire levels within 2-4 yr, and D. flexuosa showed a dramatic increase in cover as well as in fruiting. Fires that burned slightly deeper nearly eliminated D. flexuosa, and the deepest burning fires also eliminated Vaccinium spp. In contrast to regrowth from rhizomes, colonization from seed was better after relatively deep-burning fire, both for species with a soil seed bank and for species dispersing seed onto the burnt soil. However, after fires consuming most of the organic soil layer, seed bank species were also badly affected, whereas dispersers showed progressively better establishment with increasing depth of burn. Differences between treatments were still great after 5 yr, indicating that variation in depth of burn will have a long-lasting impact on the vegetation. These results from experimentally burned plots were corroborated by an analysis of depth distribution of viable plant rhizomes and seeds, and the initial colonization at a site newly burned in a wildfire. The precise response patterns of boreal vegetation to variation in burn depth will depend on characteristics of the species present. However, we assume that these results have a high degree of generality, since, in podzolized soils, most rhizomatous species are predominantly located in the mor layer, since the dormant seed bank typically is concentrated at the interface of mor and mineral soil, and also since a thick organic soil layer is a poor seedbed for incoming seeds. The results indicate that in boreal forest, depth of burn is a more important variable than fire front intensity for the understory vegetation, in contrast to the situation in ecosystems with little accumulation of organic material on the mineral soil.																	0012-9658					JUL	1996	77	5					1436	1450		10.2307/2265541							WOS:A1996UX39600014

The major principles of reducing the seed bank and controlling the weed in the germination and parasitic/reproductive phases are critically reviewed. Practices to control broomrape include physical methods (weeding, soil tillage, flooding, irrigation, solarization, flaming), chemical methods (soil fumigation, herbicide application, use of germination stimulants) and biological methods (use of resistant or tolerant varieties, cropping systems with trap and catch crops, intercropping, biological control with insects or fungi). Cultural practices which help to avoid germination, infection or strong reproduction of the weed or improve the crop's tolerance should be optimized. However, no single cheap method can control the weed, so integrated management practices are required. Integrated control strategies are site- and cropping-system specific but have in common that measures are taken to kill part of the seed bank, induce the conditioned seeds to germinate in the absence of the commercial crop, kill emerging Orobanche shoots before seed set during growth of the commercial crop and further reduce or avoid damage to the commercial crop.																	0931-2250					JUL	1996	176	5					335	359		10.1111/j.1439-037X.1996.tb00479.x							WOS:A1996VE84400007						
J	Cocks, PS; Osman, AE				Cocks, PS; Osman, AE			Productivity and botanical composition of communally-owned Mediterranean grasslands in the marginal farming areas of north Syria	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Herbage production in winter and spring, seed bank size in summer and soil fertility were measured in two transects across dry Mediterranean grasslands in north-west Syria. The transects were repeated in 1983/84 and 1984/85. Measurements were taken inside and outside wire cages that protected the quadrats from grazing. The results, which were analysed using regression and cluster analyses, showed severe soil degradation, with lime content reaching 50% on the steeper slopes, indicating erosion of top soil. The soil contained low amounts of both available phosphorus and total nitrogen. The total amount of herbage produced depended strongly on plant numbers, the relationship between herbage and numbers weakening with time. Total herbage production tended to be greatest where clay content was high. Herbs and legumes increased during the growing season, while grasses decreased. Seed banks, dominated by grasses, were highest on sandy soils. Grass and herb seed banks were transient, most seed germinating by February each year. In contrast the legume seed bank was extremely persistent, with less than 5% of the seed bank producing plants in either year. Protection from grazing had little effect on feed on offer in 1983/84, suggesting that sheep obtained little, if any, benefit from grazing during the growing period. The sheep did however, reduce seed set. We concluded that (1) both soil and vegetation were degraded, (2) the grassland will continue to deteriorate unless grazing is controlled, and (3) the grassland will respond to improved management.

A hydrology component of the model calculated changes in water storage based on precipitation, evapotranspiration, snowpack, surface runoff, and subsurface inflow. A spatially explicit vegetation component in the model calculated changes in distribution of vegetative cover and open water, depending on water depth, seasonality, and existing type of vegetation. The model reproduced four known dry periods and one extremely wet period during the three decades. One simulated dry period in the early 1980s did not actually occur. Simulated water levels compared favorably with continuous observed water levels outside the calibration period (1990-1992). Changes in vegetative cover were realistic except for years when simulated water levels were significantly different than actual levels. These generally positive results support the use of the model for exploring the effects of possible climate changes on wetland resources.																	0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					871	881		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0871							WOS:A1996VN45800009						
J	Chen, CY; Folt, CL				Chen, CY; Folt, CL			Consequences of fall warming for zooplankton overwintering success	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY					Symposium on Regional Assessment of Freshwater Ecosystems and Climate Change in North America	OCT 24-26, 1994	LEESBURG, VA	Amer Soc Limnol & Oceanog, N Amer Benthol Soc, US EPA, US Geol Survey				Increased temperatures in fall as predicted by recent climate models will have important consequences for the overwintering strategies and seasonal phenologies of organisms in temperate lakes. We compare fall thermal responses of species representatives of the copepod Epischura lacustris and the cladoceran Daphnia catawba. Daily temperatures and weekly population densities were measured in a lake where these species co-occur, and demographic variables for each species (survival, reproduction, egg hatching, and production of resting stages) were assessed over a temperature range of 15 to 30 degrees C in the laboratory. This study provides three types of evidence that the success of these species could be altered by fall warming events (temperatures > 15 degrees C). First, resting eggs of E. lacustris could be stimulated to hatch from the ''seed bank'' in fall. If so, they would be unable to reach maturity before winter, and the cohort could be lost. Second, sexually reproducing D. catawba populations in fall could be induced to switch from sexual to asexual reproduction. This switch could delay production and reduce the number of ephippial resting eggs. Third, on the basis of thermal tolerances, E. lacustris is representative of a species whose geographic range is likely to be altered by warming at any time. Over the long term, the disruption of overwintering strategies by warming in fall could be a mechanism that alters the geographic ranges of species.																	0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					1077	1086		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1077							WOS:A1996VN45800030						
J	Norton, TA; Melkonian, M; Andersen, RA				Norton, Trevor A.; Melkonian, Michael; Andersen, Robert A.			Algal biodiversity	PHYCOLOGIA												The relevance of algae to the current debate on global biodiversity is assessed. Algal diversity is considered at the levels of richness of species and of higher taxonomic ranks and as the variety of habitats algae dominate and their functional importance in the processes they mediate. The geographical distribution of algae indicates substantial differences in species richness and degree of endemism in different regions. Coasts with the greatest diversity of algae occur in both temperate and tropical seas. High degrees of endemism in seaweeds seem unrelated to overall species richness. Information is sparse for the microalgae, but for some groups high endemism occurs in regions of low diversity. The potential vulnerability of algae and algal communities and the possible consequences of their depletion or extinction are assessed. There is an urgent need to inventory the world's algae, conserve species in culture collections and genetic stocks in 'seed' banks, as well as to preserve natural communities by protecting sites of phycological importance. Current progress in these endeavours and some inherent problems are discussed and recommendations are made. The current dearth of appropriately trained phycologists is also identified as a major brake on progress, for algal taxonomists are perhaps the most threatened species of all.																	0031-8884					JUL	1996	35	4					308	326		10.2216/i0031-8884-35-4-308.1							WOS:000203404200002						
J	Rorslett, B; Johansen, SW				Rorslett, B; Johansen, SW			Remedial measures connected with aquatic macrophytes in Norwegian regulated rivers and reservoirs	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT					International Workshop on Remedial Strategies in Regulated Rivers	SEP 25-28, 1995	LYCKSELE, SWEDEN	Swedish Environmental Protect Agcy				Enhanced growth of aquatic macrophytes have been recorded from some Norwegian rivers regulated for generating hydropower, and reducing the aquatic vegetation to manageable levels is desirable. Weir building is a common practice on Norwegian low flow reaches, but this in turn can result in silting and nuisance growth of macrophytes. Using herbicides to treat aquatic systems is not allowed by the Norwegian environmental authorities and alternative methods of macrophyte control have to be employed. In contrast, many regulated rivers and reservoirs are devoid of macrophytes and the management aim then is to restore native aquatic vegetation. Mechanical methods using harvesters and cutting devices are often difficult to implement in running water. Better results have been achieved utilizing flushing flows to scour sediments and associated macrophytes. Using a sharply peaking flow gives a more efficient control of excessive macrophyte growth because only the initial surge actively scours the river bed. Moss quantities flushed out in a number of controlled flows exhibited a strong log-linear relationship to significant how, Q*, in River Suldalslagen, south-western Norway. Temporarily halting hydroelectric facilities during cold spells to drain the river and thereby expose submerged macrophytes to frost, has been applied to the River Otra in southern Norway. An attendant ice run resulted in heavy loss of macrophytes in this river. The benefit of winter draw-downs combined with flushing flow is partly offset by downstream accumulation of the removed plants. The potential to revegetate shores of reservoirs and impoundments has been studied in Meltingen, a regulated lake in mid-Norway. This field study indicates that amending the shore substrate by light dressing with fertilizer results in enhanced survival of amphibious species. This study also demonstrates the need for sediment seed banks or nearby sanctuaries from which aquatic species can extend into the reservoir during years with a favourable high water level. Reducing the designated fluctuation range of reservoir elevation from 7 to 1.6 m resulted in recolonization by submerged macrophytes in Hartevatn, a reservoir on the upper River Otra.																	0886-9375					JUL-OCT	1996	12	4-5					509	522									WOS:A1996VK75500014						
J	Albrecht, H; Forster, EM				Albrecht, H; Forster, EM			The weed seed bank of soils in a landscape segment in southern Bavaria .1. Seed content, species composition and spatial variability	VEGETATIO												The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition and the spatial variability of the arable soil seed bank in one large, coherent landscape segment, where the cultivation practice of neighboring farms and the gradients in soil properties determine the distribution of the weed seeds in soil. To this end, a 50 x 50 m grid of 338 reference points was fixed throughout a 143 ha area in southern Bavaria. The seed bank contained a median density of 4950 seeds per m(2) able to germinate. These values showed remarkable variation throughout the investigated area. Thus, 27% of the sampling area contained less than 2500 seeds per m(2), another 23% were below 5000 seeds per m(2) and 19% ranged among 5000 and 10 000 germinating seeds per m(2). Among the remaining sites, 22% showed seed densities between 10 000 and 20 000 and 9% more than 20 000 seeds per m(2). To visualize the spatial distribution of the weed seed bank over the whole study area, the interpolation method kriging was used. For this purpose the spatial continuity must be described by means of a semivariogram analysis. The goodness of the interpolation results depends on the fit of the semivariogram model which shows the spatial dependency. Two important characteristic parameters of this model are the nugget and the range. The nagger expresses the sampling error and the local variability up to the 50 m sampling distance, which cannot be detected by the semivariogram. Therefore the interpolation cannot describe the seed bank variation on a scale below this threshold. In our investigations the nugget comprises about one third of the total variance. The estimation error increases towards the border of the investigated area. In general, this is due to missing sampling points at the field edges. The range observed in the present investigations was 340 m. Beyond this no more spatial variability exists and the measurements are independent of each other. The species occurring in more than five of the investigated samples were ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis and classified by k-means cluster analysis of the ordination axes. Five weed communities were recognized from this analysis which distinctly differed in their relation to the soil type and to the preceding management.

(Brassicaceae) introduced to Central Europe in the 18th century recently entered a phase of rapid spread accompanied by sudden establishments of extensive dominance stands mainly on roadside locations. We studied vegetation structure and expansion rate of B. orientalis stands and performed a series of experiments to investigate key factors that underlie the colonizing and establishment of B. orientalis. Reiterated observations exposed a high current expansion rate of B. orientalis populations and vegetation surveys of B. orientalis stands showed that these stands were mainly composed of Artemisietea and Arrhenateretea species. Regeneration experiments with root fragments revealed high regeneration capacities: root fragments of 3 cm length showed 93% regeneration, varying water content (10-50% water loss) and separation into root cortex and root stele yielded regeneration of 30 to 50%. In a field study high regrowth after mowing with varying mowing intensity indicates B. orientalis to be well adapted to disturbed sites as its preferential locations for development of dominance stands. Vegetative growth parameters were studied in two controlled growth experiments with elevated nutrient availabilities. B. orientalis exhibited a high sensitivity to nutrient addition and rosette sizes of maximal 90 cm were reached. Biomass was comparable or even higher than that of native ruderals grown in the same experiment. Measurements of reproductive parameters revealed a high reproductive effort (0.2 to 0.45 g g(-1)) even under intense mowing regimes, resulting in a dense seed bank with maximal values of about 400 fruits (congruent to 550 seeds) l(-1) soil. With respect to colonization and establishment of B. orientalis the results of our study enable the formulation of three hypotheses.																	0042-3106					JUL	1996	125	1					73	82		10.1007/BF00045206							WOS:A1996VJ80900007

Aschers. and Juncus bulbosus L. were carried out. The addition of powdered limestone to acidified moorland pools led to increased phosphate levels in the water layer and increased carbon dioxide levels in the sediment pore water and the water column; this resulted in an excessive growth of Juncus bulbosus. Similar observations were made in seed bank experiments, conducted in a greenhouse. After 2 years the abundance of J. bulbosus was very high. Littorella uniflora and Lobelia dortmanna L. germinated spontaneously and developed in mini-ecosystems with sediments from the Padvindersven and the Peetersven, respectively, two moorland pools from which these species had disappeared a few decades ago, Spontaneous germination and development of endangered soft water macrophytes only occurred on sediments after removal of the organic sapropelium layer. Therefore, this study showed that in order to restore the original water chemistry of acidified moorland pools, removal of the organic sapropelium layer is necessary, as well for improving vegetation development.

This study examines seed bank attributes in habitats associated with slash-burn agriculture and with the more recent expansion of grasslands. We estimated the abundance and floristic composition of seeds in the soil from induced grasslands, milpa fields neighboring early and mature forests, and from secondary forest and mature tropical rain forest (15 samples by site, 2-3 replicated sites per successional stage). A total of 130 species germinated from the soil samples. The seeds of late successional tree species were scarce in all the seed soil samples (<2% of che species). Twenty-five early successional species accounted for ca. 70 percent of all individuals. Soil seed density (but not species richness) increased as milpas and fallows dominated the landscape. Affinity analysis based on presence/absence and abundance data showed a different soil seed bank composition for the grasslands when compared to that of all other successional communities. Our results suggest that current expansion of pastures and agricultural fields modifies seed deposition and storage patterns in the soil that may alter the process of secondary succession. This compromises both the regenerating potential of tropical rain forest in the region, and the sustainability of traditional practices and economic relationships of the Lacandon Maya.

J	Bradstock, RA; Bedward, M; Scott, J; Keith, DA				Bradstock, RA; Bedward, M; Scott, J; Keith, DA			Simulation of the effect of spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes on the population viability of a Banksia species	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Populations of plants that rely on seeds for recovery from disturbance by fire (obligate seeders) are sensitive to regimes of frequent fire. Obligate seeders are prominent in fire-prone heathlands of southern Australia and South Africa. Population extinction may occur if there are successive fires during a plant's juvenile period. Research on the population biology of obligate seeders has influenced the management of fire in these heath and shrublands, but work on the effects of the spatial variability of fires is lacking. We hypothesize that extinction may be avoided under an adverse fire frequency if fires are patchy. We present a model that simulates the effects of spatial and temporal variations in fire regimes on the viability of a plant populations in a grid landscape. Seedling establishment, maturation, senescence, and seed dispersal determine the presence of absence of plants in each cell. We used values typical of serotinous Banksia species to estimate probability of extinction in relation to fire frequency, spatial burning pattern and size variance, and the size of the grid. Simulations 200 years in length indicated that extinction probability was lowest when fire frequency was intermediate and man fire size was large. When fire frequency was high, extinction probability was high irrespective of fire size. Senescence was more important than high-frequency fire as a cause of extinction in cells. Interactions between dispersal, fire frequency, and size were complex, indicating that extinction is governed by interactions between dispersal, fire frequency, and size were complex, indicating that extinction is governed by intercell connectivity. The model indicates that fire patchiness cannot be assumed to ensure avoidance of extinction of populations. Conservation of populations is most likely when fire patchiness is relatively low-when the size of fires is moderate to large and when burned patches are contiguous.

J	AlvarezBuylla, ER; Chaos, A; Pinero, D; Garay, AA				AlvarezBuylla, ER; Chaos, A; Pinero, D; Garay, AA			Demographic genetics of a pioneer tropical tree species: Patch dynamics, seed dispersal, and seed banks	EVOLUTION												We consider whether changes in population-genetic structure through the life cycle of Cecropia obtusifolia, a tropical pioneer tree, reflect its gap-dependent demography and the role of evolutionary processes that are important for this species. We asked whether the spatial scale at which population-genetic subdivision occurs corresponds to the scale of habitat patchiness created by gap dynamics; whether patterns of seed dispersal and storage in the soil affect spatial genetic patterns: and whether spatial genetic patterns change through the species life cycle. We estimated Wright's F-statistics for six successive life-history stages for individuals grouped into subpopulations according to occurrence in natural gaps, physical proximity, or occurrence within large quadrats. For each life stage, F-ST-statistics were significantly higher when individuals were grouped by gaps, although concordant patterns across life stages for the three grouping methods were obtained. This supports the hypothesis that patchy recruitment in gaps or among-gap heterogeneity influences the species' genetic structure. F-statistics of seeds collected from females before dispersal (tree seeds), seed-rain seeds, soil seeds, seedlings, juveniles, and adults grouped by gaps, were, respectively: F-IT = 0.004, 0.160, 0.121, 0.091, -0.0002, -0.081; F-IS = -0.032, 0.124: 0.118, 0.029, -0.016, -0.083; and F-ST = 0.035, 0.041, 0.003, 0.063, 0.015, 0.002. Spatial genetic differentiation in rain seeds was not significantly lower than that of tree seeds. The loss of genetic structure in the soil seed bank, relative to that found in the seed rain may be due to sampling artifacts, but alternative explanations, such as microsite selection or temporal Wahlund effect are also discussed. If structure among soil seeds is unbiased, the peak in seedling F-ST may be due to microsite selection. F-IS of seeds in the rain and soil were significantly greater than zero. A Wahlund effect is the most likely cause of these positive F-IS values. Such fine-scale substructuring could be caused by correlated seed deposition by frugivores. The decrease in F-IS from seedlings to adults could result from loss of fine-scale genetic structure during stand thinning or from selection.

J	Daskalakou, EN; Thanos, CA				Daskalakou, EN; Thanos, CA			Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) postfire regeneration: The role of canopy and soil seed banks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), is the dominant tree of a large fraction (26%) of the Greek coniferous forests; this species is an endemic pine of the Mediterranean Rim and well adapted to fire. Its regeneration is accomplished exclusively through seeds, thus its soil and canopy seed banks are of paramount importance for postfire resilience. Cone opening and seed dispersal were investigated in unburned forests of Attica (Greece) and it was found that Pinus halepensis trees maintain a significant percentage of the yearly cone crop (40-80%) closed, thus creating a persistent, canopy seed bank. Full viability of enclosed seeds was maintained for at least three years in canopy storage; moreover, preliminary results concerning the viability of seeds enclosed within the cones for four to more than 50 years showed a gradual reduction of both final percentage and rate of germination. Nevertheless, cones of up to 20 years of age contained a considerable fraction of germinable seeds. On the other hand, Aleppo pine forms only a short-lived (transient) soil seed bank; this bank was particularly abundant after a fire, as a result of the fire-induced cone opening. The germinable seed portion, although quite important prior to the start of the rainy season, was rapidly depleted, and at the end of the rainy season it was virtually absent in both burned and unburned forests. It is therefore concluded that postfire Aleppo pine seedling recruitment takes place almost exclusively during the first year after the fire and depends upon the germination of seeds in a transient soil bank which is produced by the postfire dispersal of pine seeds stored in the canopy seed bank.

Standardised autecological data for 15 of the more important Miller's Dale species were obtained from the Integrated Screening Programme (ISP), and their functional attributes were reviewed in the context of a larger database, broadly representative of the British flora. Ordination of adult plant attributes demonstrated that the Miller's Dale species are strategically relatively uniform; most are slow-growing, evergreen and tolerant of mineral nutrient deficiency. Ordination of seed attributes revealed more variety among the Miller's Dale species; the main axis of variation was from species with large, transient seeds (mostly grasses) to species with small, persistent seeds (mostly dicots). From the ordination we derive the predictions that germination of the latter species will be more temporally opportunistic and more inhibited by the presence of vegetation than the former. These predictions are consistent with data collected in experimental studies of seed persistence and germination at the site. These data suggest that spatial and temporal variation in opportunities for regeneration is an important mechanism contributing to the high species richness of dry limestone grasslands.																	1100-9233					JUN	1996	7	3					371	380		10.2307/3236280							WOS:A1996VB05600008						
J	Virgona, JM; Dear, BS				Virgona, JM; Dear, BS			Comparative performance of Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum cv Monaro) after 11 years under low-input conditions in south-eastern Australia	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The productivity, composition, and quality of plots containing four legume cultivars (T. repens cv. Haifa, T. ambiguum cvs Monaro and Alpine, and T. subterraneum cv. Woogenellup) was examined 11 years after establishment. The cultivars were sown in 1981 with 250 kg/ha molybdenum (Mo) superphosphate and after 1 year were grazed in common with the surrounding paddock. No further fertiliser was added over the next 10 years. In June 1992, the plots were split with half receiving 280 kg/ha Mo superphosphate (High-Pert) and the other none (Low-Pert), and were subsequently harvested every 8 weeks from August 1992 until September 1993. When averaged across harvests, Monaro produced more dry matter (DM) at High-Pert and had a significantly higher sown-legume content (75%) than Alpine and Woogenellup. At Low-Pert, total DM production was similar among cultivars but Monaro had significantly higher legume content (22%). These differences mainly occurred over spring and autumn. Herbage (unsorted) that accumulated over October-November 1992 was analysed for in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD). The addition of fertiliser increased OMD from 67.8 to 71.5% and crude protein from 9.2 to 15.5% when averaged across cultivars. Plots containing Monaro had significantly greater OMD (74.1%) and crude protein content (14.8%) than the other cultivars averaged across fertiliser treatments. There was no fertiliser by cultivar interaction for OMD or crude protein content. The main difference in the composition of the readily germinable seed bank was that Monaro plots contained the least number of germinating seedlings because of the lower invasion from non-sown legumes. After 11 years of low-input conditions, plots containing Monaro had superior legume content and digestibility and were able to productively respond to fertiliser addition.																	0028-8233					JUN	1996	39	2					245	253		10.1080/00288233.1996.9513183							WOS:A1996UZ51800008

Purdie (Fabaceae), found in Marlborough, South Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In the wild, adult Chordospartium muritai shrubs and trees up to 6 m tall are confined to a single population in the northern South Island. There are few juveniles and seedlings have only recently been recorded. Seed viability, germination requirements, fate of seeds in the soil seed bank, and seedling growth were investigated. Seeds required scarification, after which a high proportion germinated over a wide range of temperatures, but particularly between 20 degrees C and 24 degrees C. The few seeds that survived a year's burial were still viable, suggesting the effects of soil scarification. Seedling growth was very slow and 65% of seedlings that survived the first 2 years reached a height of only 12 cm. Site factors including past grazing, competition from herbs, and lack of suitable substrates, are considered largely responsible for the failure of C. muritai regeneration. The management implications of the results are discussed.				Norton, David/D-6978-2011													0028-825X					JUN	1996	34	2					199	204									WOS:A1996UZ14600008						
J	Burrows, CJ				Burrows, CJ			Germination behaviour of seeds of the New Zealand woody species Melicope simplex, Myoporum laetum, Myrsine divaricata, and Urtica ferox	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Germination rates, percentage germination success, and phenomena related to germination delay were determined for seeds from freshly collected fruit of Melicope simplex, Myoporum laetum, Myrsine divaricata, and Urtica ferox. The disseminule of Myoporum is unusual in having up to four seeds enclosed in fused endocarp tissue. The tests were carried out in an unheated, partially shaded glasshouse in Christchurch, in a range of conditions similar to those that the seeds might experience after natural dispersal. In the standard treatment (cleaned, kept moist, well lit) subsets of seeds in a cohort germinated at intervals over three, four, or five years, according to species. It took about one month (Urtica), two months (Myrsine), five months (Myoporum), or seven months (Melicope) for the first seeds to germinate. Some seeds of each species germinated through the winter and/or spring in the first year. Otherwise, there were episodes of germination, with different proportionate numbers germinating for each species, in each successive year, mainly in spring. The seeds, thus, exhibit deep dormancy, established to differing degrees in subsets of seeds within a cohort. This enables them to germinate in the favourable spring period and to spread risk. Final germination percentages, respectively, for Melicope, Myoporum, Myrsine, and Urtica, were 77%, 90%, 92%, and 59%. No Melicope seeds germinated in the dark and soil treatments. Rapid germination occurred for Myrsine seeds in the dark and Myoporum seeds on soil. When the endocarp of Myoporum disseminules was cut to expose the seeds the germination rate was very similar to that in the standard treatment; no seeds of this species germinated when left in fruit. It is very likely that seeds of the four species, (especially Urtica and Melicope) could form relatively long-term seed banks. As plant species with deeply dormant seeds seem to be relatively scarce in New Zealand lowland forests, the existence of this phenomenon could relate to the earlier phylogeny of the taxa which possess it. Relatives of both Urtica (in Europe) and Myoporum (in Australia) have deeply dormant seeds.																	0028-825X					JUN	1996	34	2					205	213									WOS:A1996UZ14600009						
J	Sem, G; Enright, NJ				Sem, G; Enright, NJ			The relationship between seed rain and the soil seed bank in a temperate rainforest stand near Auckland, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Composition of the germinable seed rain and the soil seed bank is documented for five sites in temperate rainforest near Auckland, New Zealand, in an effort to understand the dynamics of the soil seed bank. The seed rain added a mean of 202 +/- 93 germinable seeds per 0.1 m(2) over 15 months to the forest floor in 1988 and a total of 40 species (range 15-25 per site). The source of seeds included both native forest species growing on-site, and adventive species of which most were growing off-site. Species richness of the seed rain was highest in summer (32 species) and lowest in winter (6 species). However, density of the recorded seed rain was highest in late autumn-early winter from high seed rain and massive germination in May and June of seeds from the native tree, Kunzea ericoides, at two sites in the early stages of forest regrowth. Seed germination from soil samples which had been denied seed inputs for 15 mo identified the density (52 +/- 41/0.1 m(2)) and composition (18 species, range 2-9) of the 'persistent' component of the seed bank (i.e., seed longevity >1 y). Native woody species were poorly represented in the persistent seed bank relative to native herbs and adventives. An estimated 10% of the annual seed rain enters the persistent soil seed bank. The presence, and dynamics of turnover for most species in the persistent seed bank can be explained as a balance between additions of new individuals and loss of old individuals over one to a few years. At the same time, the combination of high persistent seed bank densities and low seed rain inputs for a few adventive species (e.g., Phytolacca octandra, Juncus bufonius) indicates that seed of these species may derive from individuals which grew at or near the site at some time in the past.

J	Kitajima, K; Tilman, D				Kitajima, K; Tilman, D			Seed banks and seedling establishment on an experimental productivity gradient	OIKOS												A major cause of the lower species richness of nitrogen enriched grasslands with high productivity is the lower colonization rate of such areas by new species. To determine what role the soil seed bank might play, we performed greenhouse germination tests of soil sampled in experimental plots that had received various rates of annual nitrogen addition for II yr. Species composition of the soil seed bank depended on the rate of N-addition, even though the species richness and the overall density of viable seeds in soil were independent of N-addition. The proportion of the species shared between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation decreased with N-addition. The density of forb seedlings emerging in field plots was negatively correlated with the nitrogen input, productivity, and litter depth, but the probability of seedling survival from May through August was not different among treatments. Thus, suppression of seed germination, rather than limitation of the availability of seeds in soil or seedling survivorship, was the primary mechanism of lower colonization rates in the high-N plots. Burning in spring decreased litter depth and promoted germination of forbs, especially in no-N control plots. However, germination was still very low in the high-N plots even after fire decreased litter depth to a level similar to that of controls.

J	Grant, CD; Bell, DT; Koch, JM; Loneragan, WA				Grant, CD; Bell, DT; Koch, JM; Loneragan, WA			Implications of seedling emergence to site restoration following bauxite milling in western Australia	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Seedling emergence of 12 selected northern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Smith) forest species were investigated to assist Alcoa of Australia Ltd. in maximizing the establishment of topsoil species in re-habilitated bauxite mining sites. The species, which encompassed a range of seed weights (0.024 mg to 87 mg), plant families, seed-storage types, life forms, and germination requirements, were placed on the soil surface and at depths of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 cm under controlled conditions in a glasshouse. Ability to emerge from deep burial was found to depend on feed size for species that annually release their seed to the topsoil but not for species that store their seed on the plant. All selected species were capable of emerging from 2 cm depth of burial, but eight of the 12 species were either unable to emerge from 5 cm or showed a significant reduction in emergence from 5 cm depth of burial compared to optimally buried seed. This group included two small-seeded species, Stylidium calcaratum and Chamaescilla corymbosa; the major forest dominant, Eucalyptus marginata; the serotinous canopy-borne seed of Hakea amplexicaulis; and the wind-dispersed seed of Xanthorrhoea gracilis. A few seeds of the legume species Kennedia coccinea, Acacia pulchella, and Bossiaea aquifolium established seedlings from depths of 15 cm, Currently, Alcoa removes the upper 15 cm of topsoil separately from the underlying soil prior to the commencement of mining. This topsoil is respread at a similar depth following mining as part of the rehabilitation procedure. It is recommended that Alcoa continue to strip topsoil to a depth of 15 cm but investigate the option of respreading topsoil onto rehabilitated pits at a shallower depth to maximize establishment via the sail seed bank.																	1061-2971					JUN	1996	4	2					146	154		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00115.x							WOS:A1996UR75400004						
J	Biedenbender, SH; Roundy, BA				Biedenbender, SH; Roundy, BA			Establishment of native semidesert grasses into existing stands of Eragrostis lehmanniana in southeastern Arizona	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The semidesert grassland in southern Arizona has changed from a native grassland to a scattered Prosopis juliflora var. velutina (mesquite) woodland with an understory of African Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass) on many sites. To determine native grass restoration potential, seven species were direct seeded into E. lehmanniana stands that were left alive, burned, sprayed with an herbicide and then either left standing, or mowed. Initial native grass establishment was limited in the live standing treatment but was successful for all other treatments when either June or August sowing was followed by consistent summer precipitation and soil water availability. Four species, Bothriochloa barbinodis (cane beardgrass), Bouteloua curtipendula (sideoats grama), Digitaria californica (Arizona cottontop), and Leptochloa dubia (green spangletop) initially established most successfully, while only Muhlenbergia porteri (bush muhly) had consistently limited or no establishment. E. lehmanniana establishment from the seed bank was increased by canopy removal associated with burning. Densities of native grasses one year after successful initial establishment were much lower than that off. lehmanniana. A possible revegetation strategy would be to spray emergent E. lehmanniana seedlings and surviving plants with an herbicide during the summer rainy season after spring burning. Native grasses could then be established by sowing in early August of that year or June and August of subsequent years until consistent precipitation produces a native grass stand.																	1061-2971					JUN	1996	4	2					155	162		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00116.x							WOS:A1996UR75400005						
J	Orr, DM; Paton, CJ; Blight, GW				Orr, DM; Paton, CJ; Blight, GW			An improved method for measuring the germinable soil seed banks of tropical pastures	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												The accuracy of 2 methods for determining germinable soil seed banks was compared in soil cores containing known seed loads of 5 tropical grasses placed on sand columns in pots. A sprayed method watered soil cores for 30 minutes per day, and a capillary method watered cores by capillary action from shallow trays. The sprayed method produced significantly (P<0.05) higher seedling emergence than the capillary method and gave more reliable estimates of seed load. In a second pot experiment, using soil cores from a grazing experiment, the sprayed method again resulted in significantly (P<0.05) higher seedling emergence than the capillary method. We consider that the sprayed method more closely simulates the natural process in a field situation, where seeds are subjected to daily fluctuations in moisture potential rather than being continuously wet, as occurs with the capillary method.																	0049-4763					JUN	1996	30	2					201	205									WOS:A1996VA37800002						
J	VivianSmith, G; Handel, SN				VivianSmith, G; Handel, SN			Freshwater wetland restoration of an abandoned sand mine: Seed bank recruitment dynamics and plant colonization	WETLANDS												We examined plant recruitment from two soil seed banks used in the freshwater wetland restoration of an abandoned sand mine in South Brunswick, New Jersey. One seed bank was already present at the mine prior to restoration; the other was imported from a nearby wetland to be destroyed by road development. We also investigated the effects of pH and water regime on recruitment in a greenhouse study and assessed plant recruitment at the restoration site during the first growing season. Multivariate analysis of recruitment in greenhouse communities revealed differential responses of the two seed banks to pH and water regime treatments. In the wetland soil, species richness and plant density responded favorably to inundation and increased pH treatments. In the mine soil, species richness and density were greatest with non-inundated and unadjusted pH conditions. The imported seed bank was characterized by greater species richness (n=21) than the mine seed bank (n=14). Mean recruit density was also greater in the wetland soil (263.6 individuals/m(2)) than the mine soil (60.1 individuals/m(2)). Recruits unique to the imported wetland seed bank included a significant proportion of obligate wetland species (52.4%). More species were censused in the field study (82) compared to the greenhouse study (24), with 23.2% of species present in both studies. A lower proportion of obligate wetland species (24.0%) was present in the field. The imported wetland seed bank was the major contributor to species richness and plant density, indicating that the use of imported soils as an amendment may enhance success of wetland restoration projects.																	0277-5212					JUN	1996	16	2					185	196		10.1007/BF03160692							WOS:A1996UU25900009						
J	Evans, AS; Mitchell, RJ; Cabin, RJ				Evans, AS; Mitchell, RJ; Cabin, RJ			Morphological side effects of using gibberellic acid to induce germination: Consequences for the study of seed dormancy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												To assess the evolutionary significance of persistent seed banks, phenotypes of naturally germinating seeds must be compared with those that remain dormant under the same environmental conditions. Dormant seeds can often be induced to germinate by application of gibberellic acid (GA). However, this method is valid only if there are no phenotypic ''side effects'' of GA that could confound comparisons between dormant and naturally germinating seeds. We examined this assumption in Lesquerella fendleri, a short-lived perennial mustard of the desert Southwest. We exposed 3840 seeds from 16 maternal sibships to two different GA treatments (0 or 1 g/L GA) in two different germination environments (greenhouse and growth chamber), and measured germination and postgermination traits. As expected, application of GA increased germination. GA also had strong and long-lasting effects on seedling morphology. Seeds that received GA developed into seedlings that were taller, with fewer but longer leaves, than seeds that did not receive GA. Effects of GA on both dormancy and postgermination traits varied among maternal sibships. Our results indicate that for this species and this concentration of GA, morphological effects can be substantial. Further study is required to determine whether such side effects are found for lower concentrations of GA, or under conditions that encourage faster seedling growth. Nonetheless, the present results illustrate the importance of testing potential confounding effects of GA in studies of the evolution of seed dormancy and its influence on postgermination traits.

J	Johnson, EA; Fryer, GI				Johnson, EA; Fryer, GI			Why Engelmann spruce does not have a persistent seed bank	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. becomes established after fire by dispersing seeds into a burn, not through the maintenance of a persistent soil seed bank. The objective here was to determine causes of spruce seed loss from the bank to understand its lack of a persistent seed bank. One hundred seeds placed in soil cores were enumerated for 2.5 years and divided into three treatments: (i) varying the amount of protection from predators, (ii) keeping litter intact or removing it, and (iii) placing seeds on top of litter or between litter and mineral soil. For all treatments, fewer than 5% of seeds remained at the end of the study. Predation caused the greatest loss to the seed bank, much greater than germination in all treatments. Removal of litter increased germination, but predation occurred at the same rate; therefore, the total rate of loss to the seed bank increased. Seeds placed between litter and mineral soil experienced greater germination and less predation than seeds placed above the litter layer. However, increased germination balanced the reduced predation so there was little difference in the total rate of loss to the seed bank from seeds placed in either location. Further, seeds appeared to lose viability within two seasons. Thus, there is no persistent seed bank because of high predation and a rapid loss of viability.																	0045-5067					MAY	1996	26	5					872	878		10.1139/x26-095							WOS:A1996UL40500015

The longevity of seeds in the seed bank of the original community is also estimated. The established vegetation was compared with the seed bank, as divided into two layers (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm); this allowed a classification of species into three groups, with (1) transient, (2) short-term persistent and (3) long-term persistent seed bank. The majority of the species of the unfertilized flood-meadow community have a transient or short-term persistent seed bank with seeds showing a large variance in shape i.e. flattened or elongate. Because of this, the characteristic flood-meadow species will disappear soon after the beginning of fertilizer application and will not re-establish from the seed bank, once the fertilizer application is ceased. The formerly fertilized flood-meadow contains many ruderal and arable weed species, the seeds of which tend to be compact or round. Significantly more seeds were found in the seed bank of the formerly fertilized flood-meadow under cattle-grazing than under sheep-grazing and no grazing.																	1100-9233					MAY	1996	7	2					157	164		10.2307/3236315							WOS:A1996UX38300003

After abandonment, encroachment of Juniperus communis starts and a closed woodland can develop within 100 yr. A chronosequence, representing a successional series, was used for the comparison of sites still grazed, and sites ungrazed for about 20, 55 and 80 yr, respectively. Out of the 58 characteristic dry alvar grassland species 55 % disappeared from the established vegetation after 80 yr of abandoning, and 80 % also vanished from the seed bank. Arenaria serpyllifolia, Trifolium repens, Agrostis vinealis, Linum catharticum, Polygala vulgaris, Cerastium fontanum, Luzula campestris, Achillea millefolium and Potentilla tabernaemontani were the only species left in the seed bank. More than 75 % of the dry alvar grassland species were classified as having a transient or short-term persistent seed bank. It is concluded that restoration management, by cutting junipers, of overgrown dry alvar grassland cannot rely on the longevity of seeds in the soil. Seeds have to be dispersed by wind or grazing animals.

J	Baldwin, AH; McKee, KL; Mendelssohn, IA				Baldwin, AH; McKee, KL; Mendelssohn, IA			The influence of vegetation, salinity, and inundation on seed banks of oligohaline coastal marshes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Sea level rise may alter salinity and inundation regimes and create patches of open water in oligohaline coastal marshes, potentially affecting the composition and germination of seed bank species. We conducted seedling emergence experiments to: (1) examine the effects of standing vegetation on the seed banks of three oligohaline marsh communities in coastal Louisiana (dominated by Paspalum vaginatum Sw., Sagittaria lancifolia L., or Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl., respectively); and (2) investigate the effects of salinity and inundation regime on germination of seed bank species. We also studied the effect of a temporary increase in salinity (to simulate a salt water intrusion event) on the viability of buried seeds. We found that the presence or absence of vegetation within a community affected the abundance of some species in the seed bank but had little effect on species composition. Also, the seed banks of the three communities exhibited considerable overlap in species composition and had similar species richness (10-11) and diversity (antilog Shannon-Weaver diversity index = 6.5-7.1), despite differences in vegetation type. Higher salinities and flooding reduced seedling emergence for most species; few species emerged at salinities above four parts per thousand (ppt), and only Sagittaria lancifolia and Eleocharis parvula germinated well under flooded conditions. A temporary increase in salinity did not affect species richness or seedling emergence of most species. Our results suggest that differences in vegetation may have little effect on the composition of seed banks of oligohaline marshes. However, higher salinities and greater depth and duration of inundation (anticipated as global sea level continues to rise) may decrease recruitment of seed bank species, reducing their abundance in oligohaline marsh communities.

The plants exhibit biennial fluctuation in berry production but individual plants retained the same rank among other plants in the number of viable seeds produced per berry from year to year. No significant correlation was found between berry production and precipitation or temperature. Two plants produced about 27% of the total seed output of this population sample while the ten poorest producers contributed <1% of the total seed output.

I carried out two seed burial experiments, one at an outcrop site occupied by a small-seeded population, and another in an experimental garden with soil from the same field site, with seeds representing the local population and a segregating generation of a cross between two other populations. Using logistic regression with data corrected for seed viability, I found an association between small seed size and failure to germinate in the first autumn. The small seed size characterizing many outcrop populations may have evolved as a response to selection for delaying germination in a habitat subject to unpredictable droughts during the growth season.

J	Holderegger, R				Holderegger, R			Effects of litter removal on the germination of Anemone nemorosa L	FLORA												In a recent article, ERIKSSON (1995) showed high germination rates in Anemone nemorosa. To check whether ERIKSSON'S results are also valid in Central Europe, a litter removal experiment was carried out in Northeastern Switzerland. In both experimental series, litter removal plots and control plots, high germination of A. nemorosa occured. Nevertheless, litter removal greatly enhanced germination of A. nemorosa. A significant correlation between seedling number and ramet density within the plots; pointed to a dominance of very local dispersal. These facts lead to the hypothesis that reproduction by seeds in A. nemorosa as well as vegetative reproduction by clonal growth are of great importance for the maintenance of populations of this species. Surprisingly, no successful germination of A. nemorosa was detected in seed bank investigations.																	0367-2530					APR	1996	191	2					175	178									WOS:A1996UH54700008						
J	Hanley, ME; Fenner, M; Edwards, PJ				Hanley, ME; Fenner, M; Edwards, PJ			The effect of mollusc: Grazing on seedling recruitment in artificially created grassland gaps	OECOLOGIA												Two experiments conducted in spring and autumn 1992 examined the effect of mollusc grazing on seedling regeneration from natural grassland seedbanks by creating artificial gaps in plots in a grassland sward. Molluscs were excluded from half the gaps by application of molluscicide. Mollusc grazing in both the spring and autumn experiment significantly reduced seedling recruitment, though the intensity of grazing was greatest in autumn. Recruitment of five species was markedly influenced by molluscicide application. In spring, plots from which molluscs were excluded contained significantly more seedlings of Chenopodium polyspermum and Ranunculus acris. In the autumn, exclusion of molluscs resulted in increased populations of R. acris, Stellaria graminea and Rumex acetosa. Cerastium holosteoides populations were greatest in autumn grazed plots. Other species, notably the grasses Holcus lanatus and Agrostis capillaris and the legume Trifolium repens were unaffected by molluscicide application. Species diversity was significantly decreased by molluscicide application in the autumn. Gap size significantly affected the recruitment of two species. Ranunculus acris populations were significantly higher in small gaps in both spring and summer, while Chenopodium recruitment in the spring was greater in small gaps. Gap size also significantly influenced the risk of mollusc attack on Ranunculus as molluscs appeared to show an aggregative feeding response in the high seedling density small gaps. Selective grazing of vulnerable seedlings by molluscs may influence the eventual relative proportions of the species present and so provide a potent mechanism in shaping community composition in grasslands.																	0029-8549					APR	1996	106	2					240	246		10.1007/BF00328604							WOS:A1996UJ21900013	28307649					
J	Eiszner, H; Salazar, D; Pohlan, J				Eiszner, H; Salazar, D; Pohlan, J			The effect of crop rotation and weed control on the weed seed bank in the soil	TROPENLANDWIRT												Quantitative and qualitative changes in the weed community and the weed seed bank in the soil due to crop relation and weed control measurement were studied by the UNA Managua al ''Las Mercedes'' Experimental Station from 1987 to 1990. A bifactorial permanent field trial combined five grain crop relations and three weed management systems. To determine the weed seed bank in the soil a modified cultivation method was used. Results are showing significant diifferences between crop rotations and weed control systems after the first three year trial period. The level of weed infestation in the field (actual) varied from 88 to 440 ind./m(2), while the weed seed bank in the soil (potential) was determined from 3125 to 12959 secds/m(2), giving emergence rates from 0.5 to 14.2 %. The highest values were registered in the cucumber-soya rotation with 330 ind./m(2) and 6771 seeds/m(2). The chemical weed control with 217 ind./m(2) and 6063 secds/m(2) had a low efficiency due to predominance of tolerate species Rottboellia cochinchinensis, counting until 405 ind./m(2), The lowest actual infestation was reached in the corn-sorghum rotation with 101 ind./m(2) and the lowest potential in the corn-soybean relation with 4010 seeds/m(2), Periodic weed control reduced weed infestation until 109 ind./m(2) and 3531 seeds/m(2).																	0041-3186					APR	1996	97	1					63	73									WOS:A1996VD18000006

J	Agee, JK				Agee, JK			Achieving conservation biology objectives with fire in the Pacific Northwest	WEED TECHNOLOGY					Symposium on the Role of Forest and Rangeland Vegetation Management in Conservation Biology	FEB 01, 1995	SEATTLE, WA	Weed Sci Soc Amer				Fire has been a part of natural ecosystems for many millennia. The species of those ecosystems have evolved through a series of ''coarse filters,'' one of which is resistance or resilience to disturbance by fire. Plant adaptations to fire include the ability to sprout, seed bank adaptations in the soil or canopy, high dispersal ability for seeds, and thick bark. These adaptations are often to a particular fire regime, or combination of fire frequency, intensity, extent, and season. Fire can be used by managers to achieve species to ecosystem-level conservation biology objectives. Examples using prescribed fire include the grasslands of the Puget Trough of Washington State, maintenance of oak woodlands, and perpetuation of ponderosa pine/mixed-conifer forests.

J	deWinton, MD; Clayton, JS				deWinton, MD; Clayton, JS			The impact of invasive submerged weed species on seed banks in lake sediments	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seed banks within submerged sediments were sampled from 21 New Zealand lakes with varying degrees of invasion by vegetatively reproducing, adventive hydrocharitacean species, to examine the influence of vegetation type on seed bank characteristics. Seed number and seed species richness were significantly lower at sites where the submerged vegetation was dominated by the adventive weeds Elodea canadensis Michaux, Egeria densa Planchon or Hydrilla verticillata (Linn. f.) Royle, compared with a predominantly native vegetation. The greater the degree of exclusion of native seed producing plants by adventive weed beds, the greater the apparent impact upon seed abundance, In contrast, seed numbers beneath the adventive weed beds did not differ significantly from sites in lakes where a large scale decline in submerged vegetation had taken place subsequent to hydrocharitacean invasion. The observed impact of weed invasion on lake sediment seed banks is attributed to reduced in situ seed production over time and may be accentuated by increased sediment accumulation beneath tall growing, high biomass weed beds. As seed density influences the speed and extent of germination and plant establishment, our results suggest a large reduction in the re-vegetation potential of invaded lakes. Seed bank decline may also provide an additional 'ecological feedback mechanism' contributing to the maintenance of stable, turbid de-vegetated lakes.																	0304-3770					MAR	1996	53	1-2					31	45		10.1016/0304-3770(95)01010-6							WOS:A1996UV88000004						
J	Myerscough, PJ; Clarke, PJ; Skelton, NJ				Myerscough, PJ; Clarke, PJ; Skelton, NJ			Plant coexistence in coastal heaths: Habitat segregation in the post-fire environment	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Previous studies of heaths on Pleistocene coastal sands showed consistent variation in patterns of floristic composition between areas on ridges and slopes but not within them. A large wild-fire that swept this system provided an opportunity to observe temporal processes in habitat segregation of species. Ridges and slopes were found to differ in species richness of seedlings in 0.0625 m(2) quadrats and there was no evidence that the species richness in the two habitats was converging over 3 years. This suggests that initially these processes differ in space between the two habitats with more species in the wet heath being packed into a smaller area than in the dry heath. Seed-banks of species did not saturate available space for recruitment in either habitat, but seedling densities differed asymmetrically between habitats across two pairs of species studied. Experimental manipulation of seeds among habitats also showed distinct differences in establishment and survival among representative species from different habitats. The presence of seed-banks of wet-heath species in dry heath suggested that recruitment of their seedlings may occur there, but experiments showed that seedlings that arise from them do not survive there. Conversely, although no seed-bank of either dry-heath species studied was found in wet heath, our manipulations showed that their seedlings could grow there. Thus, superficially, physiological tolerance appeared to limit regeneration of wet-heath species in dry heath. However, there appeared to be no physiological limit for dry-heath plants to survive in wet heath. This paper shows that segregation of species may operate at either of two stages of the life cycle: at dispersal when safe sites for establishment are required, and at recruitment after seedlings have established. These findings highlight the importance of the regeneration niche in structuring community composition in coastal heaths, and contrast with traditional explanations of species segregation invoking physiological tolerance and competition at later life-history stages.

J	Clarke, PJ; Myerscough, PJ; Skelton, NJ				Clarke, PJ; Myerscough, PJ; Skelton, NJ			Plant coexistence in coastal heaths: Between- and within-habitat effects of competition, disturbance and predation in the post-fire environment	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Previous experiments on post-fire establishment of two obligate seeders and two resprouting species suggested that initial establishment processes differ between wet- and dry-heath habitats. Disturbance, interspecific competition between seedlings and between seedlings and adults, and access for potential predators were manipulated in the field after a fire to identify mechanisms to explain between- and within-habitat species coexistence. When soil surfaces are disturbed or seeds are buried, dry-heath species can establish in the wet heath. Under natural conditions, however, wet heath is rarely disturbed by animal foragers and lack of safe sites may preclude establishment of dry-heath species. In contrast, dry heath is often disturbed by ground foragers such as bandicoots and safe sites are plentiful for establishment of all heath species. Nevertheless, while wet-heath species can establish in dry heath, their seedlings are apparently unable to survive there due to the drier conditions. No evidence for competition among species was detected in either type of habitat during the first 3 years of the experiment, even at elevated seedling densities. Lack of early competition and unsaturated seed-banks may promote coexistence of species. Seedling predation from vertebrates was low and did not appear to influence patterns of coexistence within or between habitats. In terms of community theory we suggest that several interacting mechanisms are responsible for community structure in heaths after a fire. Chance and microsite disturbance are important during dispersal, while resources are critical during establishment and early survival of seedling populations. In these heath systems where fires burn extensive areas, seed-banks may be more important in temporal storage of species than patch or spatial storage as a mechanism for maintaining coexistence and plant diversity.

After 8 years storage, significant differences on seed germination rate were found among accessions and in the frequency of seeds showing particular phenotypes on the zymograms. Significant correlation was found in the MDH system between germinability rate and frequency of seeds demonstrating isozyme activity. Differences among allelic frequencies for Mdh-1, Mdh-2, Mdh-3 and Idh-1 were found to be statistically significant in the populations analysed. The genetic distance obtained among populations demonstrated that those from N. Africa are the most closely related, followed by population from S. Sardinia. The pattern that emerges from the dendrogram yields a possible explanation for geographic localization of the populations and for the edaphic preferences oi: this species.

J	Vandermeer, J				Vandermeer, J			Disturbance and neutral competition theory in rain forest dynamics	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Subsequent to a disturbance in a tropical rain forest, many new stems arrive, either as new seedlings, previously established seedlings, small saplings, newly germinating seeds that were in the seed bank previously, or as newly germinating seeds that arrived after the disturbance. As the new stems grow, they eventually enter a stage of intense competition, at which point competitive thinning occurs. To describe the various patterns this process may take, a theoretical focus is proposed in which the neutrality of competition among different species of rain forest trees is assumed. Using the total biomass and total number of stems as state variables, the dynamic interaction between these two variables in the post hurricane forest is described. Using this model, six distinct patterns of post disturbance succession are recognized and discussed. Data from post hurricane succession in a tropical rain forest in Nicaragua are applied to one aspect of the theory.																	0304-3800					MAR	1996	85	2-3					99	111		10.1016/0304-3800(94)00152-9							WOS:A1996TY93200001

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The implication of the viable soil seed bank in the early stages of the plant recovery after fire was studied in a recently burnt Mediterranean pine forest of Pinus pinaster. Seed number contained in soil samples taken inmediately after fire and emergent seedling number recorded in the field during the subsequent year were compared. Although the fire effect was important, available seed density in the soil after fire was relatively high (around 2,200 seeds/m(2)). A small group of species containing the main shrub species in the unburnt community predominated both in the viable seed bank and field germination after fire. However, these species showed low germination rates in the field, as opposed to species with the lowest presence in the seed bark. The predominance of woody obligate seeders in the seed bark after fire and the high specific correspondence between seed bank and germination in the field, emphasize the important role of the seed bank contained in the soil before fire in the postfire species establishment.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218												1049-8001					MAR	1996	6	1					31	35		10.1071/WF9960031							WOS:A1996UL00500006

Lodge-pole pine (Pinus contorta Laws.) seeds were tested for ability to germinate after exposing both serotinous and nonserotinous cones for 10 to 60 seconds in a flame front designed to simulate a crown fire. Heating enhanced germination of seeds from serotinous cones but not those from nonserotinous cones. Maximum germination rates for serotinous cone seeds ranged from 37 to 64 percent and occurred after 10-20 seconds exposure of cones to flames. Germination after 60 seconds exposure averaged 0.3 to 14 percent. Maximum germination of seeds from nonserotinous cones (about 80%) occurred with no exposure and after 10 seconds in the flames.																	1049-8001					MAR	1996	6	1					45	49		10.1071/WF9960045							WOS:A1996UL00500008

Bags with germinated seeds were observed beginning in November, Percentage germinated seed increased 4.8 +/- 3.7% in the last month of sampling, Consumption of seeds by bruchids also increased in November, but the effect was highly variable, In the last month of sampling (March in the following year), 35 +/- 18.0% of seeds were affected by bruchids, A predictive seed longevity model was developed considering climatic variables, but data were well described only until January (y = 81.50-0.097 time-3.94 precipitation (r(2) = 0.66)), Undispersed seeds had a high rate of decay and low germination, Longevity was strongly affected by bruchid attack.																	0022-409X					MAR	1996	49	2					147	150		10.2307/4002685							WOS:A1996UA01800011						
J	Creed, JC; Norton, TA; Kain, JM				Creed, JC; Norton, TA; Kain, JM			Are neighbours harmful or helpful in Fucus vesiculosus populations?	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												In order to investigate the effect of density on Fucus vesiculosus L. at all stages of its development, 2 experiments were carried out. A culture study in the laboratory found that increased density resulted in depressed growth and a negatively skewed population structure during the first month in the lives of freshly settled germlings. Intraspecific competition acts even at this early stage, and the limiting factor was probably nutrients. 'Two-sided' ('resource depletion') competition and an early scramble phase of growth may explain negative skewness in plant sizes. On the shore experimental thinning by reduction of the canopy resulted in increased macrorecruitment (apparent density) from a bank of microscopic plants which must have been present for some time. With increased thinning more macrorecruits joined the remaining plants, making population size structures highly positively skewed. Thinning had no effect on reproduction in terms of the portion of biomass as reproductive tissue. Manipulative weeding allows an assessment of the potential spore bank in seasonally reproductive seaweeds and revealed that there are always replacement plants in reserve to compensate for canopy losses. In F. vesiculosus the performance of individuals early on is crucial to their subsequent survival to reproductive stage, as neighbours are generally competitively harmful. However, a failure to 'win' early on may not necessarily result in the ending of a small plant's life - the 'seed' bank still offers the individual a slim chance of survival and protects the population from harmful stochastic events.

Three pre-sowing treatments were applied: (a) no herbicide; (b) herbicide to suppress existing pasture; and (c) herbicide to kill existing pasture. Four oversewing treatments were imposed: (1) no oversewing; (2) hill country ryegrass and 'Prop' white clover; (3) 'Yatsyn' ryegrass and 'Prop' white clover; and (4) a mixture of hill country grass species. Five times as many ryegrass seeds were oversewn than emerged from buried seed, giving the introduced material an advantage. The ryegrass content was greater at the high-fertility sites than at the low-fertility sites, both before and after oversewing. Killing the original pasture tended to increase ryegrass content for 16 months at the low-fertility sites but increased the ryegrass content for less than 9 months at the high-fertility sites. The ryegrass content was not significantly different on any of the sown and unsown plots, 16 months after oversewing. Ryegrass populations, in sown plots on the high-fertility northerly aspect, comprised 70% of the introduced ryegrass and 30% of resident ryegrass, 2 years after oversewing. The number of white clover seeds sown was 70% of that germinating from buried seed, giving the resident material an advantage. As a result, the white clover content was similar in sown and unsown plots, and the introduced white clover germplasm contributed 30% of the clover plant population. At 5 months after oversewing, white clover content was greater under the suppress herbicide. Soil fertility had the greatest influence on both ryegrass and white clover content. Sowing ''other grass'' species increased their content in the pasture and, after 16 months, Agrostis capillaris was the dominant other grass followed by Dactylis glomerata and Holcus lanatus. The results suggest that the genetic structure of ryegrass populations can be changed at high fertility levels provided no large ryegrass seed pool exists, but changes in the content and genetic composition of white clover are more difficult to achieve. The seedling establishment phase is critical for successful introduction of new genotypes and herbicide had little effect at this time.																	0028-8233					MAR	1996	39	1					41	52		10.1080/00288233.1996.9513161							WOS:A1996UM34100004						
J	Burrows, CJ				Burrows, CJ			Germination behaviour of the seeds of seven New Zealand vine species	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Germination rates, percentage germination success, and phenomena related to germination delay were determined for seeds from freshly collected fruit (summer-autumn) of Calystegia tuguriorum, Clematis foetida, Muehlenbeckia australis, Parsonsia heterophylla, Ripogonum scandens, Rubus cissoides, and Tetrapathaea tetrandra. The experimental treatments simulated natural conditions that the seeds might experience after dispersal. In the standard treatment (seeds cleaned, moist, well-lit) seeds of each species behaved differently. Ripogonum seeds germinated through autumn and winter; in late-collected fruit some had germinated viviparously. The large seeds have a very thin testa and are killed by drying. Some Muehlenbeckia seeds germinated in autumn, the rest did not do so until early spring. Clematis and Tetrapathaea seeds did not start germinating until late winter (when temperatures were rising) and all viable seeds had germinated within two months. A few Rubus and Parsonsia seeds germinated, respectively, in autumn and spring. Germination of the remaining seeds occurred at a slow, steady rate for Rubus, for two years, and during warm periods for Parsonsia, for three years. Sporadic germination of hard-coated Calystegia seeds occurred over five years. The amount of germination success was high (89-98%) for Clematis, Ripogonum, Muehlenbeckia, and Tetrapathaea, but only 18, 73, and 82%, respectively, for Calystegia, Parsonsia, and Rubus. In the dark treatment most Tetrapathaea and Parsonsia seeds germinated, but only moderate numbers of Ripogonum, Muehlenbeckia, and Rubus seeds and none of Clematis. In the soil treatment germination success was lower than in the standard treatment and germination rates were slower. The same applied to seeds in the in-fruit treatment for Muehlenbeckia, Parsonsia, and Rubus. No radicles emerged in the in-fruit treatment for Ripogonum, but the embryos of many developed, viviparously, to the immediate pre-emergence stage. Ripogonum, Calystegia, Clematis, Muehlenbeckia, and Tetrapathaea can all maintain short-term seed banks, in fruit, on the parents (for two months or more). Rubus, Parsonsia, and Calystegia seeds can persist in soil seed banks for more than a year. Ripogonum does not maintain soil seed banks. It is not known whether seeds of Clematis and Tetrapathaea can do so. Generally the seed germination phenomena accord well with the habitat preferences of the respective species.																	0028-825X					MAR	1996	34	1					93	102									WOS:A1996UL99900011						
J	White, JJ; VanAuken, OW				White, JJ; VanAuken, OW			Germination, light requirements, and competitive interactions of Stipa leucotricha (gramineae)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Reasons for the atypical distribution of Stipa leucotricha (Texas winter grass), a C-3, cool season perennial bunchgrass, strictly south of 35 degrees N latitude are unknown. Germination requirements, light requirements, and competitive abilities of S. leucotricha were investigated to better understand the biology and possibly explain its persistence in an area reported as more suitable for C-4 species. Aerial, chasmogamous seeds (florets) were dormant, bur when scarified with concentrated sulfuric acid for 15 minutes, germination increased from 18.5 +/- 7.7% to 82.7 +/- 4.6% which suggests seed bank longevity uncharacteristic of most grasses. Aboveground, belowground, and total dry mass of seedlings were significantly, linearly related to light level, with greatest dry mass produced in the highest light treatment. Intraspecific competition for both S. leucotricha and Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem, a co-occurring C-4 perennial) was found at a density as low as 2 plants per pot. Interspecific competition studies demonstrated that growth of both species was greatest in the high light and high nitrogen treatment, and reduced at low light and low nitrogen levels. Comparisons of species differences between mixtures and monocultures indicated that S. leucotricha was a better competitor al high light and nitrogen levels. At low levels of nitrogen and light interspecific competition was equal. These characteristics do not fully explain its distribution strictly south of 35 degrees N latitude; however, its ability to compete with a climax prairie grass species under conditions typical of late successional grassland communities, along with growth during a time of reduced temperature, increased soil moisture, and dormancy of irs competitors are possible causes of the southern distribution of this C-3 grass.																	0038-4909					MAR	1996	41	1					27	34									WOS:A1996VJ85700002						
J	Raffaele, E				Raffaele, E			Relationship between seed and spore banks and vegetation of a mountain flood meadow (mallin) in Patagonia, Argentina	WETLANDS												Soil seed and spore banks are seen to affect the composition and structure of plant communities, especially in wetlands. This study was conducted in a flooded mountain meadow (mallin) in the Nahuel Huapi National Park, Patagonia, Argentina. Species density and composition were determined for spring (November 1989) and autumn (April 1990) using the emergence technique. Viable diaspore( i.e., seed and spores) density was greater for autumn samples (17,063 m(-2)) than for spring samples (10,047 m(-2)). A sizeable pool of fern spores was also found, which represented 17.8 and 60.2% of the autumn and spring collections, respectively. Species composition of the seed and spore banks varied seasonally, and seeds of the dominant mallin species were only present in autumn. Seed bank species were mostly perennials, except Mimulus parviflorus. The composition of the seed bank compared with that of the above-ground vegetation yielded a relatively low correlation between germinable seeds in the soil and the surface plant community. In addition, no ferns were present in the surface community. These results suggest that neither seed nor spore banks control mallin vegetation dynamics, probably because perennial and rhizomatous plants are the dominant components of the wetland community.																	0277-5212					MAR	1996	16	1					1	9		10.1007/BF03160640							WOS:A1996UD99800001

The study site was treated in 1991 with varying dosages of triclopyr amine herbicide, the triethylamine salt formulation of triclopyr [[(3,4,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy] acetic acid]; 4.0, 8.0, and 12.0 kg active ingredient (a.i.)/ha. Different levels of adult loosestrife control were achieved. The lowest density of adult loosestrife was observed in the 8.0 and 12.0 kg a.i./ha treatment plots where root kill was most effective. Most new adult loosestrife plants in the 8.0 and 12.0 kg a.i./ha treatment plots established from seed. The highest densities of loosestrife seedlings and grass (Gramineae) species were observed in the treatment plots with the lowest number of adult loosestrife plants (12.0 kg a.i./ha). Sedge species (Carer spp.) did not differ between treatment levels during 1993 and 1994. Loosestrife seedling densities decreased from 1993 to 1994, suggesting that increased native plant species can slow the rate of loosestrife reestablishment from the seed bank. Native vegetation seems to replace adult loosestrife for a limited time following herbicide application; however, without subsequent treatment, loosestrife will slowly reinvade a wetland.																	0277-5212					MAR	1996	16	1					95	98		10.1007/BF03160650							WOS:A1996UD99800011						
J	Galatowitsch, SM; vanderValk, AG				Galatowitsch, SM; vanderValk, AG			The vegetation of restored and natural prairie wetlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Thousands of wetland restorations have been done in the glaciated midcontinent of the United States. Wetlands in this region revegetate by natural recolonization after hydrology is restored. The floristic composition of the vegetation and seed banks of 10 restored wetlands in northern Iowa were compared to those of 10 adjacent natural wetlands to test the hypothesis that communities rapidly develop through natural recolonization. Restoration programs in the prairie pothole region assume that the efficient-community hypothesis is true: all plant species that can become established and survive under the environmental conditions found at a site will eventually be found growing there and/or will be found in its seed bank. Three years after restoration, natural wetlands had a mean of 46 species compared to 27 species for restored wetlands. Some guilds of species have significantly fewer (e.g., sedge meadow) or more (e.g., submersed aquatics) species in restored than natural wetlands. The distribution and abundance of most species at different elevations were significantly different in natural and restored wetlands. The seed banks of restored wetlands contained fewer species and fewer seeds than those of natural wetlands. There were, however, some similarities between the vegetation of restored and natural wetlands. Emergent species richness in restored wetlands was generally similar to that in natural wetlands, although there were fewer shallow emergent species in restored wetlands. The seed banks of restored wetlands, however, were not similar to those of natural wetlands in composition, mean species richness, or mean total seed density. Submersed aquatic, wet prairie, and sedge meadow species were not present in the seed banks of restored wetlands. These patterns of recolonization seem related to dispersal ability, indicating the efficient-community hypothesis cannot be completely accepted as a basis for restorations in the prairie pothole region.																	1051-0761					FEB	1996	6	1					102	112		10.2307/2269557							WOS:A1996TU56700021						
J	Zwick, P				Zwick, P			Variable egg development of Dinocras spp (Plecoptera, Perlidae) and the stonefly seed bank theory	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Temperature dependence of egg development of Dinocras cephalotes (Curtis) (three German and one Norwegian population) and Slovenian D. megacephala (Klapalek) was studied under a constant 14:10 light:dark photoperiod and constant temperature ranges of 4-24 degrees C and 4-18 degrees C, respectively. D. cephalotes was also incubated under seasonal field conditions; natural daylength and fluctuating temperatures had no modifying effect. 2. Both species have very similar lower threshold temperatures (4 and 3.5 degrees C, respectively), thermal demand for development (c. 600 degree days) and high dependence of mean incubation period on temperature (exponents of regressions near 1.5). Present data on D. cephalotes agree with the literature on British and Norwegian material of the same species. 3. Development occurs only at cue temperatures above the lower threshold. Cue temperatures range from 6 degrees C (some D. megacephala) to 14 degrees C (some D, cephalotes) and vary strongly within and between egg masses of D. cephalotes. Variation is not random, but seems to be genetically determined. 4. The variable temperature response renders study of effects of particular experimental regimes, and comparisons between local populations, difficult. 5. A latitudinal gradient in cue temperatures for development from 6 degrees C at c. 46 degrees N to 12 or even 14 degrees C at c. 61 degrees N seems to reflect reduced diversity at high latitudes. 6. Average success of spontaneous hatching exceeded 90% between 12 and 20 degrees C, but declined towards higher and lower temperatures. 7. Unhatched eggs were not dead but in parapause; development at other, higher or lower, temperatures was induced. Spontaneous plus induced hatching success approached 90%. Developing eggs rarely died; most dead eggs were apparently unfertilized. 8. Dormant plecopteran eggs are proposed to form a seed bank in stream bed sediments. Highly successful development after up to 220 days of dormancy was ascertained in Dinocras, and survival for up to 3 years is reported for other Perloidea. 9. Only systellognathan egg morphology provides options for long dormancy; the other plecopteran superfamilies, notably Nemouroidea, follow different strategies.																	0046-5070					FEB	1996	35	1					81	99		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00482.x							WOS:A1996TW36600008

The seedling emergence method for assessing the size of the seed bank is improved by washing soil samples on a fine sieve and spreading the thus concentrated samples in a 3-5 mm thick layer on sterilized potting compost. 2. The method largely increases the number of seedlings that emerge as compared to unconcentrated samples. Hand-sorting afterwards shows that the germination rates vary between 81 and 100% of the viable seeds present. 3. Ninety-five per cent of the seedlings will emerge within 6 weeks using this method. 4. The method greatly reduces the greenhouse space needed and enables examination of large sample volumes.																	0269-8463					FEB	1996	10	1					144	151									WOS:A1996UF09000016

J	Mull, JF; MacMahon, JA				Mull, JF; MacMahon, JA			Factors determining the spatial variability of seed densities in a shrub-steppe ecosystem: The role of harvester ants	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The seed banks of deserts typically show a high degree of spatial variability. We examined the influence of the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, on the spatial heterogeneity of soil seeds in the semi-arid shrub-steppe of south-western Wyoming. Seeds were sampled in the foraging areas of three ant colonies over 2 years, primarily to assess the distribution of seeds with respect to harvester ant nests and foraging trails. In 1989, seed densities varied at the smallest spatial scale sampled - the microhabitat (undershub vs. interspace). In 1990, seed densities varied at the largest spatial scale sampled - the colony foraging area. Seed abundance varied temporally in both years. Harvester ants affected the patterns of seed density in two ways. First, seed numbers in 1989 were higher in interspace areas away from foraging trails than in interspace areas near them, indicating that trails restrict colony search effort. Second, and contrary to our expectations, seed numbers in 1990 were higher near harvester ant nests than in surrounding areas. This difference was attributable to higher densities of the alien annual grass Bromus tectorum and suggests that harvester ants indirectly facilitate B. tectorum near their nests.

J	Enright, NJ; Lamont, BB; Marsula, R				Enright, NJ; Lamont, BB; Marsula, R			Canopy seed bank dynamics and optimum fire regime for the highly serotinous shrub, Banksia hookeriana	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Banksia hookeriana is a serotinous nonsprouting shrub restricted to the fire-prone northern sandplain scrub-heaths of Western Australia. Evidence of the natural fire frequency to which the species is best adapted was sought through analysis of its seed demography using a computer model of canopy seed bank dynamics based on field data. 2 Plants began flowering at 3-4 years of age but storage of viable seeds in the canopy was rare for plants < 5 years. Infructescences (cones) contained a mean of 12 follicles, holding two seeds of which 62% were estimated to be viable. 3 Cone (and seed) production increased with plant age to 15 years, but then fluctuated widely around a mean of 17 cones per year. By this time the average plant had an estimated canopy seed bank of 700 viable seeds comprising seeds 1-10 years old. 4 Seeds were lost from the canopy seed bank through spontaneous follicle rupture (i.e. in the absence of fire), granivory by insect larvae, and decay. Most follicles remained closed for at least 5 years and up to 50% of follicles were still closed after 10 years. Insect granivores destroyed 18% of seeds in I-year-old cones, and continued to destroy seeds in older cones at a rate of 2-3% per year. 5 The seed bank model predicted continued seed accumulation in the canopy to at least age 25 years (1400 seeds), but by this time more viable seeds (approximate to 2200) had been lost to spontaneous opening, granivory and decay than were then stored on the plant. 6 Shannon-Weiner diversity (H') of seed ages in the canopy seed bank increased with plant age, while evenness (V') decreased at first (to plant age 17 years) and then increased. 7 On a time-scale of many generations, the likelihood of successful recruitment of individuals in the next generation (on average), occurs for a fire frequency of 15-18 years. At this frequency resource wastage in this low-nutrient environment would be minimized. 8 Recent fires have recurred within 7-11 years and indicate a human impact on the natural fire regime which may ultimately threaten the species.

J	Maron, JL; Connors, PG				Maron, JL; Connors, PG			A native nitrogen-fixing shrub facilitates weed invasion	OECOLOGIA												Invasions by exotic weedy plants frequently occur in highly disturbed or otherwise anthropogenically altered habitats. Here we present evidence that, within California coastal prairie, invasion also can be facilitated by a native nitrogen-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus). Bush lupines fix nitrogen and grow rapidly, fertilizing the sandy soil with nitrogen-rich litter. The dense lupine canopy blocks light, restricting vegetative growth under bushes. Heavy insect herbivory kills lupines, opening exposed nitrogen-rich sites within the plant community. Eventual re-establishment of lupine occurs because of an abundant and long-lived seed bank. Lupine germination, rapid growth, shading and fertilization of sites, and then death after only a few years, results in a mosaic of nutrient-rich sites that are available to invading species. To determine the role of bush lupine death and nitrogen enrichment in community composition, we examined nutrient dynamics and plant community characteristics within a site only recently colonized by lupine, comparing patches where lupines had recently died or were experimentally killed with adjacent areas lacking lupine. In experimentally killed patches, instantaneous pool sizes of exchangeable ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were higher than in adjacent sites free of lupine. Seedlings of the introduced grass Bromus diandrus accumulated 48% greater root biomass and 93% more shoot biomass when grown in a greenhouse in soil collected under experimentally killed lupines compared to B. diandrus seedlings grown in soil collected at least 1 m away from lupines. At the end of the spring growing season, total above-ground live plant biomass was more than twice as great in dead lupine patches as in the adjacent lupine-free grassland, but dead lupine patches contained 47% fewer plant species and 57% fewer native species. Sites where lupines have repeatedly died and reestablished during recent decades support an interstitial grassland community high in productivity but low in diversity, composed of mostly weedy introduced annual plants. In contrast, at a site only recently colonized by bush lupines, the interstitial grassland consists of a less productive but more diverse set of native and introduced species. We suggest that repeated bouts of lupine germination, establishment, and death can convert a rich native plant community into a less diverse collection of introduced weeds.																	0029-8549					FEB	1996	105	3					302	312		10.1007/BF00328732							WOS:A1996TV85000004	28307102

Treatments for weed control after false seeding were: dalapon at 15 kg.ha(-1) harrowing with blade harrow, shallow ploughing with light plough, untreated. Tillage systems tested in these trials were: no tillage, minimum tillage with blade harrow, normal and shallow ploughing done at different periods. The results showed that in undisturbed soil, red rice seedlings counted throughout the season all emerged, from the beginning of April to mid-May. After 2 years, shallow ploughing and dalapon used for red rice control allowed the seed bank to remain quite stable-over time. In untreated plots the seed bank increased by about 10-fold. The percentage of emergences ih relation to the seed bank were strongly influenced by tillage systems: from 4.5 to 24.6% in harrowed plots, 1.3-2.5% in normally ploughed plots, 8.3-17.4% in superficially ploughed plots and 8.4-18.7% in untreated plots.

Species richness and evenness of plant distribution are high and show contrasted evolution in phytocenosis. At the opposite, seed banks are less rich, more homogeneous and independent to management. As regards the competitive or dispersal strategies of grassland plant species, endogenous biodiversity (seed banks) and exogenous biodiversity (migrations) have little utility to restoring the present biodiversity (phytocenosis) of chalk grasslands. Opposite results obtained for pioneer groups allow us to sketch a model of conservation management in function of perturbation regimes and functional strategies of the different plant communities.

J	Jutila, HM				Jutila, HM			Seed bank and emergent vascular flora of ballast areas in Reposaari, Finland	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												I studied the seed bank and emergent flora of ballast areas in Reposaari, SW Finland (61 degrees 30'N, 21 degrees 28'E). Altogether 2 180 seedlings germinated from 104 samples (depth mean = 9.2 cm) making 11 205 seeds per 1 m(2) area. 26.5% of the seedlings were monocots and 73.5% were dicots. I identified 70 taxa in the seed bank. The most common species were Potentilla argentea L., Tanacetum vulgare L., Poa trivialis L., Festuca rubra L., Agrostis capillaris L. and Poa pratensis L. Of all germinated seeds 25.3% were annuals or biennials and 62.7% were perennials (the rest not recognized to species level). Sixty-nine individuals of 9 ballast species germinated from seed bank samples: Artemisia absinthium L., Astragalus glycophyllus L., Carum carvi L., Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. ssp. arvense, Lamium album L., Medicago lupulina L., Melilotus alba Medicus, M. altissima Thuill. and Senecio jacobaea L. This accounted for 13.2% of the species in the seed bank, but only 3.2% of all germinated seedlings. In the emergent flora of the study sites I found 134 vascular plant species, of which 30 were ballast species. The emergent flora and seed bank shared 49 taxa: 10 monocots, 38 dicots (of which 3 were trees or bushes) and one pteridophyte. The emergent flora was richer in ballast species than the seed bank (22.4% vs 13.2%). The number of seeds in the seed bank decreased with depth and after cold treatment. The densest and richest seed bank was encountered in sand and the sparsest and poorest in fine sand. The amount of stones was positively correlated with the number of germinating seedlings and species. A thick organic layer seemed to diminish the number of viable seeds.

There were distinct differences in the patterns of seed softening between and within species and between years. Seed softening was accurately described by logistic curves with calculated half-lives of hard seeds (within a given year) a good indicator of differences in the softening patterns between species and accessions. T. subterraneum cv. Nungarin softened most rapidly over summer, ceasing by March (half-life in the first year 45 days), whereas M. polymorpha cv. Serena and 2 accessions of T. glomeratum softened mainly during the autumn (half-lives of 126, 104, and 136 days, respectively) First year half-lives of 4 other accessions of T. subterraneum ranged from 64 to 79 days. The results showed that large seeds were more likely to soften in the first year than were small seeds. The different patterns can be explained using Taylor's 2-stage model of seed softening. The implications of different patterns are discussed in terms of adaptation to a Mediterranean environment. T. glomeratum and M. polymorpha cv. Serena are considered to have a short-term pattern of seed softening well adapted to an environment where false breaks to the growing season are likely. The pattern of T. subterraneum is considered to be less well adapted to such an environment. However, variation within the species indicates the potential for selection of better adapted varieties. The inclusion of the short-term seed softening pattern as a selection criterion for pasture legumes is recommended.																	0004-9409						1996	47	5					775	785		10.1071/AR9960775							WOS:A1996UT12300010						
J	Yates, CJ; Hobbs, RJ; Bell, RW				Yates, CJ; Hobbs, RJ; Bell, RW			Factors limiting the recruitment of Eucalyptus salmonophloia in remnant woodlands .3. Conditions necessary for seed germination	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Characteristics of the germination strategy of Eucalyptus salmonophloia F.Muell. are described and whether the germination niche is limiting recruitment of E. salmonophloia seedlings in remnant woodlands is discussed. Germination in E. salmonophloia proceeds with favourable soil temperature and water conditions on a variety of substrates. However, at temperatures above and below the optimum for germination (25 degrees C), enforced dormancy occurs and germination is retarded. In these situations, dormancy is simply overcome when temperatures return to optimum. Evidently, seeds can remain moist at sub-optimal temperatures for prolonged periods without losing viability. Furthermore, E. salmonophloia seeds are capable of withstanding a cycle of wetting and drying with undiminished germination capacity. Conditions suitable for germination occur at the beginning of the winter wet season in south-western Australia when soil temperatures are still suitable and soil moisture and atmospheric humidity are frequently high. These germination characteristics minimise the chances of seeds germinating at times when the probability of seedling establishment is low (e.g. summer). This is particularly important because E. salmonophloia only establishes a temporary soil, seed-reserve following large scale disturbances, and therefore the opportunities for recruitment may be quite rare. In remnant woodland when ants were excluded and a soil seed-bank was created artificially, seeds germinated but no seedlings survived. This suggests that the destruction of seeds by ants during inter-disturbance periods is having little effect on recruitment because seedlings are unlikely to establish. Unfavourable conditions for germination are unlikely to be responsible for the lack of E. salmonophloia seedling recruitment in remnant woodlands. Further research is needed to identify the factors critical for seedling establishment; changes in resource availability following large-scale disturbances and associated tree death are important in this respect.

J	Ashton, DH; Martin, DG				Ashton, DH; Martin, DG			Regeneration in a pole-stage forest of Eucalyptus regnans subjected to different fire intensities in 1982	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In 1982, fire burnt stands of Eucalyptus regnans F.Muell. in a relatively dry site in Victoria. In one area, the fire killed both canopy and understorey; in an adjacent area, only understorey was destroyed. Regeneration in the two areas was similar over the following year, but diverged thereafter to produce understoreys with different species dominance. In both stands, a poor supply of mature E. regnans seed in the crowns at the time of the fire resulted in relatively low initial density of seedlings: in the fire-killed stand, this meant that closure of the canopy of the stratum was delayed for 5 or 6 years; however, in the understorey-killed stand, none of the E. regnans seedlings survived for 2 years. The soil seed bank was reduced more severely in the fire-killed than in the understorey-killed stand, although not all seed germinated in the first year. Vegetative regeneration of herbs and shrubs occurred from shallower layers of soil in the understorey-killed than in the fire-killed stand. An increase in soil fertility after the fire, as measured by seedling bioassay, was apparent only in the first season after the fire and was correlated with higher levels of available P. In the understorey-killed stand, fertility in the topsoil was greater than that in the fire-killed stand, and growth in diameter at breast height of dominant trees was significantly greater than in adjacent unburnt stands in the first few years after the fire. By comparison, when fire burnt through a site of higher rainfall after the maturation of the current crop of canopy-stored seed, regeneration was initially denser and growth considerably greater than that in the drier site. The study demonstrated that the course of secondary succession depends on site quality, timing of the fire in relation to seed production, soil seed germination, vegetative growth from protected organs, the severity of the fire, the presence or absence of browsing, and, in the long term, the frequency of recurrent fire.																	0067-1924						1996	44	4					393	410		10.1071/BT9960393							WOS:A1996VK12300003

The impact of seed production on seed banks was assessed by estimating seed banks in the seed production quadrats before and after seed fall. Seed banks in 4 of the 6 sites decreased in year 2, although seed numbers at 1 damp site increased markedly. Defoliation from mid-December until February, April or June prevented seed production, reducing seed banks by 34% over 7 months. Seed banks in undefoliated plots increased by 3300 seeds/m(2), although seed fall was estimated at >114 000 seeds/m(2). Emergence of GPG seedlings from artificially established and naturally occurring, persistent seed banks was recorded for 3 years from bare and vegetated treatment plots. Sown seeds showed high levels of innate dormancy and only 4% of seeds emerged when sown immediately after collection. Longer storage of seeds after collection resulted in more seedlings emerging. Estimates of persistent seed banks ranged from 1650 to about 21260 seeds/m(2). Most seedlings emerged in spring or autumn and this was correlated with rainfall but not with ambient temperatures. Rates of seed bank decline in both bare and vegetated treatment plots was estimated by fitting exponential decay curves to seed bank estimates. Assuming no further seed inputs, it was estimated that it would take about 3 and 5 years, respectively, for seed banks to decline to 150 seeds/m(2) in bare and vegetated treatments.

J	Thompson, K; Hodgson, JG				Thompson, K; Hodgson, JG			More on the biogeography of scarce vascular plants	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A recent study of the distribution of 139 British scarce plants (Quinn et al., 1994, Biol. Conserv., 70, 149-57) found that degree of aggregation was correlated with habitat, dispersal ability (in space) and pollination type. Our reanalysis using a different classification of dispersal in space and new data on dispersal in rime shows no relationship between aggregation and dispersal in time or space. We argue that present distributions of scarce plants ave largely the product of recent habitat loss and that correlations with dispersal characteristics are therefore unlikely to be found.																	0006-3207						1996	75	3					299	302		10.1016/0006-3207(95)00068-2							WOS:A1996UB72800012						
J	Leck, MA				Leck, MA			Germination of macrophytes from a Delaware River tidal freshwater wetland	BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB												The effects of burial and soil moisture (seeds were on the surface, or buried at 1 and 5 cm with drained, saturated, or hooded water levels), inundation (Petri dishes, and open and closed jars), and storage (similar to 0 and similar to 100% RH), as well as of light and various temperature regimes, were examined. Focus was on ten species (Amaranthus cannabinus (L.) Sauer, Ambrosia trifida L., Bidens laevis (L.) BSP. Impatiens capensis Meerb., Peltandra virginica (L.) Schott. & Endl., Phalaris arundinacea L., Pilea pumila (L.) A. Gray, Polygonum arifolium L., Polyontum punctatum Elliott, and Sagittaria latifolia Willd.); five others were also considered to a limited extent (Alisma subcordatum Raf., Carex lurida Wahlenb., Cicuta maculata L., Cuscuta gronovii Willd., and Pontederia cordata L.). Species varied in their germination responses. Those with the same seed bank strategy (transient or persistent) had different dormancy mechanisms although seeds with persistent seed bunks required temperatures >5 degrees C and germination fur most was enhanced by light. Responses to burial and moisture level showed that larger seeded species were able to germinate from greater depth. but germination was greater in drained samples. There were three types of responses to inundation: (1) requirement for at least modest amounts of oxygen, (2) requirement for hypoxic conditions, and (3) those having good germination regardless of inundation regime. Seed bank losses and relatively short seed bank longevity could be accounted for by germination following afterripening, adverse effects of prolonged inundation. failed germination (e.g., germination at depths that preclude the seedling from reaching the surface), and predation. Differences between the seed characteristics of species of this and those of other wetlands relate to the transient nature of the seed bank, and to wetland hydrology. Variable responses to drying have implications for wetland restoration projects.																	0040-9618					JAN-MAR	1996	123	1					48	67		10.2307/2996306							WOS:A1996UE42300007						
J	Peterson, CJ; Carson, WP				Peterson, CJ; Carson, WP			Generalizing forest regeneration models: The dependence of propagule availability on disturbance history and stand size	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												We summarize three existing conceptual frameworks for forest regeneration in northeastern North America and suggest that none consider both a range of disturbance characteristics and a range of forest conditions at the time of disturbance. We offer a more general conceptual model, within which the existing models can be seen as special cases. We propose that the abundance of characteristic seed-bank, pioneer species, such as Prunus pensylvanica L.f. and Rubus spp. (often Rubus allegheniensis T.C. Porter, Rubus hispidus L., or Rubus odoratus L.), is dependent on propagule availability, which in turn is determined by forest age and size. Specifically, following disturbance, large tracts of forest and older forests (ca. >125 years) are predicted to have very low densities of the above pioneers. As a result, population, community, and ecosystem parameters may be substantially different in the regenerating forest than in the familiar cases of regeneration in secondary forests. Indeed, the presettlement forest of much of northeastern North America may have experienced a notable scarcity of pioneers after disturbances, in areas far enough inland for hurricanes to be unimportant. Our hypothesis makes predictions of seed-bank abundance that are well supported in a variety of forest types; we also provide support for our hypothesis with data on regeneration following catastrophic windthrow in Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Finally, our hypothesis also predicts that the potential regeneration in much of the secondary forest of northeastern North America should profoundly shift as stands age from roughly 100 to 130 years.

J	Bekele, I; McCulloch, CE				Bekele, I; McCulloch, CE			Estimation of the time of attainment of a threshold with control of the probability of overestimation	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION												Consider a random variable whose mean value depends on time such as the mean germination rate of seeds stored in a seed bank. Interest lies in the estimation of the time at which the mean of the random variable attains a known fixed value when overestimation is considered to be more costly than underestimation. We assume the random variable under study has a mean value that is a linear function of time with i.i.d. normal errors. Estimates based on sequential sampling carried out at prespecified sampling times tend to be more costly than those based on estimated inspection times since frequent sampling increases sampling cost and infrequent sampling could lead to a high probability of stopping past the desired time and a large average distance past the desired time. Among three procedures based on estimated inspection times a procedure based on inspection times determined exactly after updating the information performed better than the other two in terms of a lower sample size requirement. The probability of stopping past the desired time was slightly inflated for this procedure but the average distance from the desired time of those estimates which exceeded it was very small. The existing procedure adopted for the current formulation and setup controlled the probability of stopping late at the desired level and performed better for small values of the slope. Compared to a procedure based on specific constants selected to control the probability of stopping late at the desired level for each slope, the sample size requirement of the existing procedure was higher, ranging from 616% to 2493%. This higher sample size requirement did not lead to an appreciable advantage when the slope is not small.																	0361-0918						1996	25	1					157	168		10.1080/03610919608813304							WOS:A1996TY60900011						
J	Troumbis, AY				Troumbis, AY			Seed persistence versus soil seed bank persistence: The case of the post-fire seeder Cistus incanus L	ECOSCIENCE												The paper examines conceptual and methodological questions related to the validation of alternative hypotheses of seed bank size variation in time: the ''steady accumulation of seeds in soil'' and the ''annual fluctuation of seed bank size''. Among the examined questions, most effort is allocated to identifying the relative magnitude of temporal variability of seed banks and the establishment of criteria for accepting a hypothesis related to the persistence of single-species soil seed banks. A set of criteria is proposed as a validation scheme of a hypothesis. Cistus incanus L., an obligate seeder, has been used during an I-year study in two different stands, as experimental material for studying seed production and seed storage in soil. Some general conclusions may be proposed: 1) Simple interannual comparisons of seed bank size in order to support a hypothesis on bank persistence must be avoided. 2) The validity of the hypothesis is related to the scale of observation (temporal, spatial and numerical). 3) Although annual fluctuations in soil seed bank size are evident, a minimum number of seeds persist in the soil. In that case, the physiological persistence of the seed is confused with the populational persistence of the soil seed population.																	1195-6860						1996	3	4					461	468		10.1080/11956860.1996.11682364							WOS:A1996WD61600011						
J	Bertiller, MB				Bertiller, MB			Grazing effects on sustainable semiarid rangelands in Patagonia: The state and dynamics of the soil seed bank	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The composition of the germinable seed bank was studied in four vegetation states of the Festuca pallescens grasslands in semiarid Patagonia during four years. The aim of this study was to test whether above-ground vegetation states resulting from grazing exclusion or different combinations oi grazing and topography are reflected in different states of the germinable seed bank. The size of the total and dicot germinable seed bank was positively related to the total cover in each stale. Dicots dominated all germinable seed bank states. Carex patagonica increased its cover as well as its germinable seed bank under grazing disturbance. Grazing did not reduce the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses in uplands where the grazing pressure is lower as compared with slopes. In slopes the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses was significantly reduced by grazing. A reduction of the length oi the grazing period in late spring increases the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses both in upland and slope. These results are interpreted in the frame of a model of management techniques where grazing exclusion during late spring and late summer increases the seed bank of the perennial grasses and promotes their establishment in uplands. The artificial addition of seeds of perennial grasses and the manipulation of the soil surface in order to increase ''safe sites'' appear as management alternatives that deserve further evaluation to improve plant reestablishment in slopes.																	0364-152X					JAN-FEB	1996	20	1					123	132		10.1007/PL00006692							WOS:A1996TK96300012

A field experiment was conducted to determine the influence of tillage practice and interference level on seed production potential emergence pattern, and soil seed bank of S. obtusifolia and X. strumarium and to determine the dominant species after introduction into a weed-free field. Interference level did not influence the soil seed bank except for S. obtusifolia under tilled conditions. Under tilled conditions, X. strumarium was the dominant species, and S. obtusifolia was dominant under no-till conditions. Soil seed bank loss was greater for both species with tillage. Three years after initial seed deposition, the remaining S. obtusifolia seeds were 100% viable while X. strumarium burs were not viable. Thus, under no-till conditions the X. strumarium soil seed bank was depleted while S. obtusifolia was not.																			87-984996-1-0				1996							241	246									WOS:000076408300039

Therefore, since 1994, a project at the Institute of Hop Research and Brewing Zalec, Department of Plant Protection, is in progress in order to detect herbicide resistant weed biotypes in Slovenia and to develop weed control strategies. This contribution deals only with Chenopodium album, one of the most common and frequent weed species in maize fields in Slovenia. For testing of resistant and sensitive biotypes different methods were used: field treatments, biological tests under controlled conditions and flotation of leaf discs. In addition, the resistance ratio of the C. album seed bank was calculated. Samples collected in 1994 and 1995 from 100 fields where maize is grown strongly indicate that resistant biotypes of C. album are to be found in all parts of Slovenia, especially in locations where maize is grown in monoculture. Samples from fields with a 2-year crop rotation included only two cases with resistant plants while no resistant plants were found in the fields with a 3-year crop rotation. As we estimate that less than 10 % of maize is grown in monoculture, the incidence of resistant C. album indicates that less than 3 % of the fields in Slovenia where maize is grown are infested with resistant biotypes of C. album.																			87-984996-1-0				1996							469	474									WOS:000076408300073

Striga primarily affects small-scale farmers with limited resources. Integrated control strategies are required in order to control Striga under these conditions. The primary components of an integrated approach are: containment and reducing seed banks, while maintaining or increasing farm productivity. Containment can be achieved through the use of clean seed and farm implements. Striga seed banks can be reduced by preventing reproduction through hand-weeding and the application of 2,4-D, inducing suicidal germination with effective trap crops, and by enhancing the natural demise of seed by increasing the biological activity of the soil. Maintaining on-farm productivity is achieved by using resistant/tolerant cultivars, through strategic use of non-host crops, by delaying attachment with seed-dressed herbicides, and by improving the fertility status of the soil. Due to the varied agro-ecologies and farming systems where Striga is found, localised adaptation and integration of these components is required.																			87-984996-1-0				1996							623	628									WOS:000076408300095

With almost all cases of herbicide resistance in wheat and rice are due to enhanced detoxification of herbicides with consequences of cross resistance to alternate herbicides, farmers in developing countries may have to control resistant weeds by exhausting the existing seed bank of resistant populations through changes in crop sequences and designing new agronomic techniques in wheat and rice. In plantation crops, an integrated approach involving alternate herbicides or herbicide mixtures and mechanical weeding may help to contain the spread of resistant populations.																			87-984996-1-0				1996							665	673									WOS:000076408300100

Control of S. viarum is only possible through integrated weed management strategies that are based on biological and ecological principles. Prevention is based on reducing or eliminating the movement of S. viarum through seed dispersal vectors like cattle, wildlife, hay, and sod. In Florida, this weed has been dispersed by herbivores which eat the fruits. Prevention involves surveying areas most susceptible to invasion (improved pasture, ditch banks, cowpens) and implementing a control program when the plant is detected. Control of S. viarum is possible if fruit production (ie. seed) is eliminated. Herbicides such as triclopyr (1.12 kg ai/ha; 373 L/ha) offer excellent opportunities for control, especially in combination with cultural practices like mowing (7.5 cm stubble height). High seed germination (75%) and production (40,000 seed/plant/yr), and soil seed-bank dynamics require timely and repeated herbicide applications to eliminate S. viarum.																			87-984996-1-0				1996							1009	1014									WOS:000076408300153

It is widely accepted that both niche-differentiation and chance effects among ecologically very similar species play an important part in maintaining richness. The purpose of the paper is to provide an improved background of ideas on rainforest dynamics, against which to consider differentiation in the regeneration niche, and against which to plan management and conservation. Paradigms deemed to need review are the following: the all-importance of canopy gaps, the existence of a spectrum of tolerance in which the relative positions of species are not dependent on size of individual, the association of large seed size with shade tolerance, the idea that soil seed banks are composed of species demanding sizeable canopy gaps, and the all-importance of shade as opposed to competition for water or mineral nutrients in limiting regeneration. Recent evidence bearing on these ideas is reviewed briefly, and an alternative set of paradigms is offered.																	0077-0639		0-7923-4038-8				1996	74						215	233									WOS:A1996BH23U00021

One of the ways dia spores of plants are spread by man is their transport in stable manure and in slurry Ideal conditions to investigate such a dispersal by cattle slurry were given on the Scheyern research station in Southern Bavaria. There, the transport of seeds from fields frequently cultivated with maize to stands which had had a minimal percentage of maize in the former crop rotation could be observed. As a result of effective weed control the weed densities in the source crops stayed low. Consequently, only 3.4 viable seeds were recovered in one litre of the liquid manure which was produced by the cattle fed with the corresponding silage and with green forage. Thus, with an application of 30 m(3) slurry per ha 10.2 viable seeds per mt were dispersed in the two target maize fields. This value amounts to not more than 1.0% respectively 3.8% of the soil seed bank. Vegetation releves carried out in the two years preceding the slurry application made it also possible to evaluate the field establishment of the seeds contained in the organic manure. Despite a low overall weed infestation in the maize stands, these investigations imply that several "maize weeds" and some grassland species were spread and successfully established by the slurry application. Nevertheless, the amount of seeds imported and produced could not compensate the losses in the soil seed bank by emerging and dying. The content of viable seeds in the soil of the two fields decreased from 13640, respectively 2140 to 10420 and 1530 viable seeds/m(2). Significant increases in the soil seed bank of certain species were not observed. On the basis of these results, possibilities of using farm manure to spread rare and endangered species are discussed.

The 41 species consisted of 11 annual grass, 14 annual broadleaf, 4 biennial broadleaf, and 12 perennial broadleaf species. Weed seeds were exhumed annually for germination tests the first 9 yr, then after 12 and 17 yr. Germination percentages at the two burial locations averaged over 0, 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 17 yr of burial were 57, 28, 9, and 4% for annual grass; 47, 26, 16, and 11% for annual broadleaf; 52, 49, 44, and 30% for biennial broadleaf; 36, 18, 13, and 8% for perennial broadleaf; and 47, 26, 16, and 10% for all 41 weed species, respectively. Biennial broadleaf weeds showed the greatest seed germination over years. Annual grass weeds showed less seed germinability over 17 yr of burial than annual broadleaf weeds and perennial broadleaf weed species were intermediate. Weed seed germinability in soil was greater in the reduced rainfall and more moderate soil temperatures of western Nebraska than in the greater rainfall and more fluctuating soil temperatures of eastern Nebraska. The greatest seed survival among the 41 weed species was shown by common mullein, which had 95% germination after 17 yr of burial in western Nebraska.

J	Mahesh, MQ; Upadhyaya, MK; Turkington, R				Mahesh, MQ; Upadhyaya, MK; Turkington, R			Dynamics of seed bank and survivorship of meadow salsify (Tragopogon pratensis) populations	WEED SCIENCE												Seasonal changes in germination behaviour of meadow salsify seeds buried at different depths, and survivorship of seed and plant populations were investigated. Freshly matured seeds were mixed with sterilized soil, placed into nylon mesh bags, and buried at three soil depths in a meadow salsify-infested rangeland. Two germination peaks were observed: one in the fall, 2 to 3 mo after burial, and a second the following spring. Burial depth affected seed dormancy. The number of seeds with enforced dormancy, and innate or induced dormancy, increased with burial depth in the 1989 cohort, and the number with enforced dormancy increased in the 1990 cohort. Burial depth also affected seed survivorship. The survivorship curves for 1989 and 1990 seed cohorts were not different as indicated by the Logrank test. The seed population was nearly depleted after 9 to 10 mo of burial; less than 3% of the buried seeds remained viable after 13 mo. About 50% of the plants monitored in a natural meadow salsify population in 1990 died before winter, and an additional 35% died during winter. The mortality of the remaining plants during the second growing season was very low Only 12% of the 1990 cohort remained in October 1991. Mortality of meadow salsify plants was density-independent.																	0043-1745					JAN-MAR	1996	44	1					100	108									WOS:A1996UA33100016						
J	Leck, MA; Simpson, RL				Leck, MA; Simpson, RL			Ten-year seed bank and vegetation dynamics of a tidal freshwater marsh	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A decade-long examination was made of recruitment and establishment in a tidal freshwater high marsh along the Delaware River. Over the 10 yr of the study, seed bank, field seedlings, and vegetation showed variable patterns and significant year-to-year fluctuations. Patterns of each species were unique, perhaps the result of specific germination and/or establishment requirements and seedling morphology. For a given species there was little correlation among seed bank, seedling, and vegetation patterns, and germination success did nor guarantee establishment. Species diversity showed significant year-to-year fluctuation, but there was no trend, and perennials did not change in importance during the 10-yr period. Because four annual species (Bidens laevis, Cuscuta gronovii, Impatiens capensis, and Polygonum arifolium) composed over 90% of the seed bank and field seedlings, and 58-89% ((x) over bar = 70 +/- 4) of the cover, community dynamics were dependent on seedling recruitment. For a given species life history stages (seed bank, field seedlings, and vegetation) were not predictable over the temporal scale of a decade. It is predicted, however, that if hydrology remains unchanged, the same suite of species will persist. The importance of the parasite Cuscuta gronovii is noteworthy.																	0002-9122					DEC	1995	82	12					1547	1557		10.2307/2446183							WOS:A1995TK75600008						
J	Harrington, GN; Driver, MA				Harrington, GN; Driver, MA			The effect of fire and ants on the seed-bank of a shrub in a semi-arid grassland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Invasion of grasslands by woody plants following the introduction of domestic stock is a worldwide phenomenon. Burning is frequently recommended as a remedial measure but for a pastoral enterprise it is costly and the frequency of the fires required is of critical economic importance. The size and longevity of the soil seed-bank is an essential part of the response of shrub populations to prescribed fire regimes. In this study the seed-bank of the semi-arid zone shrub Dodonaea attenuata in Eragrostis eriopoda tussock grassland was examined in relation to harvesting by ants and the burning history of the sites. On unburnt sites, more than 3500 seeds per m(2) entered the seed-bank in the summer 1984-85 but sites burnt 5 years previously produced less than one-third of that number. Burnt shrubs did not flower for 5 years and no seeds survived in the soil through to 1985. Burning immediately prior to seed ripening destroyed the seed crop but burning after seed-fall stimulated a greater germination in the following spring than on unburnt treatments. Ants rapidly harvested most of the seeds produced and after 20 months the combined effects of ant harvesting and germination had reduced the seed-bank at unburnt sites to 8-21 seeds per m(2) and at sites burnt 7 years previously to less than two seeds per m(2). Seeds were initially harvested in summer by Pheidole spp. of ants for their elaiosome and then discarded in middens outside the entrance to the ant nest. During the subsequent cool season the seeds were taken back into the nest and stored at depths ranging from 2 to 30 cm. It was concluded that ants provided short-range dispersal (<10 m) and promoted the contagious distribution of D. attenuata, which is advantageous for a fire-susceptible, arid-zone shrub invading a grassland liable to be burnt: seedlings derived from seeds in ant storage chambers near the soil surface and in sparse grass situations caused by competition from shrubs may obtain some survival advantage. Prescribed fire has potential as a management tool for controlling population density of D. attenuata because, depending upon season and frequency, it reduces seed rain by killing shrubs, suppresses flowering activity and destroys seed crops on the plant. Under the influence of a regime of regular burning, such as prevailed prior to the European pastoral industry, the limited soil seed-bank would have been a major constraint on D. attenuata populations.																	0307-692X					DEC	1995	20	4					538	547		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1995.tb00573.x							WOS:A1995TP70700008						
J	Edwards, W; Whelan, R				Edwards, W; Whelan, R			The size, distribution and germination requirements of the soil-stored seed-bank of Grevillea barklyana (Proteaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Fire-triggered release from seed dormancy is a characteristic of many Australian plant species. We investigated aspects of the seed-bank dynamics and dormancy characteristics in seeds of Grevillea barklyana, an understorey shrub of coastal sclerophyll vegetation in the Jervis Bay Region on the south coast of New South Wales. We used two soil core sizes to compare the number and distribution of stored seeds in soil cores taken from underneath and outside the limits of plant canopies at three study sites. Core size did not affect the estimate of seed density. No seeds were found outside the existing canopies. Even in under-canopy samples, seed numbers were small. Mean seed densities were estimated as 10.9, 14.1 and 4.3 seeds per (sic) for the three sites. A hierarchical series of laboratory experiments was used to test the germination response of both fresh and soil-stored seeds. Likewise, we attempted to simulate 'natural' disturbance conditions in a glasshouse experiment. Both laboratory and glasshouse experiments indicated polymorphism in germination behaviour. A constant proportion of seeds exhibited enforced dormancy, when moist at room temperature, while a smaller number of seeds showed either an induced dormancy or a non-seed-coat linked innate dormancy. The majority (75%) of seeds were innately dormant due to a hard seed-coat. This dormancy was broken when the seed-coat was damaged, for instance, by heat. The level of polymorphic germination behaviour will be dependent on the length of the inter-fire periods. We conclude that the expression of polymorphism within and between species across a range of environments and fire regimes is an important consideration for any further study attempting to assess the role of the seed-bank.

J	Ireland, C; Andrew, MH				Ireland, C; Andrew, MH			Ants remove virtually all western myall (Acacia papyrocarpa Benth) seeds at Middleback, South Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Ants can have a profound effect on the numbers of seeds present in the seed-bank. We investigated the removal of seeds of an important arid zone tree species, the western myall (Acacia papyrocarpa Benth.). The species has seed characteristics typical of other Acacia species: a hard seed-coat and a small, white aril or elaiosome; the latter is reported to be attractive to ants. An experiment was conducted to see how rapidly and completely the seeds would be removed under various caging treatments. Observations were also made to discover the major seed removers and the fate of the seeds. Seed removal was rapid (<12h) and was almost entirely by ants, and while our observations were not conclusive, we speculate that much of the seed supply is effectively destroyed by seed harvester ants which thus act as true granivores, not seed dispersers. Whether this matters for western myall in the long term is problematic because the species is so long-lived; rare but successful recruitment events may well be sufficient for its long-term survival.																	0307-692X					DEC	1995	20	4					565	570		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1995.tb00576.x							WOS:A1995TP70700011						
J	DUTOIT, T; ALARD, D				DUTOIT, T; ALARD, D			PERMANENT SEED BANKS IN CHALK GRASSLAND UNDER VARIOUS MANAGEMENT REGIMES - THEIR ROLE IN THE RESTORATION OF SPECIES-RICH PLANT-COMMUNITIES	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												A survey was carried out on four stands of a chalk grassland (open, intensively grazed, tall and scrub) in order to monitor the permanent soil seed bank under various management regimes responsible for the decline of the ecological interest of this ecosystem. There was no real similarity between the seed banks and the associated vegetation, except in the intensively grazed stand. When vegetation changes, seed banks appear to be quite stable and are mostly dominated by three species (Centaurium erythraea, Origanum vulgare, Hypericum perforatum). The seed bank seems to be quite useless in order to restore a species-rich community after both grazing intensification or abandonment. Because recolonization processes are the critical factor, the management of species-rich grassland has to be designed with a view to preserving a given plant community as well as to improving dispersion processes from a source to target areas.

One hundred uprooted trees were evaluated in order to investigate the sprouting ability of different species and size classes, and to determine the extent of contribution of sprouting to gap closure. The large proportion (82%) of sampled trees with live sprouts indicates that uprooting need nor be associated with the death of the tree. The occurrence of sprouting, while independent of the diameter of the fallen trunk, varied greatly among species. Al the sampled trees found with sprouts fit the definition of non-pioneer species. This study suggests that sprouts may compete successfully with pioneer trees in the process of gap closure.

To determine whether viable seeds of V. americana occurred in the seed bank of navigation pool 7, Lake Onalaska, the upper 5 cm of sediment was collected from 103 sites in May 1990. These sediment samples were kept in pots at a depth of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 m in an outdoor pond for 12 weeks. Vallisneria americana seeds germinated from sites throughout the lake, and some seedlings produced overwintering buds by the end of the study. Seeds, spores, or fragments of 12 other species of aquatic plants also germinated. Seed germination trials with fresh and stored seeds in both greenhouse and ponds in which light availability was reduced with shade cloths indicated that seed germination was insensitive to light level. To determine the light requirements for seedling survival and bud production, sediment from Lake Onalaska was incubated in ponds under neutral density shade screens reducing light to 2, 5, 9, and 25% of full sun. Seeds germinated under all shade treatments but survival was significantly higher in the 9 and 25% light treatments, and bud production was restricted to these light levels.																	0008-4026					DEC	1995	73	12					1966	1973		10.1139/b95-210							WOS:A1995TM29800014

ECOGRAPHY												We compare the ecological and habitat characteristics of alien and native vascular plants which have recently expanded in range in England, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands. In the great majority of respects, expanding aliens and natives are functionally indistinguishable. However, there are a few consistent differences: aliens are more likely than natives to be clonal, polycarpic perennials with erect, leafy stems, and to have transient seed banks. We discuss these trends in the context of the difficulties faced by aliens in invading mostly closed plant communities in relatively cool, damp climates. Our results are consistent with some predictions of the attributes of 'ideal' invaders, but contradict others. We argue that the ecological attributes of successful alien invaders are strongly habitat-dependent.																	0906-7590					DEC	1995	18	4					390	402		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1995.tb00142.x							WOS:A1995TZ41900008						
J	Tyler, CM				Tyler, CM			Factors contributing to postfire seedling establishment in chaparral: Direct and indirect effects of fire	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 In the chaparral significant seedling establishment occurs only following fire. Mechanisms proposed to explain this abundant recruitment after fire include: direct heating of the soil and seed bank, and a temporary reduction in competition or herbivory. 2 I tested hypotheses regarding the relative importance of these mechanisms to different plant functional groups using field experiments conducted in burned and nearby unburned chaparral. Competition was manipulated by removing shrubs from mature chaparral, and mammalian herbivory manipulated using small cage exclosures. 3 Burning and reduction in herbivory were primarily responsible for the postburn 'flush' of seedlings, although plant functional groups differed in their responses to fire. 4 Shrub seedling density was enhanced only by herbivore exclusion. The abundance of subshrubs and annual herbs was positively affected only by burning. Perennial herbs increased both with burning and herbivore exclusion. 5 The effects of variation in fire intensity or soil heating were also investigated, by comparing unmanipulated plots in the burn to areas in the burn which had been cleared of shrubs prior to the fire. 6 Areas in the burn with reduced soil heating had higher overall seedling densities, cover and biomass; perennial herbs were the only functional group unaffected by variation in fire intensity. 7 Comparison of the results of this study to those from similar experiments in maritime chaparral suggest that inconsistencies between the responses of chaparral communities to fire may be due primarily to differences in species composition.																	0022-0477					DEC	1995	83	6					1009	1020		10.2307/2261182							WOS:A1995TL88300009						
J	Vleeshouwers, LM; Bouwmeester, HJ; Karssen, CM				Vleeshouwers, LM; Bouwmeester, HJ; Karssen, CM			Redefining seed dormancy: An attempt to integrate physiology and ecology	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The paper reviews the literature on seed dormancy, with special regard to inconsistencies in terms and definitions used. It presents a concept of seed dormancy in which physiology and ecology are integrated. Its aim is to increase the understanding of seed dormancy and germination, and to help defining ecological research questions. 2 It is claimed that seed dormancy should not be identified with the absence of germination. Seed dormancy should rather be defined as a characteristic, the degree of which determines the range of conditions in which a seed is able to germinate. Dormancy varies on a continuous scale, which is visualized by continuous changes in the range of conditions suitable for germination. If the conditions required by the seed are met by its environment, the seed will germinate. 3 The concept of dormancy that is described in the paper is partly based on a physiological model for the regulation of dormancy and the stimulation of germination. In this model dormancy is related to the amount of a hypothetical phytochrome receptor in the seed. 4 It is argued that the process of dormancy release should be clearly distinguished from the germination process itself. It is stated that as yet only temperature has been shown to alter the degree of dormancy in seeds. Factors like light and nitrate are often indispensable for germination, but only by promoting the germination process itself, not by mitigating the requirements for germination. 5 It is suggested that seed dormancy prevents germination when conditions are favourable for germination, at a time of the year when it can be expected that the plant originating from the seed will not survive and produce offspring. 6 It is concluded that dormancy should not be regarded as inactivity of seeds. At any degree of dormancy, seeds continuously react to their environment by adjusting their level of dormancy to the changing environment.

J	Teketay, D; Granstrom, A				Teketay, D; Granstrom, A			Soil seed banks in dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The soil seed bank was investigated in four dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia. Al least 167 plant species were identified in the 0 - 9 cm soil layer with total densities ranging between 12 300 and 24 000 seeds/m(2) Herbs were represented with the largest numbers of species and seeds in the seed bank, while the contribution of tree species was rally low. The overall vertical distribution of seeds was similar at all sites with the highest densities occurring in the upper three cm of soil and gradually decreasing densities with increasing depth. Relatively high densities also occurred in the litter layer. There were large differences in depth distribution between species, suggesting differences in seed longevity. A large number of species in dry Afromontane forests evidently store quantities of seeds in the soil and this is in contrast to the situation in most tropical rain forests, dry lowland forests and savannas, where both the number of seeds and the number of species are relatively small. It is possible that the strongly seasonal and unpredictable climate of this region may have selected for high levels of dormancy, and that herb regeneration is associated with small scale disturbance. The fact that most of the dominant tree species do not accumulate seeds in the soil suggests that their regeneration from seed would be unlikely if mature individuals disappeared. Most tree species have relatively large seeds and poor long-distance dispersal; this implies that restoration of Afromontane forests after destruction would be difficult. Since there is a diverse seed bank of the ground flora, this component of the vegetation would have a better chance of re-establishing. However, because most cleared forest land is used for agricultural crop production, it is probable that the seed bank will be depleted in only a few years. Therefore, the future of the Afromontane forest flora seems to depend on the successful conservation of the few fragments of remaining natural forest.																	1100-9233					DEC	1995	6	6					777	786		10.2307/3236391							WOS:A1995TV49300002						
J	Looney, PB; Gibson, DJ				Looney, PB; Gibson, DJ			The relationship between the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation of a coastal barrier island	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The germinable soil seed bank is described from a coastal barrier island off the northwest coast of Florida, USA. Soil samples collected from seven vegetation types, recently deposited dredge spoil and unvegetated areas in autumn 1990 and spring 1991 were placed out in greenhouse trays. 110 taxa germinated from the samples with the largest number (41) being C-3 perennial dicots. The largest number of taxa germinated from dry (57) and wet (54) swales, the fewest (one species: Heterotheca subaxillaris) from strand. Similarity of seed bank densities to above-ground species cover was low (Jaccard's Index = 0.36), not different between vegetation types, but higher in the autumn than in the following spring. Compositional gradients in the seed bank and above-ground vegetation determined using DCA ordination were highly correlated and related to distance from mean high water, and plot elevation. At the landscape scale, the seed bank provided an equally clear delineation of vegetation types to that based upon the above-ground vegetation. The seed bank of low disturbance, late-succession vegetation types (wooded dunes, swales, marshes) was well developed (high species richness, emergent density, and percentage annual species) with the exception that the large-seeded woody species (i.e. Quercus spp.) were absent from the wooded dune seed bank. By contrast, a poorly developed and transient seed bank occurred in more frequently disturbed (extensive sand movement, salt spray), early successional dredge spoil, unvegetated areas and strand. These contrasts support a general pattern of increasing seed bank development and a persistent rather than transient seed bank with decreasing disturbance frequency, increasing time since disturbance and successional maturity.																	1100-9233					DEC	1995	6	6					825	836		10.2307/3236396							WOS:A1995TV49300007						
J	Tanaka, H				Tanaka, H			Seed demography of three co-occurring Acer species in a Japanese temperate deciduous forest	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Seed demography of three co-occurring Acei species in an old-growth mixed deciduous forest in Japan was studied. Almost all of the seeds of A. mono germinated in the first spring, while those of A. palmatum var. amoenum showed a delay in germination of almost one year. A. rufinerve showed a rather opportunistic germination habit. Both A. palmatum var. amoenum and A. rufinerve form short-term persistent seed banks, but without input of newly dispersed seeds they may become extinct in about one year. The seed bank for these two species is not as significant as for a typical pioneer species, and the seedling bank is important for all three species. Only a small proportion of the dispersed propagules contained viable embryos, mainly due to pollination failure or abortion (A. mono and A. palmatum var. amoenum), and invertebrate pre dation (A. rufinerve). For all three species, larger seed crops had a higher percentage of viable seeds. Even for these relatively small, wind-dispersed seeds, the predation pressure was very high. A large part of the dispersed seeds was eaten by wood mice during the first winter (30 - 80 %). Estimation from the 5-yr average of seed dispersal and seedling emergence showed that only 7 - 16 % of the dispersed viable seeds succeeded in germinating.																	1100-9233					DEC	1995	6	6					887	896		10.2307/3236403							WOS:A1995TV49300014

This study examined seasonal species turnover, time-space community development and species-area relationships of an assemblage of microscopic forms, on boulders and stones in 2 tidal pools in central Chile (32 degrees 46' S; 71 degrees 33' W). A total of 25 taxa were found in the assemblage, with low species turnover throughout the year. The assemblage contained about twice the number of species present in the water column and about half the number present in the macroscopic vegetation. Species present in the macroalgal vegetation and in the water column accounted for 70% of the taxa in the assemblage; the remaining 30% suggested propagule sources outside the study area. Colonization and succession experiments indicated that the banks were formed by ephemeral and perennial species. Most perennials are slow-growing and crustose, of low-colonizing capacity; the bank seemed more important for the survival of these perennial species than for fugitive forms. Species richness in the bank correlated with the surface area of boulders. For areas larger than 40 cm(2), species richness was significantly higher on individually sampled stones than on equivalent surfaces subsampled from larger boulders, suggesting that, species richness follows predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The number of species was high, suggesting that disturbance affects the macroscopic expression of diversity rather than the total number of species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC	1995	129	1-3					215	228		10.3354/meps129215							WOS:A1995TP66400022

J	Cohen, AL; Singhakumara, BMP; Ashton, PMS				Cohen, AL; Singhakumara, BMP; Ashton, PMS			Releasing rain forest succession: A case study in the Dicranopteris linearis fernlands of Sri Lanka	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Throughout tropical moist climates, Dicranopteris linearis fernlands can develop as a result of rain forest clearance followed by frequent burning. In Sri Lanka, D. linearis fernlands are capable of suppressing the regeneration of rain forest. field experiments were conducted at Sinharaja Man and Biosphere Reserve, a rain forest where fernlands occupy substantial areas of the reserve boundary. The experiment's objective was to identify methods for initiating forest regeneration in fernlands dominated by D. linearis. Three disturbance treatments were used to initiate seedling regeneration: clean weed, root removal, and till. We hypothesized that increasing the severity of the soil disturbance would establish vegetation with higher species richness and diversity, greater above-ground dry biomass, and higher percentage cover and seedling density. Results indicate only partial support for this hypothesis. Dry biomass was greatest in till treatments, the most severe soil disturbance. By comparison, species richness and diversity, seedling density, and percentage cover were greatest in root-removal treatments, though in many instances the differences were not significant. The study clearly demonstrated that any kind of soil disturbance can facilitate the establishment of herbs, shrubs, and trees in a fernland dominated by D. linearis. Results showed that herbs, sedges, grasses, and pioneer shrubs represented greater proportions of seedling recruits than did pioneer trees. Seedlings of primary-forest tree species were nearly nonexistent. In general, results showed that soil disturbance can play an important role in site preparation for the purpose of initiating non-fern vegetation in fernlands dominated by D. linearis.																	1061-2971					DEC	1995	3	4					261	270		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1995.tb00093.x							WOS:A1995TL38900005						
J	Stevenson, MJ; Bullock, JM; Ward, LK				Stevenson, MJ; Bullock, JM; Ward, LK			Re-creating semi-natural communities: Effect of sowing rate on establishment of calcareous grassland.	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration ecologists are increasingly aware of the potential to re-create chalk grassland on abandoned farmland. Success is often hampered by lack of desirable species in the seed bank and by poor dispersal from nearby sites. In certain schemes, the input of seed may be essential. Locally collected seed is desirable but availability is limited. We examined whether lower sowing rates than currently recommended may be successfully utilized, facilitating more-efficient use of available seed. Experimental plots on former agricultural land were sown at different rates in a randomized complete block, and the vegetation was surveyed for two years. We compared species richness and cover for chalk grassland plants and weeds-species not associated with chalk grassland communities. Values for cover and abundance were matched with data for communities of the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC). Species richness for chalk grassland plants increased with sowing rate and with time, although after two years there was no significant difference between the treatments sown at 0.4, 1.0, and 4.0 grams of seed per square meter. Weed species decreased with increasing rate and time. After two seasons, the vegetation on all treatment plots was similar to that of recognized NVC chalk grassland communities, while the controls were dominated by weeds and showed signs of developing into species-poor grassland. Higher rates rapidly eliminated weeds, but even a small inoculum of seed seemed to significantly enhance establishment of desirable plants and to reduce weed cover. We conclude that lower sowing rates would enable the desired vegetation to become established successfully, under appropriate conditions and management regimes. Lower rates allow for the re-creation of sizable areas using local seed, and they minimize damage to donor sites.

J	Middleton, BA				Middleton, BA			Seed banks and species richness potential of coal slurry ponds reclaimed as wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Seed bank experiments are described to assess the species richness potential of coal slurry ponds reclaimed as wetlands (ranging from 6 to more than 40 years old). Experimental treatments test the drawdown and flooded conditions characteristic of the vegetation dynamics of emergent wetlands in the Upper Mississippi Valley. More seedlings, primarily annuals, emerged from exposed wet sediments (freely drained) than under continuous flooded sediments in cold ponds (339 versus 136 seedlings m(-2), respectively) and in natural ponds (163 versus 47, respectively). More seeds were produced by plants established in freely drained conditions than under flooded conditions from sediments in the coal ponds (26546 versus 1842 seeds m(-2), respectively) and the natural ponds (28430 versus 4526, respectively). Similarly, more biomass was also produced by these plants in freely drained than under flooded conditions in coal ponds (118 versus 47 g m(-2), respectively) and natural ponds (118 versus 52, respectively). Fertilization (NPK) did not affect germination for the most part, but it did affect seed set and biomass production, especially for C-4 annuals such as Echinochloa crusgalli and Panicum dichotomiflorum. I propose that lime (calcium carbonate) and fertilizer be applied during the first few scheduled drawdowns for these coal slurry ponds reclaimed as wetlands to increase the number of species and to allow their more rapid development as self-sustaining systems.

J	Carmona, R; Murdoch, AJ				Carmona, R; Murdoch, AJ			Interactions of temperature and dormancy-relieving compounds on the germination of weed seeds	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Dormant weed seeds were germinated at constant and alternating temperatures using five chemicals. Germination of Chenopodium album when expressed in normal equivalent deviates, increased linearly with the logarithm of chemical dose up to an optimal concentration. Ethephon (2-chloroethyl phosphonic acid) and sodium azide slightly stimulated germination of C. album seeds at 20 degrees C while potassium nitrate, thiourea and azide each interacted positively with alternating temperatures (5 degrees/25 degrees C). Relief of Avena fatua dormancy by azide exhibited a positive interaction with cool constant temperatures (3-10 degrees C), and chemicals had smaller or no effects at higher and alternating temperatures. No chemical mixture, including that of nitrate, thiourea, ethephon, azide and hydrogen peroxide, promoted more germination than azide on its own in A. fatua or nitrate together with ethephon in C.album. In C. album, this result arose largely because nitrate and azide antagonized each other in the presence of ethephon. Peroxide and thiourea together relieved this antagonism so that the fourth order interaction was positive. The negative interaction of nitrate, azide and ethephon in C. album was avoided in a sequential treatment with nitrate plus ethephon for seven days followed by sodium azide. Relief of dormancy by nitrate and ethephon was optimized at 67mM nitrate with 1.4 mM ethephon for C. album at 20 degrees C and 20 mM nitrate with 1.4mM ethephon for A. fatua at 15 degrees C. None of the chemicals used in this investigation stimulated the germination of Rumex crispus seeds. The results are discussed with respect to chemical control of soil seed banks.																	0960-2585					DEC	1995	5	4					227	236		10.1017/S0960258500002890							WOS:A1995TQ47100007						
J	Collins, B; Wein, G				Collins, B; Wein, G			Seed bank and vegetation of a constructed reservoir	WETLANDS												Vegetation development in constructed wetlands may be accelerated by planting aquatic and emergent species, especially when wetland seed banks are not initially present. Environmental patchiness of convoluted shorelines may enhance or retard establishment of planted or natural vegetation. Development of the seed bank may be influenced both by planting patterns and by shoreline convolutions. To determine if seed bank composition differed among locations, sediment cores were removed from coves, points, and straights, and from planted and unplanted regions of the shoreline of L-Lake, on the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina. This reservoir was built in 1985; portions of the shoreline were planted in 1987; and samples were taken in 1992. Sets of cores were taken from areas with water depths up to 1 m, the permanent waterline, and 1 m above water on the shore to determine the effects of hydrology on seed bank composition. Of the 136 seed bank taxa, only 33% were well represented and 35-46% occurred only once. Water depth was the primary influence on seed bank composition. Points, coves, and straights differed in species richness over water depths but did not differ in number of germinable seeds over depths, nor did locations differ in species richness or number of plants at the waterline. Planting vegetation in L-Lake did not significantly influence the seed bank; only 10% of taxa in the seed bank were planted in 1987. Of all taxa recorded, 56% were only in the seed bank, 22% were only in the vegetation, and 13% were in both the seed bank and the vegetation.																	0277-5212					DEC	1995	15	4					374	385		10.1007/BF03160892							WOS:A1995TM60700008						
J	LINDER, CR; SCHMITT, J				LINDER, CR; SCHMITT, J			POTENTIAL PERSISTENCE OF ESCAPED TRANSGENES - PERFORMANCE OF TRANSGENIC, OIL-MODIFIED BRASSICA SEEDS AND SEEDLINGS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We performed two experiments designed to assess the risk that seed-oil-modification transgenes will increase the persistence of feral Brassica napus canola and interspecific hybrids of B. napus canola and wild Brassica rapa, a weedy relative. The first experiment, conducted at field sites in California and Georgia where oil-modified canola will be grown commercially, tested whether buried seeds of transgenic high-stearate canola had increased survivorship and dormancy. Performance of the high-stearate type was compared to nontransgenic null segregant and parental lines. In California, no differences in initial proportions of dormant seeds and rates of exit could be detected between high-stearate canola and its controls, suggesting low probability that high-stearate canola will form a larger or more persistent seed bank than its nonpersistent controls. In Georgia, although high-stearate canola initially had as low or lower proportions of dormant seeds than its controls, high-stearate seeds exhibited no detectable exit from the seed bank, whereas both controls had significant rates of exit. Hence, escaped high-stearate seed may persist for a longer period than its controls at this site. Differences between the sites highlight the need to conduct risk assessment over the range where a transgenic crop will be commercialized. The second experiment, a greenhouse study, measured the relative ability of oil-modified canolas and wild X crop hybrids to emerge from four depths in the soil (0, 0.5, 4, and 10 cm) and their subsequent seedling vigor. We tested lines of B, napus canola carrying either the hi,oh-stearate gene or a transgene for high-laurate production, using nontransgenic parental types as controls. We also examined the impact of the high-laurate transgene in interspecific wild B. rapa X B. napus canola hybrids. Performance of the high-laurate hybrids was compared to nontransgenic hybrids and the B. rapa wild parent. For all seed types, no seedlings emerged from 10 cm, and all seedlings emerged from 0 and 0.5 cm. A higher proportion of high-stearate canola emerged from 4 cm than its control, but for all depths, high-stearate canola emerged more slowly and had significantly less biomass than its control 2 and 4 wk following emergence. In contrast, high-laurate canola's total emergence and timing of emergence could not be distinguished from its control. Although high-laurate canola's 2-wk biomass was less than that of its control, by 4 wk, its biomass was equivalent due to its significantly higher relative growth rate during that period. The different results for the two oil-modification transgenes suggest that even transgenes with similar functions should be considered on a case-by-case basis. From 0 and 0.5 cm, high-laurate wild X canola hybrids' total emergence, timing of emergence, and biomass accumulation were indistinguishable from their wild parent. High-laurate hybrids emerged more rapidly and had greater biomass at 2 wk than their hybrid controls. Our results indicate that high-laurate hybrids, emerged from shallow depths, may experience performance advantages that will allow them to perform as well as their persistent, wild parent.																	1051-0761					NOV	1995	5	4					1056	1068		10.2307/2269354							WOS:A1995TF37500019

Seed banks of both populations were persistent, with greater numbers and more species diversity in undisturbed populations. The undisturbed population showed a 65% allocation to reproduction at maturity as compared with 4% biomass allocation to reproduction in disturbed population. Populations of L. urticifolia in an undisturbed subtropical desert community of Karachi, Pakistan, have larger and more persistent seed banks, larger plant size, and higher reproductive allocations as compared with a disturbed community.

The suitability of formerly arable land for heathland restoration was studied on sandy soils in the Netherlands. For this purpose, nutrient (N, P) availability and the composition of the seed bank were investigated in three situations: a Calluna-dominated heathland (CH), an adjacent fallow-lying formerly arable field that had been Calluna-dominated heathland until about 1950 (FA), and a fallow-lying formerly arable field from which the topsoil had been removed (FR). 2. Total soil organic matter content and total soil C, N and P were highest in the FA soil and lowest in the FR soil. The soil from the Calluna heathland showed intermediate values. 3. There were only small differences in the amount of extractable N between the CH soil and the FA soil. Removal of topsoil resulted in a significant reduction of extractable N. 4. In the FA soil the amount of extractable P was 50-180 times as high as the amount of extractable N, with a maximum content of about 280 kg ha(-1) for the upper 10 cm of the soil. In the heathland soil, the amount of extractable N was equal to or exceeded the values for the FA soil, but the values for extractable P were about 100 times lower. After removing the topsoil, the amount of extractable P in the formerly arable field was reduced to very low levels. 5. Nitrogen mineralization was not significantly different between the heathland soil and the FA soil in two out of three sampling periods. The removal of the topsoil of the formerly arable field substantially reduced N mineralization. 6. There were few significant differences in P release from the different soil types. The calculated amounts of P released over a 6-week period were in all cases lower than the amount of extractable P. Exactly the opposite pattern was observed for N. 7. Seeds of Calluna were detected only in the soil of the Calluna heathland. In the FA and the FR soil, seeds of common or ruderal plant species only were detected. 8. These results show that heathland restoration at this study site requires a substantial reduction of P availability in the soil together with the active introduction of heather propagules. Topsoil removal appears to be an effective means of reducing nutrient availability.																	0021-8901					NOV	1995	32	4					827	835		10.2307/2404822							WOS:A1995TP22100015						
J	OWENS, MK; SCHLIESING, TG				OWENS, MK; SCHLIESING, TG			INVASIVE POTENTIAL OF ASHE JUNIPER AFTER MECHANICAL DISTURBANCE	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Reinvasion of mechanically disturbed juniper communities is possible through contributions from the soil seedbank, seed rain, and the juvenile seedling bank, We compared spatial distribution of the seedbank and seed rain of undisturbed communities to sites where trees were deliberately left as single trees, small mottes of less than 5 trees per group, or large mottes of 5-10 trees per group. Seed density in the litter layer ranged from 1,197 to 1,436 seeds m(-2) and in the soil layer from 318 to 617 seeds m(-2). Seed rain ranged from 275 to 366 seeds m(-2) over all tree arrangements, The treatment associated with single trees caused the litter layer to be removed resulting in the removal of that portion of the seedbank, consequently most seeds (>80%) were found under the canopy of mature, seed-producing trees, Soil disturbance was less severe in small and large motte arrangements, so only 65% of the soil seed bank was under mature trees, In undisturbed communities, the seed population was distributed evenly under tree canopies and in interspaces. Viability and germinability within the seedbank were low (4% and 0%, respectively), Viability of new seed was 47% and germinability was approximately 5%, The juvenile seedling bank contained a sufficient number of seedlings (408 seedlings ha(-1)) for ashe juniper to regain dominance on the site through growth, There was no advantage to any spatial pattern of tree distribution in terms of invasive potential when fewer than 10 trees ha(-1) were left on a site. However, when 20-50 trees ha(-1) are left on a site, tree spatial arrangement has a significant effect on reinvasion rates.

J	Cappers, RTJ				Cappers, RTJ			A palaeoecological model for the interpretation of wild plant species	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												The interpretation of subfossil records of wild plant species with respect to both environmental conditions and past vegetation is complicated by the following: (1) production and dispersal of plant remains including diaspores, (2) the formation of the soil flora, (3) taphonomic processes and differential preservation that act on subfossil assemblages and (4) methods applied to produce subfossil records. Whereas the similarity between recent plant communities and seed banks is often weak, the relationship between past vegetation and subfossil assemblages is still more complicated. It is therefore unlikely that macrofossil assemblages derived from soil samples can be considered as pure samples representing particular palaeobiocoenoses. The assumption that plant communities, in the past, may have been in some way aberrant with respect to composition and that the ecological ranges of species varied during the Quaternary has to be rejected, if not based on well considered assumptions or evidence from pure samples. Only if a sufficient number of suitable studies is available, which enable evaluation between all kinds of plant communities and their respective seed floras, can progress be made with regard to the reconstruction of past vegetation and environmental conditions. As long as these data are not available, the ecological interpretation of particular subfossil assemblages isolated from soil samples has to be carefully evaluated within their particular context.																	0939-6314					NOV	1995	4	4					249	257									WOS:A1995TN55400006						
J	FOX, GA; EVANS, AS; KEEFER, CJ				FOX, GA; EVANS, AS; KEEFER, CJ			PHENOTYPIC CONSEQUENCES OF FORCING GERMINATION - A GENERAL PROBLEM OF INTERVENTION IN EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Many evolutionary and ecological studies of plants with seed dormancy are plagued by design problems related to seed germination. On the one hand, traits of interest, especially life history traits like early growth rate or time to flowering, may not be independent of dormancy phenotype. On the other hand, germination-inducing treatments are likely to affect these traits of interest. Consequently, researchers often have had to use confounded designs without information about the consequences. To examine this problem, we studied how early growth in California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) is affected by treating seeds with giberellic acid (GA) to stimulate germination. The dose used was sufficient to slightly but significantly advance emergence time in treated seeds, but it appeared to cause variable growth responses among treated seeds. Experiments using GA to stimulate germination may thus be misleading, at least for the populations and dose studied. Perhaps more importantly, the experimental and statistical approach we used can be employed to study the effects of this confounded design for other doses and species.

J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW			Role of temperature in the germination ecology of the summer annual Bidens polylepis Blake (Asteraceae)	BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB												Achenes (seeds) of Bidens polylepis were dormant at maturity in autumn, and they came out of dormancy while buried in moist soil in a nonheated greenhouse during winter or at 5 or 15/6 degrees C for 12 weeks. As seeds came out of dormancy, they first germinated at 30/15 and 35/20 degrees C in light and at 30/15 degrees C in darkness. With additional loss of dormancy, the minimum temperature for germination in light and darkness decreased to 15/6 degrees C. Nondormant seeds re-entered dormancy (secondary dormancy) when (1)kept in the greenhouse during summer, (2) subjected sequentially to simulated March-October temperatures in incubators or (3) exposed to 25/15 or 30/15 degrees C for 24 and 12 weeks, respectively. As seeds entered dormancy, they first lost the ability to germinate at 15/6 degrees C and then at higher temperatures. Buried seeds exposed to seasonal temperature changes for 28 months in the nonheated greenhouse exhibited an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle, with full dormancy occurring in September-November. Seeds came out of dormancy in winter (December-March), and they germinated to 85-96% in light at simulated habitat temperatures from mid-April until July. Although 20-50% of the seeds germinated in darkness at simulated habitat temperatures in spring (March-June), only 2% of them germinated while buried in soil in the nonheated greenhouse. Thus, seeds have the potential to form a persistent seed bank.																	0040-9618					OCT-DEC	1995	122	4					275	281		10.2307/2996319							WOS:A1995TP08100002						
J	Menges, ES; Kohfeldt, N				Menges, ES; Kohfeldt, N			Life history strategies of Florida scrub plants in relation to fire	BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB												To characterize life history strategies of Florida scrub plants in relation to fire, we classified 98 species into guilds based on recovery mechanisms and post-fire abundance patterns. Two types of scrub were analyzed: xeric, infrequently-burned rosemary scrub and more productive, more-frequently burned scrubby flatwoods. Based on recovery mechanisms, most (92%) species are in four guilds: resprouters (mainly woody shrubs), resprouters and seeders (small-statured shrubs, palms, and herbaceous perennials), obligate seeders (mainly herbs), and resprouters and clonal spreaders. The last category contains most of the dominant shrubs of scrubby flatwoods. Two pine species each comprised a unique guild based on recovery mechanisms. Most species of scrubby flatwoods (59%) and rosemary scrub (53%) had no significant trend in post-fire abundance. About twice as many scrubby flatwoods species increased as decreased in frequency with time since fire; increasers included ground lichens and two of the three dominant oaks. Similar numbers of species increased and decreased in rosemary scrub. Most increasers were ground lichens and most decreasers were herbaceous perennials. In scrubby flatwoods, most plants with vegetative recovery modes tended to increase in frequency with time since fire, mixed recovery mode plants usually had no trend, and obligate seeders decreased. In rosemary scrub, mixed recovery modes were associated with decreasing post-fire trends, while seeders tended to increase in post-fire abundance. Infrequently-burned rosemary scrub provides opportunities for seedling recovery from fire, evident in both in its dominant species and in the many endemic and open-space specialist herbs. In contrast, recovery from fire by resprouting and clonal growth is common in the more-frequently burned scrubby flatwoods, promoting rapid post-fire recovery and long-term competitive superiority in this more productive habitat. To promote life history and species diversity, fire management in Florida scrub should avoid overly regular fire regimes, fire suppression or too-frequent burning. Modal intervals will differ between scrubby flatwoods (520 years) and rosemary scrub(15-40 years). When to reburn rosemary scrub may depend on the specific responses of its many endemic plant species to fire.																	0040-9618					OCT-DEC	1995	122	4					282	297		10.2307/2996320							WOS:A1995TP08100003						
J	PURRINGTON, CB; SCHMITT, J				PURRINGTON, CB; SCHMITT, J			SEXUAL DIMORPHISM OF DORMANCY AND SURVIVORSHIP IN BURIED SEEDS OF SILENE LATIFOLIA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 To test for differences in survivorship between buried male and female seeds in the dioecious perennial, Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae), the behaviour of large numbers of seeds buried under field conditions and unearthed after 5 and 10 months was compared with unburied seeds. 2 After 5 months of burial there was significant mortality of seeds and a large fraction of the remaining seeds displayed induced dormancy, i.e. they did not germinate under glasshouse conditions. The sex ratio of germinating seeds was not significantly different from the sex ratio of seeds germinated without burial (0 months). 3 Seed survivorship was constant from 5 to 10 months. However, by 10 months levels of dormancy had decreased so that most seeds germinated when unearthed and tested in a growth chamber. Furthermore, the proportion of females in germinating seed was significantly higher after 10 months than after 5 months. 4 Sex differences in mortality were therefore only revealed after 10 months, when dormancy had been broken. This result suggests that female seeds were more likely to become dormant during the first 5 months of burial, whereas males suffered greater mortality. Thus, sex differences in both survivorship and dormancy of buried seeds affected the sex ratio of germinating seeds over time. Such sexual dimorphism in seed bank dynamics may have an important effect on sex ratio variation in natural populations of dioecious plants.																	0022-0477					OCT	1995	83	5					795	800		10.2307/2261416							WOS:A1995TA72400006

The initial soil seed bank and two years of seed rain and seed removal by erosion were estimated in two small catchments, and a seed balance was constructed. In addition, six rainfall simulation experiments were performed to test the susceptibility of seeds to be removed by overland flow. A variety of soil surface conditions, rainfall characteristics and plot sizes were used in these experiments. Soil seed bank densities are low, but enough for the development of plant cover. Seed losses due to erosion after natural rains were low (< 13 %), and in agreement with seed losses from simulated rainfall experiments. After two years, seed inputs in the seed rain were greater than seed outputs through seed removal, which resulted in a continuous increase in the numbers of seeds in the soil bank. These results point out that seed removal by erosion is not the key factor explaining the lack of vegetation on badlands. It is suggested that other factors, such as those related to seed germination and seedling survival, may play an important role.

J	BONIS, A; LEPART, J; GRILLAS, P				BONIS, A; LEPART, J; GRILLAS, P			SEED BANK DYNAMICS AND COEXISTENCE OF ANNUAL MACROPHYTES IN A TEMPORARY AND VARIABLE HABITAT	OIKOS												The seed bank dynamics of annuals in two Mediterranean temporary marshes were studied in order to investigate the impact of the disturbance regime on coexistence. The disturbance regime is made up of drought periods in the marshes and of predation. The density of diaspores buried in the sediment was measured in 4 consecutive years together with the biomass produced during two growing seasons. The total density of diaspores in the sediment varied markedly from year to year but always remained at a high level for all species (between 73000 and 800000 per m(2)). These perennial seed banks allowed the populations to be maintained despite two successive years without any reproduction. In experimental conditions, the seed bank was not depleted after the sediment samples had been submerged during 5 successive periods. The majority of the seedlings emerged as soon as the first period of flooding and temporary droughts stimulated the germination of Zannichellia spp. and Ranunculus baudotii. The decrease in the number of seeds buried in the soil was essentially due to germination. This was stronger when the seeds were recently produced and situated at the surface of the sediment. The seed density varied only slightly with the depth of the marsh, except in the case of Ruppia maritima. The seed bank is highly variable on a spatial microscale bur no aggregation pattern could be demonstrated. In the field, the biomass of a population generally appeared not to be limited by the availability of the diaspores, notably because of the ability to propagate vegetatively which is shown by all species studied. Similarly, a high vegetative biomass does not guarantee a high reproductive output as the droughts occur in a density-independent way. The success of a species is related to the interaction between its life history traits and the environmental conditions met each year. The macrophyte communities we studied function in non-equilibrium, with patterns close to those described in lottery models of coexistence. Establishment, growth and reproduction fluctuate strongly from one year to another for all species, in a partially asynchronous way. This would enable competitive exclusion to be indefinitely delayed. The seed bank introduces a storage effect by magnifying the effect of the ''favourable years'' in comparison with the ''bad years''.																	0030-1299					OCT	1995	74	1					81	92		10.2307/3545677							WOS:A1995TJ35900009						
J	BASKIN, JM; BASKIN, CC				BASKIN, JM; BASKIN, CC			VARIATION IN THE ANNUAL DORMANCY CYCLE IN BURIED SEEDS OF THE WEEDY WINTER ANNUAL VIOLA-ARVENSIS	WEED RESEARCH												Seeds of Viola arvensis collected in different years and in different months within those years were buried in soil under natural seasonal temperature cycles, and changes in their germination requirements monitored. Seeds were dormant at maturity in May or June, but nondormant by autumn. During winter, some seeds entered dormancy, while others entered conditional dormancy, i.e. retained the ability to germinate at 15/6 and 20/10 degrees C but not at other thermoperiods. Dormant and conditionally dormant seeds became nondormant the following summer. Seeds collected in 1981 exhibited an annual dormancy:nondormancy cycle, while those collected in 1982 exhibited an annual conditional dormancy:nondormancy cycle. The type of dormancy cycle found in these seed lots during their first year of burial persisted in subsequent years. Thirty-five and 36% of seeds collected in May 1983 and 1986, respectively, were conditionally dormant the following May, while only 5 and 9% of those collected in the same field in June 1983 and 1986, respectively, were conditionally dormant. Dormant seeds collected in 1981, 1982 and 1984 and buried at 5 degrees C during summer germinated to 0, 33 and 0% respectively, at 15/6 degrees C in autumn. After the 1982 seeds became nondormant during summer, only 25% entered conditional dormancy when buried at 5 degrees C, but after the 1981 and 1984 seeds became nondormant, 100% entered conditional dormancy at 5 degrees C. Thus, the persistent seed bank of V. arvensis at a population site may consist of seeds with an annual dormancy:nondormancy cycle and others with an annual conditional dormancy:nondormancy cycle. This is the first report of the two types of annual seed dormancy cycles in the same species.																	0043-1737					OCT	1995	35	5					353	362		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1995.tb01630.x							WOS:A1995TE28400004						
J	GARCIA, MA				GARCIA, MA			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WEED COMMUNITY AND SOIL SEED BANK IN A TROPICAL AGROECOSYSTEM	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The viable weed seed bank in a maize field was studied at Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. In 1984 50 soil samples (49 cm(2)) were taken at depths of 0-2 cm, 5-7 cm and 15-17 cm. The 150 samples were kept in resistant plastic bags arranged as vases and watered daily. The number of viable seeds was determined by counting the emerging seedlings. A total of 195 seeds emerged from the samples, i.e. an estimated 2325 seeds m(-2). Ageratum conyzoides dominated the 20 species recorded in the seed bank community. Of the weed species occurring aboveground, 41% in 1983 and 39% in 1984 were found as seeds in the soil samples. In 1983, 70% of the seed bank species occurred in the flora, and 85% in 1984. Based on these relationships, the tendency for cultivated soils in the tropics to have smaller seed banks than in temperate regions is discussed.																	0167-8809					SEP	1995	55	2					139	146		10.1016/0167-8809(95)00604-Q							WOS:A1995TF08500006						
J	CARY, GJ; MORRISON, DA				CARY, GJ; MORRISON, DA			EFFECTS OF FIRE FREQUENCY ON PLANT-SPECIES COMPOSITION OF SANDSTONE COMMUNITIES IN THE SYDNEY REGION - COMBINATIONS OF INTER-FIRE INTERVALS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Fire frequency is the number of fires experienced by a particular community within a given time period. This variable can potentially be resolved into a number of interacting components, including time since the most recent fire, and the length of the inter-fire intervals. We estimated the effects of inter-fire intervals and sequences of inter-fire intervals, independently of time-since-fire, on the floristic composition of 26 samples from dry sclerophyll vegetation with different fire histories in Brisbane Water National Park near Sydney. In particular, we examined the effects in the recent fire history of: the length of the shortest inter-fire interval (1-26 years); repetition of very short (1-3 years) and medium (7-14 years) inter-fire intervals; and recovery from very short (1-3 years) and short (4-6 years) inter-fire intervals. Our analyses suggest that inter-fire interval may account for about 55% of the floristic variation among our samples, which were taken at a uniform 18 months after the most recent fire. There appear to be at least three general and unrelated effects of the recent history of inter-fire intervals on the floristic composition of this vegetation: (i) shorter inter-fire intervals were associated with a reduction in the number of species present in the community, along with a more unequal abundance of the remaining species, particularly of those large Proteaceae shrubs that often dominate the community biomass in dry sclerophyll shrublands of southeastern Australia; (ii) the presence of an inter-fire interval that: is 1-6 years long was associated with an additional reversible reduction in the number of fire-sensitive species present in the community, particularly those common shrub species with a canopy-stored seed-bank and non-leguminous species with a soil-scored seed-bank; and (iii) repetition of inter-fire intervals that are 1-5 years long was associated with an increase in the abundance of herbaceous fire-tolerant species. This means that variation in these characteristics is associated with changes in abundance of different plant species, and that the floristic composition of any one area can be influenced in three different ways by these variables. Management of fire for plant species conservation must therefore be based on both length of time-since-fire and length of inter-lire intervals if it is to be effective.																	0307-692X					SEP	1995	20	3					418	426		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1995.tb00558.x							WOS:A1995RW33100009

Thirty-six species of seed plants representing the Krakatau flora germinated from the samples. The topsoil samples yielded the largest number of seedlings and species, and had a faster pace of germination. These samples were found to be locally similar to each other but disharmonic with the extant vegetation. Seeds germinated both from samples buried by land crabs and from soils buried by layers of volcanic ash deposited ca 1930-33 and 1952-53. Eleven species of seed plants germinated from four samples buried ca 1930-33, indicating that these seeds survived burial by volcanic ash for ca 60 years.

Seeds were placed in situ in the field, and after four days with wind as the sole dispersing agency, 19% of the seeds were repositioned. After another 11 days, during which both wind and water acted as dispersing agencies, all seeds of both types had either become repositioned and were still visible (1/3 of the seeds), had penetrated into the ground at the point of release or after dispersal (1/3), or were not recovered (1/3). The probability to become lifted secondarily by water was similar in both seed types. Of those seeds repositioned and recovered on the ground, more of the winged type had been transported any distance horizontally than the unwinged type, The seed dispersal curve was strongly skewed to the left, and the winged seed type was transported slightly further than the unwinged type, both during primary and secondary dispersal. All seeds were transported further when placed on bare soil than when placed in dense vegetation. Vertical transportation was quicker in dense vegetation, and unwinged seeds disappeared more quickly into the ground. In dense vegetation, unwinged seeds were more frequently encountered in the seed bank than winged seeds, whereas in the absence of vegetation cover, seeds of both types recovered in the soil were found in equal shares.																	0906-7590					SEP	1995	18	3					230	237		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1995.tb00126.x							WOS:A1995TE52500004

The effects of wetness period and inoculum concentration on disease severity were studied under controlled conditions. The fungus was grown on different artificial culture media and carrot juice agar with 5 g l(-1) yeast extract was found to be the most suitable medium for conidial production under artificial conditions. Abundant disease symptoms only occurred after 8 h of wetness at 20 degrees C. The minimum incubation period before disease symptoms appeared was 8 days following a wetness period of at least 40 h. Inoculum concentration of 1 x 10(4) conidia per mi killed plants in less than one month and reduced seed production by two thirds. These results suggest that this pathogen has the potential to reduce plant survival and seed bank replenishment of this annual weed species.

High winter rainfall, high spring temperatures, and exceptionally high June rainfall in combination with below average temperatures provided favourable environmental conditions for floral initiation in the preceding growing season. Quantitative data on spike production per plant, mean number of flowers and fruits per spike, dry mass and potential viability of seeds, and seed density on the ground are presented, as well as preliminary estimates for pre- and post-dispersal predation. The data show high allocation to sexual reproduction, although S. tenacissima is a clonal plant which normally reproduces vegetatively by tillering. Heavy predation of the soil seed bank by seed-harvesting ants was observed. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited.

J	WILLMS, WD; QUINTON, DA				WILLMS, WD; QUINTON, DA			GRAZING EFFECTS ON GERMINABLE SEEDS ON THE FESCUE PRAIRIE	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												The germinable seed bank in a grassland affects the succession of degraded range and the recolonization of disturbed sites, and must be understood to predict potential responses to management. The germinable seed bank on the fescue prairie was characterized and its relationship to grazing, season, and depth of burial determined, The study was conducted in the fescue prairie of southwestern Alberta in livestock exclosures and on paddocks that, since 1949, have been stocked at fixed rates to achieve light, moderate, or heavy grazing pressures. Surface debris was sampled in fall and spring, and soil was sampled to a depth of 6 cm in spring. The samples were spread on vermiculite in trays and the seeds allowed to germinate over a 90-day period. In fall, total surface seed numbers m(-2) increased from 1,785 to 7,783 from the ungrazed to heavily grazed site, and most of the differences were accounted for by whitlow-grass (Draba spp.) and Kentucky bluegrass (Pea pratensis L.). These species also contributed most to differences between fall and spring on the grazed sites. Total seed numbers were similar (1,790 vs 1,803) in spring and fall on ungrazed sites. The species composition of the seed bank did not change with depth. In the soil, the annual forb pygmyflower (Androsace septentrionalis L.) was the most common seed but was not detected in a vegetation survey, Soil disturbance in the fescue prairie is more likely to lead to a seral community dominated by annual forbs, than a rough fescue (Festuca campestris Rydb.) dominated grassland.																	0022-409X					SEP	1995	48	5					423	430		10.2307/4002246							WOS:A1995RU39300008

Several aspects of the regeneration of these Passiflora species were examined and the results generally reflected those of intensive studies of the same species conducted in Hawaii. Seed germination in the laboratory was continuous over an 8 month period from sowing, and in the wild this allows seeds to accumulate in the soil seed bank. Germinable seeds and seedling numbers, however, were of a similar magnitude to those of native angiosperms at the sites, and they do not reach the very large numbers of some woody weeds. Seedling growth was c. 10 cm over a seven month period at two sites at 300 m a.s.l., which is towards the upper altitudinal limit of Passiflora species. Stem cuttings readily establish in both a glasshouse and a shadehouse. As stems frequently become buried and fragmented on steep slopes, their regeneration may assist in the localised spread of the plant, and also in the re-establishment of plants on a wide range of sites after mechanical control operations. Establishment of Passiflora species is restricted to areas of high light levels and soil disturbance such as forest clearings and road cuttings in the absence of dense herbaceous growth. Small forest and scrub remnants with high edge-to-area ratios are therefore particularly vulnerable. Passiflora species are relatively new weeds which are probably still expanding their range, and they can be expected to increase, assisted by human activity, particularly adjacent to highways.																	0028-825X					SEP	1995	33	3					315	323		10.1080/0028825X.1995.10412959							WOS:A1995TB88000005

We describe in detail a series of these incidents on the central California coast, based upon observational and comparative evidence. Stands of thousands of plants die, while nearby mature plants live on. In some sites, repeated die-off followed by regeneration from the seed bank has led to the cover and density of this woody, perennial plant fluctuating widely over the 40 year period for which records exist. Root damage by caterpillars of the ghost moth or ''swift'' Hepialus californicus (Lepidoptera, Hepialidae) is a major cause of individual bush death and a probable cause of die-off of stands of lupine. Hidden from view underground, a few of these insects readily kill a juvenile or young mature plant by girdling and reaming-out roots. The mass mortality of L. arboreus that we observed involved heavy root damage by these caterpillars in even-aged stands of plants in their first (1.5-year-old) or second (2.5-year-old) flowering season. The injured plants set seed before dying. Older, larger bush lupines better withstood root damage. In plants aged 3 or more years, damage and mortality were correlated with the intensity of ghost moth caterpillars in the roots. At the highest intensity (mean = 37.5, maximum = 62 caterpillars/root), a stand of large, old L. arboreus suffered 41% mortality; 45% of root cambium (median value) was destroyed by feeding caterpillars. Mass death of mature L. arboreus was not correlated with folivory, and leaf damage ranged from nil to moderate in instances of die-off. The western tussock moth, Orgyia vetusta, accounted for the highest levels of folivory, but this insect was rare when die-offs occurred. The lowest lupine mortality rates in our study occurred where tussock caterpillar intensities were high and where plants were repeatedly defoliated by this insect. However, experimental defoliation by high, but realistic, intensities of tussock moth caterpillars resulted in some mortality of mature bushes, and the combined effects of leaf and root herbivory have yet to be assessed. In its natural range on the California coast, bush lupine has several additional species of insect herbivores that can be locally abundant and injurious to the plant, al though none is associated with die-off. Subterranean natural enemies of ghost moth caterpillars may play a role in the patchy waxing and waning of this shrub. Locally, a new species of entomophagous nematode (Heterorhabditis sp.) causes high mortality in the soil, before ghost moth caterpillars have entered the root. This natural enemy may thus afford lupines protection from heavy under ground herbivory.																	0029-8549					SEP	1995	104	1					85	92		10.1007/BF00365566							WOS:A1995RZ35900012	28306917					
J	BRAND, T; PARKER, VT				BRAND, T; PARKER, VT			SCALE AND GENERAL LAWS OF VEGETATION DYNAMICS	OIKOS												In the recent theoretical proposal of S. T. A. Pickett and colleagues, a patch dynamic concept of secondary succession is used to develop general laws of vegetational change. While this proposal is an important step in the formalization of vegetation theory, its basis in secondary succession limits its applicability at larger spatial or temporal scales than those of single disturbance patches. We show that general theory must incorporate a more inclusive concept of environmental constraints on species behaviors than advanced in their proposal, as well as an expanded account of those behaviors. Our modifications of the original proposal allow its unrestricted applicability at all scales relevant to vegetation dynamics, and emphasize the fundamentally continuous, interactive nature of these dynamics.																	0030-1299					SEP	1995	73	3					375	380		10.2307/3545961							WOS:A1995TA64800009

Restoration of habitat will form the basis for responses by most biological components of the ecosystem and will provide a key indicator of the success of the restoration effort. This paper evaluates the relative importance of a range of abiotic and biotic habitat parameters in the existing and historic Kissimmee River ecosystem and provides a conceptual framework for predicting expected spatial and temporal responses of river and floodplain habitats to the restoration project. Among the ecological factors and processes that influenced the development, dynamics, and maintenance of river and floodplain habitat structure, hydrology is expected to be of central importance in eliciting restoration responses in the Kissimmee River ecosystem. Based on the assumption that the restoration plan will reestablish historic hydrologic characteristics, predictions are made of expected responses by geomorphic and vegetative components of the Kissimmee River's habitat structure. Recommendations are made regarding key habitat parameters requiring long-term tracking and analysis and utilization of a geographic information system (GIS). A hierarchical habitat classification scheme is provided as a foundation for all components of the restoration evaluation program.

J	FRISVOLD, GB; CONDON, P				FRISVOLD, GB; CONDON, P			THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY - IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE												Among other goals, the Convention on Biological Diversity addresses two controversies surrounding the international system of exchange of crop genetic resources (CGRs). One debate has been over the definition of property rights over CGRs and the distribution of benefits from their use. The second has been over the adequacy of incentives for conserving CGRs both in situ and ex situ. This paper examines how these two debates are linked and reviews previous multilateral attempts to resolve disputes over genetic resources. The scope for Convention provisions and proposed implementation strategies to resolve disputes and achieve stated goals are assessed. The Convention signals wider international acceptance of both intellectual property rights (IPRs) over biological inventions and the need for multilateral assistance for CGR preservation. There remains disagreement over how strict future IPRs should become, however, and current proposals to implement the Convention appear inadequate to achieve their stated objectives. Future controversies remain over four broad issues: (1) the breadth of IPR protection, including the future of research and farmer exemptions to patents, (2) control over operation of international seed banks, (3) the need for an international biosafety protocol regulating biotechnology testing and trade, and (4) how biodiversity conservation funds will be raised and allocated.																	0040-1625					SEP	1995	50	1					41	54		10.1016/0040-1625(94)00086-C							WOS:A1995RT49000004

Six transects were established in three plant communities within two marshes. Seed production varied between 1 and 621/m(2) among transects and increased with shoot density and the proportion of shoots with flowers. The number of seeds per fertile shoot did not vary among communities and averaged 1.8 +/- 0.1 (SE). The variation in seed production was related to the interacting effects of goose herbivory, soil type, and vegetative growth. The seed bank yielded 20-200 seedlings/m(2) at different sites. Germination rates obtained in situ under experimental conditions averaged 28% overall and reached 62% in one community with sandy substrate. Both the collection and seeding sites affected levels of germination. Seedlings varied between 0 and 25/m(2) among sites and represented 0-3% of the total number of shoots. Low seedling survival was attributed to sediment accretion. Seedlings established themselves successfully only on bare patches created by erosion of the micro-bluff separating the lower and the upper marsh. We conclude that seeding of S. pungens is not an effective technique to create or restore tidal marshes where sediment accretion is important.

The species having the greatest number of buried seeds in forest soil were Eurya japonica, Clethra barbinervis and Rhododendron macrosepalum. Some other species including Aralia elata, Rhus javanica and Rubus spp. had a small number of buried seeds. Three types of emergence patterns of buried seeds of these species were distinguishable. The first type was characterized by an initial flush of emergence, and the second type was characterized by long lasting intermittent emergence. The third type was an intermediate type. Species such as Acer crataegifolium, Acanthopanax sciadophylloides, Prunus grayana, P. densiflora and Hydrangea paniculata had current year seedlings under the closed canopy with densities from 2.0 2m(-2) to 23.8 2m(-2). Seedlings of P. densiflora and H. paniculata, however, suffered heavy mortality and no current year seedlings survived to October. In the sapling layer(age >1 year old), A. crataegifolium, E. japonica, Viburnum dilatatum, Pourthiaea villosa and R. macrosepalum dominated strongly. Based upon the number of buried seeds, the number of seedlings and the number of saplings of each species, species composing this secondary forest could be grouped into three regeneration types; advance regeneration type, buried seeds type and newly dispersed type. Finally we discussed the effect of the disturbance regime through regeneration behaviors of component species on the vegetation structure and successional dynamics of forests dominated by P. densiflora and P. serrata. It was also noted that recognition of the diversity of regeneration behaviors might be necessary in order to maintain and manage P. densiflora and e. serrata dominated secondary forests.																	0378-1127					AUG	1995	76	1-3					1	10		10.1016/0378-1127(95)03564-Q							WOS:A1995TC76200001

To test whether differences in water relations were responsible for differences in species distributions across a landscape, we investigated patterns of water use (water potential, transpiration) of Protea susannae (associated with deep soil) and Protea compacta (associated with shallow soil) in the field (mature plants) and in the laboratory (seedlings). 2. Adults of P. susannae had more extensive root systems and less conservative water use than those of P. compacta, suggesting greater access to water. However, no substantial differences in water potential or transpiration were found, for either species, between plants in deep and shallow soils. 3. Germination, seedling growth and water relations were compared under controlled-environment conditions. Protea compacta seedlings were much larger with greater root depth and transpiration rate (per plant). The consequence of this was a drying out of the soil profile leading to greater dependence on the water table. Protea susannae seedlings were initially conservative in water use but, after 30 weeks, had a similar rate of transpiration (per plant) to P. compacta seedlings, despite a much smaller leaf area. 4. Both species were found to experience switches in water-use strategy between seedling and adult stages: from conservative to water spending in P. susannae and from water spending to conservative in P. compacta. These switches, together with differences in water relations, particularly at the seedling stage, suggest that habitat specialization could play a critical role in determining these species distributions.

However, if there is delayed germination or diapause, in some situations the conditions for genetic polymorphism are greatly broadened in a temporally variable environment. For a model with absolute dominance which means that there can be no type of heterozygous advantage, the upper bound is no longer the geometric mean and the lower bound may not be the arithmetic mean of the fitnesses over environments.

A metapopulation neighbourhood model of the seed bank of an annual plant, that included the effects of heterogeneity in space and time, of stochastic local extinction and of dispersal, was modified using data reported previously, to examine control of the arable weed Avena sterilis. 2. In the absence of herbicide, for spatially homogeneous environments, few differences were found in the modelled mean predicted population for two levels of dispersal (strong and moderate), although the rate of spread and the variance of the number of seeds per cell were greater for the higher level of dispersal, For spatially heterogeneous environments, with strong dispersal, an increase of the spatial scale of patchiness increased the variance, whereas moderate dispersal had the opposite effect. The introduction of temporal heterogeneity did not affect the results greatly; nor did the inclusion of variation in the fecundity parameter. 3. With the introduction of a herbicide with spatially variable efficacy, the modelled metapopulation in all cases declined exponentially and became globally extinct in approximately 20 years; strongly dispersed populations with large-scale spatial heterogeneity were slightly more persistent. However, in all cases, it was usually possible to decrease the population within the model to acceptable levels (<10 seedlings m(-2)) within a period of between 3 and 5 years. Spatial variability was considerable and extreme patch persistence was occasionally observed.				perry, joe n/B-2729-2010; GONZALEZ-ANDUJAR, JOSE L./G-5671-2013	GONZALEZ-ANDUJAR, JOSE L./0000-0003-2356-4098												0021-8901					AUG	1995	32	3					578	587		10.2307/2404654							WOS:A1995RQ01500012						
J	MOHLER, CL; CALLAWAY, MB				MOHLER, CL; CALLAWAY, MB			EFFECTS OF TILLAGE AND MULCH ON WEED SEED PRODUCTION AND SEED BANKS IN SWEET CORN	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Effects of tillage (till, no-till), mulch (none, dead Secale cereale), and crop competition (none, sweet corn) on weed seed production and seed banks are reported. Data are presented for Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, Portulaca oleracea and Digitaria sanguinalis. These constituted the majority of the weeds present during the cropping season. Seed bank data for a suite of winter annuals active during the fallow season are also presented. 2. Weed seed production was estimated by dimension analysis. 3. Most seeds were produced by the first cohort of plants to emerge. 4. Amaranthus and Digitaria showed significantly greater seed production in no-till than in till treatments. 5. Seed production by Amaranthus, Chenopodium and Portulaca was significantly greater in the absence of a corn crop. 6. The only effect of Secale cereale mulch was to decrease seed production by Portulaca in 1 year. 7. Differences among treatments in the number of seeds produced per unit area were primarily due to effects on individual plant size and seed production. Effects on seedling density and rate of survival to maturity were of secondary importance. 8. Seed banks of Digitaria were greater in no-till than in till treatments, whereas the seed banks of winter annual forbs were greater in till treatments. 9. Presence of a corn crop did not affect seed banks until the final year of the study, at which time seed banks of Amaranthus, Chenopodium and Portulaca were greater in the absence of a crop. 10. An uncropped treatment which did not receive herbicides had exceptionally large seed production and seed banks of Amaranthus and Chenopodium, but not Portulaca and Digitaria, which apparently suffered from competition with the two larger species.																	0021-8901					AUG	1995	32	3					627	639		10.2307/2404658							WOS:A1995RQ01500016						
J	TUCKER, KC; RICHARDSON, DM				TUCKER, KC; RICHARDSON, DM			AN EXPERT-SYSTEM FOR SCREENING POTENTIALLY INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS IN SOUTH-AFRICAN FYNBOS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The development and application of an expert system is described for screening alien woody plants for their invasive potential in South African fynbos. The system is proposed for use by potential introducers to demonstrate low invasive risk before importing woody alien species for cultivation. Rules for the system were derived from empirical evidence by quantifying invasion windows and barriers that have limited the set of widespread woody invaders (trees and shrubs) in fynbos to fewer than 20, out of several hundred introduced species. The system first compares broad-scale environmental conditions (climate and soil) between the home environment of a species and fynbos. Features of the plant in its home environment (basic life history traits, population characteristics, regeneration biology, habitat preferences) are then assessed. Finally, an assessment is made of life history adaptations to the prevailing fire regime in fynbos (juvenile period, fire-survival capacity of adult plants, seed bank longevity). The reasoning is explicit and the steps leading to a conclusion (high risk/low risk) can be retraced. Besides the obvious application in identifying species with a high risk of invading, the system has considerable potential for modelling, and for teaching the concepts of biological invasions. The rules provide an explicit conceptualization of invasion processes in fynbos and identify multiple paths to invasive success (not all of which have been realized yet). The system can therefore be used in planning control operations (for optimal allocation of control effort to critical stages in invasion), and for predicting the outcome of changes (e.g. in fire frequency) on the dimensions of invasion windows, and for assessing what changes are needed to prevent or reduce the extent of invasion by a given taxon. Application of the system is demonstrated on Pinus and Banksia taxa and a selection of species from Californian chaparral.

J	OLSON, MS; PLATT, WJ				OLSON, MS; PLATT, WJ			EFFECTS OF HABITAT AND GROWING-SEASON FIRES ON RESPROUTING OF SHRUBS IN LONGLEAF PINE SAVANNAS	VEGETATIO												The effects of habitat and timing of growing season fires on resprouting of shrubs were studied in second-growth longleaf pine savannas of the west Gulf coastal plain in the southeastern United States. Within the headwaters of three different drainages of the Calcasieu River in the Kisatchie National Forest in western Louisiana, replicated permanent transects were established that extended from xeric upland longleaf pine savannas into downslope hydric seepage savannas. All shrubs were mapped and tagged, and numbers of stems were counted prior to any fires. Replicated prescribed fires were set early (June) and late (August) during the 1990 growing season; maximum fire temperatures were measured within both upland and seepage habitats within each transect. Shrubs were relocated; stems were recensused two and twelve months after the fires. At least some shrubs of all species resprouted from underground organs; none regenerated solely from seed banks in the soil. There was no reduction in total numbers of stems one year after fires compared to before fires, either in the upland or in seepage savannas. In addition, there was no reduction in total numbers of stems one year after early or late growing season fires. Fire-related mortality was restricted to small shrubs (< 18 stems) and was not associated with high fire temperatures. The rate of resprouting varied among species and between habitats. Resprouting occurred more rapidly in seepage than upland savannas, but more resprouts were produced in upland than seepage savannas one year after fires. In contrast to other upland species, Vaccinium arboreum and V. elliottii delayed resprouting more than two months following fire. Stems of Rhus copallina and Pyrus arbutifolia, species with long rhizomes, increased more after fires in June than fires in August. We suggest that growing season fires may block further recruitment of shrubs into longleaf pine savannas, but reduction in numbers of large shrubs may require additional management.																	0042-3106					AUG	1995	119	2					101	118		10.1007/BF00045593							WOS:A1995TA07700002						
J	POIANI, KA; DIXON, PM				POIANI, KA; DIXON, PM			SEED BANKS OF CAROLINA BAYS - POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE VEGETATION	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												We used the seedling emergence method to evaluate the influence of the dominant vegetation (herbaceous, shrubby forested) and the surrounding landscape on seed bank composition in seven Carolina bays. Landscape influence was evaluated indirectly by determining whether seed banks in wetlands close to clearcuts had more upland weedy species than those farther from clearcuts. Seed bank species composition and richness differed among forested, shrubby and herbaceous bays. DECORANA ordination identified a gradient of species composition from herbaceous bays, to shrubby bays, to forested bays. Bays near clearcuts had significantly more upland weedy species in their seed banks, with bays 20 m from clearcuts containing 79% more weedy species on average than bays 100 m from clearcuts. Within a bay, drier vegetation zones had 2.4 times more weedy species than did deep water zones. These results illustrate the potential contributions from surrounding landscape units to bay seed banks and highlight the need for further studies directly assessing the impact of adjacent clearcuts on bay vegetation dynamics.

This species is reproductively mature after approximately three years. Medium sized trees growing in the open can produce 3,500 pods in one year. Most of the pods and seeds fall within the extent of the crowns. The first 6 cm of soil under a 15-year-old A. procera stand had a seed bank of 315 seed per m(2). Seeds experimentally buried at 2.5 cm under the surface decay at an exponential rate of 0.33 seeds per year with a half-life of 2.1 yr. This study discusses implications of these biological properties for pasture management.																	0041-994X					JUL-OCT	1995	79	3-4					163	171									WOS:A1995TX47000008

Triclopyr was applied during bud to early bloom stage at rates of 4.0, 8.0 and 12.0 kg/ha. During 1991, all treatment levels effectively controlled the aboveground portion of purple loosestrife. Grasses (family Gramineae) were unaffected during 1991, however, sedge species (Carer spp.) declined in numbers at higher treatment levels. At 1 year post-treatment, adult purple loosestrife were not present in the 12.0 kg/ha treatment indicating that triclopyr effectively killed the root system, Seedlings dominated the total number of loosestrife plants in the 8.0 and 12.0 kg/ha treatment plots 1 year post-treatment. Sedges recovered in 1992 and grasses increased above 1991 levels. Removal of adult purple loosestrife allowed more light to reach the substrate surface and created favourable conditions for seed germination and plant growth, Triclopyr amine can effectively reduce adult loosestrife stem densities, however, additional herbicide applications may be required to prevent re-establishment through regeneration from the seed bank.																	0146-6623					JUL	1995	33						48	51									WOS:A1995RH63800004

A total of 670 identified seedlings comprising 56 species and belonging to 24 families were recorded. Most seedling were herbaceous perennials (hemicryptophytes: 59%), followed by annuals (therophytes: 23%). Many species that germinated from buried seeds were not observed as plants at any site, and came from exogenous communities. The principal means of seed dissemination were anemochory (45%) and autochory (23%). The number of species as well as seedlings was not significantly different between soils from the burnt and unburnt sites, but seedlings were more numerous in samples from the unburnt sites, as the number of seedlings was always highest in the upper soil layer. Germination behaviour of four particular species was characterized. Seedlings from the seed bank temporarily were found in the early stages of recovery of the burnt Quercus pyrenaica forests.

Factors such as light penetration, soil water content, soil fertility, and temperature are modified by tillage, planting, harvesting, and other production practices, resulting in enhanced or depressed weed seed germination. Changes in these environmental factors may also indirectly lead to alterations in phytohormone concentrations during seed development, which can subsequently affect dormancy status of the mature seed. Integrated approaches that place priority on depleting weed seed banks through interfering with dormancy or germination requirements have strong potential to enhance weed management aspects of agricultural systems.																	0043-1745					JUL-SEP	1995	43	3					498	503		10.1017/S0043174500081534							WOS:A1995RR66600026

A simple linear matrix model is deduced from the life cycle graph. The dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix is estimated from demographic parameters derived from field studies. The estimated values for population growth rate (lambda) indicates that the study population should be experiencing a rapid exponential increase, but this was not the case in our population. The addition of density dependent effects on seedling survivorship and adult fecundity, effects for which field studies provide evidence, considerably improves our model. Depending on the demographic parameters, the model leads to stable equilibrium, oscillations, or chaos. Study of the behaviour of this model in the parameter space shows that the existence of a seed bank allows higher among-year variation of adult fecundity, without leaving the region of demographic stability. Field data obtained over 3 years confirm this prediction.																	0001-5342					JUN	1995	43	1-2					53	65		10.1007/BF00709433							WOS:A1995QL54500005						
J	DEROUW, A				DEROUW, A			THE FALLOW PERIOD AS A WEED-BREAK IN SHIFTING CULTIVATION (TROPICAL WET FORESTS)	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												In the wet tropics weeds can grow all year round. In shifting cultivation systems the fallow period is used to restrain the development of weeds because they threaten the re-use of the land. Overhead shade suppresses the heliophytic weeds growing on the site and interrupts the continuous re-seeding of the field. This is the first phase of weed suppression. During the second phase, shade cover is maintained to allow the reduction of viable weed seeds in the soil. In the Tai farm system, Cote d'Ivoire, little weeding is carried out because optimum use is made of the natural fallow vegetation as a weed-break. The first phase took 6-12 months, the second 10 years. The shading out of weeds is cheap and effective yet demands much land. Those farm systems under the pressure of land shortage are likely to be infested by weeds. They suffer from weeds because shade-producing plants are eliminated from the system. Intensive use of the land is sometimes possible when shade plants are preserved (as stumps, tubers) during the period the field is covered by heliophytic crops, and are allowed to grow out afterwards.

It was found that rainfall was the most important factor contributing to the loss of seed over summer (up to 76%), followed by predation (up to 15%); fungi had only a very small influence (0.1-0.2%). Predation contributed to a larger percentage of loss over summer in T. resupinatum line SA14433 than in T. balansae cv. Paradana, which is attributed to seed size. The effect of summer grazing on the size of the seed-bank was investigated. It was found that summer grazing did not influence the amount of seed present in the seed-bank in March. Removal of all surface material in December resulted in a significant drop in seed reserves compared with the ungrazed or grazed areas. Hardseededness in March was not affected by any of the treatments; the seedling density after regeneration was not affected by summer grazing, but was reduced when all surface material was removed. The data were incorporated in a model to describe seed loss from the seed bank over summer quantitatively; the utility of such models is discussed.

Soil seed density of Striga varied among farmers' fields between 0 and more than 80000 seed m(-2). Differences among fields were mainly due to cropping history. The number of emerged, surviving and reproducing Striga plants were analyzed on maize and sorghum and showed a large variability among fields. Differences among fields were larger for maize than for sorghum and were mainly due to differences in crop management practices being used by farmers. The number of newly produced Striga seed at the end of the season varied between 0 and 109,000 seed m(-2) and proved to be largely independent of the initial soil seed bank. Large differences were found in the contribution of sorghum and maize in mixed cropping systems to the overall reproduction of Striga. Sorghum is the major host for Striga reproduction. In an area with intensified maize-cropping, maize functions as a Striga-suppressive crop while in an area with extensive crop management maize contributes significantly to Striga reproduction. The analysis of the population dynamics of the parasite shows the importance of a farming systems approach to pest management and to the development of sustainable cropping systems for the savannas.																	0261-2194					JUN	1995	14	4					283	290		10.1016/0261-2194(94)00004-R							WOS:A1995RH34500004						
J	SHIBATA, M; NAKASHIZUKA, T				SHIBATA, M; NAKASHIZUKA, T			SEED AND SEEDLING DEMOGRAPHY OF 4 COOCCURRING CARPINUS SPECIES IN A TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FOREST	ECOLOGY												In order to clarify regeneration traits and their fitness, we compared seed fall, seedling emergence, and first-year seedling survival of four co-occurring species, Carpinus tschonoskii, C. japonica C. laxiflora, and C. cordata, in an old-growth temperate deciduous forest in Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. Seedling emergence ratio of C. cot-data (5.5%), whose seeds mostly germinated 1.5 yr after seed fall, was lower than the other species (8.5-11.2%). First-year seedlings of Carpinus tschonoskii and C. japonica had much lower survival rates (2.7%, both species) than C. laxiflora and C. cop darn (7.5-8.5%) under closed canopy, suggesting that the former two are more disturbance dependent than the latter two. They are characterized by their seed and seedling performances as seed rain type fundamentally; however, C. cordata and C. laxiflora are able to establish a seedling bank, and C. cordata has a seed bank too. These regenerative strategies partly explain the abundance and population structure of the four species in this old-growth forest. Multiple regression analyses showed that topography was important for survival of all species but C. cordata. This result was consistent with the adult distribution of these species in this forest. Wind dispersal of Car-pinus is effective, both to escape from density- or distance-dependent high mortality and to increase the chance of arriving at canopy gaps, where seedling survival rate is high. However, escaping high mortality seems relatively more important for C. laxiflora and C. cordata (seedling bank strategy), and arriving at a canopy gap is relatively more important for C. tschonoskii and C. japonica (seed rain strategy).																	0012-9658					JUN	1995	76	4					1099	1108		10.2307/1940918							WOS:A1995QZ87800007						
J	RUSCH, G; FERNANDEZPALACIOS, JM				RUSCH, G; FERNANDEZPALACIOS, JM			THE INFLUENCE OF SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY ON REGENERATION BY SEED IN A LIMESTONE GRASSLAND	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The spatial distribution of seedlings in fertilized and non-fertilized grassland patches (1 m x 2 m) was examined in alvar vegetation on the island of Oland, Sweden. We established whether variation in seedling distribution in grassland patches reflects the distribution of conspecific adults. We also established the significance of microsite turf attributes for prediction of seedling distribution at a small scale (10 cm x 10 cm), and the significance of conspecific adults abundance, assemblage of adult species and cover of lichens, mosses, litter and bare ground. Our results indicate that fertilization reduces the importance of regeneration by seed of perennial species and enhances seedling recruitment of winter annuals and biennials. At the patch scale, enrichment does not affect species richness. Community patchiness contributes to the maintenance of diversity by providing a variety of environments with differential regeneration of the component species. Cover of lichens, mosses, litter and bare ground, accounts, in part, for the spatial variation in seedling numbers of certain species. The strong association of seedlings of some species with conspecific adults indicates that limitations in dispersal and/or the occurrence of a more suitable environment for emergence and/or establishment close to conspecific adult plants are likely to constrain the spatial distribution of new individuals in many cases. For other species, the lack of association of seedling densities with the cover of their conspecific adults, suggests that long-distance dispersal or a long-lived seed bank can play a role in counteracting the effect of short-distance dispersal.

A mean viable seed density of 1118 +/- 217/m(2) was present under the kauri forest sites. While the seed bank contained both native (77%) and adventive species (23%), its composition was not closely related to that of the extant vegetation. The abundance of adventive and native herbaceous components of the seed bank declined as stand age increased, while that of native woody secondary species remained relatively constant. The abundance of adventive species also declined significantly with increasing distance from forest edges.

The treatments were designed to simulate conditions that the seeds might experience after dispersal (normally after being consumed by birds). In the standard treatment (cleaned, moist, well-lit), from collections made in summer (Aristotelia) and autumn (the other four species), most of the seeds of each species germinated in late summer, or autumn - mid winter. A small proportion of Aristotelia and Cordyline seeds overwintered and germinated in the following spring. Overall success was high for all species (90-100%). Seeds of each species placed in the dark, or on soil, germinated at similar rates and with similar success but only for Cordyline were the rate and success as high as for the standard treatment. Seeds left in the fleshy pericarp tissues always germinated slowly and with low percentage success. A tetrazolium viability test was moderately reliable for Coprosma, Cordyline, and Myrtus seeds, but not for the other two species. The factors causing germination delay permit temporal spread of germination, but, even for Aristotelia and Cordyline, are insufficiently strong to permit development of long-term seed banks. The habitat preferences of adult plants of the respective species can be explained in terms of their germination capabilities both in light and dark and also the degree of intolerance of their juveniles to shading.																	0028-825X					JUN	1995	33	2					257	264									WOS:A1995RQ48300007

Flowering is strongly seasonal: 80% of the insect-pollinated flora, which consists of 133 species, blooms between February and June. There is a variably expressed secondary flowering period in autumn. The pollinating fauna follows a strongly correlated pattern of abundance. Two types of plants were distinguished: pauciflorous species bearing <10 flowers that are large compared to the plant body, and multiflorous species with many small flowers. Pauciflorous species flower in the winter half of the year, while multiflorous species flower mainly in the summer half. The mean flower life spans are 9 and 3 days, respectively. The duration of flowering (DF) for each species is 55 days on average, which is long compared to other communities. The DF shows year-to-year variations, concomitant with the vicissitudes of the climate. The start of flowering of a species is statistically correlated with the temperature in the previous month, not with rainfall; its end date of flowering only partly compensates for the time gained or lost. DF is maximal in winter. The average flower life span of species flowering at any given date varies strongly and independently of the average DF. We tested the hypothesis that flowering phenology is set by phylogenetic and life form constraints. This could not be corroborated for phylogeny, evidently because of the overriding influence of the mediterranean climate, and probably also for biogeographical reasons. In contrast, life forms and multiflorous and pauciflorous species show strong differences. Many (51) of the species are therophytes; we tested the hypothesis that because of their annual habit they would be more dependent on pollination than perennials. Thus we anticipated that therophytic species would be differentiated from perennials in their flowering phenologies. This is not corroborated. We therefore conclude that the seed bank plays a role that is analogous to that of a perennial plant body.

J	SCHOTT, GW				SCHOTT, GW			A SEED TRAP FOR MONITORING THE SEED RAIN IN TERRESTRIAL COMMUNITIES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Monitoring the seed rain of a species, population, or community is important to quantify that component of life history that follows anthesis yet precedes establishment in the seed bank or as a seedling. I have developed a unique seed trap that is ideal for monitoring the seed rain of a grassland community. The trap consists of a 10-cm diameter funnel attached by Velcro to one end of a 15-cm long PVC pipe. The trap is sunk into the ground with 1.5-2 cm protruding above the soil surface to prevent soil and ground-dwelling insects from entering the trap. A small cotton bag is attached to the stem of the funnel and acts as the reservoir for trapped seeds. I was able to trap propagules ranging in size from 0.5-mm seeds (Juncus interior) to >2 cm long awned spikelets (Andropogon gerardii). Because this trap minimizes predation, is easy to construct and monitor, and is inexpensive, it is superior to traps used by previous researchers.																	0008-4026					MAY	1995	73	5					794	796		10.1139/b95-087							WOS:A1995RC04600015						
J	HORVITZ, CC; SCHEMSKE, DW				HORVITZ, CC; SCHEMSKE, DW			SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITIONS OF A TROPICAL UNDERSTORY HERB - PROJECTION MATRIX ANALYSIS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Our goal was to elucidate the population dynamics of the perennial under- story herb Calathea ovandensis in a rain forest in southern Mexico using matrix projection model analysis. We emphasize the magnitude and consequences of spatiotemporal variation in (1) basic demographic parameters (growth, survival, and reproduction) (2) asymptotic demographic properties of a given environment (the asymptotic population growth rate and the associated stable-stage distribution and reproductive values) and (3) demographic sensitivities associated with a given environment (sensitivity and elasticity). We obtained 6 yr (1982-1987) of empirical data from four study plots (differing in substrate, light, and density) from which we used the first 5 yr (1982-1986) to construct 16 plot-year and 1 pooled population projection matrices. This stage-structured population was characterized by a long-lived seed bank, temporally variable seedling recruitment (10-fold variability among years), high mortality of seedlings (>90%), very low mortality of reproductives (usually <10%), fertility that increased markedly with plant size, and the ability of large plants to shrink rather than die under adversity. Within these broad outlines, the magnitudes of transitions representing demographic fates exhibited considerable variation through space and time, some parameters varying much more than others (CV from 22 to 400%). Growth and reproduction were positively correlated across environments. The least variable parameters were seed dormancy and stasis of small reproductives. Observed stage distributions were reasonably close to the stable stage distributions (mean = 86.1% similar). In most plot-years, the stable-stage distribution was dominated by seeds, followed by seedlings, and then small reproductives and the reproductive values increased with size class. Population growth rates, given by the dominant eigenvalue of the matrices, ranged from 0.73 to 1.25. Analysis of the mean dynamics gave lambda = 0.97 (using a variety of analytical approaches) and our analysis of the overall pooled dynamics gave a lambda = 0.99, indicating that the habitat at the study site favored the persistence of Calathea ovandensis. An el Nino event coincided with the year of the highest population growth rate. Survival, growth, and reproduction varied significantly through space and time, and different plot-years were beneficial to different stages. Most interestingly, stage-specific sensitivity parameters (sensitivity and elasticity) also varied through space and time. Spatiotemporal variability of sensitivity structure has important implications. Determination of stages most ''critical'' to population dynamics will depend upon knowledge of this variation. Population growth rate was significantly positively correlated with elasticity of seed production, seed germination, and seedling growth. These results indicate that the opportunity for selection on plant characters affecting particular life history stages varies through space and time even if the effect on the single-stage transition probability does not vary. Selection on characters affecting juvenile stages may be stronger in populations of higher growth rates.																	0012-9615					MAY	1995	65	2					155	192		10.2307/2937136							WOS:A1995QW14700002						
J	WILSON, PJ; AEBISCHER, NJ				WILSON, PJ; AEBISCHER, NJ			THE DISTRIBUTION OF DICOTYLEDONOUS ARABLE WEEDS IN RELATION TO DISTANCE FROM THE FIELD EDGE	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Three surveys were carried out in cereal crops during 1988 and 1989. In the first, numbers of dicotyledonous weed seedlings and seeds in the seed-bank were determined at 10 distances from the crop edge. In the second and third, only the numbers of seedlings were counted. 2. In the first survey of spring cereals, numbers of seedlings of 13 species and numbers of seeds of 11 species decreased significantly as distance from the crop edge increased. Viola arvensis was the only species for which numbers increased. 3. The proportions of the seed-bank represented by the germinated seedlings of 21 species varied from 0.4% (Sonchus spp.) to 55% (Fumaria spp.). The half-life of the seed-bank was highly variable between species. 4. In the second survey of spring cereals, numbers of seedlings of 17 species decreased significantly as distance from the crop edge increased. Polygonum aviculare was the only species whose numbers increased. 5. In the survey of autumn-sown cereals, numbers of seedlings of 14 species decreased significantly as distance from the crop edge increased. Viola arvensis was the only species whose numbers increased. 6. These distributions have implications for the conservation of endangered weed species.																	0021-8901					MAY	1995	32	2					295	310		10.2307/2405097							WOS:A1995RA02300005

Seed input, changes in the seed bank and seedling recruitment of Onopordum were monitored over 1 year at three contrasting sites (pasture, oat crop and hillside) within an 80-hectare paddock at Galong, New South Wales, about 100 km NW of Canberra. Each site was c. 2000 m(2). Time constraints precluded a longer study and repetition of the sampling procedures at similar sites in other areas. 2. In the pasture there were few Onopordum plants but a seed bank of c. 5000 seeds m(-2). During the year the seed bank decreased by more than half, but the most dormant component remained constant at c. 800 seeds m(-2). 3. In an oat crop nearby there were no flowering Onopordum plants and there was no direct seed input. Nevertheless, the seed bank of c. 700 seeds m(-2) did not decrease. 4. At the third site, a grazed hillside, Onopordum density was high (19 plants m(-2)). The seed input of 1788 seeds m(-2) caused a temporary small increase in the seed bank in summer but there was no change over the 1-year period either in the total seed bank (c. 3000 seeds m(-2)) or in its most dormant component (c. 750 seeds m(-2)). 5. Seedlings appeared in all seasons, invariably after rain. More than 95% of seedlings appeared in late summer or autumn, but different management practices changed the pattern of winter establishment. 6. For ecological studies of weeds, the population dynamics of the seeds in the soil and of the plants above ground are equally significant. This study shows that the existence of a small pool of labile seeds (c. 15% minimum) in the seed bank that can be recruited opportunistically, together with a large, strongly persistent component, will make any form of short-term control difficult.																	0021-8901					MAY	1995	32	2					425	433		10.2307/2405108							WOS:A1995RA02300016

Maximum germination occurred from 7 to 14 March, when mean daily maximum and minimum air temperatures were 14.8 and 3.3 degrees C, respectively. No additional seeds germinated in two subsequent springs, indicating lack of ability of this species to form a persistent seed bank. Seeds receiving only a cold stratification period germinated to 98% after 28 weeks at 5 degrees C, whereas those given a warm-stratification pretreatment of 4 weeks at 30:15 degrees C (max-min) germinated to 100% after only 18 weeks at 5 degrees C. In the field, warm stratification during summer and autumn would reduce the length of the cold-stratification period required to break dormancy, and thus allow dormancy to be broken during winter. This is only the second report of a woodland herb having physiologically dormant seeds with fully developed embryos that require warm plus cold stratification to germinate in spring. We hypothesize that this requirement for dormancy break could have evolved from ancestors whose seeds required only a period of warm stratification to emerge from dormancy.																	0008-4026					APR	1995	73	4					608	612		10.1139/b95-064							WOS:A1995RA68300012

Liming was expected to affect calcicole and calcifuge species richness and density, while species that form persistent versus transient seed banks were expected to vary with microsite. Two of five subcatchments were limed in October, 1989 with 6.89 t ha-1 of pelletized CaCO3. Forest floor samples were collected in May 1991 and 1992 from pit, mound, and undisturbed microsites in limed and reference (untreated) subcatchments. Water soluble calcium concentrations in forest floor samples collected in May 1992 from limed subcatchments were almost ten times greater than forest floor samples from reference subcatchments, but there were no differences in soluble calcium concentration among microsites within a subcatchment. Species richness and abundance varied among microsites, but the magnitude depended on year and lime treatment. Relative frequencies of Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch) and Oxalis acetosella (wood sorrel) exceeded 80% in both years, with a slightly greater frequency from limed than reference subcatchments. Differences in relative frequency for several species between subcatchments were not consistent between years. The relative frequency of all species by microsite was generally greater from limed than reference subcatchments. Total density and the density of individual species by microsite varied between treatments within subcatchments and between years, although some patterns exist. Seed bank patterns vary appreciably between years and among microsites. Differences in seedling emergence from pit versus mound microsites varied between years and depended on whether the microsites were in limed or reference subcatchments. These data suggest that there are no detrimental short-term effects of watershed liming on seed banks of upland deciduous forests. Microsites may affect plant community composition most through germination and survival of propagules.																	0378-1127					APR	1995	72	2-3					273	285		10.1016/0378-1127(94)03454-5							WOS:A1995QX26000015

Dung pats dropped in spring and winter were marked, and the vegetation developing on them during the first two years of colonization was followed. The influence of endozoochorous seeds on dung colonization is assessed through the study of: (1) the vegetation on spring and winter dung pats and the seed contents of both, which is abundant in the former and negligible in the latter; and (2) the vegetation on spring dung pats compared with that of the surrounding pasture. The origin of plants growing on dung (either seeds in the manure or in the soil seed bank) was traced by studying dung colonization under controlled conditions in pots with manure put on seed-free sand, and on pasture turf. The results indicate that endozoochorous seeds germinate in manure; they are the main source of recovery in gaps generated by dung pats. The micro-succession involved is independent of the type of pasture. A small-scale spatial pattern results in which gaps of old dung are dominated by endozoochorous species. Thus, dung patches enhance the similarity between grazed communities, and the variation within communities.

Seed germination patterns were examined in the laboratory for seeds from 135 populations belonging to 38 species and 13 sections of the genus Penstemon (Scrophulariaceae), from habitats ranging from warm desert to alpine tundra. Seeds of most species were dormant at dispersal and required a period of moist chilling to become germinable. Response to chilling was related to probable chilling duration at the collection site. Populations from habitats with severe winters produced seeds with long chilling requirements, while those from habitats with mild winters produced seeds with short chilling requirements. Populations from midelevation habitats produced seeds with intermediate chilling requirements but with a sizeable fraction whose dormancy was not broken by chilling of any length. Another pattern observed mostly in warm desert populations was little primary dormancy at autumn temperatures combined with induction of a fraction into secondary dormancy by short chilling. Species with a wide habitat range included populations with contrasting germination patterns. Parallel habitat-correlated patterns were observed in different sections. Most species showed germination patterns that combined predictive mechanisms with potential for carryover of a persistent seed bank. Results of common garden experiments suggested that germination differences had a strong genetic basis both among populations and among plants in a population. Adaptive radiation in the genus Penstemon has thus included the evolution of habitat-specific germination timing strategies in multiple lineages within the genus.																	0002-9122					MAR	1995	82	3					377	389		10.1002/j.1537-2197.1995.tb12643.x							WOS:A1995QM77500011

Each flowering head has a broad range of achene morphologies. There is no between-year seed bank. There are no ecologically relevant differences in achene size, seedling size, or seedling growth rates of the different morphs. Achenes located centrally in the heads lose dormancy earlier during the period between autumn achene production and the onset (May-July) of the rainy season. This results in relatively more early emergence of central achenes. Awned central achenes also have greater adhesive dispersibility. Emergence, survival, and fecundity were measured for achenes sown into natural populations in central Mexico. When harsh conditions result in few seeds surviving to reproduce, the advantage tends to go to the more ''conservative'' peripheral achenes. Greenhouse experiments show a strong genetic component to the determination of achene proportions within and among populations and a variety of genetic correlations. Populations with a high proportion of awned achenes tend to be found in vegetation types where they are likely to be ephemeral. A high proportion of central achenes tend to be found in sites with little pre-rainy season precipitation. These patterns are interpreted in terms of selection for dispersal and the within-year timing of germination.																	0002-9122					MAR	1995	82	3					410	420		10.2307/2445587							WOS:A1995QM77500014

The top 10 cm of soil in the disturbances was replaced by sterile soil, and the excrement laid in half of them was removed fortnightly. The seed banks of the disturbances subjected to the two treatments was quantified by germination of soil samples (n = 44) gathered at the start of the following growth season. Rabbit droppings were collected fortnightly to quantify their seed content and the pasture seed production was estimated. Seed bank regeneration takes place early in the disturbances. The main source of qualitative variation in seed banks is their position on the slope, while endozoochory lacks a characteristic qualitative effect. However, endozoochorous dispersal is responsible for a significant increase in the number of germinable seeds, the richness and diversity of the seed bank samples with respect to those lacking it. The importance of endozoochorous dispersal by rabbits in grassland dynamics is suggested to be its effect on the colonization of small disturbances, where species dispersed with dung are found to be favoured. This aids the maintenance of grazing-tolerant communities.

J	EVANS, AS; CABIN, RJ				EVANS, AS; CABIN, RJ			CAN DORMANCY AFFECT THE EVOLUTION OF POST-GERMINATION TRAITS - THE CASE OF LESQUERELLA-FENDLERI	ECOLOGY												Seed dormancy, which is thought to have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental variability, has led to the existence of seed banks-populations of dormant, viable seeds in the soil. Seed banks are theoretically important to both the demography and genetic structure of plant populations. The presence of seed dormancy can also affect the evolution of traits not directly associated with dormancy and germination. Theoretical models have suggested that the existence of dormancy can influence the rate of evolution of post-germination traits. The eventual outcome (e,g., allele frequencies) may be influenced as well, leading to adaptive syndromes of germination and post-germination traits. Seeds that germinate in different conditions may experience different selective regimes for post-germination traits. If there an trade-offs between the fitness of post-germination traits in different environments, then seeds that germinate in the environment to which their post-germination traits are adapted will be at a selective advantage. If differences in germination and post-germination traits are genetically based, then potentially adaptive genetic correlations between germination and post-germination traits may evolve. We feel that investigating the ecological and evolutionary importance of these correlations requires an empirical approach. As a first step, hen we ask whether the conditions necessary for such syndromes to arise exist in a particular plant population. We show that conditions favoring the joint evolution of dormancy and postgermination traits leading to adaptive syndromes exist in the mustard, Lesquerella fendleri, in central New Mexico. First, Lesquerella experiences the sort of variation in environmental conditions that would be expected to lead to adaptive trade-offs in the expression of post-germination traits for individuals that differ in germination traits, Annual precipitation varies greatly from year to year so that germination in drier years would be expected to select for more xerophytic traits. Within a year, microenvironmental spatial variation exists. Lesquerella growth and reproduction are sensitive to both year-to-year and microenvironmental variation. Second, the seed bank can affect both the demographic and genetic structure of the population. Dormant seeds remain viable for at least 3 yr and can mitigate the negative demographic effects of reproductive failure. Allozyme differences exist between seeds that germinate in the field and seeds that remain dormant, suggesting that the evolutionary potential of the aboveground population is influenced by dormancy. Finally, the necessary genetic and environmental variation is present. Both germination percentage and post-germination traits (e.g., leaf morphology) vary among and within populations as well as among environmental treatments. Thus, the potential exists for Lesquerella to respond to selective differences between different temporal or spatial environments. We suggest experimental approaches for assessing the extent to which seed dormancy has affected or will affect the evolution of post-germination traits. The consequences of past evolution could be explored by asking ''What genetic and phenotypic differences exist between individuals that germinate and those that remain dormant?'', while controlling for factors that influence germination (maternal genotype, maternal environment, and germination environment). Exploring whether evolution is currently occurring would require an assessment of natural selection and the genetic potential for response to selection. Given the difficulty of such studies, a reasonable first step would be to explore how evolution can occur by performing an artificial selection experiment on dormancy or germination percentage. Then, correlated responses of post-germination traits could be examined. Empirical studies such as these are necessary in order to better understand the role of seed banks in plant ecology and evolution. Then, once associations that can be interpreted as adaptive syndromes are documented, questions about the ecological mechanisms (e.g., necessary frequencies of different year types) and genetic mechanisms (e.g., linkage disequilibrium vs. pleiotropy) can be explored. We hope to draw attention to seed dormancy, which is an often-ignored stage in the life history of plants, and to encourage empirical work, which lags far behind theory.																	0012-9658					MAR	1995	76	2					344	356		10.2307/1941194							WOS:A1995QL93100003						
J	LAMONT, BB; WITKOWSKI, ETF				LAMONT, BB; WITKOWSKI, ETF			A TEST FOR LOTTERY RECRUITMENT AMONG 4 BANKSIA SPECIES BASED ON THEIR DEMOGRAPHY AND BIOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES	OECOLOGIA												A stage-by-stage protocol for identifying simple or biased lottery, or non-lottery, patterns of seedling recruitment is outlined. For a simple (weighted) lottery to apply, the proportion of total individuals accounted for by one species at one stage of recruitment plotted against the proportion accounted for at a previous stage over a wide range of recruitment conditions should obey a linear regression with a = 0 and b = 1. For a biased lottery to hold, the regression is significant but a not equal 0 and/or b not equal 1. Demographic, size and water relations data were collected over 3 years for four co-occurring Banksia species following two contrasting experimental fires. The first summer was exceptionally wet and the second was exceptionally hot and dry. Seedlings still alive by the 3rd year relative to the fire-killed parent plants conformed to a biased lottery in the case of B, speciosa and B, baxteri, while B. coccinea and B. pulchella had no mathematical structure (mean of the proportional ratios not equal 1). Intervening stages, beginning with seed release, showed transient deterministic or simple lottery patterns in some cases, but the overriding trend was for biased lotteries. B, speciosa dominated the responses, with greater seed release than expected, fewer initial seedlings, lottery survival of 1st year seedlings and greater survival of 2nd year seedlings, when compared with the previous stages. Large seeds and subsequent high growth rates enabled B. speciosa to exploit soil water preferentially during the severe summer drought. The trend for B. speciosa to replace other species may be cancelled by stochastic processes not operating in this particular study.

The use of the seed mixture successfully established a sward of some 18-25 species per square meter. The species composition was enriched to some extent by recruitment of unsown species, principally from the soil seed bank. Hay-type defoliation management produced greater dry matter yield and species richness than grazing defoliation, but grazing defoliation produced greater species diversity. Fertilizer application had no significant effect on dry matter production but reduced species diversity. Ordination analysis revealed that both defoliation and fertilizer management significantly affected species composition. The response obtained by individual species was explicable largely by their comparative biology.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	1995	3	1					39	50		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1995.tb00073.x							WOS:A1995RB38600005

(kauri pine) were stored hermetically at moisture contents of 1.5-15.5% and at temperatures from -20 degrees to 42 degrees C; and one seedlot of Agathis macrophylla was stored at 7%, 9% or 13% moisture content and at 26 degrees, 6 degrees or -13 degrees C. Seeds of A. australis showed orthodox storage behaviour; except that viability was progressively reduced with drying below about 5% moisture content, and, depending on seedlot, subsequent storage longevities were reduced at all temperatures. Seeds of A. macrophylla again showed essentially orthodox characteristics at 9 and 13% moisture content; but drying to 7% moisture content reduced viability significantly, and of those seeds surviving, a further proportion died as a result of transfer to -13 degrees C, and the remainder survived for 2500 d with little further viability loss. Seeds of neither species conformed fully to orthodox characterisics, nor to those of the intermediate category. The results are discussed in relation to possible causes of this 'sub-orthodox' behaviour, especially current seed-harvesting methods, and the limits put upon ex situ conservation of these species in seed banks by their predicted comparatively short storage lives.																	0960-2585					MAR	1995	5	1					5	14		10.1017/S0960258500002531							WOS:A1995RK12600002

These sites have been utilized for gravel excavation and extraction as well as for building and road construction. Vast, areas of open gravel resulting from human activities scar the landscape and reduce the amount of undisturbed dry heath tundra. When left alone these gravel areas may remain devoid of vegetation for many decades due to the severity of the climate. Nothing has been done to restore them to their pre-disturbance vegetation cover. Their soils are characterized by low nutrient availability, poor moisture retention capabilities and Limited seed banks. The current paper reviews literature regarding manipulation of chemical and physical properties of gravel substrates in order to facilitate the development of cover by native plants.

J	ELLISON, AM; BEDFORD, BL				ELLISON, AM; BEDFORD, BL			RESPONSE OF A WETLAND VASCULAR PLANT COMMUNITY TO DISTURBANCE - A SIMULATION STUDY	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We developed a spatial computer simulation model of the vascular plant community of a freshwater wetland in south-central Wisconsin. This model, based on the aggregation of an unwieldy collection of species into a manageable number of functional ''species-types'', is used to investigate the responses of wetland plant communities to anthropogenic disturbance that resulted in alterations in wetland hydrology. The results of the model are in general (rank-order) agreement with 7 yr of observed changes in vegetation structure of a sedge meadow and shallow marsh adjacent to a 1000-MW coal-fired power plant near Portage, Wisconsin. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed that functional species' responses to disturbance depended most heavily on seed germination and dispersal characteristics, a result predicted qualitatively by the wetland succession model of van der Valk (1981). Although analyses of the model presented here appear to verify the model, validation of the model will depend on the collection of similar long-term data sets at disparate sites. This model may be of use in predicting the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance on other freshwater wetlands.

A natural seed bank in which seed densities varied (variable seed density experiment) and an artificial seed bank in which seed densities were fixed (fixed seed density experiment with Polygonum lapathifolium and Asclepias incarnata) were investigated. Seedling emergence and aboveground dry weight were measured in moist and submerged soils with four nutrient treatments: no addition (control), nitrogen addition, phosphorus addition, and nitrogen-phosphorus addition. In the variable and fixed seed density experiments, emergence was higher in moist soil but did not increase with any nutrient addition. In the variable seed density experiment, biomass increased with nitrogen addition in both moist and submerged soils. In the fixed seed density experiment, biomass increased primarily with nitrogen addition in submerged soil. Thus, our findings suggest that hydrology influences seedling emergence and that nutrient availability controls biomass in aquatic macrophytes.																	0925-8574					FEB	1995	4	2					65	76		10.1016/0925-8574(94)00046-8							WOS:A1995QJ68600002						
J	PFLEEGER, T; ZOBEL, D				PFLEEGER, T; ZOBEL, D			ORGANIC PESTICIDE MODIFICATION OF SPECIES INTERACTIONS IN ANNUAL PLANT-COMMUNITIES	ECOTOXICOLOGY												A method is proposed and tested for assessing multispecies responses to three pesticides (atrazine, 2,4-D and malathion). Pesticides were applied at two concentrations, on model plant communities grown in raised beds using soil containing a natural seed bank. Cover by species was monitored over time in nested 10 and 20 cm diameter neighbourhoods around Poa annua and Calandrinia ciliata target plants. All tested compounds modified relative species abundance, altered dominance and simplified the treated communities. Community biomass decreased with atrazine and 2,4-D treatments, but not with malathion. Each chemical altered species interactions for all treated communities, including the identities of interacting species and the timing of interactions. Each target species had its own suite of interacting species that individually changed with chemical treatment. When cover was used as a predictor of neighbour influence, analysis of species interactions using 10 cm neighbourhoods indicated more interactions than using 20 cm neighbourhoods. When biomass was used as the predictor, use of the 20 cm neighbourhoods indicated more interactions. This method of using model plant communities for field toxicity testing is simple, economical and effective. It uses naturally occurring plants while reducing the environmental heterogeneity common in most field studies.																	0963-9292					FEB	1995	4	1					15	37									WOS:A1995QT65900003	24197547

Investigations of tropical soil seed banks have reported large differences in apparent seed densities based on seedling emergence from soil set out under gap conditions. To examine to what extent these differences might reflect different methodologies rather than actual differences in seed density, soil samples of different depths were laid out in germination trays. 2. There was a marked effect of soil depth on total seedling emergence. Germination trays containing soil layers of greater-than-or-equal-to 10 mm markedly underestimated total seed density. Relative abundance of species in the samples did not alter with depth. Almost all seedling emergence occurred within the first 6 weeks for all soil depths. 3. It is recommended that future tropical soil seed-bank investigations should spread soil to less-than-or-equal-to 5 mm. This should not restrict the sample sizes used in seed-bank investigations as rapid germination from shallow soils allows rapid turnover of samples.																	0269-8463					FEB	1995	9	1					119	121		10.2307/2390098							WOS:A1995QU47000015

This is attributed to variations in total precipitation and rainfall distribution patterns. 2 In order to examine the effect of autumn drought on the floristic composition of Mediterranean annual pastures, soil samples with seed banks were taken from the upper and lower slopes of each of three pastures that differed in successional age. Half of each sample was subjected to a simulated autumn drought treatment while the other half received a continuous water supply (in both cases under controlled conditions). All germinations and deaths were recorded throughout the 2-month experimental period. 3 Only five species had significantly different numbers of germinations between the two watering treatments, and in four of these germination was lower in the drought-simulated treatment. Re-watering of samples from this treatment did not result in a second wave of germination. 4 Drought-induced mortality was greater in the samples with high seedling densities. A significant negative correlation was evident between seedling density and the water content of the pots at the end of the experimental drought. 5 The least drought-sensitive species were those with stem or leaf hairs and those belonging to Crassulaceae, which show a particular adaptive metabolism.

Five of the six are known or suspected to form persistent seed banks; the status of Carex flacca as a persistent seed is now established. The exceptionally low density of viable seeds at 35 seeds/m(2) and the paucity of other plant remains confirm that these calcareous soils have supported rapid decomposition. The complete absence of viable seeds known to be short-lived indicated that the macrofauna has played no significant role in the introduction of viable seeds from the modern-day surface down to depths in excess of 1.6 m, at least not in recent years. Because of the precise dates of burial and excavation, the results offer a rare opportunity to confirm laboratory and other indirect observations of long-term seed persistence following burial in temperate climate calcareous soils.																	1100-9233					FEB	1995	6	1					153	156		10.2307/3236266							WOS:A1995QW12100018

When tested under controlled conditions some species showed earlier germination in smoke treatments than controls; in others smoke-treated seeds continued to germinate for several weeks after controls had achieved full germination. In the remainder, treated and control seeds germinated to similar time schedules. A group of 23 species which responded positively had previously been recorded as extremely difficult or impossible to germinate using conventional techniques. These included members of the genera Geleznowia (Rutaceae), Hibbertia (Dilleniaceae), Stirlingia (Proteaceae), Verticordia (Myrtaceae), Actinostrobus (Cupressaceae) and Pimelea (Thymelaeaceae). Both large- and small-seeded species were encountered amongst the positively responding taxa, which encompassed representatives of 15 families and 26 genera of dicotyledons, 5 families and 8 genera of monocotyledons and the gymnosperm Actinostrobus acuminatus. Sowing seeds on smoke-fumigated filter papers or watering with aqueous eluates of smoke elicited similar degrees of stimulation of germination, as did exposure to gaseous smoke in a readily germinating species Anigozanthos manglesii (Haemodoraceae) and the normally intractable species Lysinema ciliatum (Epacridaceae). Exposing recently burnt and unburnt natural bushland sites to smoke, smoked water or smoked dry sand elicited a significant germination response in 15 species. Over one third of the species sampled in the burnt site exhibited germination additional to that caused by the fire. Data are discussed in relation to previous germination studies on Australian and other taxa.

J	MILBERG, P				MILBERG, P			SOIL SEED BANK AFTER 18 YEARS OF SUCCESSION FROM GRASSLAND TO FOREST	OIKOS												I studied the vegetation and seed bank in an 18-yr-old, replicated experiment with grazed and ungrazed plots in a semi-natural, perennial grassland in southern Sweden. In the ungrazed plots, a tall (16-20 m) and dense tree layer had developed. There were fewer plant species growing in ungrazed plots than in grazed plots, but the difference was not significant. However, the number of species per square metre was significantly lower in ungrazed plots. Hence, on a smaller scale, the ground vegetation had become less diverse, but on a larger scale few species had been lost. In the seed bank, a few species lost from the vegetation were still present as seeds in the soil, but in most cases species lost were not recorded in the seed bank. Seeds of species that had colonized plots over the 18 yr were evenly distributed in the soil between the upper (0-4 cm) and lower (4-8 cm) sampling depths. Most of the seeds of species that had disappeared from plots were deep in the soil. Hypotheses about changes in the seed bank during secondary succession, predicting decrease in species richness and seed density, were not confirmed.

Initial spread was mainly to plants adjacent to infected transplants and occurred during grazing and trampling by sheep. New sites of infection subsequently formed away from the original infection sites. Spread occurred mainly in spring and its extent varied with cultivar, site and year. Final SCMoV incidence in swards ranged from 17% of plants infected by isolate MJ in cv. Karridale in 1993 to 60% by isolate P23 in cv. Dinninup in 1991. With cvv. Dinninup and Junee, in two experiments SCMoV-infection. decreased yields within patches with symptoms by 11-26% (herbage) and 5-31% (seed); in one of these experiments infection decreased overall yields of herbage by 9-10% and seed by 10-31%. In an experiment with cw. Dalkeith and Woogenellup, SCMoV-induced overall herbage yield decreases of 10-13% were recorded despite extensive virus spread to control swards; yield losses within affected patches were 20-28.% for herbage and 19% for seed. In an experiment with cw. Karridale and Woogenellup, SCMoV-induced yield losses within patches with symptoms were 38-44% for herbage and 15-41% for seed. Decreased seed size (mean seed weight) and fewer seeds both contributed to the diminished seed yields. Estimates of the effects of different levels of SCMoV infection on herbage yields were obtained for cv. Woogenellup by plotting dry weight data from (i) individual quadrats against percent plants with symptoms within them and (ii) whole plots against percent plot infection determined by ELISA. Losses increased in proportion to the level of infection. SCMoV infection of subterranean clover pastures not only decreases the feed available but also the seed bank which, when compounded over several years, leads to pasture deterioration. Heavy grazing, reseeding the pasture with susceptible cultivars and extended growing seasons are all likely to magnify SCMoV-induced losses.

J	MORGAN, JW				MORGAN, JW			ECOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF THE ENDANGERED RUTIDOSIS LEPTORRHYNCHOIDES .1. SEED PRODUCTION, SOIL SEED BANK DYNAMICS, POPULATION-DENSITY AND THEIR EFFECTS ON RECRUITMENT	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The seasonal dynamics of the soil seed bank of Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides F.Muell. were studied by the seedling emergence technique. Seed longevity in soil was quantified in a seed burial and retrieval experiment. The importance of annual seed production to recruitment was also determined over a 2-year-period, as was the impact of conspecific neighbour density on seed production per inflorescence. Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides appears to form a transient seed bank with little capacity to store germinable seeds in the soil from year to year. No seedlings were observed in soil sampled after the autumn germination pulse and no viable seed was present in the soil within 16 weeks of burial. The rate of seed loss was similar when seed was buried under an intact grassland canopy and in 0.25m(2) canopy gaps. It appears that most seeds simply rot in moist soil or are predated by soil invertebrates. Seedling recruitment was at least 15 times greater in plots where natural seed input occurred than where it was curtailed. Less than 10% of seed shed resulted in seedling emergence. It is suggested that recruitment in the large populations studied was limited by germination rather than by microsite availability for seedling survival. Population density had an impact on seed production with sparsely distributed individuals producing fewer seeds per inflorescence than plants from denser colonies, although there was much variation. Sparse plants produced significantly fewer seeds per inflorescence than hand cross-pollinated heads suggesting reduced pollinator efficacy in these colonies relative to larger colonies where there was no such difference. Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides is dependent on the maintenance of the standing population for recruitment. Any factors that influence flowering and subsequent seed production will limit the ability of the species to regenerate. Over sufficient time, this could lead to the localised extinction of the species and may explain why R. leptorrhynchoides has failed to reappear in remnants where a suitable fire regime has been re-implemented after a period of management unfavourable to the survival, flowering and regeneration of this species.																	0067-1924						1995	43	1					1	11		10.1071/BT9950001							WOS:A1995QU59700001

POSTDISPERSAL SEED PREDATION AND SOIL SEED RESERVES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												This study examined post-dispersal seed predation and soil seed reserves in four remnant populations of E. salmonophloia in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia to determine the effect of these factors on recruitment. Diurnal observations of post-dispersal seed predation at regular intervals of 2 months were undertaken over a 12 month period using artificial baits. Four species of ants were seen removing seeds from artificial baits regularly. Surveys of soil seed reserves revealed that E. salmonophloia does not form a soil seed bank despite a continual seed rain from canopy seed reserves. These observations suggest that ants probably destroy a large proportion of E. salmonophloia seed following dispersal. Burial of E. salmonophloia seeds in the soil in autumn, winter, spring and summer suggest that any seeds which do escape predation are unlikely to persist in the soil for much longer than 12 months and probably germinate with the onset of winter rains. Both the depredation of seeds by ants and the short term viability of seed in the soil contribute to the inability of E. salmonophloia to form a soil seed reserve.

J	LAMONT, BB; MARKEY, A				LAMONT, BB; MARKEY, A			BIOGEOGRAPHY OF FIRE-KILLED AND RESPROUTING BANKSIA SPECIES IN SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Banksia includes 38 fire-killed (seeders) and 20 resprouting species, and two species with contrasting ecotypes, in south-western Australia. There may be up to 12 seeders per 50 X 50 km grid cell in the southern sandplains and 12 resprouters in the northern sandplains. The patterns of distribution of species across soil type and eight climatic attributes is similar for both life forms, except that greater numbers of resprouting species occur at higher rainfalls and where there is greater seasonal spread of rainfall. Most: seeders occur on white sands and rocky substrates, and resprouters occur on yellow sands and the more fertile lateritic soils. Nutrient requirements for both life forms appear to be similar. Resprouters are more widespread than seeders which suggests that resprouters show greater environmental tolerances. The distribution of grid cells containing each life form across soil types and eight climatic attributes is similar and any differences in climatic profile for all species in each category are considered biologically insignificant. Both life forms in section Abietinae are well represented in the climatically distinct southern and northern sandplains indicating no climatic preferences within the lineage. There are no consistent trends in environmental attributes from fire-killed to resprouting ecotypes of B. ashbyi E.G.Baker and B. violacea C.A. Gardner. Multiple-partitioning classification of the floristic data produced 10 groups varying greatly in geography, species richness, and proportion and endemism of each life form. The Lesueur (northern) district has four endemic seeders, six endemic resprouters and a mean of 10 resprouters per cell. The East Eyre (southern) district has five endemic seeders, no endemic resprouters and one resprouter per cell. Both groups have a mean growing season of 5 months. The relative aridities and fluctuations of present and past (Quaternary and late Tertiary) climates are invoked to explain the much higher proportion of resprouters in the northern than southern sandplains and the absence of seeders in the most marginal cells. The absence of endemic species yet high proportion of resprouters (73%) in the extreme south-western corner of the region might be explained by elimination of seeders through frequent burning by Aborigines in the late Quaternary. The increase in the proportion of fire-killed species along the south coast from 23% to 100% at the edge of the Nullarbor Plain also requires an explanation.

J	Lunt, ID				Lunt, ID			Seed longevity of six native forbs in a closed Themeda triandra grassland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seeds of six native forbs-Arthropodium strictum R.Br., Burchardia umbellata R.Br., Bulbine bulbosa (R.Br.) Haw., Chrysocephalum apiculatum (Labill.) Steetz, Craspedia variabilis Everett & Doust and Leptorhynchos squamatus (Labill.) Less.-were sown on and below the soil surface in a closed, native grassland dominated by Themeda triandra Forsskal. Replicate seed lots were recovered after 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months, and viability was assessed. Less than 7% of sown surface seeds of B. bulbosa, B. umbellata, C. variabilis and L. squamatus, and less than 10% of buried seeds of A. strictum, B. umbellata and C. variabilis remained viable after 12 months. Virtually all losses of Liliaceae seeds were due to germination. Fates of Asteraceae seeds were difficult to assess accurately after 6 months, but germination accounted for most seed losses. Burial significantly promoted longevity of B. bulbosa, C. variabilis and L. squamatus seeds. No obvious relationship existed between seed longevity and taxonomic group (Liliaceae versus Asteraceae) or seed mass, for surface or buried seeds; the response of the large-seeded lily, B. bulbosa, was most similar to that of the small-seeded daisy, L. squamatus. Of the six species, C. apiculatum appears to have the greatest potential to accumulate a soil seed bank beneath a closed grass canopy, owing to its small seed size, inhibition of germination beneath a closed canopy, both on and below the soil surface, and sustained viability of buried seeds. Naturally dispersed seeds of the other five species are likely to form smaller, transient or short-term seed banks.																	0067-1924						1995	43	5					439	449		10.1071/BT9950439							WOS:A1995TN50400001

Survey 1 (in spring) sampled naturalised legumes, and survey 2 (in summer) measured the amount and botanical composition of legume seed from selected sites. Seedbanks were examined in greater detail on 2 farms in the higher rainfall part of the wheatbelt. Survey 2 revealed that mean seedbank size of the poorest 40% of sites (those with less than or equal to 200 kg seed/ha) was 61 kg/ha, and that 72% of seeds were naturalised clovers. In contrast, the best 60% of sites (those with >200 kg seed/ha) averaged 533 kg seed/ha, of which only 35% was naturalised clover seed, the remainder in both surveys being mainly subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum). Mean seed bank size (kg/ha) varied from 359 (survey 2) to 587 (survey 1) and, in both surveys, was poorly correlated with long-term mean annual rainfall and a number of soil parameters. On the 2 farms, seedbank size ranged from 300 to 345 kg/ha (in spring) and from 650 to 740 kg/ha (in summer). Trifolium glomeratum (cluster clover) and subterranean clover were the most widespread species in both surveys. They were present at 35 and 30 of the 57 survey sites, respectively, and at both farms. Most of the subterranean clover collected was cv. Geraldton (22 of 30 sites), the next most frequent cultivar was Dwalganup (6 sites). The currently recommended cultivar, Dalkeith, was found at only 5 sites. Several other legumes including T. tomentosum (16 sites), T. suffocatum (8 sites), Medicago truncatula (7 sites), T. hirtum (4 sites), and M. minima (4 sites) were common, while M. littoralis, M. polymorpha, T. dubium, T. cernuum, T. cherleri, and T. campestre were found at single sites. With few exceptions, these are naturalised species and were characterised by flowering times about 20 days later than sown legume cultivars, and seed sizes less than or equal to 1 mg. The value of these widespread annual legumes to agricultural productivity and sustainability needs to be quantified and their adaptation to wheatbelt farming systems assessed.																	0816-1089						1995	35	2					189	197		10.1071/EA9950189							WOS:A1995RH05700009						
J	Evans, PM; Hall, EJ				Evans, PM; Hall, EJ			Seed softening patterns from single seed crops of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L) in a cool temperate environment	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												An experiment was set up in northern Tasmania with 7 cultivars of subterranean clover widely ranging in maturity and levels of hardseededness. They were planted as pure swards and in a mixture with perennial ryegrass. After seed set in the first year, all seedling regenerations were counted and then killed, and seed populations were measured each summer for 6 years. No significant differences in seed losses existed between the pure swards and the mixtures or between cultivars. Negative exponential functions of the relationship between seed banks and time fitted the data well with r(2) ranging from 0.87 (Nungarin) to 0.998 (Trikkala). By mid-summer of the sixth year the percentages of the original seed left in the ground were: Enfield 12%, Woogenellup 19%, Trikkala 20%, Nungarin 21%, Larisa 24%, and Karridale and Mt Barker 31%. Seeds at higher latitudes were lost at about half the rates experienced at lower latitudes with drier, hotter summers. The higher percentages of seed remaining in plots with later maturing cultivars suggest that environmental conditions favoured the production of hard seeds while the reverse was the case with very early, hardseeded cultivars like Nungarin.																	0816-1089						1995	35	8					1117	1121		10.1071/EA9951117							WOS:A1995TY08300008

J	MILBERG, P; LAMONT, BB				MILBERG, P; LAMONT, BB			FIRE ENHANCES WEED INVASION OF ROADSIDE VEGETATION IN SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												We documented the invasion of native vegetation by exotic species after fire. The study was conducted in linear remnants of sclerophyll woodland along a highway in southwestern Australia. Weeds spread into the remnants mainly from the roadside, while their expansion was less marked from the opposite direction (fenceside). The number of weed species, and their frequency and cover increased after the fires, while the abundance of native species often decreased. The impact of the fires was still evident 7 years later, while the unburnt controls remained almost unchanged. The most abundant weeds were the perennial grasses Eragrostis curvula and Ehrharta calycina. Since grasses are an insignificant component of sclerophyll vegetation, their abundance is likely to increase the fire proneness of the vegetation. We advocate restrictions on the frequency of burning and on further narrowing of these corridors.

Seeds were placed in nylon net bags, buried 7 cm deep in soil, exhumed at monthly intervals for 2 yr and allowed to germinate in temperature regimes of 10/2 degrees C, 20/5 degrees C, 25/10 degrees C and 35/20 degrees C (16/8 h), simulating temperatures found during early spring or late fall, spring or fall, summer and mid-summer on the soil surface, respectively. Exhumed and refrigerator-stored (2 degrees C) check seeds exhibited no yearly dormancy/nondormancy germination cycle, but mortality of buried seed increased to 36%, after 10 mo in contrast with that of the check seeds which remained low for two years. Light was required for germination during the first year but was not required for a portion of the seed during the second year. The retention of viability in buried seed explains the persistent seed bank and seedling emergence throughout the growing season when moisture and temperature are nonlimiting.																	0008-4220					JAN	1995	75	1					277	281		10.4141/cjps95-049							WOS:A1995QN02900049

The fact that their effect has not been fully evaluated within the context of the complete plant life cycle contributes to this controversy. This study is the first to test directly the influence of flower and seed consumption by a guild of inflorescence-feeding insects on the demography and fitness of a native plant over its whole life cycle within its natural environment. First, we discuss the evidence required to assess the effect of inflorescence-feeding insects on sequential stages in the plant life cycle. Then, we present the detailed results of two experiments that quantify the effect of inflorescence-feeding insects on seeds, seedlings, juveniles, and subsequent flowering progeny of Cirsium canescens (Platte thistle), a native, monocarpic perennial species of Sandhills prairie, Nebraska. Exclusion of inflorescence-feeding insects by insecticide had four main effects. Total seed output increased (P < 0.0005 in both experiments), indicating that resources were not limiting seed production. Flower heads produced later in the season contributed to the seed pool when insects were reduced (P < 0.01), suggesting that insect feeding restricted the phenology of flowering and pollination. The density of seedlings increased around plants protected from inflorescence-feeding insects (P < 0.0005), showing that safe sites were not limiting. Finally, the increase in seedlings led to higher numbers of flowering adults (P < 0.009), demonstrating that inflorescence-feeding insects significantly reduced lifetime fitness. Neither individual compensation for seed loss, nor density-dependent compensation for increased plant population densities, was observed when insects were excluded. Thus, we conclude that the inflorescence-feeding insect herbivores limited seed production, seedling recruitment, plant density, and maternal fitness of this plant under natural conditions. This outcome challenges current theoretical models of the effect of insects on plant population dynamics. We predict that our result will be general for short-lived perennial plants with life histories in which persistence is tightly linked to regeneration from current seed, such as for fugitive perennials with transient seed banks.																	0012-9658					JAN	1995	76	1					229	245		10.2307/1940645							WOS:A1995QC87200020						
J	PAKE, CE; VENABLE, DL				PAKE, CE; VENABLE, DL			IS COEXISTENCE OF SONORAN DESERT ANNUALS MEDIATED BY TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS	ECOLOGY												Models of annual plants with a persistent seed bank have shown that temporal variation can promote coexistence if the reproductive success of species is favored in different environments determined by temporally variable conditions. This study investigates whether this mechanism may explain the coexistence of three Sonoran Desert species (Pectocarya recurvata, Plantago patagonica, Schismus barbatus). In a 2-yr experiment, factors that vary across years (water and seedling density) were manipulated. In addition, the dominant spatial feature, presence or absence of Larrea cover, was also included as a factor. Our aim was to document fitness hierarchies in different types of years. Seedlings were mapped monthly for survival and reproductive success. To compare species, we used 10 yr of data to calculate the average value that seeds of different species have for population growth. Shifts in fitness hierarchies were found for two species pairs (Pectocarya-Schismus and Pectocarya-Plantago), depending on density and either the year or the water level. Surprisingly, all species had higher survival at higher densities in one or another treatment. Habitats were not important to the fitness hierarchies; all species had higher mean survival and fitness in the open than under shrubs.																	0012-9658					JAN	1995	76	1					246	261		10.2307/1940646							WOS:A1995QC87200021						
J	SIROIS, L				SIROIS, L			INITIAL PHASE OF POSTFIRE FOREST REGENERATION IN 2 LICHEN WOODLANDS OF NORTHERN QUEBEC	ECOSCIENCE												A five-year postfire monitoring of forest floor regeneration, black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) seed dispersal, germination and seedling establishment was performed in a black spruce and in a jack pine lichen woodland of the upper boreal forest in northern Quebec. The plant species present before the fire and able to resprout vegetatively were the fastest to regenerate. The slower regeneration of the spruce stand forest floor probably resulted from deeper combustion of the organic layer which killed most potentially meristematic organs of species which otherwise might have regenerated. The total seed dispersal over the five-year postfire monitoring period in the spruce stand reached 1 700 886/ha and 270.830/ha for black spruce and jack pine, respectively. In the pine stand, these values were in the same order: 216 011/ha and 298 883/ha. The spatial pattern of seed dispersal was generally contagious. The number of seeds dispersed decreased during the last trapping periods, suggesting that seed banks were becoming exhausted. Likewise, seed viability dropped markedly over time. These temporal patterns of seed dispersal and viability fit the predictions of Wilton's model. Despite a lower total seed input, jack pine established at a higher density than black spruce, particularly on charred organic seedbeds. Seedling establishment success observed in this study and elsewhere suggests that this parameter has been probably underestimated in simulation models of the dynamics of the northeastern Canadian lichen woodland.																	1195-6860						1995	2	2					177	183		10.1080/11956860.1995.11682282							WOS:A1995TF50800009						
J	KOLLMANN, J				KOLLMANN, J			REGENERATION WINDOW FOR FLESHY-FRUITED PLANTS DURING SCRUB DEVELOPMENT ON ABANDONED GRASSLAND	ECOSCIENCE												Successional patterns in seed rain, seed predation; seed bank, and the density and survival of seedlings were studied for fleshy-fruited plants in a patchy vegetation of dry grassland with interspersed scrub in central Europe. These hay meadows were abandoned 20-30 years ago. Three successional scrub stages (phases) and the adjacent mown and abandoned meadows were used for the investigation. Seeds of 29 fleshy-fruited species were collected in seed traps over two years. The spatial pattern of seed dispersal strongly depended on the successional stage: seed rain density was highest beneath the mature scrub phase and lowest in the grassland. This was also true for seed predation by rodents, and frequency of fleshy-fruited plants in the seed bank. The density of seedlings showed a different pattern; it was highest in the intermediate phase of scrub development. In this phase the seed rain was less abundant than under the mature phase, but the destructive influence of seed predation and the mortality of seedlings (particularly due to shading) were not as strong as beneath the mature phase. Therefore, it can be assumed that this intermediate phase is a regeneration window for fleshy-fruited scrub species.

J	MARTINEZRAMOS, M; ALVAREZBUYLLA, ER				MARTINEZRAMOS, M; ALVAREZBUYLLA, ER			SEED DISPERSAL AND PATCH DYNAMICS IN TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS - A DEMOGRAPHIC APPROACH	ECOSCIENCE												In this paper we propose that an evaluation of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of seed dispersal requires the recognition of patches where seeds have different probabilities to reach the seedling stage as well as the spatial and temporal dynamics of such patches. To analyze the relative importance of seed sources on the regeneration of trees growing in patchy environments, we use metapopulation models that combine matrix demographic models with Markovian models that simulate patch dynamics. The models are applied to the cases of two tree species with contrasting life-histories at Los Tuxtlas tropical rain forest, Mexico. For pioneer tree species, we show that the relative contribution of propagules from the seed rain and seed bank depends on the temporal regime of natural disturbance and the mortality rates of soil seeds. For shade-tolerant trees, results suggest that dispersal may increase seedling recruitment when seed movement occurs from patches where mother plants have higher fecundity and/or seeds have higher pre-dispersal survival to patches where soil-seeds and/or seedlings have higher survival. The metapopulation models also show that inferences about critical stages in the evolution of species life-histories contrast between a static and dynamic patchy scenario.

J	ERIKSSON, O				ERIKSSON, O			SEEDLING RECRUITMENT IN DECIDUOUS FOREST HERBS - THE EFFECTS OF LITTER, SOIL CHEMISTRY AND SEED BANK	FLORA												A litter removal experiment, in combination with analyses of soil chemistry and seed bank, were performed to investigate the role of these factors for seedling recruitment of herbs and grasses in a deciduous forest fragment in Sweden. An additional experiment was used to investigate effects of seed availability and seed predation on germination of one selected species, Anemone nemorosa. Removal of litter increased both seedling number and species diversity among seedlings. No species was directly favoured by litter but a few species, most notably A. nemorosa, were capable of germination under litter. No relationships were found between recruitment and soil chemistry. Only 26% of the species in the established vegetation were found in the seed bank. Recruitment in the field, after litter removal, was positively correlated to size and diversity of the seed bank. Seedling recruitment of A. nemorosa was partly limited by seed availability and seed predation. As a generalization, it is suggested that an increase in seed size among deciduous forest herbs implies (1) that litter effects of recruitment decrease, (2) that species become less likely to have a persistent seed bank, (3) that effects of seed predation increase, and (4) that recruitment limitation by seed availability becomes increasingly important.																	0367-2530					JAN	1995	190	1					65	70		10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30626-6							WOS:A1995QF04800004

Seeds were collected from fruits and from faeces in the Nature Reserve of Sierra de Grazalema (S Spain); they were separated into various sets which were subjected to different treatments before being sown in Petri dishes to test their germination. Results showed that 1) carob seeds have physical dormancy afforded by their hard seed coat, constituting a persistent seed bank in the soil; 2) fox and cow carry out a long distance dispersal of carob seeds without damaging the embryo, but they do not accelerate the germination. 3) Ceratonia siliqua is not dependent on fire for seed germination. Experiments simulating fire effect resulted in a decreased germination, the embryo remaining intact, which suggests a hardening of the seed coat by heat.

J	WILLEMS, JH				WILLEMS, JH			SOIL SEED BANK, SEEDLING RECRUITMENT AND ACTUAL SPECIES COMPOSITION IN AN OLD AND ISOLATED CHALK GRASSLAND SITE	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA & PHYTOTAXONOMICA												A soil seed bank study was conducted in an old and isolated chalk grassland site (area ca. 0.05 ha) with a high species richness in The Netherlands, over a two-year period. Each soil seed bank sample was divided into two halves: one part was sown immediately in trays with a layer of sterilized sand and put in a greenhouse, whilst the other half received a chilling period before being sown. Plant recruitment in the field was studied during the same period in permanently marked plots. Seeds of species which had become extinct during the period 1944-1970 were not found in the soil seed bank in the late eighties. One group of species still present in the actual vegetation neither showed any signs of recruitment from seed nor had a soil seed bank. Species in this group that do not recruit vegetatively can be considered as directly threatened by extinction. A group in the actual vegetation did not show any recruitment, but nevertheless had germinable seed present in the soil. Among this group, there are some annuals; however, the majority of the species are characterized by the potential to recruit vegetatively. The majority of the species present in the actual vegetation (45%) demonstrate seedling recruitment and are also present as seeds in the soil, although there is some quantitative discrepancy between these categories. The seed bank did not reflect former stages of the actual vegetation. Based on the results, predictions can be made on the future development of the vegetation and on the fate of a number of species. Adjustment of the management regime is aimed at maintenance of the species richness of the site. This is important for nature preservation purposes since a high number (ca. 27%) of the species in the chalk grassland of this small site are on the Dutch Red List.																	0015-5551						1995	30	2					141	156		10.1007/BF02812094							WOS:A1995RV83800004

Over the course of stand development following disturbance, light levels in the understorey will be reduced as the leaf area increases and with an increase in the spruce composition of stands. Understorey vegetation density and composition are highly dependent upon overstorey density. Forest shrubs and herbs can be placed into three categories: "Understorey avoiders" are adapted to grow only in open conditions in the period after stand disturbance these species recruit from long distance dispersal of seed or from seed banks and usually have photosynthetic strategies thr;; demand strong light. "Understorey obligates" must live in the shelter of an understorey; they are usually short in stature, adapted to low light environments and have leaf phenology strategies that allow photosynthesis in periods other than summer. "Understorey tolerators" survive in understorey environments but grow best in open conditions; these are usually taller summer green herbs and shrubs that can grow over a wide range of light conditions. The impact of understorey vegetation on the success of partial-cut silviculture systems will depend upon three major factors: 1) The canopy density of the overstorey prior to cutting. If the canopy is heavy, the understorey will be sparse or nonexistent. There will be a lag before the understorey re-establishes following partial-cutting. If the canopy is light, the understorey will be well-established and in position to dominate the site. 2) The tolerance of the tree species to be regenerated relative to the tolerance of the main understorey species will be important in determining how much canopy needs to be retained. 3) The response of the understorey species to disturbance will be important. Frequently, mechanical site preparation is needed to prepare seed beds and planting spots. The time free of vegetation will be critical to the establishment of the target tree species.																			0-9695385-3-7				1995							33	39									WOS:000077172300006

Abiotic influences on seed longevity and dormancy were investigated by comparing seeds maintained at 5 degrees C with seeds experiencing fluctuating day/night temperatures (40 degrees C/20 degrees vs. 50 degrees C/30 degrees C) under dry and moist conditions. Acacia seed demonstrated no dormancy and initial germinability was >82% in the laboratory. Variability of Leucaena seed was >97%, but seed coat dormancy limited germination to <7%. Persistence of Acacia seeds in the soil seed bank varied with depth. After 42 days the viable seed population of Acacia was reduced by 10 and 80% for surface and buried seeds, respectively, and no viable seeds were present after 3.5 months of burial. In contrast, Leucaena seeds on the soil surface exhibited no significant decline in viability over 60 days and attrition of buried seed was <11%. After 3.5, 6 and 12 months of burial, 86, 81 and 71% of the Leucaena seeds dispensed remained viable, but the hard seed coat limited germination to 5, 2 and 0%, respectively. Loss of dormancy of Leucaena seeds stored in the laboratory over 7, 30 and 78 days was 7, 12 and 19%. Thus, the 29% attrition after 1 year of burial was probably associated with a gradual loss of seed coat dormancy. Light levels (full sun and 25% full sun) manipulated with neural density shade cloth had no significant influence on surface seed viability for either species. Temperature and moisture interacted to influence Leucaena seed coat dormancy and embryo viability, but fluctuating temperatures under dry conditions affected neither viability nor germination. However, when moisture was available, germinability of seeds in the 40 degrees C/20 degrees C regime was higher (41%) than that of the control group maintained at 30 degrees C(7%). All seeds in the 50 degrees C/30 degrees C regime imbibed water within 50 days, but non germinated. Low germination of buried seeds (29%) suggest that temperature/moisture combinations capable of disrupting seed coat dormancy or inducing embryo mortality were infrequent during the year of the field experiment.

However, little is known, except in agricultural grasslands, about how the associated understorey vegetation develops after control. A process model to predict vegetation development after bracken control has been developed from existing models of bracken growth and of successional development in set-aside. Basically, species compete for that space not taken up by the bracken canopy. Litter hinders germination and also competes for space with the growing plants. The outcome of succession depends on the initial species composition, the seed bank, the type of control and the various attributes of the species present.
