J	Azcarate, FM; Peco, B				Azcarate, Francisco M.; Peco, Begona			Effects of seed predation by ants on Mediterranean grassland related to seed size	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: 1. Do harvester ants (Messor barbarus) promote seed mortality in Mediterranean grassland?; 2. Is this effect greater in large-seeded species? Location: Central Spain. Methods: We established an ant-exclusion experiment of five circular (1.5 m diameter) plots from where ants were excluded during one year, along with ten control plots. We recorded the seed bank of all species in the plots both before and after the treatment. The effect of seed length and weight was analysed after transforming data into phylogenetically independent contrasts, and alternatively by dividing the species data set into morphological groups. Results: Longer and heavier seeded species significantly increased in the seed banks under the exclusion treatment, although ants did not significantly modify overall seed densities. Conclusions: Although the ants do not collect large numbers of seeds, they differentially affect the composition of the seed banks by selecting the longest or heaviest seeds, or both. The persistence of this short-term effect in the seed bank may result, over a number of years, in the system evolving towards a predominance of small-seeded annuals, congruent with the species composition actually observed in Mediterranean grasslands.

J	Carolan, MS				Carolan, Michael S.			Conserving nature, but to what end? Conservation policies and the unanticipated ecologies they support	ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT												The author examines various cases of conservation policies in practice, and the implication of those practices in terms of the ecologies they support, showing, in the end, that the "nature" being preserved is not always the one intended. In doing this, insights are also gleaned to inform how we should do environmental sociology, and what lies in environmental sociology's future if we work toward this end. The author argues that environmental sociology needs to become more environmental: to be willing to understand sociobiophysical relationships in all their complexity, even in those cases that require a well-grounded understanding of ecosystem processes. Thus, although retaining focus on the historical subject, which shapes conceptions of and ultimately practices toward ecology, we must also begin to view this subject as also an ecological object. The implications of such an analytic move, in terms of what it means for environmental sociology's future, are then discussed.																	1086-0266					JUN	2006	19	2					153	170		10.1177/1086026606288061							WOS:000240628700001						
J	Flores, J; Jurado, E; Arredondo, A				Flores, J; Jurado, E; Arredondo, A			Effect of light on germination of seeds of Cactaceae from the Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												In the Chihuahuan Desert, there are many cacti species considered to be at risk due to illegal extraction, land-use change and overgrazing. To reduce their illegal extraction, ex situ plant propagation has been suggested. However, the literature regarding seed germination biology of these species is scarce. We investigated the effect of light on germination percentages and germination rate (t(50)) in seeds of 28 cactus species from the Chihuahuan Desert. Seeds were incubated at a 14-h daily photoperiod (light) and in continuous darkness at 25 degrees C for 30 d, after which seeds failing to germinate in darkness were transferred to light for 30 d. Only 11 of the species had non-dormant seeds, germinating >= 70% in the light; thus an evaluation of the effect of light versus darkness on germination was confined to them. All species were positively photoblastic, and all of them had seeds weighing < 1 mg. Ten species did not germinate in darkness, and one species had only 7% germination. From these 11 species, 8 did not germinate to a significantly higher percentage when the same set of seeds was transferred from dark to light, suggesting that darkness had triggered secondary dormancy (skotodormancy). To our knowledge, these results are the first to show that darkness triggers secondary dormancy in cacti. Implications of having a light requirement for germination and having small seeds to accumulate a persistent soil seed bank are discussed. These results contribute to understanding the germination biology of cactus species at risk, and could enhance the propagation of large numbers of cultivated individuals outside their habitats, promoting ex situ conservation.

Mother plants of E. adenophorum were absent from eight of the sites, and their frequency was low at nine other sites. However, persistent soil seed banks were present at all 19 sites. Seed density in the 0-10 cm soil layer varied from 47 to 13,806 seeds m(-2), and averaged 2199 seeds m(-2). Fifty-seven percent of the seeds of E. adenophorum were in the 0-2 cm soil layer, 24% in the 2-5 cm layer and 19% in the 5-10 cm layer. The percentage of cores from which seedlings emerged ranged from 33-100% across all sites. Seed density and seedling emergence percentages varied significantly among the five stations, and both were positively correlated with abundance of mother plants.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				JUN	2006	16	2					157	162		10.1079/SSR2006240							WOS:000237234400007						
J	Pedros-Alio, C				Pedros-Alio, Carlos			Marine microbial diversity: can it be determined?	TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Estimates of the order of magnitude for the total number of microbial species on Earth range from 10(3) to 10(9). Despite global dispersal of microorganisms, this number is probably rather large. The total biodiversity of an ecosystem is composed of two elements: first, a set of abundant taxa that carry out most ecosystem functions, grow actively and suffer intense losses through predation and viral lysis. These taxa are retrievable with molecular techniques but are difficult to grow in culture. Second, there is a seed bank of many rare taxa that are not growing or grow extremely slowly, do not experience viral lysis and predation is reduced. Such taxa are seldom retrieved by molecular techniques but many can be grown in culture, which explains the dictum 'everything is everywhere'.

A. sterilis showed relatively stable spatial distribution and spatial structure of its population over time at large scale, with well-defined patches, although weed density rose quickly. L. rigidum showed poorly defined patches that were not stable across time. Interaction between species could explain to some degree the spatial distribution at large scale: a negative relationship was detected between the spatial structures of both weed populations. At fine scale, both species showed a clear interaction effect from primary dispersal (more important in A. sterilis) and secondary dispersal from combine harvesting (more important in L. rigidum).

J	Merkey, DH				Merkey, DH			Characterization of wetland hydrodynamics using HGM and subclassification methods in southeastern Michigan, USA	WETLANDS												The hydrogeomorphic (HGM) wetland assessment method has been developed to provide a muchneeded, ecologically-sound means for classifying, assessing, and comparing wetland hydrodynamics and related functions. A first step in using the HGM is the identification of 'biogeographical regions' to characterize regional wetland subclasses. I found no attempts to test existing ecoregions or other subclassification methods in the glaciated Great Lakes basin for use with HGM. Two subclassification methods are tested here. One ecosystem classification (based on geology, climate, topography, and other large-scale variables) is compared with a method based solely on the permeability of underlying glacial deposits. Water-level fluctuation, conductivity, and alkalinity were monitored for three years to determine whether differences in hydrodynamics and water chemistry existed between depressional wetlands using either subclassification method. The hydrodynamics of inland wetlands differed significantly between subclasses based on either method. The permeability-based subclasses were also effective in differentiating wetland water chemistry. Aspects of the ecosystem classification, however, provided additional information not accounted for by the permeability-based method. Thus, the ecosystem classification provides better biogeographical regions for use with HGM in the glaciated Great Lakes basin.																	0277-5212					JUN	2006	26	2					358	367		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[358:COWHUH]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000238701700008

Shrubs as a source of spatial heterogeneity - the case of Retama sphaerocarpa in Mediterranean pastures of central Spain	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The processes underlying the positive effect exerted by woody species on other plant species can be grouped into a physical effect due to the canopy itself (mainly amelioration of temperature and light extremes), and an edaphic effect (nutrient enrichment). Both groups of effects are present in the savanna-like systems originated by Retama sphaerocarpa in the Iberian Peninsula. The consequences of these shrubs for the spatial heterogeneity induced in the herbaceous community are not well known. The herbaceous community was sampled by means of radial transects around 20 adult shrubs, from the canopy centre to the open areas among the shrubs, both northwards and southwards. Floristic composition, diversity and pasture mean height change both along the inside-outside gradient, and from north to south. As a nutrient enriched environment, the centre of the understorey showed the lowest species richness and evenness, and the highest standing crop. In contrast, the environmentally stressful open areas showed the highest number of species and evenness, and the lowest standing crop. This general effect is only partially due to nutrient availability, and is not homogeneous around the shrub, as open area conditions penetrate into the understorey driving the herbaceous community towards that of open areas. An individual shrub effect is also suggested by our results. Different conditions are thus provided by R. sphaerocarpa understoreys, favouring different subsets of species from thegeneral pool, and therefore defining shrub canopies as sources of spatial heterogeneity in the whole savanna-like system.

J	Barker, GM				Barker, Gary M.			Diversity in plants and other Collembola ameliorate impacts of Sminthurus viridis on plant community structure	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Five experiments investigated the importance of herbivory by Sminthurus viridis in structuring botanical composition in developing grasslands, and how these effects may be modified by diversity in collembolan and plant species. Differential susceptibility to S. viridis feeding was demonstrated in 23 dicotyledonous and three monocotyledonous plants assayed as seedlings at the first true leaf stage. The composition of seedling communities developing from natural and artificially constructed soil seed banks varied with the level of S. viridis infestation, with plant species least susceptible to herbivory making the greatest contribution to plant biomass. The combined effect of herbivory by S. viridis and Bourletiella hortensis on Trifolium repens biomass was shown to be less than the effect of S. viridis alone, indicating competitive interference. The adverse effects of herbivory by S. viridis on T repens biomass was reduced by increased diversity of plants growing in association with the legume, and the presence of four non-herbivorous arthropleonan Collembola. S. viridis was shown to reduce seedling numbers, species diversity and biomass in communities developing from the soil seed bank, but the presence of non-herbivorous arthropleonan species. reduced the effect of S. viridis. The experiments demonstrate the potential for herbivory by S. viridis to significantly alter species composition in developing grassland communities. However, interactions with collembolan and plant species profoundly modified S. viridis herbivory impacts, either by reducing feeding intensity or enhancing plant growth. These results highlight the fact that data from-simple, synthetic systems may be poor predictors of herbivory impacts under field conditions where more complex species interactions occur.

The objectives were: (1) to investigate whether species composition and species richness of soil seed banks are affected by different forest stands; (2) to examine how abundant are habitat-specific forest species in seed banks under different planted tree layers. The study was carried out in stands which are replicated, managed in the same way (even-aged high forest), and growing on the same soil type with the same land-use history. In the investigated area, the seed bank did show significant differences under oak, beech, pine and in logging areas, respectively in terms of size, composition and depth occurrence. All species and layers taken together, the seed bank size ranked as follows: oakwood > beechwood > logging area > pinewood. The same pattern was found for forest species. Seed numbers of Betula pendula, Calluna vulgaris, Dryopteris dilatata and Rubus fruticosus were significantly higher under the beech canopy. Carex remota, Impatiens parviflora and Lotus sp. showed a significantly denser seed bank in logging areas, while Digitalis purpurea seeds were significantly more abundant in soils under the oak canopy. The fact that the seed bank of an originally homogeneous forest varies under different planted stands highlights that a long period of canopy conversion can affect the composition and depth of buried seeds.

J	O'Donovan, JT; Blackshaw, RE; Harker, KN; Clayton, GW				O'Donovan, JT; Blackshaw, RE; Harker, KN; Clayton, GW			Wheat seeding rate influences herbicide performance in wild oat (Avena fatua L.)	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Field experiments were conducted at three locations in Alberta for 3 yr to determine if spring wheat (Triticum aestimin L.) seeding rate (75 and 150 kg ha(-1)) influenced the effects of recommended and reduced herbicide rates on wild oat (Avena fatua L.) shoot biomass, wild oat seed in the soil seed bank, and wheat yield and net economic return. Wild oat biomass and seed in the soil seed bank decreased nonlinearly at both seeding rates as herbicide rates increased. The herbicides were more effective in reducing wild oat shoot biomass and seed in the soil seed bank when wheat was seeded at the higher rate. The lowest wheat yields and net economic returns occurred when no herbicides were applied and both variables increased nonlinearly with increasing herbicide rate. In most cases, wheat yield and net economic return were greater at the higher seeding rate. On average, wheat yield improved by 19% and net economic return by 16% when wheat was seeded at the higher rate. The results indicate that seeding wheat at relatively high rates can contribute positively to herbicide performance and result in better wild oat management and higher wheat yields and economic returns. In some cases, there was little difference between applying the herbicides at 75 or 100% of the recommended rate but reducing rates below 75% almost always resulted in higher wild oat shoot biomass and seed, and reduced yields and net economic returns, even at the higher wheat seeding rate.																	0002-1962					MAY-JUN	2006	98	3					815	822		10.2134/agronj2005.0234							WOS:000237867600048

Location: Camp Whispering Pines (30 degrees 41' N; 90 degrees 29' W), eastern Louisiana (USA). Methods: We used ecologically sensitive restoration logging to remove patches of Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) in a second-growth loess plain Pinus palustris savanna managed using frequent lightning season fires. Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m(2) plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades. Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m(2), 20% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees. Responses varied with life form; more herbaceous species occurred in recent and older overstorey openings than beneath overstorey trees. Total numbers of all species and of less abundant forb species were positively and linearly related to light transmitted to ground level. Those species responding to openings in the overstorey and positively associated with increased transmitted light levels were monocarpic and short-lived perennial forb and grass species with a seed bank in the soil. In addition, community structure, as reflected in species composition and abundances, appeared to vary with canopy condition. Conclusions: Restoration involving ecologically sensitive removal of patches of overstorey pines in frequently burned pine savannas should benefit the ground cover and increase plant species biodiversity as a result of increased abundance of seed bank species.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				MAY	2006	9	1					37	50		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2006.tb00654.x							WOS:000242292500006

Effects of the litter layer of Pteridium aquilinum on seed banks under experimental restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Does the litter layer of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken) act as a barrier to certain species in the seed bank? Does bracken control/restoration treatment affect seed transfer through the litter layer? Location: Five experiments at three sites across the UK covering two major vegetation types; acid-grassland and heathland. Methods: At each experiment a range of bracken control and vegetation restoration treatments were applied for about ten years. The seed bank was sampled in both the bracken litter and the soil. The cover (%) of each species in the vegetation and the bracken litter abundance (cover and depth) was also estimated. Results: The bracken litter layer acts as an inert barrier as it contained a large proportion of seeds available in the litter-soil profile (38% - 67% of the total). Bracken litter depth and cover also influenced significantly the seed bank composition in both the bracken litter and the soil. These effects were site-specific, and species-specific. The application of treatments changed significantly the balance between seed inputs and outputs in the bracken litter layer for some species. This was either a positive or negative response relative to the untreated control plots. Conclusion: For heathland and acid-grassland restoration, the bracken litter layer may be an important seed source, but it must be disturbed particularly before seed addition.

We investigated the species composition and density of the soil seed banks (propagule banks) of lake sediments at nine sites (total area, 65,200 m(2)) where lake sediments were spread thinly (similar to 10 cm) on the surfaces of artificial littoral zones. These zones were constructed in front of concrete levees and had microtopographic variations. In total, 180 species, including six endangered or vulnerable species and 12 native submerged plants that had disappeared from the aboveground vegetation of the lake, were recorded during the first year of restoration. The distribution of each restored species at the sites suggested the importance of microtopographic variation for recolonizing species-rich lakeshore vegetation. Furthermore, the origin of the source sediment affected the species composition of the established vegetation.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				MAY	2006	21	3					436	445		10.1007/s11284-005-0133-y							WOS:000237657300014

(Cactaceae), a species threatened with extinction	INTERCIENCIA												Astrophytum myriostigma Lem. is a threatened endemic cactus from the Chihuahuan Desert, in Mexico. In order to promote its conservation, a germination experiment was performed with 4 years old seeds from a population which disappeared due to mining activities. Germination speed and percentage were evaluated in small and large seeds which differed significantly in length (P = 0.003) and dry weight (P < 0.0001), but not in diameter. Treatments were H2SO4, distilled water immersion, mechanical scarification and low temperature. Germination percentage varied for different treatments, seed size and treatment x size interaction. Immersing seeds in distilled water or low temperature had the highest germination percentages. Small seeds showed higher germination percentages than the control for all treatments except scarification, for which germination was indistinguishably low for both seed size categories. Germination speed did not vary in response to germination treatment, but it did in response to seed size and treatment x size interaction. Small seeds germinated faster (3.8 seeds/day) than large seeds (1.6 seeds/day). Under H2SO4 treatment small seeds germinated faster than large ones. Scarification with sand paper had the opposite effect, large seeds germinated faster than small ones. In conclusion, small 4 year old seeds showed higher and faster germination than large seeds. In general, small seeds might have had higher germination percentages as a result of faster water uptake or because of a strategy for small seeds to become part of a soil seed bank and thus defer germination. Further specific studies are required to test these hypotheses.																	0378-1844					MAY	2006	31	5					371	375									WOS:000237981700009

Four-day experiments were conducted on three dates and at four different sites. Seeds from 10 native plant species representing a broad mass range were offered at densities equivalent to 3145 seeds m(-2). We found that total seed removal and relative importance of granivorous groups varied widely among sites and dates. Rodents were the major seed predators in all the habitats, except for the savanna/forest border where birds dominated. Ants removed more seeds than birds, but since they preferred the smallest seeds, ants ranked last in mass removed. We found a temporally variable relationship between seed removal rates and seed rain or seed bank. We inferred monthly seed predation from seed-dish experiments as well as through the decline of the seed bank in the environment during the dry season, and compared both estimations to evaluate the suitability of the seed-dish technique for estimating granivory. We initially hypothesized that seed-dish experiments that emulate seed availability more closely may yield a better estimate of seed predation, but in fact, they may still overestimate granivory intensity.																	0266-4674					MAY	2006	22		3				255	265		10.1017/S0266467405003093							WOS:000237584300003

We used 21 microsatellite loci to analyse the genetic relationships among individuals (n= 813) collected from a small Oryza rufipogon population conserved since 1993 in Hunan Province of China. The analysis revealed four distinct genetic subpopulations (F-ST= 0.145) without geographic isolation. One subpopulation was composed of possible introgressed individuals, two subpopulations were composed of seed recruits and their descendants, and the fourth subpopulation consisted of reintroduced individuals, seed recruits and their descendants. Positive spatial genetic structures were detected by spatial autocorrelation statistics at the population (c. 63 m) and subpopulation levels (11-30 m), but the degree of autocorrelation was stronger at the population level.

Linking hydroperiod and vegetation response in Carolina bay wetlands	PLANT ECOLOGY												Hydrology filters propagule bank expression in herbaceous Carolina bays, but the strength of this filter's effects on community composition at different points along the hydrologic gradient of these southeastern U.S. depressional wetlands is unknown. We used an experimental approach to determine the pattern of vegetation expression from propagule banks of Carolina bays exposed to different hydrologic conditions and gradients. Propagule banks of sediment cores collected from six Carolina bays were placed in bins, each of which was allocated to one of three hydrologic treatments: moist soil (MS), mid-summer drawdown (DD), or flooded (FL). After one season of vegetation development (1995) in the hydrologic treatments, half of the bins were left flat and the remaining were sloped to produce a finer moisture gradient within each bin. We compared taxa richness, community composition based on cover, and cover patterns of eight abundant species that developed in bins over the season (1996) after sloping. Species richness was significantly higher in the moist soil treatment and in sloped bins. Community composition, however, was affected by the hydrologic treatment only and not the finer-scale flooding gradient produced by sloping. Under flooded conditions, floating-leaved and submerged aquatics had higher cover; vegetation converged on simpler, less variable communities dominated by obligate wetland species, with species exhibiting different patterns of abundance over small changes in water depth. Emergent species typically had higher cover in moist soil and drawdown treatments. These results confirm a tight mechanistic link between hydrology and vegetation patterns within Carolina bays, but suggest that the strength of this link is not uniform across the gradient. The linkage weakens with drier conditions as both facultative wetland and upland species recruit into the standing vegetation.																	1385-0237					MAY	2006	184	1					173	185		10.1007/s11258-005-9062-7							WOS:000238139000015

Soil seed bank characteristics in relation to land use systems and distance from water in a semi-arid rangeland of southern Ethiopia	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The size and species composition of the soil seed bank of southern Ethiopia rangelands were examined under three land use systems (communal land, a government ranch and traditional grazing reserves) and along a distance gradient (near, middle and far) from water sources. Soil seed bank sampling was carded out at the end of the growing season from 0.25 m(-2) quadrates 30 mm deep. The aboveground species composition was also compared. Of the total plant species identified in the soil seed bank in the greenhouse, 25% were grasses and 75% non-grasses. The near, middle and far sites from water was dominated by Leucas glabrata, Verbesina encelioides and Lintona nutans, respectively. Lepthotrium senegalensis made up 67% of the total composition of the soil seed bank in the traditional grazing reserve. Graminoid seedling density at the traditional grazing reserve (798.8 seedlings m(-2)) was higher (P < 0.01) than that of the ranch and communal sites, but did not vary significantly along the distance gradient from water (average 239.2 seedlings m(-2)). Non-graminoid seedling density did not vary much (P > 0.05) between the land use systems (average 128.9 seedlings m(-2)) and along the distance gradients from water (average 183.7 seedlings m(-2)). Sorensen's similarity index of the aboveground vegetation and the associated seed bank was low at all the sites. Difference in grazing pressure between the land use systems was one of the most likely causes of variations in the soil seed bank density and botanical composition of graminoids. The non-significant differences in the graminoid seed bank density along the distance gradients from water were due to similar population of grasses and may not explain the levels of grazing impact and disturbance. Regeneration from the soil seed bank may have a profound effect in restoring the composition of the grass layer in the degraded Borana rangelands if sustainable management practices are applied and sufficient rest periods followed. By translocating seed rich topsoil from the grazing reserves to degraded grazing areas, the soil seed bank can be used to develop valuable grass species at small community level. (c) 2005 SAAB.

Process development for a Cuban cholera vaccine based on the attenuated strain Vibrio cholerae 638	VACCINE					3rd International Conference on Vaccines for Enteric Diseases	APR 28-30, 2004	Montego Bay, JAMAICA					Genetically modified Vibrio cholerae strain 638 (biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa) has previously been shown to be immunogenic in animal models and in human trials. Our objective in the work reported herein was to describe the process development methods for the production of the 638 attenuated cholera vaccine. Cell seed bank, culture of biomass, lyophilization and final formulation were processes were developed. The results show kinetics of culture that fulfils a logistical model. The microbiological properties, colonizing capability, immunogenicity and non-toxigenicity of the final product were indistinguishable from the properties of the working seed lot. We conclude that the non-reactogenic, immunogenic and protective strain 638 is robust and can withstand the fermentation processes required for large-scale production of a vaccine.

The natural history of soil seed banks of arable land	WEED SCIENCE					Seed Bank Symposium	2004	Columbus, OH	N Cent Weed Sci Soc				This article briefly reviews how long weed seeds can live in the soil and what happens to them during burial. Freshly matured seeds of many weeds are water-permeable, but those of others are water-impermeable. Water-permeable seeds may have morphological, physiological, or morphophysiological dormancy, with physiological dormancy (PD) being one of the most commonly found in buried weed seeds. Further, nondeep PD is very common in buried weed seeds, and many of them exhibit annual dormancy cycles in response to seasonal temperature changes. The time of year when seeds are nondormant varies with the species, i.e., autumn, spring, or spring to summer. A light requirement for germination plays an important role in preventing nondormant seeds from germinating in the soil. To germinate, soil disturbance that exposes seeds to light must occur at a time of year when seeds are nondormant. Buried seeds of some species come out of dormancy and remain nondormant regardless of seasonal changes in environmental conditions; however, a light requirement for germination prevents them from germinating in the soil. Water-impermeable seeds have either physical dormancy (PY) or a combination of PY and PD, with PY being the most common, e.g., in members of the Fabaceae and Malvaceae. Seeds with PY have a water gap in the seed coat that opens in response to an environmental signal, thereby allowing water to enter. When disturbance brings seeds to the soil surface, temperatures that are higher than those in the soil can cause the water gap to open. Consequently, the water gap indirectly serves as a depth sensor. A challenge for the future is to use information about buried weed seeds to better manage weeds in crops, and modeling is an important step in that direction.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				MAY-JUN	2006	54	3					549	557		10.1614/WS-05-034R.1							WOS:000238440200024						
J	Davis, AS				Davis, AS			When does it make sense to target the weed seed bank?	WEED SCIENCE					Seed Bank Symposium	2004	Columbus, OH	N Cent Weed Sci Soc				Weed seeds initiate most weed invasions of arable fields, yet there is relatively little information on the value of managing weed seed banks. Matrix population models were used to examine the relative importance of managing weed seed banks, in relation to other life stages, for four model weed species with varying life histories. Simulations for giant foxtail and common lambsquarters, summer annual weeds of arable fields; garlic mustard, an obligate biennial invasive weed of temperate forests; and Canada thistle, a perennial weed of pastures and arable fields, were run under conditions of varying population density and efficacy of seedling control. The models were subjected to elasticity analysis to determine what happened to weed populations when different life stages were targeted. Losses from the dormant seed bank were most important for summer annual weeds, of intermediate importance for biennial weeds, and of low importance for perennial weeds. More effort is needed to develop weed seed-bank management techniques for summer annual weed species as part of integrated weed management systems.

Published and unpublished experimental data were used to parameterize a simulation model for a number of crop-weed combinations. Sensitivity analyses of models for giant foxtail in corn and soybean indicated that factors related to seed availability were more important in determining overall seed losses due to predation than those related to seed demand. Delaying harvest date and destroying unshed weed seeds collected at harvest emerged as promising strategies to reduce seed input into the seed bank. The role of plant debris in hiding weed seeds from predators was ambiguous and requires further investigation. Estimates of overall seed losses due to predation based on model simulations in various crops and cropping systems indicated that weed seed predation could serve as an important tool in ecological weed management.

WEED SCIENCE					Seed Bank Symposium	2004	Columbus, OH	N Cent Weed Sci Soc				Reduction of seed-bank persistence is an important goal for weed management systems. Recent interest in more biological-based weed management strategies has led to closer examination of the role of soil microorganisms. Incidences of seed decay with certain weed species occur in the laboratory; however, their persistence in soil indicates the presence of yet-unknown factors in natural systems that regulate biological mechanisms of seed antagonism by soil microorganisms. A fundamental understanding of interactions between seeds and microorganisms will have important implications for future weed management systems targeting seed banks. Laboratory studies demonstrate susceptibility to seed decay among weed species, ranging from high (velvetleaf) to very low (giant ragweed). Microscopic examinations revealed. dense microbial assemblages formed whenever seeds were exposed to soil microorganisms, regardless of whether the outcome was decay. Microbial communities associated with seeds of four weed species (woolly cupgrass, jimsonweed, Pennsylvania smartweed, and velvetleaf) were distinct from one another. The influence of seeds on microbial growth is hypothesized to be due to nutritional and surface-attachment opportunities. Data from velvetleaf seeds suggests that diverse assemblages of bacteria can mediate decay, whereas fungal associations may be more limited and specific to weed species. Though microbial decay of seeds presents clear opportunities for weed biocontrol, limited success is met when introducing exogenous microorganisms to natural systems. Alternatively, a conservation approach that promotes the function of indigenous natural enemies through habitat or cultural management may be more promising. A comprehensive ecological understanding of the system is needed to identify methods that enhance the activities of microorganisms. Herein, we provide a synthesis of the relevant literature available on seed microbiology; we describe some of the major challenges and opportunities encountered when studying the in situ relationships between seeds and microorganisms, and present examples from studies by the ARS Invasive Weed Management Unit.

Foraging beetles encounter both freshly dispersed and seed exhumed from the soil bank. The predation oil seed from the soil bank has never been Studied and the effect of burial on seed acceptability is unknown. The preferences of two generalist granivorous carabids, Harpalus addinis and Pseudoophonus rufipes, were investigated by offering them fresh (stored frozen after dispersal) and buried (for 6 months in the soil under field conditions) seed of six common weed species. Significantly more of the buried seed of Tripleurospermum inodorum and significantly less of that of Taraxacum officinale was eaten than fresh seed. For four other weed species the consumption of both kinds of seed did not differ. The preferences were similar in both species of carabid. The change in preference probably Occurred because the seed of T officinale was partially decayed and the repellent surface of T inodorum seed abraded. Provided the seed in the soil batik does not decay it may have a similar or better food value for carabids than fresh seed.

J	Peco, B; Sanchez, AM; Azcarate, FM				Peco, B; Sanchez, AM; Azcarate, FM			Abandonment in grazing systems: Consequences for vegetation and soil	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Many dehesa zones in marginal areas are suffering from the abandonment of traditional farming practices. Herbivore grazing affects grassland dynamics, changing the species colonisation and extinction relationships via consumption, mechanical disturbance, seed dispersal and altered soil fertility due to dung-borne nutrient input. This paper analyses changes to floristic composition, species richness and heterogeneity as well as soil and light resources in relation to grazing abandonment in two characteristic topography-related types of dehesa habitat (upper slope and lower slope grasslands). Vegetation surveys were undertaken using five replicates in each habitat type in grazed and abandoned grasslands in the Guadarrama range in Central Spain with distric cambisol soils. Additional measurements of light and soil parameters were also undertaken. The results show an effect of grazing on resource availability. In general there was a smaller proportion of fine matter (clay), organic matter, total nitrogen, assimilable potassium and readily available water in abandoned as opposed to grazed zones. We did not find any effect of grazing on phosphorous availability. Abandonment reduces light availability at ground level in lower slope grasslands (wet meadows) but does not produce a significant reduction in upper slope (driest) grasslands, although there is an increased spatial heterogeneity in the availability of light associated with the presence of scattered shrubs. While the total number of species in abandoned zones did not significantly differ from grazed zones, floristic composition changed dramatically with abandonment in both habitat types, with less than 50% of common species. Also, floristic heterogeneity at the small scale increased with abandonment. Designers of agri-environmental policies applied to Mediterranean grasslands should be aware of the risk of widespread grazing abandonment and promote the diversification of grazing regimes across the landscape to maximize species diversity and take advantage of the benefits of low-density grazing in other functions of the ecosystem such as their productivity and stability.

J	Cueto, VR; Marone, L; De Casenave, JL				Cueto, VR; Marone, L; De Casenave, JL			Seed preferences in sparrow species of the Monte desert, Argentina: Implications for seed-granivore interactions	AUK												We assessed seed preference in four species of sparrows that are common to the central Monte desert of Argentina. Our hypotheses are that (1) sparrows always prefer grass over forb seeds and (2) different species of sparrows show the same preferences when consuming seeds. We presented seeds from eight species of plants (four grasses and four forbs) in both choice and nonchoice experiments. In general, sparrow species preferred grass over forb seeds, though one of them (Rufous-collared Sparrow [Zonotrichia capensis]) included one forb species (Parthenium hysterophorus) among its preferred seed items. Among grass seeds, sparrows avoided or showed less preference for the tiny seeds of Sporobolus cryptandrus, which suggests that seed weight may affect seed choice among grasses. Avoidance of most forb species, by contrast, could not be associated with seed size, probably because of the presence of unpalatable or toxic compounds in forb seeds. Experimental evidence suggests that the main feeding pressure of sparrows is clearly directed to grass seeds, which coincides with reported information on bird diet. Results support assertions that sparrows can cause a negative effect on the composition and abundance of grass seeds in the soil seed-bank, a necessary condition for birds in playing a significant role on grass population dynamics in the central Monte desert of Argentina.																	0004-8038					APR	2006	123	2					358	367		10.1642/0004-8038(2006)123[358:SPISSO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000237442500006

Weeds are major contributors to the loss of diversity of native species. We examined the hypothesis that an increase in the availability of nitrogen (N) may be responsible for the increase in weed abundance. In a small field trial, nitrogen availability was greater in areas invaded by weeds and weeds had greater nitrate reductase activity than native species. Both invaded and uninvaded areas were well-supplied with weed seed, although the composition of the seed bank varied greatly between sites. Diaspores of the weed Romulea rosea were abundant in uninvaded sites while those of Ehrharta erecta and Ehrharta longiflora were abundant in invaded sites. The abundance of weed diaspores suggested that increased N availability may be a precondition for invasion. Formation of a dense litter layer by senescent weeds is likely to promote the capture and retention of N added from anthropogenic sources including air pollution and overland flow from nearby roads and drainage channels.				adams, mark/H-1303-2012; adams, mark/P-4028-2019; Adams, Mark/H-1303-2012	adams, mark/0000-0002-8154-0097; adams, mark/0000-0002-8154-0097; Adams, Mark/0000-0001-8989-508X												1442-9985	1442-9993				APR	2006	31	2					262	270		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01575.x							WOS:000235693400014

The seeds are structurally adapted for wind dispersal but little is known about their fate after dispersal. Some studies of seed viability in situ indicate survival for up to two years in temperate orchid species. Seeds stored in the laboratory may last much longer. We investigated seed viability of seven North American orchid species with seed packets buried in a range of soil and wood substrates within their natural habitats. In Goodyera pubescens most seeds germinated within one year. Four other species continued to germinate sparsely during the observation period, but after almost seven years many seeds were still viable. In one species, Liparis liliifolia, seeds that had been in situ for four years had germination rates as high as 68% when sown in vitro with a compatible fungus. The remaining two species did not germinate during the observation period but the seeds were judged to be intact and tested positively for viability after four years in the ground. These observations are interpreted as different species-specific strategies for in situ germination and their seed bank potential is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Of the nine sites where it has been collected, five are extirpated and the status of two of the populations is uncertain. There are two extant populations; some of the other sites may contain the species in the seed bank. Some of the sites are protected to a certain extent from direct habitat destruction by their remote location, although introduced herbaceous species may pose a serious threat by preventing the establishment of the species at other sites.

J	Boutin, C				Boutin, Celine			Comparison of the vegetation and seedbanks of soybean fields, adjacent boundaries, and hedgerows in Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Patterns of plant assemblages in habitats located within agroecosystems are poorly understood. A study of the seedbank and standing vegetation in 10 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields, their adjacent boundaries, and adjoining woody hedgerows was undertaken in Ontario. The objective was to examine the composition of plants of conservation value and weedy species in these habitats. The seedbank of each habitat was determined from soil cores in quadrats located at regular intervals along transects, using the seedling emergence method in the greenhouse. The vegetation was surveyed in plots adjacent to the seedbank sampling areas. There was no significant difference in total species richness of vegetation or the seedbank among habitat types. However, there was a marked difference in species composition. In the seedbank, no difference in weed species richness among habitats was observed. In vegetation, however, fields harboured significantly more weedy species than adjacent boundaries and hedgerows. The dissimilarity between the seedbank and the vegetation was confirmed in detrended correspondence analyses, which showed that hedgerow vegetation, and to a lesser extent boundary vegetation, differed from field vegetation and all the habitats of the seedbank. The analysis of soil properties indicated that organic matter and nutrient levels were often higher in hedgerows than in fields. It can be concluded that hedgerows are valuable habitats for plant diversity and that weed species represent a minor component of their overall vegetation composition.																	0008-4220					APR	2006	86	2					557	567		10.4141/P05-129							WOS:000240051500032

Replicated experiments were conducted over a 4-year period in two apple orchards of Southern Quebec, Canada. Weed communities were monitored within quadrats and soil samples were collected to estimate the soil weed seed bank. Emergence cages and sticky traps were used in each plot to monitor emerging plum curculio or apple sawfly adults. Newly installed cellulose sheets provided adequate weed control throughout the summer and fall. However, weeds present on the cellulose sheets the following spring were attributed to the germination and establishment of weed seedlings in depressions in the sheets where organic matter had accumulated. The use of cellulose sheets reduced the accumulation of weed seeds in the soil. Cellulose sheets significantly reduced plum curculio and apple sawfly populations, but not consistently. The cellulose sheets under investigation biodegraded within I year of use, and accumulated debris and water in depressions on their surface. Loss of integrity of the cellulose barrier and variable suitability of fruit debris as an overwintering refuge may explain the variation in control success of cellulose sheets for both insect species.

Accordingly, methods to accelerate forest recovery must address multiple impediments. Here, we evaluated the ability of "tree islands" to serve as "recruitment foci" 2 in a two-year study at three sites in northern Honduras. Islands of three sizes (64, 16, and 4 m) and at two distances to secondary forest (20 and 50 m) were created by planting 2 m tall vegetative stakes of two native species: Gliricidia sepium (Fabaceae) and Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae), each in monoculture. Open-pasture "islands" of equal sizes served as controls. Tree islands reduced temperature and light (PAR) extremes as compared to open pasture, creating a microenvironment more favorable to seedling establishment. Seed-dispersing birds (quantified at one site only) showed an overwhelming preference for islands; 160 visits were recorded to islands compared with one visit to open pasture. Additionally, frugivores visited large islands more often, and for longer time periods, than small islands, thereby increasing the likelihood of a dispersal event there. In total, 144 140 seeds belonging to 186 species were collected in islands; more than 80% were grasses. Tree islands increased zoochorous tree seed rain; seed density and species richness were greater in tree islands than in open pasture, and large islands had greater seed density than smaller islands (Gliricidia only), suggesting that they are more effective for restoration. Distance to forest did not affect seed rain. A total of 543 seedlings and 41 species established in islands; > 85% were zoochorous. Seedling density did not differ among treatments (mean 0.2 seedlings/m(2) for islands vs. 0.1 seedlings/m(2) for pasture), although an increasing trend in tree islands over the course of two years suggests that seedling recruitment is accelerated there. Lastly, similar seedling densities were censused in the I m perimeter surrounding islands, suggesting that islands can expand outward into pasture. Planting vegetative stakes to create tree islands in pastures accelerates forest recovery by overcoming a number of impediments, and presents a simple, broadly applicable alternative for facilitating forest regeneration in abandoned pastures.

J	Miller, SJ; Wardrop, DH; Mahaney, WM; Brooks, RR				Miller, SJ; Wardrop, DH; Mahaney, WM; Brooks, RR			A plant-based index of biological integrity (IBI) for headwater wetlands in central Pennsylvania	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Vascular plants are quickly emerging as one of the best indicators of human-mediated disturbances in the environment. We developed a plant-based index of biological integrity (IBI) to evaluate headwater wetland condition in response to anthropogenic disturbances in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of central Pennsylvania. To construct the 1131, we evaluated 50 attributes of the plant community, including species richness, diversity, and evenness. Disturbance was quantified for each site using information on surrounding land use, buffer characteristics, and an assessment of potential site stressors. Ecological dose-response curves were then plotted to evaluate the relationship between each attribute and the disturbance score. Eight attributes showed a consistent and strong response to disturbance and were selected as metrics: adjusted FQAl, % cover of tolerant plant species, % annual species, % non-native species, % invasive species, % trees, % vascular cryptogams, and % cover of Phalaris arundinacea. All metrics were highly and significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with disturbance as were IBI scores. To test the IBI, we used data from 47 sites collected as part of the Juniata Wetland Monitoring Project. The metrics and 1131 scores for this data set were also significantly correlated with disturbance. Although, to date, very few plant-based IBIs are in use, studies from Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Ohio, as well as our study in Pennsylvania demonstrate the efficacy of plant community measures in assessing the overall condition of wetlands.

Knowledge of the regulatory effects of the crop canopy on weed seed germination is necessary to understand fully the behaviour of weed seed banks during a crop cycle. It is well known that canopy presence interferes with seed germination through modifications to the light and thermal environment, but the changing effect of a growing canopy has not been assessed, thus precluding the identification of shading-intensity thresholds for triggering the different types of canopy-detection mechanisms in different seed populations. 2. Field experiments were performed with artificially modified thermal and light environments, using two types of seed banks (seeds buried or located at the soil surface). Conditions below a wheat canopy were modified to match light and thermal conditions prevailing on bare soil (i.e. soil without vegetation). 3. Most weed emergence patterns during the early stages of crop establishment were not modified by the thermal regime produced by the incipient canopy compared with a bare soil control. However, the reduction of the red : far-red ratio from the bare soil value of 1.2-0.9 below the wheat canopy reduced germination of some weed species located at the soil surface, and the effect could by reversed by far-red filters. 4. The weed Galinsoga parviflora developed two generations during the crop cycle. The modified light and thermal environments beneath an establishing wheat canopy was not sufficient to inhibit the germination of Galinsoga parviflora, even if seeds were located at the soil surface. Only for seeds of the second generation, dispersed from seeds of the first plant generation, was there sufficient modification of the photothermal environment below the wheat canopy to interfere with dormancy termination. 5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding seed responses to modifications in the photothermal environment below a crop canopy (e.g. wheat crop) should allow us to improve weed management strategies by manipulating crop canopy attributes. This could be achieved by modification of sowing date, crop density, spatial arrangement and genotype. For example, increasing the crop plant density would diminish the number of weeds emerging during the first phase of crop establishment. This strategy would be appropriate where weed seeds are predominantly located at the soil surface, typically found in a no-till cropping system.																	0021-8901					APR	2006	43	2					227	236		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01140.x							WOS:000236396100003						
J	Krauss, SL; He, TH; Lamont, BB; Miller, BP; Enright, NJ				Krauss, SL; He, TH; Lamont, BB; Miller, BP; Enright, NJ			Late Quaternary climate change and spatial genetic structure in the shrub Banksia hookeriana	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Spatial genetic variation within species is influenced by both contemporary and historical factors. We attempted to assess the impact of increased aridity and lower temperatures associated with the last glacial maximum on possible refugia and the structuring of genetic variation in Banksia hookeriana, a shrub species restricted to deep sands on the Eneabba sandplain and adjacent Gingin Scarp/Dandaragan Plateau, centred 300 km north of Perth, Western Australia. We used optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to estimate the last time these sands were mobile, as well as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to infer spatial patterns and the phylogeographical history of genetic variation among 15 populations of B. hookeriana. While genetic variation at the species level was high, with 96.6% of 238 AFLP markers polymorphic, average within population gene diversity was low (H-pop = 0.16). Of the total genetic variation, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) partitioned 70% within populations, 24% among populations within substrate and 6% between substrates. There was an isolation-by-distance effect among populations within the same substrate, but not across substrates, and ordination highlighted genetic differentiation between the sandplain and scarp/plateau populations. A neighbour-joining tree identified the sandplain populations as a distinct clade, with the exception of the most northern sandplain population, which clustered with two northern and eastern plateau populations. The most southern plateau populations formed a clade sister to the sandplain clade. OSL dating of sand at six extant populations suggested that dunes were last mobile 15000-35000 years ago, with no clear difference in the ages of sandplain and plateau dunes. These data are consistent with a historical scenario of (re) colonization from isolated refugia of smaller populations either within the patchily vegetated sandplain and/or refugia at the northern, eastern and southern sandplain/scarp margins following postglacial climate amelioration and dune stabilization. Historic interpretations were confounded by the possible effects of long-distance dispersal, natural selection by substrate, and weak and/or ancient introgression with the sister species, Banksia prionotes.

J	Garnier, A; Lecomte, J				Garnier, A; Lecomte, J			Using a spatial and stage-structured invasion model to assess the spread of feral populations of transgenic oilseed rape	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					4th International Workshop on Environmental Applications of Machine Learning (EAML)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2004	Bled, SLOVENIA					The risk of roadside verge invasion by transgenic plants is favoured when a cultivated species can persist outside fields as feral populations. we chose oilseed rape as a model species to evaluate the spread of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) feral populations under selection pressure (herbicide spraying) in the medium term. We developed a stepwise invasion model that combines stage-structured dynamics (via a leslie matrix) and seed dispersal (via a mixture of two kernels) within an integro-differential equation. Modelling choices were made to conform to our intention to obtain methodological insight about the necessity to integrate long-distance seed dispersal in models of gene flow among oilseed rape. We thus assumed that roadside verges are a one-dimensional and uniformly suitable habitat and that events of dispersal and demography are deterministic. We performed elasticity analyses of population growth rate and invasion speed to highlight the determinants of population demography and spread. Rare events of long-distance dispersal controlled population spread. The risk of road verge invasion by feral populations of GMHT oilseed rape under selection pressure is thus real and does exist, since it was proved experimentally that oilseed rape can be dispersed by vehicles. Models of oilseed rape should then include long-distance seed dispersal otherwise they would underestimate feral population spread. Population growth rate and invasion speed depended on the same demographic transitions, i.e. those including local recruitment (local production of new individuals), but not on the persistence of seeds in the seed bank. Therefore, plant sterilisation would be more efficient to limit feral population spread than selection of cultivars without seed dormancy The assumptions made about habitat continuity and homogeneity were consistent in the framework of this stepwise approach. However, integrating habitat heterogeneity and stochasticity would improve this invasion model.

However, present approaches generally focus upon the biophysical characteristics of habitats and sites, and tend to ignore the social values associated with landscapes and habitat features. As a result current approaches only partially resolve the problems we face when dealing with a multifunctional landscape. In this paper, we examine how these limitations of current approaches may be overcome. The paper shows that present approaches to suitability modelling can be broadened by linking them to ideas about natural capital and landscape function. The approach is illustrated by means of a case study from the South Downs of England. It is suggested that by using the approach to model the spatial aspects of the natural capital associated with a given landscape, we may provide the user community with a framework that more fully addresses management issues that arise in the context of a sustainable, multifunctional landscape. In the case of the South Downs we show that restoration strategies that seek to take account of the multiple functions of downland differ from those which focus exclusively on enhancing or restoring the biodiversity of these areas.

Two kinds of experiments were performed to test the role of fire and environmental heterogeneity on germination. The first experiment tested the effect of environmental conditions (constant and alternating temperatures, cold stratification and light). The second one tested the effects of fire and high temperatures (dry and moist heat) on germination. Seeds of Dahlia were indifferent to light. The seeds showed physiological dormancy, which was lost by after-ripening or by gibberellins. During simulated fires, dry seeds tolerated high temperatures of short duration and also withstood prolonged exposure to 60 degrees C. Dry heat treatment reduced the mechanical restriction for embryo growth in dormant seeds. Ash and prolonged exposure to moist heat inhibited germination. Exogenous gibberellins reversed the deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to moist heat. The effect of cold stratification was related to the seeds' physiological stage and to light conditions; stratification in the dark reduced germination Seeds of D. coccinea could tolerate, evade, or be slightly favored by the effects of low intensity fires occurring in their habitat. Seed responses to treatments suggest that the spatially heterogeneous lava field could provide a wide variety of micro-sites where physiological dormancy could be broken and during fires seeds could maintain their viability and subsequently germinate and/or develop a seed bank.

J	Hyatt, LA; Araki, S				Hyatt, LA; Araki, S			Comparative population dynamics of an invading species in its native and novel ranges	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Although the ecology of many exotic invaders has been intensively examined in the novel range, few studies have comparatively explored how population dynamics differ in native and novel parts of an invading plants' range. The population dynamics of mile-a-minute weed, Polygonum perfoliatum L., was explored in both the native (Japan) and novel (northeastern USA) portions of its range and evaluated using periodic matrix models. Projected per capita population growth rate (lambda) varied within and between native and novel range populations. Surprisingly, five of the six populations in the novel range were projected to fail to replace themselves (lambda<1) while only two of the four native range populations were projected to decline, although these projections had wider confidence intervals than in the novel habitat. While changes in germination, survivorship, fecundity and seed banking would have equivalent effects on population growth in the invasive habitat, small increases in plant survivorship would greatly increase lambda in native populations. The differences between native and novel population growth rates were driven by lower adult survival in the native range caused by annual flooding and higher fecundity. Simulation analyses indicated that a 50% reduction in plant survival would be required to control growing populations in the novel range. Further comparative studies of other invading species in both their native and novel ranges are needed to examine whether the high per capita population growth and strong regulatory effects of adult survival in the native habitat are generally predictive of invasive behavior in novel habitats.																	1387-3547					MAR	2006	8	2					261	275		10.1007/s10530-004-5572-9							WOS:000234309500014

J	Martinez-Ghersa, MA; Ghersa, CM				Martinez-Ghersa, MA; Ghersa, CM			The relationship of propagule pressure to invasion potential in plants	EUPHYTICA												The invasive potential of a species can be assessed by propagule pressure, which measures the chances for propagules of a species to find a suitable habitat for establishment and reproduction. Seeds, fruits, and vegetative structures that contribute to the propagule pressure are morphologically, physiologically and genetically different from one another, thus each kind should have a specific way of contributing to a successful invasion. In this paper we review plant traits that contribute to the propagule pressure. Seed production provides an estimate of the potential multiplication rate of the weed. However, it is gap-sensing mechanisms of seeds based on dormancy termination and germination requirements, which significantly contribute to the naturalization and invasion processes assuring a successful seedling establishment in environments of high competition. Dispersal of propagules reduces competition, mating with a sibling, and subsequent inbreeding depression, and increases colonization opportunities and range of expansion. Some of those benefits can be achieved in a population by existence of dormancy mechanisms and thus, the existence of a seed bank. Finally, vegetative propagation may ensure expansion of local populations when seedling establishment is low. Broadening the scope of traits that are considered in the breeding programs aimed at commercial production of plant propagules, to include those related to propagule pressure, is essential for adequate evaluation of invasive potential.																	0014-2336					MAR	2006	148	1-2					87	96		10.1007/s10681-006-5943-7							WOS:000238016900008

In a field experiment in a large recent boreal forest fire in central Quebec, we used 24 paired salvaged and non-salvaged stands to test the effect of salvage on the recruitment of two conifer species possessing an aerial seed bank (Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana). The seedbeds following salvage were, on average, more hospitable to germination, but, incongruously, engendered far lower regeneration densities. The poor recruitment on salvaged sites was due primarily to the loss of seeds following the immediate post-fire salvage, when cone-bearing branches were removed along with the trunks. By contrast, the density of the asexually-recruited Populus tremuloides was relatively unaffected. We suggest simple ways to modify current salvage procedures that would retard this transition from conifer to Populus forest, as well as leaving more wood in situ.

J	Olofsson, J				Olofsson, J			Short- and long-term effects of changes in reindeer grazing pressure on tundra heath vegetation	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Previous studies of plant-herbivore interactions have typically focused either on short-term or long-term effects. By directly comparing effects at different temporal scales, I studied whether short-term experiments provide good indications of the long-term effects of herbivory. I reciprocally transplanted turfs of tundra heath vegetation within areas covered by a long-term (40 years) reindeer manipulation experiment, in order to examine the effects of all possible permutations of light, moderate and heavy grazing pre- and post-transplantation. The effects of a short-term (three growing seasons) increase in reindeer grazing pressure gave good qualitative indications of most of the long-term effects of grazing on plant biomass, species richness, moss cover and lichen cover. In contrast, reducing grazing pressure on previously heavily grazed vegetation had no significant effects on any of these variables over the same time-scale. Although few effects on individual species were recorded from the short-term manipulations, all those that were significant were qualitatively similar to the long-term responses of the respective species to herbivory. The grass-dominated vegetation from the heavily grazed area changed little when grazing and trampling pressure were reduced for 3 years. In contrast, the dwarf shrub-dominated vegetation in the lightly grazed area changed rapidly into grasslands when the grazing pressure was enhanced. Re-establishment of dwarf shrubs appears to be both seed and microsite limited, but it appears that dwarf shrubs may be able to re-establish in previously heavily grazed vegetation in the absence of reindeer. Transitions from moss- or dwarf shrub-dominated ecosystems to grass-dominated ecosystems are currently occurring at different locations in boreal, arctic and alpine regions due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition and livestock grazing. This loss of habitat may be reversible, given a relatively long time frame.

J	Duncan, RS				Duncan, RS			Tree recruitment from on-site versus off-site propagule sources during tropical forest succession	NEW FORESTS												The management of successional forests has become an increasingly important tool for tropical forest restoration on disturbed lands. Successful management depends on understanding factors governing tree recruitment during succession. Recruits can be on-site propagules surviving disturbance (e.g. saplings) or seeds arriving after disturbance. Among disturbed sites, the importance of seed arrival from off-site should increase as availability of on-site propagules declines. This study examines how seed arrival from off-site seemed to influence natural forest regrowth on logged plantations in Uganda. Specifically, the effect of seed arrival from mammals (determined directly) and birds (determined inferentially) was estimated in two plantations with high and three plantations with low quantities of saplings surviving logging. In both plantation types, first-year recruitment seemed to originate from on-site (seed bank and sprouts from damaged trees) and off-site sources (seed-dispersing birds). Recruitment declined 2-3 years after logging in all plantations despite high densities of seed-dispersing birds. Recruitment was generally greater in plantations with low initial quantities of on-site propagules, and by 4-6 years forest structure was similar between plantation types. Recruitment was dominated by bird-dispersed species, rather than mammal- or wind-dispersed species. Taken together, these results illustrate that disturbed areas with low initial on-site propagule availability have much potential for forest regrowth.																	0169-4286					MAR	2006	31	2					131	150		10.1007/s11056-004-5395-7							WOS:000235706000002						
J	Hunter, ME; Omi, PN				Hunter, Molly E.; Omi, Philip N.			Seed supply of native and cultivated grasses in pine forests of the southwestern United States and the potential for vegetation recovery following wildfire	PLANT ECOLOGY												In this study we examined seed supply (seed banks and seed rain) and vegetation of seeded cultivated grasses and naturally occurring native grasses following a wildfire in northern New Mexico, USA. We specifically examined density of native and cultivated grass seeds and plants in areas of high, moderate, and low fire severity. We also examined the similarity between density of native and cultivated grass seeds to density of above ground plants. Density of native grass seed per square meter was higher in areas that burned under low fire severity (85.18 +/- 44.83) compared to areas of moderate (18.52 +/- 11.26) and high (7.41 +/- 4.90) fire severity; however, differences were not statistically significant due, in part, to the high error associated with estimates. Density of cultivated grass seed per square meter was higher than that of native grass seed in areas of high (439.60 +/- 117.98) and moderate (437.02 +/- 146.50) fire severity, areas that were seeded with cultivated grasses after the wildfire for erosion control. Density of seeded grass plants per square meter was also higher than that of native grass plants in areas of high (18.78 +/- 4.59 versus 0.33 +/- 0.24) and moderate (8.22 +/- 1.76 versus 0.22 +/- 0.15) fire severity. There was a higher correspondence between the density of cultivated grass seeds and plants (highest value 0.32 +/- 0.11) compared to density of native grass seeds and plants (highest value 0.05 +/- 0.04). The high density of seeds, plants, and correspondence indicated that seeds from cultivated grasses are more likely to establish as post-fire vegetation than seeds from native grasses. Seeding with cultivated grasses following a wildfire may slow or inhibit recovery of native grasses in the short term. Longer-term implications for site occupancy deserve further study.																	1385-0237					MAR	2006	183	1					1	8		10.1007/s11258-005-9000-8							WOS:000238158000001						
J	Cuevas, JG; Le Quesne, C				Cuevas, Jaime G.; Le Quesne, Carlos			Low vegetation recovery after short-term cattle exclusion on Robinson Crusoe Island	PLANT ECOLOGY												Livestock browsing and grazing are considered serious threats to the conservation of the Juan Fernandez Islands' flora, Chile. Nowadays the elimination of grazing by cattle is very difficult. In order to prevent the entrance of cattle into the native forests, an 8.3 km-long fence was established on the main island (Robinson Crusoe). The response of the vegetation was evaluated during 27 months of exclusion. The changes in abundances and composition of species were monitored in 12 permanent plots, each of 25 m(2), located in ungrazed and grazed areas. We expected an increase in plant height and total ground cover in the ungrazed area, and also a directional compositional change towards forest species. We found five different patterns of variation or non-variation for the 22 species observed: (i) one species (Acaena argentea) diminished in abundance in the ungrazed area; (ii) another one (Conium maculatum) increased in the ungrazed area; (iii) one species (Vulpia bromoides) increased in the grazing area; and some species displayed no net variation, but they showed (iv) a nearly constant occurrence, or (v) they appeared and disappeared sporadically. Contrary to our hypothesis, the vegetation showed no net differences in cover on both sides of the fence. As expected, plant height increased in the ungrazed area. In this area, we detected no noteworthy changes in floristic composition towards forest species. On the contrary, four new pastureland species appeared outside of the exclusion area during the last year of evaluation. Other ungrazed sectors of the island showed qualitative differences from grazed sectors, such as major height and density of plants, and lower intensity of browsing, grazing, and trampling, attributable to a reduction of herbivorous pressure. The modest responses reported in this study could be related to the short lapse of time since the exclusion, soil compaction, overgrowth by a single species (A. argentea), great seasonal variations in different species' abundances, the reduction in the number of cattle grazing the area previous to the fence's installation, and persistent herbivory by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.). We conclude that the effect of grazing by cattle is less than expected, and that there are other factors that delay the recovery of the Juan Fernandez pasturelands.

Contrasting demographies and persistence of rare annual plants in highly variable environments	PLANT ECOLOGY												Spatial and temporal variation in critical life history traits differ markedly between two co-occurring, rare and endangered annual plants, Gilia tenuiflora arenaria and Chorizanthe pungens pungens, that have restricted, but overlapping geographic distributions in coastal habitats of central California, USA. Environmental variation was extreme during the 6-year study (1997-2002), with the greatest differences between an intense wet, warm El Nina year (1998), followed by a very dry, cool La Nina (1999). Both species have similar increases in adult survival and seed set with wetter, warmer weather in spring, but they differed in other traits: more Gilia germinated in years with high rainfall and temperature, while more Chorizanthe germinated in dry, cooler years; Gilia abundance increased with the number of years since the previous large El Nina event, while Chorizanthe abundance declined; and Gilia abundance was independent of the previous year's seed set, while Chorizanthe density was directly related to the previous year's seed set. The strong negative associations of Chorizanthe abundance with warm, wet weather and with time since the previous El Nina probably reflect the particular sequence of annual weather patterns from 1997 through 2002, especially the extremes in 1998 and 1999. Since it germinates readily in most years under a wide range of winter conditions and does not develop a long-lived seed bank, Chorizanthe seedling abundance reflects recent additions and depletions of its seed bank, rather than prevailing weather, per se. In contrast, Gilia seeds may remain in the seed bank for many years, until relatively rare winter conditions trigger significant germination. These species-specific demographies enhance persistence and coexistence of these species, but the mechanisms differ from each other and from those described for annuals in other highly variable environments.

An experiment was initiated in northern Arizona in 1994 to evaluate long-term ecosystem responses to 3 restoration treatments: 1) thinning from below (thinning), 2) thinning from below plus forest floor manipulation with periodic prescribed burning (composite), and 3) an untreated control. Results focus on total herbaceous and functional-group standing crop response to these restoration treatments. Pretreatment data were collected in 1992 and posttreatment responses were measured from 1994 through 2004. Total herbaceous standing crop was significantly higher on the 2 treated areas than on the control over the entire posttreatment period, but did not differ between the thinning and composite treatments. Plant functional groups responded differently to treatments and to drought. In general, the graminoid standing crop responded within several years after the initial treatments and continued to increase through time, until a series of severe droughts reduced standing crop to pretreatment levels. C-3 graminoids dominated the standing-crop response, of which bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey ssp. elymoides) was the primary contributor. C-4 graminoids had a minimal response to restoration treatments, possibly because they were less abundant before the experiment began or because they were adversely affected by autumn burning. Legumes and forbs exhibited a 4-5 year lag before responding to the thinning and composite treatments. Annual and biennial plants showed a large biomass increase approximately 5 years after implementation of the composite treatment. The restoration goal of optimizing herbaceous standing crop must be weighed against the competing goals of increasing the abundance of specific functional groups, increasing biodiversity or rare plants, and managing invasive plant species.

J	Eldridge, DJ; Costantinides, C; Vine, A				Eldridge, DJ; Costantinides, C; Vine, A			Short-term vegetation and soil responses to mechanical destruction of rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) warrens in an Australian box woodland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												We studied the impact of disturbance by rabbits on plants and soils along a gradient out from the center of ripped rabbit warrens in an Australian semiarid woodland. Five years after the warrens were ripped, the impact of rabbits was still apparent. The cover of bare soil declined, and the cryptogam cover increased with increasing distance from the warren mound. However, litter cover, plant cover, and plant diversity remained unchanged with increasing distance from the mounds. Differences in plant composition were apparent with increasing distance from the mounds, with three species, Schismus barbatus, Salsola kali var. kali, and Chenopodium melanocarpum dominating the mounds, whereas the perennial grass Austrostipa scabra dominated the nonwarren control surfaces. Two species, Crassula sieberana and S. barbatus, dominated the active soil seed bank on ripped warrens. The mounds had the lowest number of species in the soil seed bank, whereas the warren edge microsite had the greatest. Ripped and unripped warrens differed substantially in their complement of species, and ripped warrens contained an order of magnitude fewer active warren entrances compared with unripped warrens. Ripped warrens also had significantly more plant cover than unripped warrens. Taken together, our results reinforce the view that rabbits have a destructive effect on surface soils and vegetation in semiarid woodlands and suggest that restoration of the original woodland vegetation after warren ripping is likely to be a slow and ongoing process.

J	Kiehl, K; Thormann, A; Pfadenhauer, J				Kiehl, K; Thormann, A; Pfadenhauer, J			Evaluation of initial restoration measures during the restoration of calcareous grasslands on former arable fields	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												In 1993, experiments on the restoration of calcareous grasslands on ex-arable fields were started in order to provide new habitats for species of a small nature reserve with ancient grasslands north of Munich (Germany). The effects of diaspore transfer by the application of seed-containing hay on vegetation establishment were studied on restoration fields with and without topsoil removal for 5 years. The aim of the study was to assess plant diversity for the evaluation of restoration success by different methods including determination of species with viable seeds in the hay by germination tests, phenological investigations on hay-transfer source sites at the time of harvest, and vegetation analyses on the restoration sites. Total seed content of the hay and the number and composition of plant species with viable seeds were affected by the time of harvesting and differed between a site which had been used as arable field until 1959 and ancient grassland sites. Nevertheless, the number of established hay-transfer species showed only few differences between restoration fields. The proportion of species transferred to restoration fields in relation to the number of species with viable seeds in the hay was between 69 and 89%. Five years after the hay transfer, the proportion of the established species was still between 58 and 76%. Up to now, topsoil removal had no significant effect on the number of established hay-transfer species. After triple hay application the absolute number of transferred grassland species was higher than on sites with single hay application, but restoration efficiency was lower because many of the species with viable seeds in the hay did not establish. In general, our results showed that the transfer of autochthonous hay is a successful method to overcome dispersal limitation in restoration projects.																	1061-2971					MAR	2006	14	1					148	156		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00115.x							WOS:000235096200018						
J	Batlla, D; Benech-Arnold, RL				Batlla, D; Benech-Arnold, RL			The role of fluctuations in soil water content on the regulation of dormancy changes in buried seeds of Polygonum aviculare L.	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												It has been hypothesized that fluctuations in soil water content may affect the dormancy status of weed seed banks under field conditions. In this paper, we present results showing that fluctuations in soil water content affect the dormancy status of buried seeds of Polygonum aviculare L. stored at dormancy-releasing temperatures. Effects of fluctuations in soil water content on the dormancy status of P. aviculare seeds were evaluated by comparing changes in the range of temperatures and water potentials permissive for germination, and in the sensitivity to fluctuating temperatures, between seeds subjected to a moist soil regime (MS) or to a fluctuating soil water content regime (FS). In comparison to the dormancy release pattern observed for seeds subjected to MS, seeds subjected to FS generally showed an increase in their dormancy level after periods of storage under dry soil conditions, and a decrease in their dormancy level after periods of storage under moist soil conditions. These effects were more pronounced during early stages of the storage period, producing larger changes in the thermal and water potential range for seed germination than in the sensitivity of seeds to fluctuating temperatures. Seeds subjected to FS generally exhibited a lower mean low-limit temperature, lower mean thermal time and hydrotime requirements for germination, and a higher proportion of the seed population with the capacity to germinate in situ, than seeds subjected to MS. The results obtained suggested that fluctuations in soil water content could be an additional factor affecting dormancy and weed emergence patterns under field conditions.																	0960-2585					MAR	2006	16	1					47	59		10.1079/SSR2005234							WOS:000235234900005						
J	Mohler, CL; Frisch, JC; McCulloch, CE				Mohler, CL; Frisch, JC; McCulloch, CE			Vertical movement of weed seed surrogates by tillage implements and natural processes	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Vertical position of weed seeds in the soil column is one of the critical factors governing the density of emerged seedlings, but data on movement of subsurface seeds and seed surrogates by tillage are limited. In this experiment ceramic beads were seeded at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 cm using specially constructed equipment. Plots were then tilled at right angles to the bead slots with either a moldboard plow, a chisel plow with curved blades, a chisel plow with straight blades, heavy tandem disks, a rotary tiller, or left untilled. Soil was sampled to determine bead positions. The probability matrix describing movement of beads from each soil layer to any other was estimated for each tillage regimen by maximum likelihood. Movement patterns for moldboard plow, the two chisel plow treatments, and disk and rotary tillage differed significantly. The difference between disking and rotary tillage was only marginally significant (0.05 < P < 0. 10), as was the difference between the two chisel treatments. The chisel, disk and rotary tillage treatments all buried at least 70% of surface beads to below 2 cm but they showed little vertical displacement of beads below 10 cm. For example, beads below 14 cm in the chisel treatments had a > 80% probability of remaining in at their original depth. Tillage by moldboard plow showed the expected soil inversion, but burial of surface beads was greater than return of buried beads to the surface. For example, the probability of a surface bead ending up below 10 cm was over 77% whereas the probability of a bead originally in the 14-18 cm layer moving to the top 10 cm was only 44%. Sampling of the no tillage and moldboard plow treatments the following spring showed an upward movement of beads by natural causes for beads below 14 cm. To allow flexibility in vertically structured population models, the movement probability matrices were fitted with a continuous model based on the beta distribution. The model showed that for a hypothetical uniformly distributed seed bank, 97% of seeds in the top 4 cut following moldboard plowing had arrived there from greater depths. In contrast, only about one third of seeds in the top 4 cm of soil after tillage by chisel, disk or rotary tiller arrived from deeper layers. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mickelson, JA; Grey, WE				Mickelson, JA; Grey, WE			Effect of soil water content on wild oat (Avena fatua) seed mortality and seedling emergence	WEED SCIENCE												Field experiments were established in fall 1999 and 2000 near Huntley, MT to determine the effects of soil water content on wild oat seed mortality and seedling emergence. Four supplemental irrigation treatments were implemented from June through September to establish plots with varying soil water content. Wild oat seed mortality during the summer increased linearly as soil water content increased. For seed banks established in 1999 (1999SB), seed mortality increased, on average, from 36 to 55% in 2000, and 15 to 55% in 2001 as soil water content increased from 6 to 24%. For seed banks established in 2000 (2000SB), seed mortality increased, on average, from 38 to 88% in 2001 and 53 to 79% in 2002 as soil water content increased from 6 to 24%. Increasing soil water content likely increased the activity of microorganisms chat cause mortality in wild oat seeds. The increasing seed mortality rates (due to increasing soil water content) resulted in greater annual declines of wild oat seed banks and 2-yr cumulative decline rates. Total season emergence percentage was not affected by irrigation treatment. Results show that weed seed bank decline is more rapid in moist than in dry soils and suggest that management practices that increase or conserve soil moisture will also increase the rate of wild oat seed bank decline.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	2006	54	2					255	262									WOS:000236728600009						
J	Martinkova, Z; Honek, A; Lukas, J				Martinkova, Z; Honek, A; Lukas, J			Seed age and storage conditions influence germination of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli).	WEED SCIENCE												Germination was investigated in 1-yr and 8-yr-old seed lots of barnyardgrass. Each seed lot was divided into a portion stored dry at 25 C (afterripening) and a portion buried in the field (stratification) in central Europe (latitude 50 degrees N, longitude 14 degrees E). The afterripened seed lost dormancy within 2 yr after dispersal, whereas buried seed passed through annual dormancy/nondormancy cycles. The seed was germinated at five constant temperatures between 17 and 35 C with an 18/6-h light/dark photoperiod. Germination was affected by both seed age and storage conditions. Germination percentage and rate in 8-yr-old afterripened and each of the stratified seed lots varied with temperature. Optimum temperatures for germination were between 27 and 31 C, and the range of adequate temperatures increased with seed age. A common base temperature for germination was 11.7 C. In 1-yr-old afterripened material, the proportion of germinating seed (< 5%) and germination rate were similar at all temperatures. Barnyardgrass thus revealed a plastic strategy of germination. Stratification during the first winter removed dormancy and allowed germination at a narrow range of temperatures. This constraint on optimum germination temperature decreased with increased seed age. Seedling emergence, thus, may vary according to whether seed population originates from the previous year or from old soil seed banks.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				MAR-APR	2006	54	2					298	304									WOS:000236728600014						
J	Virgona, S; Vaughton, G; Ramsey, M				Virgona, S; Vaughton, G; Ramsey, M			Habitat segregation of Banksia shrubs at Gibraltar Range National Park	PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES												Events during seedling recruitment affect species' distributions, causing habitat segregation of congeneric species within the same area. We documented the segregation of Banksia marginata and B. spinulosa var. neoanglica in adjacent swamp and woodland habitats at two sites by surveying adult and seedling distributions. We also examined seed banks and seed characters as factors contributing to segregation. Habitat segregation was pronounced, with 92% of B. marginata adults located in swamps and 98% of B. spinulosa adults located in woodlands. After fire, 84% of B. marginata seedlings were in swamps, but 10 months later this increased to 93%, indicating that although seeds dispersed to and germinated in adjacent woodlands, most seedlings failed to establish. Seedlings of B. spinulosa were confined to woodlands, indicating that seeds did not disperse into swamps or that, if they did, seeds failed to germinate or seedlings suffered early mortality. Canopy seed banks of both species were large (> 280 seeds/plant) and seeds of both species possess membranous wings, allowing dispersal between habitats. Overall, neither limited numbers of seeds nor limited seed dispersal are likely to cause habitat segregation. Instead, processes occurring during early seedling growth are probably more influential.																	0370-047X					FEB 23	2006	127						39	47									WOS:000237170200006						
J	Fomsgaard, IS				Fomsgaard, IS			Chemical ecology in wheat plant-pest interactions. How the use of modern techniques and a multidisciplinary approach can throw new light on a well-known phenomenon: Allelopathy	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												A new holistic approach on research into allelopathy was launched in the FATEALLCHEM project. The project was financed by the European Commission in the 5th Framework Programme and involved agronomists, biologists, analytical chemists, organic chemists, environmental chemists, ecotoxicologists, and modelers. Benzoxazinones from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were the main group of compounds studied in the project. The project showed that future assessments of an extensive use of allelopathic crops must include the development of validated analytical methods, considerations of relevant concentrations, studies on soil transformation, ecotoxicological studies on individual compounds and mixtures, evaluation on human and mammal toxicity, and joint effect studies on weeds, insects, and pathogens. The project results clearly showed the relevance of optimizing the exploitation of cereal benzoxazinones. Crop rotation is a very traditional practice, which was given less importance for decades but is now regaining its importance in agricultural practice as a means of controlling weed seed banks and soilborne diseases and pests. When using cereals as catch crops and green manure, the allelopathic properties of the cereals could now be much more extensively exploited, choosing varieties with optimal production of benzoxazinones and optimizing the time of sowing in relation to the formation of bioactive metabolites.

J	Hammerstrom, KK; Kenworthy, WJ; Fonseca, MS; Whitfield, PE				Hammerstrom, KK; Kenworthy, WJ; Fonseca, MS; Whitfield, PE			Seed bank, biomass, and productivity of Halophila decipiens, a deep water seagrass on the west Florida continental shelf	AQUATIC BOTANY												One of the largest contiguous seagrass ecosystems in the world is located on the shallow continental shelf adjacent to the west coast of Florida, USA and is comprised of seasonally ephemeral Halophila decipiens meadows. Little is known about the demography of the west Florida shelf H. decipiens, which may produce 4.56 x 10(8) g C day(-1) or more during the peak growing season. We documented seagrass distribution, biomass, and productivity, and density of sediment seed reserves, seedlings, flowers and fruits on the southeastern portion of the west Florida shelf by sampling along a transect at three stations in 10, 15, and 20 m water depth. Biomass, flower, fruit, seedling, and seed bank densities tended to be highest at stations in 10-15 m water depth and lowest at 20 m. Flowers and fruit were most prevalent during summer cruises (June and August 1999, July 2000). Seedling germination occurred during summer, fall (October 1999), and winter (January 2000) sampling events, with the highest seedling densities present during the winter. Seed bank density remained consistent through time. A Category I hurricane with sustained winds of 120 km h(-1) passed over the stations, but only limited impact on H. decipiens biomass was observed. The presence of a persistent seed bank provides for recovery after storm disturbance, annual reestablishment of populations, and continual maintenance of the 20,000 km(2) of deep water seagrass habitat present on the west Florida shelf.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Lakeshore marshes around Liangzi Lake, in the middle reach of the Yangtze River, China, experience annual changes of water level of c. 1.5 m. During the drawdown period, the vegetation is structured by helophytes and emergents; during the rainy season when the dams are closed (June-September) the marshes are flooded and their vegetation rapidly changes to be come dominated by submerged, floating-leaved and tall emergent species. The species composition and abundance of both the marsh seed bank and the vegetative propagule bank were compared with those of the drawdown and flooded vegetation types. These data provided a test of the predictive power of van der Valk's model of northern temperate seasonal vegetation change in a subtropical, freshwater wetland with cyclic vegetational change. The abundant species were detected in the propagule bank. The seed bank was found to determine the species richness of both types of the vegetation, whereas the vegetative propagule bank consisted of the dominants of the drawdown vegetation. Water depth conditions, and the composition of seed and vegetative propagules banks together determine the structure of the standing vegetation during drawdown and flooding. van der Valk's succession model was found to predict the seasonal vegetation change reasonably well. The Chi-square test showed no significant difference between predicted vegetation and actual vegetation in both drawdown and flooding periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

J	Nielsen, UN; Riis, T; Brix, H				Nielsen, UN; Riis, T; Brix, H			The importance of vegetative and sexual dispersal of Luronium natans	AQUATIC BOTANY												Luronium natans (L.) Rafin. is a very rare macrophyte even though it has the ability to grow in a wide variety of habitat types. Previous studies leave two possibilities for this pattern: the species has a poor ability to disperse and establish or it is unable to grow and develop a sustainable population after colonization. Experiments on establishment of shoots, seed bank dynamics, seed germination and genetic analysis (AFLP) were conducted to establish whether L. natans disperse to new habitats within hydrologically linked water systems by means of vegetative shoots or by seeds. Shoots had high ability to establish by roots (52% in autumn shoots), but only when subjected to water depths < 4 cm. Seeds of L natans has a high germinate rate (mean of 51-60%), and the density of seeds in the seed bank ranged from 635 to 3354 m(-2) during a year. Analysis of the genetic diversity showed that samples could be differentiated to individuals with higher diversity between populations than within population. Low ability of shoots to establish if not subjected to low water depth, high germination rate of seeds, substantial seed bank and a high genetic diversity all indicate that most colonization events depend on sexual reproduction. Genetic diversity in L. natans seems to depend on habitat type and management. Habitats subjected to high water velocities or management with weed cutting generally have a lower genetic diversity (5-6%) than habitats subjected to dredging (11 %), indicating that the latter habitats favor sexual reproduction.

The New England Wild Flower Society, which maintains a regional seed bank, developed a set of three complementary decision matrices in spreadsheet form by which to prioritize all occurrences of all state-listed rare plant species in New England in terms of their urgency and feasibility for collection. Data on 4333 occurrences, spanning 456 taxa, were collated from six state Natural Heritage Programs. The first decision matrix ranked taxa in terms of their amenability to storage or propagation at ex situ institutions, and determined whether any known New England occurrences were reproductive. The second matrix further ranked taxa in terms of their global and regional rarity and the viability and genetic and geographic representation of collections already present in the bank. The third matrix scored individual occurrences within each taxon in terms of the presence of imminent threat, reproductive status, vigor, protection status, potential genetic distance from other occurrences, availability of landowner permission, and their current status in the bank. Occurrences were then sorted in ascending order by total matrix score; those with low scores were at the top of the list for collection priority. 3743 occurrences were deemed eligible for collection. Scores ranged from 14.5 to 182, and were influenced most strongly by the number of occurrences per taxon. Clear breakpoints were apparent in the distribution of scores, with clusters of uncommon taxa at the low end of the scale and a long tail created by taxa with more numerous occurrences in New England. These breakpoints could potentially be used to prioritize groups of occurrences that should receive the first attention for collection, while postponing collection of higher-scoring groups. Fewer than 1% of occurrences were mis-classified, according to post hoc inspection. This simple set of decision matrices can be adapted by a wide range of institutions involved in ex situ conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The seed damaging fly, Ophiomyia lantanae is a widespread agent that infests the fruits and seeds of Lantana camara. Its effectiveness in reducing seed dispersal or seedling recruitment has not been comprehensively tested. We determined the effects of O. lantanae damage on fruit removal rates of L. camara in a field study. We also investigated recruitment responses (seed germination in growth cabinets and seedling emergence in pot trials) of two common L. camara biotypes, pink and pink-edged red (PER) to O. lantanae damage. We found that fewer damaged fruits were removed than undamaged fruits, suggesting that frugivores select against damaged fruit. In all recruitment experiments, the responses to damage were biotype dependent. In germination experiments, these differential responses were primarily due to significantly reduced germination of damaged PER seeds. Seedling emergence from pots of the PER biotype was also lower in damaged seeds (27.5%) than undamaged seeds (56.1%). In contrast, emergence increased with seed damage in the pink biotype, from 28.2 to 41.% O. lantanae damage significantly reduced seed mass only in the smaller seeded PER biotype. In the larger seeded pink biotype, it may have promoted seedling emergence by interfering with dormancy mechanisms. We also examined in situ seed banks at L. camara populations prior to peak seed production. Mean viable seed densities ranged from 78.6 to 402.8 seeds m(-2). Of these, non-dormant seeds comprised 24.6 to 98.2 seeds m(-2), suggesting that recruitment is unlikely to be seed limited. We conclude that while O. lantanae influences recruitment and dispersal processes, the magnitude of the responses measured are unlikely to greatly influence plant densities in south-east Queensland infestations.

J	Osem, Y; Perevolotsky, A; Kigel, J				Osem, Y; Perevolotsky, A; Kigel, J			Size traits and site conditions determine changes in seed bank structure caused by grazing exclusion in semiarid annual plant communities	ECOGRAPHY												1. Contrasting patterns of change in the seed bank of natural grasslands are frequently found in response to grazing by domestic herbivores. Here, we studied the hypotheses that a) patterns of change in seed bank density and composition in response to grazing depend on spatial variation in resource availability and productivity, and b) that variation among species in patterns of seed bank response to grazing is linked to differences in species size traits (i.e. size of plant, dispersal unit and seed). 2. Effects of sheep grazing exclusion on the seed bank were followed during five years in a semiarid Mediterranean annual plant community in Israel. Seed bank density and composition were measured in autumn, before the rainy season, inside and outside fenced exclosures in four neighboring topographic sites differing in vegetation characteristics, soil resources and primary productivity: Wadi (dry stream terraces, high productive site), Hilltop, South- and North-facing slopes (less productive sites). 3. Topographic sites differed in seed density (range ca 2500-18000 seed m(-2)) and in seed bank response to grazing exclusion. Fencing increased seed density by 78, 51 and 18% in the Wadi, South- and North-facing slopes, respectively, but had no effect in the Hilltop. At the species level, grazing exclusion interacted with site conditions in determining species seed bank density, with larger or opposite changes in the high productive Wadi compared to the other less productive sites. 4. Changes in seed bank structure after grazing exclusion were strongly related to species size traits. Grazing exclusion favored species with large size traits in all sites, while seed density of tiny species decreased strongly in the high productive Wadi. Species with medium and small size traits showed lesser or no responses. 5. The size of plants, dispersal units and seeds were strongly correlated to each other, thus confounding the evaluation of the relative importance of each trait in the response of species to grazing and site conditions. We propose that the relative importance of plant size vs seed size in the response to grazing changes with productivity level.																	0906-7590					FEB	2006	29	1					11	20		10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04283.x							WOS:000235099900002						
J	Gough, L				Gough, L			Neighbor effects on germination, survival, and growth in two arctic tundra plant communities	ECOGRAPHY												In relatively harsh environments such as arctic tundra, abiotic factors have traditionally been considered the primary determinants of community structure, overwhelming any effects of biotic interactions such as competition. Two common low arctic tundra types that differ in soil properties, moist acidic and moist non-acidic tussock tundra (MAT and MNT, respectively), occur in close proximity in northern Alaska. Several plant species occur in both communities with different relative abundance, while others are restricted to one. This study experimentally examined how neighboring vegetation affects germination, survival, and growth of species in these two communities that differ in soil pH, cation availability, and other characteristics. Germination of sown seeds was greater than background levels suggesting seed limitation may restrict recruitment of these clonal, perennial species. Germination of sown seeds was greater at both sites when both mosses and vascular plants had been removed compared to plots with intact vegetation. However, neighbors had almost no effect on survival and growth of adult transplants. Patterns of germination, survival and growth of several species differed depending on the community of origin and the community of destination of the seeds or transplanted adults. For example, transplants of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum grew better if they were from MAT, and this species germinated better when sown at MNT. Although of relatively short duration (three growing seasons), this study suggests that biotic interactions may affect local species composition by restricting germination and establishment in these two communities, but have less of an effect on adult plants. Not surprisingly, site-specific abiotic conditions also exhibit control over species occurrence and relative abundance. Without disturbance to clear bare ground for recruitment of new individuals, these populations for the most part must rely on clonal growth to persist.																	0906-7590					FEB	2006	29	1					44	56		10.1111/j.2005.0906-7590.04096.x							WOS:000235099900005						
J	Hosogi, D; Kameyama, A				Hosogi, D; Kameyama, A			Timing for the planting method using deciduous forest topsoil in suburban Tokyo, Japan	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The suitable time for planting using the topsoil of a warm temperate deciduous forest is discussed based on the germination characteristics of the soil seed bank. Forest topsoil was collected regularly over a 1-year period from a deciduous forest in suburban Tokyo, and seedling emergence in the outdoors was recorded immediately after collection. Many seedlings were observed from February to May, indicating that this is the best time for planting because this is when most buried seeds germinate. Additionally, it was inferred that buried seeds germinate immediately after planting during the period from February to October, although the quantity of seed germination varies according to the season. The method of evaluating the forest topsoil as a planting material is also discussed. The simple and preferred method of evaluation is to examine outdoor seedling emergence from February to May. Accurate evaluation during the summer and autumn months proved problematic. especially when counting tree seeds, and it was necessary to continue the evaluation into the following spring. A practical understanding of the timing of planting and the method of evaluating forest topsoil as a planting material is possible in warm temperate areas. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the present paper, the model was evaluated by comparing its simulated output to independent field observations, as a function of sowing/tillage date, seed depth, seed history and characteristics, soil climate and soil structure. The evaluation showed that the survival of the seed bank in top layers was systematically overestimated. In addition, some minor aspects were identified for future improvements, such as the pre-emergent seedling mortality in very compacted soil structures or germination rates of seeds that had not been previously stimulated by light. Despite these few shortcomings, the model simulates the timing and relative importance of the emergence flushes very well; in addition, the actual emerged seedling densities are usually predicted satisfactorily. Consequently, the model can be used to simulate the effects of cropping systems on black-grass emergence. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Capon, SJ; Brock, MA				Capon, SJ; Brock, MA			Flooding, soil seed bank dynamics and vegetation resilience of a hydrologically variable desert floodplain	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. This paper explores soil seed bank composition and its contribution to the vegetation dynamics of a hydrologically variable desert floodplain in central Australia: the Cooper Creek floodplain. We investigated patterns in soil seed bank composition both temporally, in response to flooding (and drying), and spatially, with relation to flood frequency. Correlations between extant vegetation and soil seed bank composition are explored with respect to flooding. 2. A large and diverse germinable soil seed bank was detected comprising predominantly annual monocot and annual forb species. Soil seed bank composition did not change significantly in response to a major flood event but some spatial patterns were detected along a broad flood frequency gradient. Soil seed bank samples from frequently flooded sites had higher total germinable seed abundance and a greater abundance of annual monocots than less frequently flooded sites. In contrast, germinable seeds of perennial species belonging to the Poaceae family were most abundant in soil seed bank samples from rarely flooded sites. 3. Similarity between the composition of the soil seed bank and extant vegetation increased following flooding and was greatest in more frequently flooded areas of the floodplain, reflecting the establishment of annual species. The results indicate that persistent soil seed banks enable vegetation in this arid floodplain to respond to unpredictable patterns of flooding and drying.

J	Traba, J; Azcarate, FM; Peco, B				Traba, J; Azcarate, FM; Peco, B			The fate of seeds in Mediterranean soil seed banks in relation to their traits	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Is there any change in seed density and species richness in Mediterranean surface soil banks during summer? Are there any relationships between these summer variations and seed traits (weight, length and shape), without and with controlling the phylogenetic effect? Location: Central Spain. Methods: Samples of the surface soil seed bank were collected in two Mediterranean systems, grassland and scrubland, at two points in the year: immediately after the summer production peak and immediately prior to the autumn germination peak. We used Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordination to check for changes in floristic composition and ANOVAs to check for changes in seed density and species richness between summer and autumn samples. We used multiple regression analysis to analyse the relationship between summer variations in soil seed density and form traits, with and without controlling phylogenetic relations. Results: Soil seed density dropped significantly during the summer in the two systems (28% in grasslands, repeated measures ANOVA test; F = 58.19, P < 0.01; 72% in scrublands, repeated measures ANOVA test; F = 75.67, P < 0.001). Species richness, however, only dropped significantly in the scrubland (32%; repeated measures ANOVA test; F = 9.17, P < 0.05). Variation in the floristic composition of the shallow banks was only significant in the scrubland. Changes in shallow bank density were related significantly to seed morphology features, with greater drops in species with heavier seeds in grasslands and species, with longer seeds in scrubland. Conclusions: Our results show a substantial loss of seeds in the uppermost soil layer during the summer period between the point of peak production and the autumn germination peak. This drop was clearer in the scrubland than in the grassland. Longer and/or heavier seeds underwent the greatest declines in density at the end of summer, indicating a more intense effect of post-dispersal predation on large-seeded species.

J	Osem, Y; Perevolotsky, A; Kigel, J				Osem, Y; Perevolotsky, A; Kigel, J			Similarity between seed bank and vegetation in a semi-arid annual plant community: The role of productivity and grazing	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Large variation in the similarity between seed bank and standing vegetation generally occurs along environmental gradients. We asked: 1. How is seed bank-vegetation similarity in Mediterranean semi-arid annual plant communities related to variation in primary productivity; 2. How is this productivity-similarity relationship affected by exclusion from grazing. Location: Mediterranean, semi-arid rangeland in the Northern Negev desert, Israel. Methods: Density of seeds and plants, and species composition of the seed bank and vegetation were compared in grazed and ungrazed subplots, in four neighbouring topographic sites differing in productivity. Seed bank samples were collected in autumn, just before the rainy season, and vegetation samples in the following spring, at peak above-ground biomass, when net primary productivity was assessed. Results: Quantitative and qualitative similarities between seed bank and the vegetation (Sorensen index values) varied between 0.14-0.61 and 0.40-0.68. Quantitative similarity and productivity were positively and linearly related within the low productivity range (up to 160 g.m(-2)), in both grazed and ungrazed subplots. In contrast, at higher productivity levels (up to 500 g.m(-2)), similarity decreased slightly with productivity in the ungrazed subplots, but no trend Occurred in the grazed subplots. At low productivity, grazing did not affect similarity, while at higher productivity grazing prevented the reduction in similarity with increasing productivity. Conclusion: seed bank - vegetation similarity, with and without grazing, is positively related to productivity up to a threshold range, above which soil resource availability is no longer the factor limiting plant density. Above this range grazing prevents a reduction in similarity with increasing productivity, by diminishing vegetation cover and litter accumulation that constrain germination, seedling emergence and plant survival.																	1100-9233					FEB	2006	17	1					29	36		10.1658/1100-9233(2006)017[0029:SBSBAV]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000235669200005

Influence of different microhabitats and stand age on viable soil seed banks of sand-stabilising species	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed bank densities of 21 soil stabilizing species were measured in a shifting desert sand dune habitat to determine the effect of microhabitat and stand age on soil seed viability and seedling development. Seventeen species displayed statistically significant differences in the numbers of viable seeds present in soils from three microhabitats, namely dune crest, dune plinth and inter-dune basin. Five species had higher viable seed banks on the dune crest, two species on the dune plinth and thirteen species in the inter-dune basin. Three species, namely Artemisia ordosica, Caragana korshinskii and Hedysarum scoparium, exhibited significantly different numbers of viable seeds in soils from differently aged stands. These findings provided valuable information on the dynamics of soil seed banks in soil stabilizing vegetation cultivated on mobile sands useful for restoration and management projects.

J	Gerwing, JJ				Gerwing, JJ			The influence of reproductive traits on liana abundance 10 years after conventional and reduced-impacts logging in the eastern Brazilian Amazon	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Balancing timber production and conservation in tropical forests requires an understanding of the impacts of silvicultural manipulations on specific groups of organisms. Lianas are characteristic of many tropical forests, where they contribute to species diversity, ecosystem functioning, and biomass. However, lianas can also impede timber production by increasing logging damage and slowing tree growth. Cutting lianas prior to logging can mitigate the negative effects, but may adversely affect a forest's value for conservation. To evaluate the effects of forest management activities on lianas, this study assessed the impacts of logging, both with and without pre-logging liana cutting, on the relative abundance and population structure of five species of lianas that differed in primary reproductive strategies. Inventories of the five study species were conducted 10 years following logging in 4.4 ha plots in three adjacent treatment areas: (1) an old-growth forest reserve, (2) a selectively-logged forest that used conventional practices for the region, and (3) a forest that was logged using reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques including complete liana cutting prior to logging. Liana species responses to logging varied according to their primary modes of reproduction. Croton ascendens, a pioneer species with a persistent seed bank, had a higher abundance in the two logging treatments relative to the old-growth forest, while Serjania caracasana, an early successional species lacking a persistent seed bank, showed abundant regeneration following conventional logging but negligible regeneration following RIL. In contrast, Acacia multipinnata, also an early successional species, showed abundant regeneration following RIL owing to the sprouting of persistent prostrate stems present on the forest floor prior to logging. In both logged areas, Bauhinia guianensis recruited abundant climbing stems from self-supporting seedlings that were present prior to logging, but it showed greatly reduced seedling density following RIL. By sprouting profusely from both fallen stems and stumps, Memora schomburgkii recruited abundant small-diameter climbing stems in both of the logging treatments. The results of this study demonstrate that there are interspecific differences in liana responses to different types of logging and that knowing species' primary modes of reproduction is a valuable first step toward predicting those responses.

J	Diemont, SAW; Martin, JF; Levy-Tacher, SI				Diemont, SAW; Martin, JF; Levy-Tacher, SI			Emergy evaluation of Lacandon Maya indigenous swidden agroforestry in Chiapas, Mexico	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												The Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Mexico practice a system of swidden agroforestry that mimics the surrounding ecosystem and its successional stages. Their fields rotate through grass (milpa), and shrub (acahual) and forest fallow stages that regenerate soil, nutrients, and seed banks. Each successional stage, including the fallow stages, produces over 25 types of crops, raw materials, and medicines. Lacandon traditionally do not use fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. An emergy evaluation of Lacandon agroforestry was conducted to quantify resource use, productivity, environmental impact, and overall sustainability. Six systems were analyzed. The Emergy Yield Ratios of the systems ranged from 4.5 to 50.7, which indicated a high level of output per purchased investments. The agroforestry systems had minimal environmental impacts as shown by Environmental Loading Ratios between 0.03 and 0.38. The Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI) of the systems ranged from 12 to 1740, indicating a high level of sustainability. The high ESI values were partially due to a large fraction of renewable resources that varied from 0.72 to 0.97. ESI was dependent upon land area devoted to the system for each family, where greater land area resulted in higher values of ESI. Labor invested did not exhibit a direct effect on sustainability.

J	Waples, RS				Waples, RS			Seed banks, salmon, and sleeping genes: Effective population size in semelparous, age-structured species with fluctuating abundance	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Previous studies reached contrasting conclusions regarding how fluctuations in abundance affect N-e in semelparous species with variable age at maturity: that N-e is determined by the arithmetic mean N among the T years within a generation (N-e approximate to T(N) over bar (t); monocarpic plants with seed banks) or the harmonic mean (N-e approximate to T (N) over tilde (t); Pacific salmon). I show that these conclusions arise from different model assumptions rather than inherent differences between the species. Sequentially applying standard, discrete-generation formulas for inbreeding N-e to a series of nominal generations accurately predicts the multigenerational rate of increase in inbreeding. Variability in mean realized reproductive success across years ((k) over bar (t)) is the most important factor determining N-e and N-e/N. When abundance is driven by random variation in (k) over bar (t), Ne <= T (N) over tilde (t) < <T(N)over bar>(t).With random variation in N-t and constant per capita seed production (C), variation in (k) over bar (t) is low and N-e similar to T (N) over tilde (t); however, if C varies among years, N-e can be closer to T (N) over tilde (t). Because population regulation affects the genetic contribution of entire cohorts of monocarpic perennials, N-e for these species may be more closely approximated by than by T (N) over bar (t) than by T(N) over bar (t). With density-dependent compensation, Cov (k(t), N-t) < 0, and N-e is further reduced because relatively few breeders make a disproportionate contribution to the next generation.

Lack of understanding of seed biology limits management options for promoting survival of existing populations and recruitment of new populations. This study investigated the soil seed bank, seed viability, germination and seed dormancy. The plants release seeds in January but no seeds germinated from soil collected near the plants in September 1999, irrespective of the soil being treated by smoke, heat or. re. When sampled again in February 2001, seeds were present in the soil seed bank but were not viable. Viability testing of seeds collected from the plants determined that at least a third of the seeds being produced were viable, even after storage for 6 months. Seed germination and dormancy investigations found that the seeds germinated following exposure to smoke or scarification of the seed coat. Untreated seeds did not germinate during the preliminary study, although a proportion of untreated seeds germinated from a later seed lot. Fire management is important for promoting the survival of this species and the soil seed bank cannot be relied on for re-establishment of populations as the longevity of the soil seed bank seems to be short. Many other species of Tetratheca are also rare or threatened and this study suggests that hand-collected seeds treated with. re-related stimuli may be important for re-establishing those species and that the soil seed bank requires assessment before being relied on as a source of propagules or for maintaining a population.

The feral Asian water buffalo has been implicated as a factor in inhibiting the movement of juvenile trees to sapling stage. In a 6-year field study in Kakadu National Park, 656 juvenile plants were monitored for growth and survival, and in exploring the effects of buffalo, clipping surrounding vegetation and ambient. re. Buffalo were removed from one half of the sites across an environmental gradient in a landscape-scale experiment. Juvenile trees grew more slowly but fewer became dormant where buffalo were absent. Experimental clipping of surrounding vegetation produced significantly increased height at the buffalo-absent sites, but not at the buffalo-present sites, demonstrating that the positive effect of buffalo on growth was indirect, by reducing the competitive regime for juvenile trees. Within 3 years of removal of buffalo, ground-level green biomass increased 2-10 times and litter 1.3-2 times over a topographic gradient. Mortality of juvenile trees was not significantly different between buffalo-present and buffalo-absent sites when plots remained unburnt. By contrast, at buffalo-absent sites, three times more juveniles died after late dry-season. res than at unburnt sites, but there was no difference among buffalo-present sites. Overall, the total juvenile tree bank decreased by 7% where buffalo grazed and by 18% where buffalo had been removed. The study demonstrated a major mechanism(s) responsible for recorded changes in vegetation patterns of these savannas, whereby buffalo initiate a cascade of effects by changing ground-level biomass, which change competitive relationships and fuel loads, which then have an impact on tree growth and demography. The results are discussed with respect to dynamics of the juvenile tree bank and implications for long-term sustainability of these wooded savannas.																	0067-1924						2006	54	3					283	296		10.1071/BT04135							WOS:000237476900005						
J	Tierney, DA				Tierney, David A.			The effect of fire-related germination cues on the germination of a declining forest understorey species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Fire is an important component of most Australian terrestrial ecosystems and exerts a major influence on plant recruitment in these systems. Seeds of species from Australian heath, woodland and grassland systems have a diverse response to fire-related germination cues. Australian forests are also subject to. re events. However, for species of these forests, the diversity of germination responses to fire-related germination cues is poorly known. This study reports on the germination response of seed of Prostanthera askania Conn (Lamiaceae), a species restricted to eucalypt forests and eucalypt forest-rainforest boundaries. Smoke and heat shock negatively interact in relation to the germination level of P. askania seed. Thus, in this study, smoke elevated the germination level of P. askania seed only in the absence of applied heat treatments. P. askania seed also displayed high levels of dormancy, but unlike some related species, smoke effected a partial dormancy break. These results suggest that low-intensity. re may be optimal for the germination of this species. This is supported by an observed germination response of this species to a low-intensity fire and low-intensity fire may be a common feature of species of rainforest-eucalypt forest boundaries. However, other species in these systems have germination levels maximised by cues associated with high-intensity fire. Shifts in rainforest boundaries, reported effects of weed invasion on. re intensity in rainforests and the reported decline of species as a result of increased. re intensity suggest that P. askania may have been disadvantaged by a range of habitat changes associated with. re regimes since European settlement.

Optimising smoke treatments for jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest rehabilitation	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Alcoa is undertaking rehabilitation in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata D. Don ex Sm.) forest ofWestern Australia, following bauxite mining. One of the methods used in the rehabilitation program is broadcasting seeds; however, about two-thirds of species require seed-dormancy-breaking treatments. Smoke overcomes dormancy and enhances the germination of many jarrah forest species. Smoke-application methods were investigated to find the best seed treatment for 64 jarrah forest species. The optimum duration of seed imbibition in aqueous smoke and dilution of the aqueous smoke product were also investigated. The method of smoke application was important. Smoke water enhanced the germination of 12% of species, whereas aerosol smoke enhanced the germination of 6% of species. Both Grevillea pilulifera (Lindl.) Druce and Velleia trinervis Labill. had germination enhanced by both smoke-application methods. Aerosol smoke inhibited the germination of Clematis pubescens Endl. and Hypocalymma angustifolium (Endl.) Schauer. A total of 78% of species did not exhibit significantly enhanced germination when smoke treated, including the two species inhibited by smoke treatment. Germination was equivalent following 1- and 12-h imbibition in the aqueous smoke extract. Dilutions of the aqueous extract Regen 2000 Smokemaster from 1 to 3% were optimal for the germination of Marianthus bicolor (Putt.) F. Muell and Stylidium amoenum R. Br., even after subsequent washing with water, demonstrating the irreversible nature of smoke treatments. For species that did not exhibit smoke-enhanced germination, other dormancy-breaking treatments may be required before a response to smoke is elicited. These results have application to a wide variety of natural managed lands, disturbed and designed landscapes.

Conservation biology of the rare species Conospermum undulatum and Macarthuria keigheryi in an urban bushland remnant	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We evaluated the utility of a focussed, short-duration research program for investigation of two rare species that occur within an urban bushland remnant, with application for improving conservation management and translocation outcomes. Conospermum undulatum Lindl. is listed as Threatened and Macarthuria keigheryi Lepschi is listed as Vulnerable under the (Australian) Federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The C. undulatum population lacked evidence of juvenile plants, indicating either lack of a suitable germination cue or failure of seedling establishment. The M. keigheryi population was browsed heavily by feral rabbits where exposed and thrived when sheltered within unpalatable vegetation from rabbits. Seeds of M. keigheryi were rapidly removed in an ant cafeteria-style experiment, although seeds of the related Macarthuria australis and an 'outgroup' species, Gompholobium tomentosum, were removed at equally high rates. Seed viability was high in M. keigheryi, but variable in C. undulatum. Germination rates, in untreated fresh seed, were 11% for C. undulatum and 0% for M. keigheryi and increased to 27 and 3%, respectively, when treated with gibberellic acid. Maximum strike rates for cuttings of 33 and similar to 75% were obtained for C. undulatum and M. keigheryi, respectively. Cutting-grown plants of M. keigheryi flowered and seeded profusely in the nursery within 7 months, providing a highly effective seed-orchard resource for research and conservation seed banking. Genetic fingerprinting (AFLP) indicated that the C. undulatum population at Perth Airport was not genetically distinct from nearby C. undulatum populations, despite its relatively high variability in leaf morphology. All C. undulatum populations contained moderate to high levels of genetic variation, with the percentage of AFLP markers polymorphic ranging from 48.6 to 64.9%, and heterozygosity from 0.167 to 0.202. Overall, the knowledge gained from this program of short duration will enable informed management and will underpin successful population enhancement through future translocations.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011; Krauss, Siegy/C-2211-2011	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; Krauss, Siegy/0000-0002-7280-6324; Close, Dugald/0000-0001-7999-1692												0067-1924						2006	54	6					583	593		10.1071/BT05205							WOS:000240500500009						
J	van Klinken, RD				van Klinken, Rieks D.			Biological control of Parkinsonia aculeata: what are we trying to achieve?	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												The rangeland shrub, Parkinsonia aculeata (parkinsonia), is considered to be a serious pastoral and environmental weed in Australia. Existing biological control agents have been ineffective and native-range surveying is currently being undertaken to find potential new agents. In this paper I develop unambiguous performance criteria to assist in prioritising potential biological control agents, and against which the success of our biological control program can be judged. These include a reduction of patch density (to below 30% cover) and size (< 0.1 ha), a reduction in rates of spread and in-fill (by reducing seed production and understorey seed bank densities to < 100 viable seeds m(-2)), and the explicit targeting of regions most at risk from parkinsonia impacts. The development of explicit, a priori performance criteria for biological control programs should help biological control develop into a more rigorous and predictive science.				van Klinken, Rieks D/B-1772-2009	van Klinken, Rieks D/0000-0002-7578-8977												1326-6756						2006	45		4				268	271		10.1111/j.1440-6055.2006.00549.x							WOS:000240660400004

Sheep rumen digestion and transmission of weedy Malva parviflora seeds	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												The effect of sheep digestion and mastication on Malva parviflora L. seed transmission, viability and germination was investigated. Mature M. parviflora seeds were subjected to 2 seed treatments: 'scarified', where the hard seed coat was manually cut to allow inhibition, and 'unscarified', where the hard seed coat was not cut. Seeds were placed directly into the rumen of fistulated sheep and removed at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h of rumen digestion. After 12 h of in sacco exposure to digestion in the rumen, the germination of seeds that were initially scarified dropped from 99.2 to 1.4% and longer exposure periods produced no germinable seeds. In contrast, seeds that were unscarified when placed in the rumen produced over 92% germination regardless of in sacco digestion time, although manual scarification after retrieval was essential to elicit germination. In a second experiment, unscarified seeds (29000) were fed in a single meal to fistulated sheep and feces were collected at regular intervals between 6 and 120 h after feeding. Fecal subsamples were taken to determine number of seeds excreted, seed germination on agar and seed germination from feces. Major seed excretion in the feces commenced after 12 h and continued until 144 h, with peaks between 36 and 72 h after consumption. Although mastication and gut passage killed the majority of unscarified seeds, about 20% were recovered intact and over 90% of these recovered seeds were viable and could, thus, potentially form an extensive seed bank. A few excreted seeds (1%) were able to germinate directly from feces, which increased to a maximum of 10% after subsequent dry summer storage (3 months). Through information gained in this study, there is a potential to utilise livestock in an integrated weed management program for the control of M. parviflora, provided additional measures of weed control are in place such as holding periods (> 7 days) for movement of livestock from weed infested areas.

Tillage system effects on weed ecology, herbicide activity and persistence: a review	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												In the past few years, there has been a growing trend towards reducing tillage in cropping systems to allow stubble retention, earlier planting and improved soil structure. However, the adoption of conservation tillage systems will change weed control practices. Different tillage systems interact with the micro-environment of weed seeds and can influence the pattern of recruitment from the weed seed bank. Here, we present a review of the effect of different tillage systems on weed ecology, herbicide activity and herbicide persistence. Tillage systems can have a major influence on the vertical distribution of weed seeds in the soil seed bank. However, the impact of the changes in the vertical seed distribution on weed seedling recruitment is not well understood. Usually weed seedling recruitment increases if tillage equipment brings buried seed to, or close to, the soil surface, and seedling recruitment decreases if surface seed is buried deeper in the soil. However, tillage responses have a tendency to be species specific and can also be influenced by the intensity of tillage. Any weed species in which germination is stimulated by exposure to light is likely to become more prevalent under reduced tillage systems. Similarly, species that require burial for germination may become less prevalent. Crop residue present on the soil surface can also influence weed seedling recruitment by modifying the physical environment (mainly temperature) of weed seeds. Weed responses to plant residue could also be influenced by the allelopathic activity of the residue and the sensitivity of the weed species present. Few studies have investigated the fate of weed seeds that fail to germinate under any tillage system. Further research is needed to determine whether the weed seeds that fail to germinate decay before the start of the next growing season or become part of a persistent seed bank. Crop residues present on the soil surface can intercept a considerable amount of the applied herbicide and, depending on the herbicide, this intercepted component is susceptible to losses. Therefore, conservation tillage systems are expected to have lower efficacy of soil active herbicides. However, there has been little investigation of rate of loss of soil active herbicides under reduced tillage systems and the results reported have been inconsistent. Much of the research on these effects is from overseas and may not be true in Australian conditions. Therefore, further work is needed to clearly understand the impact of changing tillage systems on weed ecology, herbicide performance and persistence.

Today wild Large mammals are presumed to be important vectors for long-distance transport of diaspores within and between European temperate forest patches, and in particular wild boars recently came into focus. Here we use a specific habit of wild boar, i.e. wallowing in mud and subsequent rubbing against trees, to evaluate epizoochorous dispersal of vascular plant diaspores. We present soil seed bank data from 27 rubbing trees versus 27 control trees from seven forest areas in Germany. The mean number of viable seeds and the plant species number were higher in soil samples near rubbing trees compared with control trees. Ten of the 20 most frequent species were more frequent, and many species exclusively appeared in the soil samples near rubbing trees. The large number of plant species and seeds - more than 1000 per tree - in the soils near rubbing trees is difficult to explain unless the majority were dispersed by wild boar. Hooked and bristly diaspores, i.e. those adapted to epizoochory, were more frequent; however, many species with unspecialized diaspores occurred exclusively near rubbing trees. As opposed to plant species closely tied to forests species which occur both in forest and open vegetation and non-forest species were more frequent near rubbing trees compared with controls. These findings are consistent with previous studies on diaspore loads in the coats and hooves of shot wild boars. However, our method allows to identify the transport of diaspores from the open landscape into forest stands, where they might especially emerge after disturbance, and a clustered distribution of epizoochorically dispersed seeds. Moreover, accumulation of seeds of wetness indicators near rubbing trees demonstrates directed dispersal of plant species inhabiting wet places among remote wallows.

Therefore, motor vehicle-borne flora was evaluated monthly for a random sample of 20 cars between October 1988 and September 1989. At the end of the experiment 33 car-borne plant species, with a total of 690 seedlings were identified from mud, attached to these vehicles. There was considerable temporal variation in the mud mass attached to the vehicles and therefore also the size and composition of the vehicle-borne flora varied during the year. Because mud retention on cars is a crucial factor in seed dispersal., the number of emerging seedlings is negatively correlated with precipitation in the week preceding the sampling. The flora dispersed by vehicles consists mostly of species with small, light seeds and a persistent seed bank. Usually, they are pioneer species of nitrogen-rich habitats. The nature of the vehicle dispersed flora was compared with the local flora of road verges and differed significantly from this in, e.g., seed length, seed weight, ecological groups, Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen supply, potential. dispersal strategies and rarity. A larger resemblance with the flora of the zone immediately adjacent to the carriageway was found. We only found a low similarity to other motor vehicle-borne floras.

The degree of association largely depends on the balance of negative and positive effects between these contrasting plant life-forms, ranging from interference to facilitation. Since positive interactions are predicted to become less important with increasing rainfall, the interaction balance is expected to shift along aridity gradients. However, this prediction has not been tested on a community level. and for different life-history stages across large geographical gradients. Here, we show such changes for annual plant populations and communities in four contrasting sites along a steep climatic gradient, ranging from the and desert to mesic Mediterranean regions in Israel.. Above-ground productivity, richness, seedling density, and seed bank density of the annual plant community, as well as fecundity of annual plant populations, were generally higher under shrubs than in areas between shrubs at the and end of the gradient, but significantly lower at the humid end. Net effects of shrubs on annuals expressed as relative interaction intensity indicated a steady and consistent shift from net positive or neutral effects in the desert to net negative effects in the mesic part of the gradient. These findings emphasize the usefulness of studies along large-scale gradients encompassing a wide range of environmental conditions for understanding community level interactions among coexisting species.

J	Rosenthal, G				Rosenthal, Gert			Restoration of wet grasslands - Effects of seed dispersal, persistence and abundance on plant species recruitment	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Working-Group-for-Restoration-Ecology	APR-DEC -, 2003-2000	Univ Kiel, Kiel, GERMANY	Working Grp Restorat Ecol	Univ Kiel			Restoration projects in previously intensively used wet grassland areas in Europe showed that the re-establishment of target plant species can be strongly limited by propagule dispersal. In a large wet grassland area in Northwest Germany (Borgfelder Wummewiesen, 677ha) with relatively intact habitat conditions and extensive inundations it was tested whether the re-establishment of grassland species during restoration succession depends on population density in the established vegetation, the ability to survive in the soil seed bank, or on long-distance dispersal through inundations. For this purpose species recruitment was recorded in 58 permanent plots over a period of 6 years. In a multiple regression, species frequencies in the established vegetation (a measure for population density), frequencies in the drift line (dispersal capacity by winter inundation) and seed persistence in the soil were used as predictors for recruitment rates. Recruitment was mainly controlled by poputation density in the established vegetation. Long distance dispersal by means of winter floods and a tong seed bank persistence contributed Less (but still significantly) to the recruitment rates. Propagation by means of stolons and adaptations to hydrochory had a positive effect on recruitment rates and frequencies in the drift Line. High recruitment rates of target species in the test area, compared with other grassland areas of a more intensive land use history, emphasize the importance of a big species pool and the spatial interconnection of species-rich (source-) and species-deficient (sink-) habitats. Many target species, however, exhibited low recruitment rates because their ability to disperse in time and space is low. Restoration management for wet grasslands should, therefore, focus on large areas with a short intensification history and remnants of target species populations, which are connected with sink habitats by inundations.

Physical conditions and abundance of Daphnia pulicaria resting eggs in sediment cores from lakes in the Tatra Mountains	BIOLOGIA												All species of Daphnia (Cladocera) produce, at some stage in their life cycle, diapausing eggs, which can remain viable for decades or centuries forming a "seed bank" in lake sediments. Because of their often good preservation in lake sediment, they are useful in paleolimnology and microevolutionary studies. The focus of this study was the analysis of cladoceran resting eggs stored in the sediment in order to examine the ephippial eggs bank of Daphnia pulicaria Forbes in six mountain lakes in the High Tatra Mountains, the Western Carpathians (northern Slovakia and southern Poland). Firstly, we analyzed distribution, abundance and physical condition of resting eggs in the sediment for their later used in historical reconstruction of Daphnia populations by genetic methods. To assess changes in the genetic composition of the population through time, we used two microsatellite markers. Although DNA from resting eggs preserved in the High Tatra Mountain lake sediments was extracted by various protocols modified for small amounts of ancient DNA, DNA from eggs was not of sufficient quality for microsatellite analyses. Distribution curves of resting eggs from sediment cores correspond to the environmental changes that have occurred in the High Tatra Mountains area during last two centuries (atmospheric acid deposition, fish introduction) and demonstrate their influence on natural populations. Evaluation of ephippia physical condition (the most common category was empty ephippial covers) suggests that the majority of resting eggs hatched to produce a new generation of Daphnia or may be due to failed deposition of resting eggs by Daphnia to the chitinous case. In conclusion, age, low quantity and poor physical condition of resting eggs from these Tatra lake sediments proved to be unsuitable not just for use in genetic analyses, but also the possibilities of autogenous restoration of Daphnia populations from the resting egg banks in the Tatra sediments are negligible.

Stratified sampling, based on a geographic information system, allowed to take in account relevant historical and ecological parameters and to correlate them with seed bank and vegetation. Data show that (i) density and richness of the grassland and shrubland seed bank were higher in ungrazed as compared to grazed areas, (ii) similarity between seed bank and vegetation increased along the succession, before decreasing in old-growth forests, and (iii) seed banks of these forests were markedly different from those of younger forests. Bitmap correlation tests show that, whatever was the dynamic stage, edaphic variables were responsible for structuring soil seed banks. In this mountain area, vegetation emphasizes vegetative reproduction at the expense of long life seed bank establishment. Pastoralism thus appears as the only mean allowing maintenance of the actual biodiversity.

J	Maron, JL; Kauffman, MJ				Maron, JL; Kauffman, MJ			Habitat-specific impacts of multiple consumers on plant population dynamics	ECOLOGY												Multiple consumers often attack seeds, seedlings, and adult plants, but their population-level consequences remain uncertain. We examined how insect and small mammal consumers influenced,the demography and abundance of the perennial shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus). In grassland and dune habitats we established replicate experimental lupine populations in 81-m(2) plots that were either protected from, or exposed to, herbivorous voles and granivorous mice (via fencing) and/or root feeding insects (via insecticide treatment). Populations were initiated with transplanted seedlings in 1999 and 2000. We followed the demography of these cohorts, subsequent generations, and the seed. bank for 5.5 years. Voles and insects killed many seedlings in dune (1999 only) and grassland (1999 and 2000) habitats. After 2000, insects and voles had minimal effects on seedling or adult survival. Seed predation by granivorous mice, however, greatly depressed seedling recruitment, resulting in lower adult lupine abundance in control plots vs. those protected from rodents. In grasslands, initial effects of voles and insects on seedling survival produced large differences among treatments in adult plant density and the cumulative number of seeds produced throughout the experiment. Differences among grassland populations in seed rain, however, had little influence on the magnitude of seedling recruitment into this habitat. Instead, recruitment out of a preexisting seed bank compensated for the lack of seed production in populations exposed to consumers. Shading by dense adults in plots protected from consumers limited seedling establishment within these populations. Although differences among populations in cumulative seed rain did not influence adult establishment, populations protected from consumers accumulated substantially larger seed banks than controls. These results illustrate how density dependence, habitat-specific seed dynamics, and particular demographic impacts of consumers interact to shape plant population responses to consumers.																	0012-9658					JAN	2006	87	1					113	124		10.1890/05-0434							WOS:000236020000013	16634302

Weed and cropped beets can cross easily and the management of weed beet is therefore crucial in the case of the advent of GM sugar beet, especially herbicide-tolerant cultivars, in order to ensure the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops and to avoid the appearance of herbicide-resistant weed beet. The inability of weed beet to compete in most other crops of the rotation makes the seed bank evolution a crucial stage of the life-cycle because in the rotation, sugar beet is at the most cultivated only every 3 years. The present study used seed burial experiments and laboratory analyses to characterise each step of the evolution of the weed beet seed bank and the external factors that could modify seed persistence in the soil. A monthly seed mortality of 10% was observed between October and December, while mortality was nil during the other seasons. Equations were then developed to describe the observed seasonal variations in seed survival. Seed dormancy also varied with season: the proportion of non-dormant seeds increased during winter (appearance of secondary dormancy) and decreased during the remaining seasons (loss of dormancy). In addition, the germinating seeds decreased with seed age and seed depth, while the presence of light stimulated germination. These observations were also translated into equations. Last, the pre-emergence hypocotyl growth and its variability were studied according to seed age, but no significant effect was observed. The results confirm the importance of the effects of cropping system on the evolution of the weed seed bank, especially the effect of soil tillage, which determines the date and conditions of seed burial, seed excavation and germination stimulation.

J	Wassie, A; Teketay, D				Wassie, A; Teketay, D			Soil seed banks in church forests of northern Ethiopia: Implications for the conservation of woody plants	FLORA												Church forests are sanctuaries for different organisms, ranging from microbes to large animals, which have almost disappeared in most parts of northern Ethiopia. Despite the actual and potential significance of these forests, studies and documented information on their bio-physical features and socio-economic setting are either scanty or totally lacking. A study was, therefore, carried out in seven of these church forests, namely Hiruy, Zahara, Gibtsawit, Gelawdiwos, Dengolt, Debresena and Ascha with the objective of assessing the composition, densities and spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks. The number of viable seeds in the soil samples, from both germination and sieving, corresponded to a seed bank density down to 9 cm in the soil of 7594 seeds m(-2) at Ascha, 2064 seeds m(-2) at Debresena, 4208 seeds m(-2) at Dengolt, 3158 seeds m-2 at Gelawdiwos, 2754 seeds m(-2) at Gibtsawit, 2759 seeds m(-2) at Hiruy, and 1909 seeds m(-2) at Zahra. The total number of species recorded was 50, representing at least 22 plant families, in the seven church forests, of which 13 were recorded from Ascha, 29 from Debresena, 26 from Dengolt, 19 from Gibtsawit, 22 from Gelawdiwos, 20 from Hiruy and 21 from Zahra. There was a significant difference in seed densities and number of species recovered from the soil seed banks of the seven church forests. Ascha had a significantly higher seed bank density than all other church forests. Dengolt exhibited a significantly higher number of species compared with other church forests. Of the identified species recorded from the seven church forests, 83% were herbs, 11% trees and 6% shrubs. Our results revealed that church forests accumulate large quantities of persistent seeds of herbaceous species in the soil while only five (6%) of the 91 woody species recorded in the standing vegetation of the seven church forests were represented in the soil seed banks. The fact that most of the dominant tree species do not accumulate seeds in the soil suggests that their regeneration from seeds would be prevented by removal of mature individuals in the standing vegetation. The results also provided further evidences that consolidate the conclusions of previous studies, i.e. the future existence of the woody flora characteristic of dry Afromontane areas in Ethiopia depends on the conservation and sustainable utilization of the few remnant natural forests.

J	Martinkova, J; Klimesova, J; Mihulka, S				Martinkova, Jana; Klimesova, Jitka; Mihulka, Stanislav			Vegetative regeneration of biennial Oenothera species after disturbance: Field observations and experiment	FLORA												It has been recently shown that some annual and biennial species of man-made habitats cope with severe disturbance by resprouting (vegetative regeneration) from their bud bank and do not only rely on regeneration from seeds. Nevertheless, information on the ecology of this phenomenon is rare. In a field study, we answered the question how frequent is resprouting from root buds in populations of the ruderal biennial herb Oenothera biennis, and how it is affected by habitat conditions. In an experiment, we tested the hypothesis that higher severity of injury and later life-cycle phase of the injured plants suppress resprouting from both axillary and root buds in O. biennis and also in its closely related congeners O. fallax and O. glazioviana. In 25 out of 29 studied ruderal populations of O. biennis severely injured individuals were found; however, only half of these populations included injured individuals that resprouted from roots. Among these populations, the number of root-sprouting individuals varied highly (from 3% to 67% of injured individuals). The largest populations and the highest percentage of root-resprouting individuals were found in urban habitats with sandy/gravelly substrate, a low vegetation cover, and a high frequency of disturbance. In the experiment with three Oenothera congeners, removal of aboveground biomass with all axillary buds largely led to the death of plants of all three species. When a portion of the basal axillary buds remained intact, individuals of O. biennis mostly failed to regenerate, whereas individuals of O. fallax and O. glazioviana survived and formed seeds. A higher severity of injury suppressed resprouting in Oenothera congeners in this experiment. However, the relationship between life-cycle phase and the ability to resprout remains unclear in Oenothera species. This study showed that resprouting after severe injury is an important feature of Oenothera individuals occurring in man-made habitats and may represent an alternative strategy to regeneration from the seed bank under disturbance conditions.

J	Handlova, V; Munzbergova, Z				Handlova, Viola; Munzbergova, Zuzana			Seed banks of managed and degraded grasslands in the Krkonose Mts., Czech Republic	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												Grassland seed banks are traditionally considered a source of new species in degraded communities. However, many recent studies have shown that the potential of the seed bank to restore many communities is rather limited. Two principal reasons for these limitations, loss of species from the seed bank or inability of the species to create any seed bank, are, however, usually not distinguished. This study aims to assess the role of seed bank composition and heterogeneity in the restoration of species-rich plant communities. It was carried out in mountain grasslands in the eastern part of the Krkonose Mountains, Czech Republic. The composition of vegetation and seed bank were recorded and their relationship was assessed in 1.5 m x 1.5 m plots placed in non-degraded and degraded parts of seven grasslands. Vegetation at currently managed sites is not degraded; degraded parts were without management (dominated by Holcus mollis, Bistorta major or Rumex alpinus). The degree of heterogeneity of seed bank and vegetation was tested as the relationship between subplot similarity, distance, and degradation stage. Degradation had significant effects on composition of both aboveground vegetation and seed bank and increased heterogeneity both in the vegetation and in the seed bank. Species absent from the vegetation of degraded plots were also absent from the seed bank of both degraded and non-degraded plots, indicating that the absence of species from the seed bank is not due to their loss during the degradation process but rather due to the low number of seeds in the seed bank already in the non-degraded communities. Furthermore, the seed bank of the degraded communities largely results from the present vegetation of these communities. This supports the limited role of the seed bank in these communities. Restoration of these sites is thus impossible unless management will include methods with which seeds will arrive at the degraded sites.

J	Kohler, F; Gillet, F; Gobat, JM; Buttler, A				Kohler, Florian; Gillet, Francois; Gobat, Jean-Michel; Buttler, Alexandre			Effect of cattle activities on gap colonization in mountain pastures	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												Cattle influences gap dynamics in pastures in two ways: (1) by creating gaps and (2) by affecting the colonization process. This effect of cattle activity on gap revegetation can be subdivided in three main factors: herbage removal, trampling and dung and urine deposition. The objective of this study was to assess how these three effects moderate the plant succession following gap creation. In an exclosure, four controlled treatments simulating cattle activity (repeated mowing, trampling, manuring and untreated control) were applied on plots of 2 X 2 in. In the centre of each plot, one artificial gap of 60 X 60 cm was created. During three years, vegetation changes were monitored in spring and in autumn, with 2 a square grid of 100 cells of 0.01 m(2) centred on the gap. Our experiment confirmed that fine-scale gap creation may have a high impact on relative abundances of species in the community. The gap environment acts on species as a filter and this filtering was described in terms of regenerative attributes. Colonizers were species with small seeds, unspecialized seed dispersal, persistent seed bank and high vegetation spread. However, the role of dung deposition, herbage removal or trampling by cattle did not seem to be of primary importance in the revegetation process, but could moderate vegetation response. Therefore, the different cattle effects act as secondary filters that selectively favoured or disadvantaged different species from the gap-regenerating community. These complex interactions are probably keys to understand plant coexistence in perennial grasslands.

However, categorising the fire response of a species solely based on known responses of individual plants can be misleading when predicting a population response. In the present study, we sought to determine the fire responses of several Leucopogon species at the population level, including the threatened L. exolasius. We found that, whilst all species studied were obligate seeders, the population responses of species to fire were dependent upon fire intensity and patchiness. Results showed first that low intensity fires were significantly patchier than higher intensity fires. Second, the proportion of plants killed within a population decreased with increased fire patchiness. We also assessed how populations were structured and found that stands were multi-aged at most sites, and did not have a single-aged structure, which is often assumed for obligate seeders. Both spatial complexity within the fire regime leading to adult plant persistence, and inter-fire recruitment, contributed to the multi-aged structure. It is possible that these Leucopogon species are gap recruiters, and may tolerate fire rather than be specifically adapted to it. Inter-fire recruitment may enable L. exolasius populations to persist for a much longer fire-free period than many other species in the region.

J	Hadas, R; Sirota, A				Hadas, Rivka; Sirota, Alexandra			An overview of the goals and functions of the Israeli Gene Bank for Agricultural Crops	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The area of Israel is rich in valuable wild-growing relatives of crop plants that can be used as breeding resources. However, with growing urbanization and land use, the populations of these relatives and of other species with an untapped economic potential are becoming impoverished or are in danger of extinction. A cardinal goal of the Israeli Gene Bank for Agricultural Crops (IGB), founded in 1979, is to conserve representative gene pools of these species. For now, this is mainly realized by ex-situ collections. At present, the central seed bank at the headquarters of the IGB, which is in the process of being renovated, holds some 8,000 accessions of wild crop relatives. Landraces that used to be grown in our area are being preserved in the seed bank and in vegetatively maintained clonal repositories. The IGB maintains a network of collaboration with academic institutions and other bodies that are engaged in work related to plant genetic resources, in Israel and abroad. For the future, strategies of in-situ conservation of entire populations of wild crop relatives are being explored. It is planned to enlarge the seed collections to include countrywide representatives of all native species with an economic potential, as well as rare plants. The IGB hopes to become part of a regional network with related germplasm collections in neighboring countries.																	0792-9978						2006	54	3					149	156		10.1560/IJPS_54_3_149							WOS:000247046700002						
J	Page, MJ; Baxter, GS; Lisle, AT				Page, MJ; Baxter, GS; Lisle, AT			Evaluating the adequacy of sampling germinable soil seed banks in semi-arid systems	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Quantification of soil seed is an important tool for understanding vegetation dynamics. However, determining adequate sample sizes and sampling regimes is problematic. The literature reports highly variable sample sizes and regimes without any generally applicable standards appearing to emerge. This problem is exaggerated by the heterogeneous and patchy nature of arid and semi-arid environments. Species accumulation curves are commonly used in floristic sampling to plan sampling effort and to evaluate its adequacy. However, the precision of the sample cannot be quantified arid it is difficult to determine the number of species missed. We suggest an alternate approach in which a species richness estimator is compared to the actual number of species found. When applied to data collected in a semi-arid region of South-West Queensland, this method gave a good indication of sampling adequacy at large sample sizes. We Suggest that this post hoc comparison of the predicted species richness (with coefficient of variation) to the actual number of species found would be useful in all studies reporting seed bank composition. This would allow the reader to evaluate the adequacy of the sampling effort, when judged against the research aims. We also investigated the deployment of sampling effort by examining Structured Subsets of Our data. The results suggest that sampling effort may be optimized by taking fewer samples per transect in any one site, but selecting more transects and sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We also detected a more pronounced spatial genetic association between the surface seeds and flowering genets than between the deeper seeds and flowering genets. 4 These results suggest that the surface seed bank accounts for a large proportion of the previous season's seed dispersal and therefore represents the transient seed bank, whereas the deeper (persistent) seed bank pools the reproductive output of multiple generations. 5 Directional analysis indicated that secondary dispersal by running water modifies the spatial genetic structure and extends dispersal distances. Over time, this may impact on the spatial pattern of soil seeds, possibly accounting for the absence of spatial genetic structure in deeper seeds. 6 Emerging seedlings and flowering ramets were strongly clustered together at distances up to 20 cm. Surviving seedlings were aggregated at short distances because of the patchy spatial distribution of safe sites for establishment, allowing development and strengthening of the marked fine-scale spatial genetic structure.

Key factors that could alter the mutation rate include environmental tolerances (because they reflect a plants vulnerability to changes in habitat), the pollen : ovule ratio (as it is associated with the number of mitotic divisions) and seed longevity (because this influences the number of generations per unit time in plants). This is the first study to demonstrate that seed bank persistence and drought tolerance are positively associated with molecular evolutionary rates in plants and that pollen : ovule ratio, shade tolerance and salinity tolerance have no detectable relationship. The implications of the findings to our understanding of the impact of environmental agents, the number of cell divisions and cell aging on neutral DNA sequence evolution are discussed.																	1010-061X					JAN	2006	19	1					302	308		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00977.x							WOS:000234543600030	16405600

Effects of tillage systems on the seed bank persistence and seedling emergence of ten arable weeds	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					To test the effects of different tillage implements on soil seed bank decline and on seedling emergence, 5000 seeds m(-2) of the arable weed species Avena fatua, Echinochloa crus-galli, Stellaria media, Spergula arvensis, Sinapis arvensis, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Raphanus raphanistrum, Thlaspi arvense, Solanum nigrum and Tripleurospermum perforatum were broadcast in experimental plots. The implements were the curry comb, the cultivator and the plough. After 25 months, the percentage of weed seeds recovered ranged from 0-12 %, depending on the species. The highest number of re-detected seeds was for Thlaspi arvense in soils under plough tillage. In contrast, no seeds were recovered from Spergula arvensis and Avenafatua. As there were no significant differences among the three treatments concerning the decline of the soil seed bank, seedling emergence in the curry comb and the cultivator plots significantly exceeded the values of the plots under plough tillage.

Effect of soil tillage intensity on seedbank dynamics of oilseed rape compared with plastic pellets as reference material	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					Tillage operations with different intensities following the input of oilseed rape seeds and an inert reference material (plastic pellets) resulted in seed banks which varied in size and vertical distribution. The size of the rapeseed bank has mainly to be attributed to seed losses in or on the soil, since seed bank and seed losses correlated with 0.84. Highest seed losses and consequently smallest soil seed banks were determined in treatments without stubble tillage and primary tillage by using a plough or a rigid tine cultivator in late autumn. A comparison with the reference material showed seed losses mainly in the soil horizon 0-10 cm (maximum seed: reference ratio 0.17) for treatments without stubble tillage, with noninversion tillage operations or with zero tillage. A treatment with immediate, shallow incorporation of seeds and ploughing in late autumn resulted in seed losses mainly in soil horizons 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm (maximum seed: reference ratio 0.19). Several mortality factors e.g. predators or fatal germination seem to differently affect seeds depending on cultivation sequence and soil depth. The study allows to divide the occurrence and vertical distribution of seeds in a soil seed bank into effects of mechanical shifting and into effects of seed mortality. The data will be integrated in models for seed bank dynamics of oilseed rape and weeds.																	1861-3829						2006					20		273	280									WOS:000243263500034

We found no effect of straw on weed density on the first two years of the experiment. Lower number of weeds in plots with straw was found on later years. Shallow loosening in spring, shallow catch crop incorporation in spring and no-tillage significantly increased weed infestation, compared to conventional deep plowing. No-tillage favored spread of Sonchus arvensis L. and Tripleurospermum perforatum L., but decreased the number of Chenopodium album L. Tillage systems had no effect on weed seed-bank. Straw incorporation decreased weed seed-bank, especially of Chenopodium album and, therefore, future weed infestation.

JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					Influence of microorganisms on weed and crop seeds? The natural degradation of weed and crop seeds in soils takes place in the upper layer of the soil, mostly affected by aerob microorganisms or seed predating insects. Advancing the microbial processes by application of appropriate microorganisms could reduce the input of weed seeds into the soil seed bank and diminish the weed density in the following crop. In laboratory experiments soil born strains of Streptomyces and one white rot fungus were tested for their capability to deteriorate seeds of Brassica napus L. and Chenopodium album. L. The effect was measured as weight loss and ligninase activity.

Late emergence of weeds in maize	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					Recently weed seed content of soils in Hungary has increased dramatically. This leads to severe weed problems even at later growth stages of the crop plants. In this study late-emerging weed populations were surveyed and characterized in a site-specific manner at a 9.2 ha field. Furthermore their effect on maize and future crops was evaluated. At selected sampling sites weeds were removed manually at different phases of crop development, newly emerging weeds surveyed and seed production by the major weeds determined. An evaluation of the data showed, that weeds emerging at later stages of maize development do not necessarily reduce crop yield significantly. However, they may interfere with maize harvest efficiency and the weed seeds produced contribute significantly to the soil weed seed bank thereby increasing weed problems for future years or even decades.

Interseasonal cropping - its potential for managing weeds in the Asian tropics	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					Tropical fanning systems cultivate food and cash crops with the monsoonal rains. Lands are generally left fallow during the interseasonal periods, thus building up weed populations and weed seed banks. Field studies were conducted to determine the impact of managing the interseasonal periods by growing either a food crop or green manures and its impact on weed populations in the subsequent season. The management strategies used after a maize crop in the major season were leaving the land fallow as normal practice, growing Phaseolus beans (a food crop), Crotalaria juncea (a fast growing legume green manure) or Tithonia diversifolia (a slow growing non legume green manure). A crop of mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) was planted in the following minor season and weed populations were monitored, along with crop yields. As expected, the weed populations in plots left fallow were the highest, thus requiring weeding in the mungbean crop on three occasions. Lack of weeding reduced mung bean seed yields by 67%, when compared to the weeded plots. Growing Crotalaria juncea as legume cover crop resulted in the lowest weed populations in mungbean, thus requiring only one weeding, and the lack of weeding reduced yields only by 18% as compared to the weeded plots. The slower growing green manure (Tithonia diversifolia) or the food crop (beans) facilitated a greater population of weeds in the succeeding mungbean crop. The importance of managing the interseasonal fallow periods for better integrated weed management strategies of smallholder tropical farming systems is discussed.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2006					20		921	927									WOS:000243263500114

This rare species grows in puddles that can be connected occasionally by flooded corridors. We monitored five locations in the Fontainebleau forest, France, since 2002 and recorded the presence of corridors among puddles and evaluated their impact on puddle demography and plant fitness. We showed that connections increased population size, by increasing both the number of puddles occupied by the species and the density of individuals within puddles, but seemed to have no direct influence on plant fitness. We found no evidence of a large persistent soil seed bank. Natural corridors are likely to decrease the extinction probability of the populations, most probably by allowing recolonization of empty puddles after extinctions. Therefore, the preservation of corridors appears crucial for the conservation of R. nodiflorus in its natural habitat.

Options for enhancing forest biodiversity across New Zealand's managed landscapes based on ecosystem modelling and spatial design	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY					Nigel Barlow Symposium on the Practical Applications of Ecological Theory and Modelling	SEP 15-17, 2004	Queenstown, NEW ZEALAND	Fdn Res, Sci & Technol, Royal Soc New Zealand, Minist Res, Sci & Technol Int Symposium Fund, Landcare Res, AgResearch, Australasian Wildlife Management Soc				In most regions of the world removal of environmental stress facilitates regeneration of native plants and habitats. However, in many of New Zealand's modified landscapes, exotic species are likely to respond first to any reduction in stress because these fast-growing species are prevalent in local vegetation and dominate seed banks. Given the trend in agriculture towards intensive management on larger units, the indigenous character in New Zealand landscapes is being marginalised and there is the risk that further reduction in visibility of native vegetation may be perpetuated by a growing familiarity and identification with ubiquitous exotic species. Alternative landscapes, based on an understanding of ecosystem processes, need to be explored if biodiversity coals set by international convention and national resource management law are to be achieved. This study provides a set of predictions and pathways, backed by field observations, to underpin a restoration strategy at patch to landscape scales. A forest model, LINKNZ, is employed to simulate species succession under New Zealand conditions. The incorporation of disturbance regimes and species dispersal processes in the model permits a wide range of scenarios to be investigated encompassing indigenous forest development, exotic species interactions with indigenous forest ecosystems, management of mixed introduced-indigenous forests, and landscape dynamics. The results illustrate an approach that identifies potential biosecurity threats and provides additional options for integrating nature and production in New Zealand's rural and urban landscapes.																	0110-6465	1177-7788					2006	30	1					131	146									WOS:000239637300013

The role of a seed bank in establishment and persistence of Aeschynomene virginica, a rare wetland annual	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Seed banks of Aeschynomene virginica may have significant implications for population dynamics and conservation of this rare, freshwater wetland, annual plant. Little work, however, has been done on the size and extent of the seed bank of this threatened plant. Experimental seed banks were placed at three sites to estimate overwinter seed survivorship and the potential for long-term seed dormancy. The soil beneath 5 extant populations was sampled after current-year seed germination and before seed fall to determine the presence and spatial distribution of seeds surviving more than one season. An average of 47.4 +/- 2.8 (+/- 1 SE) of the 125 seeds placed in the field survived over winter. Of those seeds that were recovered from experimental seed banks, an average of 37.3 +/- 1.7 germinated under greenhouse conditions. When the seed coats of ungerminated seeds recovered from experimental seed banks (10.3 +/- 0.3) were scored, 4.9 +/- 0.8 seeds germinated. Analysis of soil cores from the field showed high variability in natural seed distribution. Significantly more potentially viable seeds were found in plots with standing A. virginica plants than in those with no standing plants. Results indicate that A. virginica forms a Type III seed bank. The seeds in a seed bank may augment population size following poor seed production years, or they may re-establish locally extinct A. virginica populations.																	1092-6194						2006	13	2					235	246		10.1656/1092-6194(2006)13[235:TROASB]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000239067200006

This weed, originating from central America, is now a major weed in many regions of the world including Eastern Africa, India, parts of South East Asia and Australia. Presumably its recent arrival in Pakistan has been due to its movement from India, but this has yet to be established. In Australia it has been present for about 50 years, in which time it has spread from isolated infestations to establish core populations in central Queensland with scattered and isolated plants occurring south into New South Wales and north-west into the Northern Territory. Its spread in Pakistan is likely to be much more rapid, but lessons learnt in Australia will be of great value for weed managers in Pakistan. This annual herb has the potential to spread to all medium rainfall rangeland, dairy and summer cropping areas in Pakistan. In Australia its main effect is upon livestock production, but it is also causing health concems in regional communities. However, in India it has also had a significant impact in cropping systems. To help coordinate actions on its management in Australia, a National Weeds Program has created a Parthenium Weed Management Group (PWMG) and under this group a Parthenium Weed Research Group (PWRG) has been formed. Funding coming from this national program and other sources has supported the PWRG to undertake a collaborative and technology exchange research program in two main areas: 1) biology and ecology and 2) management; while the PWMG has focused on community awareness and the production of various extension and management packages. Research in the area of biology and ecology has included studies on the evaluation of competitive plants to displace parthenium weed, the use of process-based simulation models to monitor and predict future spread and abundance under present and future climate conditions, the effect of the weed on human health and the ecology of its seed bank. Management research has focussed on the development of biological control approaches using plant-feeding insects and pathogens. The effectiveness of biological control is also being monitored through long term studies on seed bank size and dynamics. The use of fire as another potential management tool is also being evaluated. In addition to this important research, an effort has also been made to spread the most important findings and management outcomes to the wider community through an extension and education program driven by the PWMG. These developments within Australia, in parthenium weed management, will be of great help to Pakistan as its weed managers prepare to resist a potential invasion by this significant weed.																							2006							19	+									WOS:000244622900004

Changing perspectives on the role of the soil seed bank in northern temperate deciduous forests and in tropical lowland rain forests: parallels and contrasts	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												In the early 1990s a simple view of forest dynamics and the role of the soil seed bank in forests was widely accepted. Plants could be divided into 'pioneers' that need canopy gaps for establishment, and 'non-pioneers' that are able to establish in shade. The species in the persistent seed bank were believed to be 'pioneers', awaiting formation of a gap in the canopy. It was also widely believed that seed bank species need (a) light, and (b) a high red: far-red (R:FR) ratio for germination, and that some need marked diel fluctuation in temperature. We review the changes in perspective during the last 15 years for the two forest-types best studied in this respect: northern temperate deciduous forest (NTDF) and tropical lowland rain forest (TLRF), and concerning NTDF we place especial emphasis on studies in nearly natural stands in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland. It is now known that 'pioneers' and 'non-pioneers' merge in the sense that in NTDF there are species that utilize gaps in the herb layer and litter under an intact tree canopy, and in TLRF there are species which need only 'micro-gaps' in the tree canopy caused by the fall of a single branch or of a whole crown a little way off. It is also known that the soil seed bank of both these forest types may contain a substantial number of species that are to a significant degree shade-tolerant; in NTDF there are a few species able to establish in the deepest shade and a greater number able to utilize gaps in the herb layer and litter, while in TLRF there are both species able to establish in the deepest shade and species needing only micro-gaps in the tree canopy. In both forest types a requirement for light and a high R:FR ratio is now seen to be characteristic of the small-seeded canopy-gap-demanding species in the seed bank; small-seeded species able to grow in an appreciable degree of shade do not need a high R:FR for germination. There is emerging evidence that (a) stimulation of germination by diel temperature fluctuation is characteristic of larger-seeded species in the seed bank, and (b) that risk-spreading dormancy is overlain on the dormancy related to awaiting an appropriate signal for germination. TLRF seems to differ from NTDF in that larger-seeded species rather than smaller-seeded last longer in the soil. (c) 2006 ROM Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Lutz; Hoelzel, Norbert; Danihelka, Jiri			Biological flora of central Europe: Viola elatior, V-pumila and V-stagnina	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Viola elatior, V pumila and V stagnina (syn. V persicifolia) are very rare in central and western Europe and red-listed in many central European countries. To improve their conservation and to base management efforts on sound scientific knowledge, we here review the available information on their biology. A comparative approach is adopted to identify similarities and differences between the species. Special emphasis will be on taxonomy, community ecology and population biology. All three species belong to the section Viola, subsection Rostratae. Since they are morphologically rather similar and have often been misidentified, we supply the most important characters for separating the three taxa. The species share a continental distribution with a centre of occurrence in the temperate zone of eastern Europe and western Siberia, and reach their western range margin in central and western Europe. They have become rare and endangered through melioration and fragmentation of their habitats. All three species are iteroparous hemicryptophytes with a complex life cycle, a mixed mating system with chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers, and a persistent seed bank. Viola pumila and V. stagnina occur in floodplain meadows and wet grasslands, whereas V. elatior is a typical species of alluvial woodland fringes and other ecotonal habitats bordering floodplain meadows. Viola elatior and V pumila are confined to calcareous or at least base-rich substrates, whereas V stagnina may also occur on strongly acidic soils. The violets are able to occupy a broad range of site conditions in terms of soil nutrient status and productivity. However, on fertile sites the species depend on regular disturbances that weaken competitors and enhance the germination of dormant seeds. Current information about mycorrhizal colonisation, biochemical and physiological data, and herbivores and pathogens is scarce or lacking, probably due to the rarity of the three species in central Europe.

The former is a predictable environment with frequent, regular and large-scale disturbances, while the latter is an unpredictable environment with irregular disturbances of varying spatial extent producing heterogeneous mosaics of different successional stages. We hypothesize that these differences in disturbance regimes select for different sets of biological and ecological plant traits in these two habitats. A data set of 2715 vegetation plots sampled in man-made habitats dominated by annual plants in the Czech Republic was combined with data on biological and ecological traits of vascular plants, mostly taken from the BiolFlor database. Differences due to temporal variation and location of plots in different climatic zones were partialled out using partial canonical correspondence analysis. Then the differences in traits of the plants growing on arable fields and in settlements were analysed using logistic and least-square regression models, both with and without phylogenetic correction. Plants growing on arable land were more often annuals, R-strategists, with overwintering green leaves, insect or self-pollinated, reproducing by seeds, with persistent seed banks and archaeophytes (i.e. those aliens that arrived prior to 1500). Plants growing in human settlements were more often biennials or perennials, C-strategists, wind-pollinated, flowering in mid summer, reproducing both by seeds and vegetatively, dispersed by wind or humans, neophytes (i.e. those aliens that arrived after 1500), species with high demands for light and nutrients and with more continental distribution ranges. Most associations between plant traits and habitats did not change after taking phylogenetic relationships into account. Traits strongly linked to phylogeny were especially modes of pollination and dispersal. By contrast, traits weakly linked to phylogeny included life strategy and alien status.

J	Van den Broek, T; Beltman, B				Van den Broek, Tom; Beltman, Boudewijn			Germination and seedling survival in fens undergoing succession	PLANT ECOLOGY												We studied mechanisms of vegetation change in fens subject to succession from open water to floating mats and finally herbaceous rich-fens. Earlier research showed that these systems are characterized by transient seed banks. Our main question was whether seedlings of later successional fen stages are already present in earlier stages, remaining subordinate in the vegetation until conditions become suitable for them. If, however, conditions during succession change in a way that only a limited set of species can survive as seedlings during each of the successional stages, no seedling bank will exist. The transient character of the seeds would then imply that seeds will not germinate and will subsequently die and that seeds that have germinated in the "wrong" stage will not become established. We hypothesized that: (1) germination and seedling survival of fen species are significantly better in the successional fen stage for which these species are characteristic, (2) as a consequence no seedling banks occur in these fens. In a field experiment, seeds of five characteristic fen species in the standing vegetation of three successional fen stages i.e. raft fen, quaking fen and rich fen were sown in each of these stages in a turf pond in the Tienhoven area, The Netherlands. Germination and seedling survival were measured over two growing seasons together with environmental variables. Germination was higher in the "own" stage for all species groups as was survival for quaking fen species and rich fen species. For both these stages, percentage of germination and survival of four out of five characteristic species were significantly higher in the "own" stage. Germination and survival can be considered stage-dependent and it was concluded that seedling banks do not exist in these fens. Site-specific environmental variables act as a sieve and differentiate on species presence already during early life history stages. We found clues that the environmental sieve acts at the level of nutrient availability, tolerance for high sulphide concentration and light climate. Because of the transient seed bank and absence of a seedling bank in these fen wetlands, successful establishment of species necessitates a continuous dispersal of characteristic species until the environmental conditions permit establishment. This also implies that species of the whole successional sere should be present within dispersal distance.																	1385-0237						2006	185	2					221	237		10.1007/s11258-006-9100-0							WOS:000239760600005						
J	Baeza, MJ; Vallejo, VR				Baeza, M. J.; Vallejo, V. R.			Ecological mechanisms involved in dormancy breakage in Ulex parviflorus seeds	PLANT ECOLOGY												Dormancy in the hard seed coats of Mediterranean species is considered a strategy that enables persistent seed banks to be formed in the soil. An important factor related to seed coat fracture and dormancy breakage in Mediterranean ecosystems is heat. Nevertheless, the effect of factors other than heat on dormancy breakage in these species has hardly been studied. To investigate the different ecological factors involved in germination, in the laboratory we applied several scarification treatments to seeds with chromatic polymorphism. We evaluated the effect of soil seed depth during experimental burns by sowing seeds at -1, -3 and -5 cm in the soil profile, and we also studied the effect of seed origin on the posterior germination of seeds from 4 and 10 year-old shrubs as well as from the soil seed bank. U. parviflorus shows clear chromatic polymorphism: its brown seeds present higher dormancy levels than its yellow seeds. The different techniques of dormancy breakage result in different degrees of germination; the highest degree of germination is generated by the mechanical treatment, followed by the acid and the heat treatments, in that order. The depth of the seeds in the soil determines the temperature thresholds and the residence times of these temperatures and whether they stimulate a massive germination at the -1 cm soil profile or only a slight germination at the -5 cm depth. Seeds recently produced by the plant show higher dormancy levels than seeds extracted from soil seed banks. Dormancy levels also depend on the shrubland age used for extracting the soil samples (3 > 9 years old). In effect, from the point of view of dormancy, the germination behaviour of U. parviflorus seeds seems to follow a multiresponse strategy based on different seed populations and involving both biological and abiotic processes to break dormancy.

Germinable soil seed bank of a gallery forest in Brazilian Cerrado	PLANT ECOLOGY												The soil seed bank is a dynamic biotic component of plant communities that represents the population's memory in relation to selective events. Few studies have investigated the natural stock of germinable seeds in the gallery forests to evaluate their regeneration potential, although they are target of anthropogenic action. Thus, seasonal, horizontal, and vertical qualitative and quantitative variations of the seed bank of a gallery forest in the Brazilian Cerrado were studied to test the influence of the climatic seasonality, the influence of the physical structure, and depth of the soil in different microhabitats of the forest in this natural seed store. It was also compared the richness and abundance of species in the germinable seed bank with the above-ground vegetation. Three hundred and seventy-five soil samples were collected at the beginning (April 1998 and 1999) and at the end of the dry season (September 1998). These samples were collected in three microhabitats distributed transversally in relation to drainage line of a large stream, at five depths. The density of germinable seeds decreases with depth, and is similar among microhabitats and seasons. In 24,690 cm(3) of soil and 4.05 m(2) of litter, 1390 seedlings emerged, being 743 dicotyledons and 647 monocotyledons. From 761 survivors, 263 were Cyperaceae, 206 Melastomataceae, 153 Poaceae, and 82 Onagraceae, the most abundant families. This study suggests that the diversity of the germinable soil seed bank is lower than that of the above-ground vegetation of the forest, and that the soil seed bank is not the principal regeneration form of this environment.

J	Forrester, JA; Leopold, DJ				Forrester, Jodi A.; Leopold, Donald J.			Extant and potential vegetation of an old-growth maritime Ilex opaca forest	PLANT ECOLOGY												The extant and potential (seed bank) vegetation of a rare maritime holly forest on Fire Island, New York was described to assess whether treefall gaps act as a mechanism for the persistence of the species composition of this plant community over time. The Sunken Forest overstory is dominated by Ilex opaca, Amelanchier canadensis and Sassafras albidum. A survey of canopy gaps indicated canopy openings compose 11.3% of the land within the Sunken Forest (16 ha). The composition and density of the seed bank were described using the emergence method. Germination from soil samples placed in the greenhouse was monitored over 2 years. Sixteen species germinated with an average propagule density of 215 41 germinants per square metre. An early successional species (Rhus copallinum) dominated the seed bank, but the late-successional, shade-tolerant L opaca was also present. Though only one species in the seed bank did not appear in the current vegetation, species abundance differed between vegetation strata. The mean cover and density of the ground-layer flora were higher beneath treefall gaps than closed canopy. Sapling density did not differ between the two canopy conditions, but the dominant species differed with A. canadensis occupying several closed canopy plots and P. serotina saplings appearing more often in gap plots. Most of the dominant canopy species are present in the seed bank and ground layer but are not present in the shrub and sapling layer, with the exception of A. canadensis. Current (2002) sapling density is lower than three decades ago for all species except P. serotina, which is now the dominant woody species in the Sunken Forest understory. The results of this study indicate that if the cause of the sapling reduction is lessened or removed, the characteristic species of the overstory of this unusual plant community may rebound and redevelop a sapling and shrub layer akin to that present before the increase in Odocoileus virginianus on the island.																	1385-0237	1573-5052					2006	183	2					349	359		10.1007/s11258-005-9045-8							WOS:000239430000015						
J	Wearne, LJ; Morgan, JW				Wearne, L. J.; Morgan, J. W.			Shrub invasion into subalpine vegetation: implications for restoration of the native ecosystem	PLANT ECOLOGY												The ability of plant communities to recover after non-native species invasion will depend upon the nature of their soil seed bank and seed rain characteristics. This study assessed changes in the soil seed bank and seed rain associated with the invasion of the non-native shrub Cytisus scoparius in subalpine vegetation. Soil seed bank and seed rain composition, density and richness were investigated at three areas of different stages of invasion: (i) recent (8-10 years), (ii) mature (15-16 years) and (iii) long-term (25 years). There were few changes in seed bank composition or richness regardless of invasion stage. By contrast, the seed rain composition, richness and density was substantially different within long-invaded areas. Very few seeds were able to colonise the dense barrier characteristic of larger, more mature C. scoparius stands. Some prominent herbs from the native vegetation were under-represented or absent from the seed bank, both in invaded and uninvaded areas. Laboratory germination experiments demonstrated that most native species germinate easily, which may imply a transient seed bank, rather than a persistent one. The majority of herbaceous and shrub species were capable of resprouting vegetatively. Therefore, regeneration appeared more reliant on the bud and tuber bank than a persistent soil seed bank. The dominance of graminoid species and C. scoparius rather than other herbaceous, shrub or tree species suggests that the regenerating vegetation will be dominated by grass species and/or C. scoparius. Hence, in areas where long-invaded C. scoparius stands are present the recovery of native subalpine vegetation maybe difficult. Recovery may only be possible through wind dispersal from the surrounding intact vegetation or through actively reseeding the area. This study highlights the importance of early intervention in invasive species management.																	1385-0237						2006	183	2					361	376		10.1007/s11258-005-9046-7							WOS:000239430000016

However, flooding duration in wet grasslands is not an easy variable to observe by itself, all the more so because it is really heterogeneous in space, due to subtle topographic relief. Moreover, actual plant diversity, composition and community structure are the synthetic results of the hydro-meteoro logical history in the past. Wet grasslands are thus truly ungauged with respect to flooding duration, which has to be simulated in a robust manner both over the spatial territory and back over the past many years. A water-balance modelling with a daily time step, based on available meteorological data and on a precise topographic characterization, was proposed to assess the flooding duration at any location of a studied area situated along the west coast of France and over a period of six years. The simulated (calculated) flooding durations were used in the plant species distribution modelling based on 350 sampled vegetation quadrats. From field-based milestone observations of water level, the hydrological modelling was shown to predict well the annual cumulative flooding duration at any spot. A strong and consistent effect of flooding duration was evident for 29 species. Plant diversity appeared to reach a maximum at an intermediate flooding duration. The hydrology-vegetation modelling approach could thus lead to a robust and versatile tool to predict the consequences of changes in flooding regime on vegetation patterns.

When a standard encapsulation-dehydration process for cryopreservation was used, the best recovery (40-55%) was obtained after drying for 4-6h when water content of the beads was about 23%. Survival and recovery rates varied among genotypes. When the new encapsulation-dehydration process of Sakai et al. (2000) was applied, where the apices were simultaneously osmo-protected with a mixture of 2 M glycerol plus 0.4 M sucrose for 1 h, high percentages (up to 60%) of shoot formation resulted.

The purpose of this paper is to identify links between water regime, seed bank and the establishment of zoned vegetation communities in a series of small distributary channels within the Narran Lakes flood plain-wetland complex, eastern Australia. Seed bank material from three distinct plant community zones within three distributary channels were collected and subjected to five inundation treatments over a period of 12 weeks to test the effects of location and inundation regime on the abundance of seedlings, species richness and species assemblages. The results of this study indicate that the water regime determines which species germinate and the seed bank influences the abundance of plants to emerge. This study provides insight into the implications of changing flooding regimes on plant community composition in flood plain-wetland systems.

Rapid characterisation of some species of the genus Onobrychis Miller (Leguminosae : Papilionoideae) by isozyme methods	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nine taxa of the genus Onobrychis (O. viciifolia, a crop, and eight wild relatives) have been compared though electrophoretic profiles of ten isozyme systems. The band patterns obtained using bulking seeds, identified samples faster than other methodologies, which could be useful in seed banks management. The enzyme profiles obtained provided 114 reliable bands, which were scored as multistate traits (not with allelic value). In order to use this method for an approach to taxonomic purposes, the relationships among taxa were estimated by dendrograms based on the similarity matrix treated by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetical averages (UPGMA). The results are in agreement with the recognised taxonomy, and the nine Onobrychis species were clustered in a main group that includes the species of subsection Vulgatae, and the taxa belonging to subsections Hispanicae, Brachysemiae and Macropterae clearly appear differentiated.																	0251-0952	1819-5717					2006	34	2					297	306		10.15258/sst.2006.34.2.05							WOS:000240041200005						
J	Rahman, A; James, TK; Grbavac, N				Rahman, Anis; James, Trevor K.; Grbavac, Nik			Correlation between the soil seed bank and weed populations in maize fields	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Annual weed populations establish every year from persistent seed banks in the soil. This 3 year study investigated the relationship between the number of weed seeds in the soil seed bank and the resultant populations of major broadleaf and grass weeds in 30 maize fields. After planting the crop, 1 m(2) areas were protected from the pre-emergence herbicide application. Soil samples were collected soon after spraying to a depth of 100 mm and the weed seeds therein were enumerated. The emerged weed seedlings in the field sampling areas were counted over the following 8 weeks. Up to 67 broadleaf species and five grass weeds were identified, although not all were found at every site and some were specific to a region or soil type. For the most abundant weeds in the field plots, on average 2.1-8.2% of the seeds of the broadleaf species and 6.2-11.9% of the seeds of the grass weeds in the soil seed bank emerged in any one year, depending on the species. Overall, the results showed a strong linear relationship between the seed numbers in the soil and the seedling numbers in the field for all the grasses and for most broadleaf weeds. For some species, like Trifolium repens, only a weak relationship was observed. In the case of Chenopodium album, which had the largest seed bank, there was evidence of asymptotic behavior, with seedling emergence leveling off at high seed numbers. An estimate of the soil seed bank combined with knowledge of the germination and behavior of specific weed species would thus have good potential for predicting future weed infestations in maize fields.																	1444-6162						2006	6	4					228	234		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2006.00223.x							WOS:000241407000007

Our goal was to determine how weed Communities of no-tillage systems are affected when the system is modified to reduce herbicide use through a combination of banded herbicides and interrow cultivation. To this end, we conducted a 9-yr study in a no-tillage corn-soybean-winter wheat rotation. All management systems had a preplant application of glyphosate, followed by either broadcast PRE herbicides (conventional no-tillage), interrow cultivation with banded PRE herbicides, or interrow cultivation alone. Aboveground weed densities were assessed each year and data were grouped into early (1991 to 1993) and late (1996 to 1998) time periods. Over time, weed communities became more distinct, showing a strong response to management and crop. In the early years, weed communities separate more in response to management than crop. In the late years, this was reversed. Weed communities in systems with interrow cultivation were more diverse than those in conventional no-tillage. The response to weed management system and crop was species specific. For example, the abundance of yellow foxtail was higher when interrow cultivation was employed, but abundance was equal in all crops. Dandelion was more abundant in conventional no-tillage of corn and soybean; however, it was equally abundant in all management systems in wheat. Seed bank species richness increased over time and was highest in systems with interrow cultivation. Herbicide use can be reduced in a modified no-tillage corn-soybean-wheat rotation by incorporating interrow cultivation, with or without banded herbicides, into the management plan.

Tillage had the largest effect on weed diversity and density. No tillage promoted the highest weed species diversity, chisel plow was intermediate, and moldboard plow resulted in the lowest species diversity. These results are consistent with ecological succession theory. The increase in weed species diversity resulted from 20 species being associated with no tillage systems, 15 of which were winter annuals, biennials, or perennials. Emerged weed density was affected only by tillage. Over 6 yr, seedbank declined in no-tillage systems from 41,000 to 8,000 seeds m(-3). Crop yields were not affected by tillage or crop rotation. In practical terms, reduced tillage in combination with a good crop rotation may reduce weed density and expenditures on weed management.

In this study, we investigated the patterns of weed seed removal, the influence of crop residue cover on seed removal, the types of granivores present and their seed preferences in a 16-ha postharvest cropping field in Western Australia during the summer months over 2 yr. Seed removal from caches was extremely variable (from 0 to 100%). Removal rates were generally highest along the edges of the field near bordering vegetation and lowest in the center of the field and within the bordering vegetation. However, there were many deviations from this general pattern. There was no change in rates of predation with different levels of residue cover. Ants or other small invertebrates were found to remove the most seeds. However, seed removal by other animals, such as rodents, was also evident. Annual ryegrass seeds were preferred over wild oat seeds, followed by wild radish pod segments. Seed harvesting was lowest in late January, peaked in February and decreased in March. Results from this study suggest seed harvesters could reduce the number of surface seeds in the field, reducing the weed seed bank. Management options that increase the activity of the seed harvesters may lead to less variability in seed predation and could, therefore, be incorporated into an integrated weed management program.																	0043-1745					JAN-FEB	2006	54	1					148	155		10.1614/WS-05-075R.1							WOS:000234766900020						
J	Hacault, KM; Van Acker, RC				Hacault, KM; Van Acker, RC			Emergence timing and control of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) in spring wheat	WEED SCIENCE												in the northern region of the northern Great Plains of North America, the relative abundance of dandelion in field crops has increased over the past two decades, and farmers need information to help them to better manage this species and slow its spread. A study was conducted to determine the emergence timing of dandelion from both rootstock and seed, and to investigate the efficacy of preseeding (spring) versus postharvest (autumn) herbicide treatments on dandelion in spring wheat fields. Emergence of dandelion plants from rootstock was very early (mean time to 50% emergence [E-50] of 430 growing degree days [GDD] T-base 0 C), while seedling emergence was much later (mean E50 of 980 GDD). Dandelion does not have a persistent seed bank, and seedling emergence occurred only after dandelion plants arising from rootstock flowered and shed seed. Herbicide treatments that included glyphosate plus florasulam, glyphosate plus tribenuron, or higher rates of glyphosate alone ( >= 675 g ae ha(-1)), provided high levels of dandelion control. Autumn herbicide applications were more effective than spring applications for reducing dandelion infestation levels (both aboveground biomass and density). Autumn herbicide applications came after peak emergence timing for dandelion plants emerging both from rootstock and from seed. Because dandelion is a simple perennial, population spread must be limited by controlling seedlings. Autumn herbicide applications provide control of dandelion seedlings and therefore, should limit dandelion population spread.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				JAN-FEB	2006	54	1					172	181		10.1614/WS-05-083R.1							WOS:000234766900023

J	Major, J; DiTommaso, A; Lehmann, J; Falcao, NPS				Major, J; DiTommaso, A; Lehmann, J; Falcao, NPS			Weed dynamics on Amazonian Dark Earth and adjacent soils of Brazil	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Field trials were conducted on Amazonian Dark Earth soils in the Manaus region, Amazonas, Brazil to assess the composition and impact of weedy vegetation on maize yield. Soil fertility among the Dark Earth varied considerably with differences largely attributable to past-use history. Consequently, maize yield and weed pressure varied among field locations, reflecting these differences in soil fertility in addition to differences in weed reservoirs such as seedbanks. Maize yield in weeded plots was as much as 63 times greater on Dark Earth (0.55 t ha(-1)) than on corresponding adjacent soil (0 t ha(-1)). and location averages varied from 0 to 3.15 t ha(-1) for Dark Earth. The percentage ground cover of weeds in weedy plots was up to 45 times greater on Dark Earth (65-99%) than on corresponding adjacent soil (2-89%), and species richness was up to I I times greater on Dark Earth (4-14 species) than corresponding adjacent soil (1-8 species). The relative proportion of annual and leguminous weeds was 32 and 17% greater, respectively, on Dark Earth than adjacent soil, and vegetative sprouting of plants was more common on sites that had been used less intensively in the past. In general, a similar weed community was observed on the different Dark Earth sites, including many species typically associated with environments that have been highly disturbed by human activities, such as Cyperus spp., Phyllantus niuri, and Croton lobatus. Seedlings from a greater number of species emerged from forested Dark Earth seedbanks (2.1 per flat) than from forested adjacent soil (1.2 per flat). The total number of emerged seedlings was greater for Dark Earth seedbanks (9.1 per flat, 1,365 m(-2)) than adjacent soil (2.2 per flat, 330 m(-2)) however the species observed were not likely to be problematic for cropping.

J	Briemle, G				Briemle, G			Effects of a grassland minimum care in accordance with "cross-compliance"	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT												In accordance with cross-compliance, grassland which is no longer used is to be kept in '' a good agricultural and ecological condition ''. To achieve this, one annual mulching after 15 July or one mowing operation with removal is scheduled every two years. With the help of the results of long-time grassland trials in South Western Germany it is demonstrated that it will be difficult to achieve the planned goal. The reason is that for the overwhelming majority of the currently managed grassland a reduction of 3 to 5 harvesting activities to just one maintenance pruning operation will result in serious redistributions in the plant stands. Only on lean soils with low productivity (yield expectation below 40 quintal of dry matter/ha) this type of minimum upkeep is an appropriate measure. In addition, according to the present results of the trials it cannot be expected that there will be an increase in plant species or a reduction of nutrients in the soil. The later in the year such a maintenance pruning operation is carried out, the more top grass is dominant and the fewer species the plant stands have. From a bio-ecological general perspective it is irrelevant whether a measure starting after the summer solstice is carried out already during midsummer or only in autumn. Only when there is an additional early pruning in May/June, the percentage of herbs needing light increases. Conclusion: Only if the ecological demands according to cross-compliance expressed by buzz-words such as '' Keeping the countryside open '' (= prevention of forest) are extremely moderate, A mulch pruning only once a year is the right measure. Yet this would not have anything to do with I the conservation of a traditional cultural landscape with a high biodiversity.																	0005-9080					DEC	2005	83	3					376	387									WOS:000234588100004						
J	Kramberger, B; Gselman, A; Borec, A; Kaligaric, M				Kramberger, B; Gselman, A; Borec, A; Kaligaric, M			Periodic very late cut of permanent grassland as a measure to facilitate self-reseeding of grasses	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT												In the utilisation of permanent grassland in compliance with modem ecological and biological trends in grassland management, we constantly seek ways of utilisation that would in the long-term lead to stable forage yields of suitable quantity and quality. In addition, we have to ensure the conservation of natural and diverse grassland. On the basis of three experiments and the data from specialist literature, this paper presents the possibility of implementing a periodic very late first hay harvest on four-cut permanent grassland as a measure to facilitate self-reseeding of plants, with the emphasis on grasses as a major component of sward. Experiment 1: It started in 1996 on grassland which prior to the experiment had been a 2-3 cut meadow (Ranunculo repentis-Alopecuretum pratensis community). During the experiment, a 4-cut utilisation was implemented on the sward. In the first treatment (N), the first cut took place before mid-May, and/or at the beginning of the heading/panicle earing of the major components of the sward. In the second treatment (S), however, the first cut in the odd years took place only at the end of May. The yield of this cut was dried on the sward to facilitate self-reseeding of the plants. After a six-year experimental period, the total yield and the yield of even years, when the cuts of both treatments were conducted simultaneously, the dry matter yield was significantly higher in the S treatment. Differences in the botanical compositions in favour of grasses could also be observed. Experiment 2: In spring 2000 (April, May), average soil samples (0-15 cm) were taken from the same meadow. In the period of one year the germination capacity of plants was examined. There were no statistically significant differences in the seed banks of both treatments, but the absolute number of germinating plants and the portion of grasses were slightly higher in treatment S. Experiment 3: In June 2000, seeds of Alopecurus pratensis L., Anthoxanthum odoratum L., Bromus hordeaceus L. and Holcus lanatus L. were collected from grassland with the same plant community. In August, the seeds were placed in plastic net bags and dug into the soil at a depth of 5 and 10 cm. The germination rate of these seeds in individual periods was examined until June 2002. In general, the treated grasses at a 10 cm depth retained a higher germination rate for a longer period of time. On the basis of the obtained results, Bromus hordeaceus can be classified as a transient plant. In contrast, the other three grasses can be classified as short-term persistent plants. The results obtained show that by periodic self-reseeding a significant effect on the increase in forage yield in the next years can be achieved, but no significant increase in the grass seed bank in the long run can be expected. Therefore, a very late first cut of meadows with suitable botanical composition cannot be considered as a one-off measure to be conducted only once. To ensure a long-term suitable plant composition of permanent grassland, it is important that the self-reseeding is facilitated from time to time over a longer term.																	2196-5099					DEC	2005	83	3					431	446									WOS:000234588100007						
J	DeBerry, DA; Perry, JE				DeBerry, DA; Perry, JE			A drawdown flora in Virginia	CASTANEA												Species composition and relative dominance (cover) were documented in an emergent macrophyte community on recently exposed sediment during an artificial drawdown of a large reservoir in the Coastal Plain of Virginia. Observations included nine county records (New Kent County), four of which were records for the Lower Peninsula of Virginia and are considered state rare species. Dominance calculations by distance class (five-meter increments from the original shoreline to the existing waterline) showed that certain species were locally dominant near the original shoreline (e.g., Fimbristylis autumnalis), whereas others, particularly the state rare species, were more prevalent near the drawdown waterline (e.g., Lipocarpha micrantha). These results suggest that the timing and magnitude of drawdown events may influence recruitment of the species observed in this study. These species appear to form seedbanks in the substrate of the reservoir for long periods of time, and are capable of rapid germination and regeneration (seed set) during short-lived, unpredictable drawdown conditions. Small seed size and other environmental factors accommodate a predisposition to this '' temporal '' niche. Based on this research and the work of others, we suggest that such species are part of a regional '' drawdown flora.''.																	0008-7475					DEC	2005	70	4					276	286		10.2179/0008-7475(2005)070[0276:ADFIV]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000235052800004						
J	van Ast, A; Bastiaans, L; Katile, S				van Ast, A; Bastiaans, L; Katile, S			Cultural control measures to diminish sorghum yield loss and parasite success under Striga hermonthica infestation	CROP PROTECTION												Prospects of reducing Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. parasitism by means of cultural control measures were assessed. In a pot experiment, deep planting, the use of transplants and shallow soil-tillage, strongly delayed and reduced Striga infection of a sensitive and a tolerant sorghum cultivar. Application of all three measures combined resulted in a four-week delay in first emergence of the parasite, a reduced number of emerged Striga plants and a decimation of Striga dry weight. With the sensitive cultivar CK-60B a yield loss of 92% was reduced to 26%, whereas with the tolerant cultivar Tiemarifing application of the cultural control measures completely cancelled out a yield loss of 28%. Evaluation of these cultural measures under field conditions in Mali resulted in a strong reduction in Striga-infection level (85%). At the same time, the measures did not result in delayed first emergence of the parasite and had no beneficial effect on crop yield. It was argued that the presence of a natural Striga soil seed bank, with seeds throughout the tilth, might be an important reason for the reduced effectiveness of the proposed cultural control measures under field conditions.

J	Dostal, P				Dostal, P			Is the population turnover of patchy-distributed annuals determined by dormancy dynamics or dispersal processes?	ECOGRAPHY												In species with fragmented distribution, regional turnover dynamics is given by the processes of local population extinction and patch (re)colonization by migrants spreading from neighboring occupied patches. In plants with dormant stages (e.g. seeds) and limited dispersal capacity, regional dynamics based on dispersal processes can be overridden by pseudo-turnover determined by signals inducing or breaking dormancy (e.g. due to changes in habitat quality) resulting in a low importance of habitat configuration and size. In this study, I investigated the turnover dynamics of 5 annual plant species growing on ant mounds of Lasius flavus over three years. I analyzed whether the grassland-scale dynamics of these annuals is influenced by dispersal processes, or alternatively, by pseudo-turnover of soil seed populations. For that purpose I 1) searched for populations formed from soil seeds only, 2) compared the relative contribution of the soil seed bank and seed rain for population restoration after disappearance from the vegetation and 3) investigated whether colonization and extinction events are affected by patch isolation. I assumed if population turnover was rather a result of the soil seed bank dynamics then spatial effects would be hard to detect. In spite of the presence of populations formed from soil seed and the relatively more important soil seed bank for potential population reestablishment, turnover dynamics followed the predictions of metapopulation theory. Population appearance was more probable in larger and less isolated patches. Probability of disappearance increased with decrease of population size that was negatively influenced by the patch size and its isolation. These findings indicate dispersal processes to be important in the turnover dynamics and only limited contribution of soil seed populations. Their small effectiveness is probably related to the low chance of recurrent disturbance on the mound surface.

J	Keeley, JE; Baer-Keeley, M; Fotheringham, CJ				Keeley, JE; Baer-Keeley, M; Fotheringham, CJ			Alien plant dynamics following fire in Mediterranean-climate California shrublands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Over 75 species of alien plants Were recorded during the first five years alter fire in. southern California shrublands, most of which were European annuals. Both cover and richness of aliens varied between years and plant association. Alien cover was lowest in the first postfire year in all plant associations and remained low during succession in chaparral but increased in sage scrub. Alien cover and richness were significantly correlated with year (time since disturbance) and with precipitation in both coastal and interior sage scrub associations. Hypothesized. factors determining alien dominance were tested with structural equation modeling. Models that included nitrogen deposition and distance from the coast were not significant, but with those variables removed we obtained a significant model that gave an R-2 = 0.60 for the response variable of fifth year alien dominance. Factors directly affecting alien dominance were (1) woody canopy closure and (2) alien seed banks. Significant indirect effects were (3) fire intensity, (4) fire history, (5) prefire stand structure, (6) aridity, and (7) community type. According to this model the most critical factor influencing aliens is the rapid return of the shrub and subshrub canopy. Thus, in these communities a single functional type (woody plants) appears to the most critical element controlling alien invasion and persistence. Fire history is an important indirect factor because it affects both prefire stand structure and postfire alien seed banks. Despite being fire-prone ecosystems, these shrublands are not adapted to fire per se, but rather to a particular fire regime. Alterations in the fire regime produce a very different selective environment, and high fire frequency changes the selective regime to favor aliens. This study does not support the widely held belief that prescription burning is a viable management practice for controlling alien species on semiarid landscapes.																	1051-0761					DEC	2005	15	6					2109	2125		10.1890/04-1222							WOS:000233858900022						
J	Cruz, A; Serrano, M; Navarro, E; Luna, B; Moreno, JM				Cruz, A; Serrano, M; Navarro, E; Luna, B; Moreno, JM			Effect of a long-term fire retardant (Fire Trol 934 (R)) on the germination of nine Mediterranean-type shrub species	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												Fire Trol 934(R) is a long-term fire retardant commonly used in fire prevention and extinction. Our objective was to determine the effect of this chemical on seed germination of nine plant species from Mediterranean-type shrublands, where these chemicals are potentially used. Seeds were exposed to five different Fire Trol concentrations, (0 (control) to 10%, on a log scale) and monitored in a germination chamber for nine weeks. Seeds from four Cistus species were subjected to an additional heat treatment that simulated thermal scarification caused by fire. Retardant exposure caused a significant decrease in total germination in all species, and exposure to the highest Fire Trol concentration (10%) resulted in complete inhibition of germination. However, the sensitivity to Fire Trol varied across species and this differential species sensitivity may potentially lead to different impacts in the soil seed banks depending on whether sites are burned or unburned. Exposure to Fire Trol 934 may affect recruitment of shrubland species particularly during dry autumns, due to limited leaching of these chemicals from the soil surface. Consequently, its use should be avoided in sites where particularly sensitive plant species are present. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Manning, P; Putwain, PD; Webb, NR				Manning, P; Putwain, PD; Webb, NR			Formulating a general statistical model for Betula spp. invasion of lowland heath ecosystems	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Numerous studies describe thresholds at which transitions between alternate ecosystem states occur but few quantitatively delimit these conditions and present them in simple frameworks that are of use in ecosystem management. Previous research on heathland ecosystems has provided a site-specific statistical model that describes the determinants of the threshold point in heath-scrub vegetation transition, but the wider applicability, and thus utility, of this model was unknown. 2. Multi-site experimental manipulations were conducted to assess whether a consistent set of factors limited the recruitment of Betula species into heathland vegetation. Data were pooled and used to fit a single general statistical model. The applicability of this model to a wider range of environments was tested using two independent data sets. 3. The identity of the factors controlling Betula colonization, which include Betula seed bank density, phosphorus (P) availability and disturbance effects, were broadly similar between sites, but the strength of their effect varied widely. 4. The general model (explained deviance 59.8%) described Betula seedling densities as a function of biomass and necromass density, vegetation height, Betula seed bank density, P availability and soil water content. These relationships were complex, with numerous interaction and polynomial terms. 5. Although the model was derived from data from a single community type it was reasonably accurate in the prediction of seedling densities over a wider range of heath conditions. However, data capable of validating predictions of high seedling densities were not available. 6. Synthesis and applications. The apparent success of the general statistical model suggests that an approach incorporating multi-site experiments and statistical modelling can facilitate our understanding of ecosystem state transitions and inform the management of invasive species. By describing Betula invasion as a function of variables that are simple, general descriptions of the environment, the model can potentially inform management in a wide range of conditions. The results suggest that heaths close to seed sources and in the degenerate state of the dwarf shrub cycle are the most vulnerable to invasion, and management should target such sites as a priority. At regional scales, these conditions are probably most common in high soil phosphorus sorption capacity areas, where management should be prioritized.

J	Paynter, Q				Paynter, Q			Evaluating the impact of a biological control agent Carmenta mimosa on the woody wetland weed Mimosa pigra in Australia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Evaluation of the success of biological control agents is essential to improve the efficiency and safety of future programmes. This study assessed the impact of Carmenta mimosa, a stem-mining moth, introduced into northern Australia as a biological control agent of mimosa Mimosa pigra. Litter fall, seed banks, vegetation cover, density and age structure of mimosa stands were compared using data collected at nine sites where Carmenta mimosa was present and eight sites where it was initially absent. 2. Mimosa seed rain was negatively correlated with Carmenta mimosa damage and declined by more than 90% at the highest Carmenta mimosa densities. Seed banks also declined with Carmenta mimosa damage. 3. Percentage cover of competing vegetation was significantly higher under stands defoliated by Carmenta mimosa and this inhibited mimosa seedling establishment and apparently increased the susceptibility of mimosa to fire, by increasing fuel loads beneath stands. 4. Four of the eight stands where Carmenta mimosa was absent expanded and none contracted. In contrast, none of the nine stands where Carmenta mimosa was present expanded and three contracted. Analysis of the age structure of mimosa stands indicated that contracting stands were typified by an absence of seedling regeneration. 5. In contrast to previous studies, no impact could be attributed to the flower feeder Coelocephalapion pigrae or to the stem-mining moth Neurostrota gunniella, whilst the bruchid Acanthoscelides puniceus consumed up to only c. 10% of seed. However, it is argued that, while these agents are unlikely to suppress dense mimosa thickets, they may reduce the rate mimosa can expand. 6. Synthesis and applications. By preventing stand regeneration, Carmenta mimosa is predicted to cause widespread reductions in mimosa populations and should therefore be redistributed to areas of mimosa where it is absent. Differences between the age structures of stands with Carmenta mimosa present may highlight how biological control could succeed for a suite of woody legume weeds with long-lived seed banks.																	0021-8901					DEC	2005	42	6					1054	1062		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01105.x							WOS:000233515200006

Ecological invasions are often associated with persistent changes to underlying ecological processes. Restoration of invaded communities is dependent on manipulation of these processes to favour the target species composition and impart resistance to further invasion. We applied these principles to extensively degraded grassy woodlands in temperate agricultural regions of Australia, where widespread invasion by mediterranean annuals is related to altered ecological processes such as soil nutrient cycling. 2. We investigated carbon supplementation and spring burns, in association with re-establishment of native perennial grasses, as potential management tools for manipulating nitrogen cycling, soil seed banks and establishment conditions in degraded woodland understoreys. Through these mechanisms we aimed to enhance native cover and increase resistance to invasion by exotic annuals. 3. In two contrasting degraded remnants, repeated sucrose applications temporarily reduced soil nitrate to inferred pre-European levels, which dramatically reduced growth of exotic annuals and enhanced native perennial abundance. Repeated spring burns did not reduce soil nitrate but reduced exotic annual grasses through effects on soil seed banks and/or establishment conditions. 4. Spring burns and carbon supplements both significantly enhanced establishment of Themeda australis, a dominant tussock grass prior to European settlement. Combinations of T. australis seed addition and either spring burning or carbon supplements enhanced native plant abundance more effectively than treatments without seed addition. 5. Within 18 months of their establishment, T. australis seedlings significantly reduced soil nitrate in some treatments, providing a preliminary indication that re-establishment of a dense sward of this species may restore ecosystem function to a low-nitrate state that favours native perennials over exotic annuals. 6. Synthesis and applications. Ecological restoration can be viewed as targeted intervention in species-environment interactions, whereby ecological conditions are manipulated to enhance establishment or vigour of key species, and these species in turn help restore ecological processes that favour the target species composition. In grassy ecosystems re-establishing a perennial sward of appropriate native tussock grasses may be critical for restoring pre-disturbance nitrogen cycles and improving resistance to invasion by exotic annuals. Carbon supplements and spring burns facilitate this process through complementary mechanisms.

J	Osumi, K				Osumi, K			Reciprocal distribution of two congeneric trees, Betula platyphylla var. japonica and Betula maximowicziana, in a landscape dominated by anthropogenic disturbances in northeastern Japan	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Information has been compiled on disturbance regimes and the life-history characteristics of Betula platyphylla var. japonica (Miq.) Hara and B. maximowicziana Regel to investigate the impact of humans on the present distribution patterns of these two congeneric tree species. Location The study area is in the central region of the northern Kitakami Mountain Range, located in the northeast of Honshu Island, Japan. Methods First, the present distributions of B. maximowicziana and B. platyphylla var. japonica were mapped at the landscape scale. To examine the factors affecting the distribution patterns, topographic features and past land use were taken into account. Second, life-history traits of both species were clarified at various growth stages either by fieldwork or through a literature search. Previous studies have provided some information on seed production, seed dispersal, seedling dynamics, sprouting, and growth. In the present study, field observations and experiments were conducted regarding seed-bank formation, size and age at reproduction, and the life span of canopy trees. Results Betula platyphylla var. japonica and B. maximowicziana were spatially segregated in the studied landscape (14,000 ha). The distribution of each species was correlated more strongly with land use at the beginning of the twentieth century than with site environmental factors such as altitude or slope angle. Betula platyphylla var. japonica was distributed more frequently on former grasslands, whereas B. maximowicziana was almost exclusively limited to past old-growth forests. As typical pioneers, the two species showed similar life-history traits but differed in several critical points. Betula platyphylla var. japonica has a vigorous sprouting ability, which might increase its resistance to burning and logging, whereas B. maximowicziana forms a persistent seed bank in the soil, indicating an advantage in regenerating in disturbances found in forest communities. Other critical differences were detected in age-related characteristics such as minimum age of reproduction and life span. Main conclusions The earlier reproductive maturity and the shorter life span of B. platyphylla var. japonica indicate a shorter population cycle than that for B. maximowicziana. The latter would be excluded from grasslands that were burned frequently, as a result of the longer time span before initial reproduction and its poor sprouting ability. In contrast, B. platyphylla var. japonica would be excluded from old-growth forests, where disturbance was infrequent, owing to its shorter life span and lack of a persistent seed bank.																	0305-0270					DEC	2005	32	12					2057	2068		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01368.x							WOS:000233408500002						
J	Hill, NM; Vander Kloet, SP				Hill, NM; Vander Kloet, SP			Longevity of experimentally buried seed in Vaccinium: relationship to climate, reproductive factors and natural seed banks	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The fleshy fruited species of Vaccinium are known for their spatial dispersal ability but have generally been found to have poor representation in soil seed banks. 2 A buried seed experiment was conducted with 28 species of Vaccinium, in which seed lots were exhumed at intervals for up to 17 years. Mean species seed longevity was 8.65 years. For five species that persisted in soil for 15-17 years, regression indicates survival times of more than 20 years. 3 Climatic factors (particularly annual temperature range in the centre of the species' distribution range) alone accounted for 42% of the variation in seed longevity and reproductive variables for 55%. 4 Models of fruit dispersal speed (rapid/tardy) demonstrated the link between spatial and temporal (seed longevity) dispersal and between spatial dispersal and habitat affinity (open/closed) of a species. The majority (87%) of species belonged to two of the four possible syndromes (rapid fruit dispersal/long-term seed persistence or tardy dispersal/short-term persistence); 84% of the former were open habitat species. 5 Seed bank density is a function of seed potential longevity, seed rain and soil conditions. Regions that support species having greatest potential longevity have the smallest seed banks. Annual temperature range was positively correlated with potential longevity but negatively correlated with actual seed bank densities. 6 Lack of recruitment via seed in Vaccinium species in arctic regions may limit genetic variability in these clonal plants and impede population responses to climate changes.																	0022-0477					DEC	2005	93	6					1167	1176		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01034.x							WOS:000233287500013						
J	Handley, RJ; Davy, AJ				Handley, RJ; Davy, AJ			Temperature effects on seed maturity and dormancy cycles in an aquatic annual, Najas marina, at the edge of its range	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Najas marina is a summer annual of shallow lakes that reaches its distributional limit in the Norfolk Broads of eastern England. Seeds are shed in autumn and overwinter in lake sediments. 2 We investigated the influence of growing-season length on seed maturity and germinability and the cumulative effects of winter temperatures on patterns of germinability. Seeds were stratified for up to 1 year and tested for germinability at 4-week intervals. Data-loggers recorded temperatures simultaneously at the field site and in the cold room. Cumulative temperature below a threshold (thermal time) was used to relate behaviour in cold storage to phenology. 3 Most seeds were dormant at collection. Cold storage of imbibed seed resulted in loss of dormancy. The proportion of non-dormant seeds peaked after a cold treatment equivalent to one winter, i.e. coinciding with favourable temperatures for germination in the field. Continued cold stratification resulted in a cycle of secondary dormancy and its subsequent relief; the thermal time characterizing the second, lower, peak in germinability coincided approximately with that attained in the field in the second spring after collection. 4 Shortening the growing season of Najas marina, by collecting material before natural senescence was complete, reduced the proportion of mature seeds, lowered average germinability and increased germination times. 5 The thermal capacity of water bodies causes a lag in spring warming, whereas declining light becomes limiting in autumn. Najas marina is crucially dependent on the length of growing season to produce sufficient viable seed. A low-temperature requirement to break seed dormancy prevents inappropriate autumn germination. In a prolonged winter (necessarily followed by a shorter growing season), a significant proportion of seed would go into secondary dormancy and remain in the seed bank until the second spring. 6 In annual plants, such requirements for warm summers and cold winters could contribute to a continental-climate distribution in northern Europe. In the case of Najas marina this might explain its limit at the eastern extremity of England and thus its rarity.

To determine whether there were differences in the persistence of plants inhabiting remnant patches in contrasting landscape types we examined the local extinction of grassland plants along an urban-rural gradient in western Victoria, Australia. 2 Thirty small grassland remnants that had been comprehensively surveyed between 1979 and 1990 were intensively re-surveyed. A total of 289 (26%) of the 1104 plant populations present in the 1980s were not relocated and were presumed to be locally extinct. The proportion of populations lost differed along the gradient, with higher local extinction rates at patches in urban (37%) and peri-urban landscapes (27%) than those in the rural landscape (20%). 3 We calculated the probability of local extinction of species in urban, peri-urban and rural landscapes using Bayesian logistic regression models. Across all plant functional traits examined, species had a consistently higher probability of local extinction in the urban landscape. 4 Species that were geophytes or hemicryptophytes with a flat rosette and species with seeds dispersed by wind or ants had substantially increased risks of extinction in the urban landscape. Low seed mass, the lack of vegetative reproduction and the presence of a soil-stored seed bank increased the probability of local extinction in all landscapes. Regionally rare species had a higher probability of local extinction in rural and peri-urban landscapes but rarity had little influence on extinction risk in urban landscapes. 5 Urbanization has a strong influence on the species composition of urban grasslands and substantially increases the probability of local extinction of plants with particular combinations of functional traits.

J	Angeler, DG; Garcia, G				Angeler, DG; Garcia, G			Using emergence from soil propagule banks as indicators of ecological integrity in wetlands: advantages and limitations	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Wetland soils contain a reservoir of dormant plant seeds and invertebrate eggs, collectively termed the seed or propagule bank, which integrate spatiotemporal variation at various levels of biology (genetic, phenotypic, species, and community). Several recent studies suggest that anthropogenic physical or chemical stressors may disrupt the process of emergence from propagule banks. This process is often the single most important colonization process in wetlands isolated geographically from other water bodies. The potential for disruption of emergence can be exploited as a useful indicator of anthropogenic stress. The aim of our paper is to provide a conceptual framework that shows the advantages and limitations of wetland propagule banks as indicators of anthropogenic stress or ecological integrity. This framework describes mechanistic responses of propagule banks to stressors and makes recommendations on experimental approaches for the evaluation of cause-effect relationships between stressors and propagule bank responses. This indicator could help bridge the current gap between basic and applied wetland ecology and could find application in future wetland management and restoration strategies.

J	Mou, P; Jones, RH; Guo, DL; Lister, A				Mou, P; Jones, RH; Guo, DL; Lister, A			Regeneration strategies, disturbance and plant interactions as organizers of vegetation spatial patterns in a pine forest	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												To determine how vegetation pattern in early successional forests may be related to plant traits and types of disturbance, we measured percent cover of individual taxa annually in a South Carolina Pinus elliottii forest, starting one year before, and ending four years after harvest and tree girdling disturbances were applied. The 17 most important taxa surveyed were grouped into four regeneration strategies chosen a priori, and the spatial patterns of these groups and of the soil were investigated using global variability, semivariograms and kriged maps. We also examined spatial correlations across years, across taxa, and between species and soil disturbance. Seed bank taxa represented by Dichanthelium spp. increased rapidly and formed large patches, and then quickly declined. Taxa that regenerate by newly dispersed seeds, represented by Rhus copallina and Rubus spp. occurred at first in a few patches, and became widespread later. Stump sprouters, represented by Quercus spp. and Myrica cerifera, had rapid increases in cover, but their spatial patterns were largely determined by their pre-disturbance patterns. Prunus serotina, which relies on both sprouting and dispersed seed, had moderate cover and a random distribution. Within-species temporal correlation of spatial pattern was lower in girdled than in harvested plots, and was not clearly related to regeneration strategy. Forest floor disturbance was patchy and affected the pattern of Dichanthelium spp. in the harvested plots. Negative correlations between herbs and woody plants in harvested plots reflected the role of biotic (i.e., successional) filters on vegetation pattern. Surprisingly, no spatial correlations were detected between the nitrogen fixer, Myrica cerifera and other taxa in this N-limited system. In comparing the spatial and temporal patterns, we found kriged maps more informative than analysis of semivariograms alone. The maps and correlation statistics demonstrated that regeneration traits, spatial patterns of soil disturbances, and interactions among taxa influence dynamics of the spatial patterns of the plants. We also demonstrated that disturbance types affected the importance and interactions among these three factors, and caused different spatial patterns of the plant taxa.

J	Lloret, F; Estevan, H; Vayreda, J; Terradas, J				Lloret, F; Estevan, H; Vayreda, J; Terradas, J			Fire regenerative syndromes of forest woody species across fire and climatic gradients	OECOLOGIA												Community resilience after fire is determined by species' ability to regenerate through two main mechanisms growth of new sprouts (resprouter species) and germination from surviving seed banks or from seeds arriving from neighbouring populations (seeder species). Both the mechanisms are present in Mediterranean communities. The occurrence of both the types in a community depends on fire history and the bio-geographical history determining the available species pool. Regenerative traits also covary with other functional attributes associated with resource acquisition and stress tolerance. As post-fire regenerative responses can be related to various ecological factors other than fire, we tested the hypothesis of a different proportional representation of post-fire regenerative syndromes in forest woody species along a climatic gradient in Catalonia (NE Spain) ranging from Mediterranean to temperate-boreal climates. Specifically, we expected seeder species to become less common with colder and moister conditions while resprouters would not be so influenced by the climatic gradient. We also tested the hypothesis of change in the relative abundance of regenerative syndromes in relation to recent fire history. We analysed a large database obtained from extensive forestry surveys and remote sensing fire records. After correction for spatial autocorrelation, we found an increase in the proportion of seeder species under more Mediterranean conditions and a decrease in fire-sensitive species (with no efficient mechanisms of post-fire recovery) in moister conditions. Resprouter species were similarly present across the whole gradient. A similar pattern was observed after excluding recently burnt plots. Therefore, post-fire regenerative syndromes segregate along the climatic gradient. Recent fires reduced the occurrence of fire-sensitive species and increased the proportion of seeder species. No significant effect was observed on resprouter species. Fire has a sorting effect, shaping the occurrence of species with different regenerative traits. Overall, fire seems to explain better the variability of the proportion of fire-sensitive species and climate the variability of seeder species. In addition, other factors (forestry practices and the covariation between regenerative and functional attributes) are likely to contribute to the regional pattern of regenerative syndromes.

J	Rey, F; Isselin-Nondedeu, F; Bedecarrats, A				Rey, F; Isselin-Nondedeu, F; Bedecarrats, A			Vegetation dynamics on sediment deposits upstream of bioengineering works in mountainous marly gullies in a Mediterranean climate (Southern Alps, France)	PLANT AND SOIL												Current erosion-control studies in mountainous catchments emphasize the effectiveness of bioengineering works in constructing vegetation barriers that are designed to trap and permanently retain sediment upstream of such barriers. Plant establishment and succession should result in colonisation of these sediment deposits, thereby improving the trapping capacity of the works. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the natural vegetation to colonise and grow on sediment accumulated upstream of 29 bioengineering works. They were constructed on the channel bottom of two marly gullies in the mountainous Southern French Alps region, which has a Mediterranean climate. We analysed the soil seed bank in sediment deposits after a germination experiment conducted in the laboratory, where soil cores were placed in a non-limited water condition. We also determined the standing vegetation which developed on the sediment deposits on field sites over 2 years of drought (2003 and 2004). The results show that the number of plants was 80/m(2) on average in the samples studied in the laboratory, vs. 31/m(2) in 2003 and 20/m(2) in 2004 on the field sites, with a total diversity of 40 species. Therefore, despite 2 years of drought, natural plant colonisation occurred on the sediment deposits. An improvement in soil water conditions slightly increases the capacity of the sediment deposits to allow seed germination. However, despite the initial success in vegetation colonisation, plant abundance and recovery were rather low, which suggests that vegetation established itself very slowly.

The objective of this paper was to determine the significance of seed bank in vegetation restoration of sand dunes. The results showed that (1) average seed density decreased from stabilized sand dune to interdune lowland of stabilized sand dune, to interdune lowland of active sand dune, and to active sand dune; (2) horizontally, along the transect from interdune lowland to ecotone and to sand dune top, a 'V' shaped pattern was presented in the active dune system, and a reverse 'V' shaped pattern in the stabilized sand dune system; (3) vertically, the proportion (accounting for the total seeds) of seeds found in 0-20 mm soil profile decreased from stabilized sand dune to interdune lowland of stabilized sand dune, to interdune lowland of active sand dune, and to active sand dune. The same order was also found in 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm soil profiles; (4) the Sokal and Sneath similarity indices in the species-composition between soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation were ranked as: the stabilized sand dune (24%) > the interdune lowland of active sand dune (21%) > the interdune lowland of stabilized sand dune (18%) > the active sand dune (5%); and (5) vegetation restoration of active sand dunes depends on the dispersal of seeds from nearby plant communities on the interdune lowlands. Much effort must be made to preserve the lowlands, as lowlands are the most important seed reservoir in the active sand dune field.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				DEC	2005	277	1-2					175	184		10.1007/s11104-005-6836-6							WOS:000233527700016						
J	Li, XR; Jia, XH; Long, LQ; Zerbe, S				Li, XR; Jia, XH; Long, LQ; Zerbe, S			Effects of biological soil crusts on seed bank, germination and establishment of two annual plant species in the Tengger Desert (N China)	PLANT AND SOIL												The presence of biological soil crusts can affect the germination and survival of vascular plants, but the reasons are not well investigated. We have conducted a field investigation and greenhouse experiments to test the effect of crusts on two desert annual plants, which occur on the stabilized dunes of the Tengger Desert in N China. The results showed that biological soil crusts negatively influenced the seed bank of Eragrostis poaeoides and Bassia dasyphylla. The important effect of biological soil crusts on seed germination and establishment were performed indirectly through reducing the amount of germinating seeds. Field investigation and experimental results with regard to the seed bank indicated that higher seedling density was found in disturbed crust soil and bare soil surface than in intact crust soils. Greenhouse experiments showed that the effects of biological soil crusts on germination and establishment of the two plants are not obvious in moist condition, while disturbed crusts are more favorable to seed germination in dry treatment. Significant differences in biomass were found between disturbed crust soil and bare soil. Survival and growth of the two annual plants were enhanced in both algal and moss crusts during the season of rainfall or in moist environment, but crusts did not affect seedling survival in the dry period. The small seeded E. poaeoides has higher germination than larger-seeded B. dasyphylla in crust soils, but B. dasyphylla has a relatively higher survival rate than E. poaeoides in crust soils.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				DEC	2005	277	1-2					375	385		10.1007/s11104-005-8162-4							WOS:000233527700033

We studied the intensity and the relative impact of negative feedback on clonal growth and seed germination of Scirpus holoschoenus, a 'ring' forming sedge dominant in grazed grassland, and the consequences for species coexistence. The structure of aboveground tussocks was described. A Lithium tracer assessed belowground distribution of functional roots. Seed rain and seedling emergence were compared for different positions in relation to Scirpus tussocks. Soil bioassays were used to compare growth on soil taken from inside and outside Scirpus tussocks of four coexisting species (Mentha acquatica, Pulicaria dysenterica, Scirpus holoschoenus and Dittrichia viscosa). We also compared plant performance of dominant plant species inside and outside Scirpus tussocks in the field. The 'ring' shaped tussocks of S. holoschoenus were generated by centrifugal rhizome development. Roots were functional and abundant under the tillers and extending outside the tussocks. The large roots mats that were present in the inner tussock zone were almost all dead. Seedling emergence and growth both showed a strong negative feedback of Scirpus in the inner tussock zone. Scirpus clonal development strongly reduced grass biomass. In the degenerated tussock zone, Pulicaria and Mentha mortality was lower, and biomass of individual plants and seed production were higher. This positive indirect interaction could be related to species-specific affinity to soil conditions generated by Scirpus, and interspecific competitive release in the degenerated tussock zone. We conclude that Scirpus negative feedback affects its seedling emergence and growth contributing to the development of the degenerated inner tussock zone. Moreover, this enhances species coexistence through facilitative interaction because the colonization of the inner tussock zone is highly species-specific.

J	Evans, MEK; Dennehy, JJ				Evans, MEK; Dennehy, JJ			Germ banking: Bet-hedging and varlable release from egg and seed dormancy	QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY												Many species produce eggs or seeds that refrain from hatching despite developmental preparedness and favorable environmental conditions. Instead, these propagules hatch in intervals over long periods. Such variable hatch or germination tactics may represent bet-hedging against future catastrophes. Empiricists have independently recognized these approaches in diverse species. Terms such as seed banking, delayed egg hatching, and embryonic diapause have been used to describe these tactics, but connections between fields of study have been Tare. Here we suggest a general term, germ banking, to incorporate all previous terms, unifying many seemingly disparate biological strategies under a single definition. We define the phenomenon of germ banking and use several biological examples to illustrate it. We then discuss the different causes of variation in emergence timing, delineate which constitute germ banking, and distinguish between germ banking and optimal timing of diapause. The wide-ranging consequences of germ banking are discussed, including modification of the age structure of a population, the alteration of microevolutionary dynamics, the migration of alleles from the past, the maintenance of genetic and species diversity, and the promotion of species coexistence. We end by posing questions to direct future research.

J	Simmons, MT				Simmons, MT			Bullying the bullies: The selective control of an exotic, invasive annual (Rapistrum rugosum) by oversowing with a competitive native species (Gaillardia pulchella)	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Mechanical, biological, and chemical attempts to control invasive plants can be expensive, ecologically damaging, and frequently unsuccessful. This study proposes using the intrinsic biological attributes of the threatened plant community by artificially increasing the density of competitive native species to selectively suppress the growth of the invasive. Evidence from agricultural weed control suggests that oversowing infested areas with species with biological traits similar to those of the invasive species not only reduces productivity of the invasive species but also may eliminate environmental damage associated with standard control techniques. Annual bastard cabbage (Rapistrum rugosum), a Eurasian exotic, is an invader of native plant communities in the continental United States. Control with herbicides has been problematic due to high mortality of adjacent native species and subsequent perpetuation of a disturbed state that facilitates further regeneration of R. rugosum from the seed bank. In a randomized field experiment, sowing native Indian blanket (Gaillardia pulchella) over established seedling colonies of R. rugosum resulted in significant reduction of R. rugosum productivity (F= 3.43; p < 0.05). The highest sowing rate of G. pulchella resulted in a 72% reduction in aboveground productivity of R. rugosum that translated to an estimated 83% decrease in seed set, without significant suppression of adjacent native species. It is proposed that enriching threatened or infested plant communities with selected native species with matching phenologies and competitive characteristics has advantages over conventional control methods in that (1) it reduces the threat to nontarget organisms; (2) once installed, the species could self-regenerate; and (3) it does not perpetuate a disturbed (early-successional) state that might aggravate the problem. This may serve as an alternative technique to protect and restore native plant communities.																	1061-2971					DEC	2005	13	4					609	615		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00078.x							WOS:000233437000005						
J	Moyes, AB; Witter, MS; Gamon, JA				Moyes, AB; Witter, MS; Gamon, JA			Restoration of native perennials in a California annual grassland after prescribed spring burning and solarization	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Grasslands dominated by exotic annual grasses have replaced native perennial vegetation types in vast areas of California. Prescribed spring fires can cause a temporary replacement of exotic annual grasses by native and non-native forbs, but generally do not lead to recovery of native perennials, especially where these have been entirely displaced for many years. Successful reintroduction of perennial species after fire depends on establishment in the postfire environment. We studied the effects of vegetation changes after an April fire on competition for soil moisture, a key factor in exotic annual grass dominance. As an alternative to fire, solarization effectively kills seeds of most plant species but with a high labor investment per area. We compared the burn to solarization in a study of establishment and growth of seeds and transplants of the native perennial grass Purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra) and coastal sage species California sagebrush (Artemisia californica). After the fire, initial seed bank and seedling densities and regular percent cover and soil moisture (0-20 cm) data were collected in burned and unburned areas. Burned areas had 96% fewer viable seeds of the dominant annual grass, Ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), leading to replacement by forbs from the seed bank, especially non-native Black mustard (Brassica nigra). In the early growing season, B. diandrus dominating unburned areas consistently depleted soil moisture to a greater extent between rains than forbs in burned areas. However, B. diandrus senesced early, leaving more moisture available in unburned areas after late-season rains. Nassella pulchra and A. californica established better on plots treated with fire and/or solarization than on untreated plots. We conclude that both spring burns and solarization can produce conditions where native perennials can establish in annual grasslands. However, the relative contribution of these treatments to restoration appears to depend on the native species being reintroduced, and the long-term success of these initial restoration experiments remains to be determined.

REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Ants may play an important role on vegetation dynamics, especially in arid and semiarid environments, where they call consume a high proportion of the produced seeds. Although some works have analysed the influence of seed predation by ants on the density of vegetation in Mediterranean pastures, there are no studies on the influence of ant activity upon the floristic composition of the vegetation and the soil seed banks in this kind of ecosystem. We have Studied the effect of ant exclusion on the floristic composition of the vegetation and the soil seed bank in a Mediterranean pasture of central Spain. We sampled the floristic composition of the pasture during 2002 and 2003 springs and also we collected soil seed bank samples in autumn 2002. Floristic composition of soil seed banks was estimated by means of greenhouse germination. Cerastium semidecandrum seeds were almost four times more abundant in the plots subjected to ant exclusion than in those with ant activity. Due to the high spatial heterogeneity shown by soil seed banks, we have corrected the differences found between the autumn Soil seed banks subjected to different ant treatments by using the floristic composition of the pasture community in the previous spring, as it was the primary source of the seeds collected in autumn. We found significant differences between the floristic composition of the soil seed banks subjected to ant exclusion and control treatments. However, no effects where found when the same procedure was used to detect ant effects oil the spring adult community, highlighting the necessity of longer time spans for these pastures to manifest changes taking place at the soil seed bank stage.																	0716-078X					DEC	2005	78	4					615	622									WOS:000234645700002						
J	Bowers, JE				Bowers, JE			New evidence for persistent or transient seed banks in three Sonoran Desert cacti	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Seedlings of Ferocaclus wislizeni and Mammillaria grahamii, 2 common cactus species ill tire northern Sonoran Desert, emerged under protective cages that had been left in place for 6 years after all initial sowing of numerous Carnegiea gigantea and E wislizeni seeds. because no seeds were sown in the interim, Mammillaria and Ferocactus seedlings must have emerged from persistent seed banks. Mammillaria seeds evidently survived in or oil the soil as long as 6 years, forming a long-term persistent seed bank, and Ferocactus seeds apparently survived tip to 3 years, forming a short-term persistent seed bank. No Carnegiea seedlings emerged, confirming that this species has a transient seed bank This is the first evidence for a between-year seed bank in M, grahamii and the first confirmation of a between-year seed bank in F wislizeni.																	0038-4909					DEC	2005	50	4					482	487		10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050[0482:NEFPOT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000234496100011						
J	Havens, KE; Gawlik, DE				Havens, KE; Gawlik, DE			Lake Okeechobee conceptual ecological model	WETLANDS												With a surface area of nearly 1,800 square kilometers, Lake Okeechobee is a prominent central feature of the South Florida aquatic ecosystem. The lake provides regional flood protection, supports a prized recreational fishery, provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and regional wading bird populations, and is a source of fresh water for irrigation, drinking, and restoration of downstream ecosystems. The main stressors on Lake Okeechobee are (1) large inputs of phosphorus from agricultural and other anthropogenic land uses in the watershed, (2) unnatural variation in water levels due to channelization of inflows and dike containment, and (3) rapid expansion of non-native plants. Ecological effects are complicated due to three distinct in-lake zones with different water chemistry, physical properties, and biota. A central pelagic zone has turbid, nutrient-rich water and phytoplankton dominance; a shallow south and western near-shore zone has submerged plant or phytoplankton dominance (at low vs. high water levels, respectively); and a western littoral zone is dominated by emergent wetland plants. Changes in water level influence the flow of nutrients between zones, thereby creating a synergistic effect between stressors. Under high water conditions, there is considerable advective transport of nutrients from the pelagic zone into the littoral zone. Under low water conditions, the littoral zone is cut off hydrologically and is a rainfall-driven oligotrophic wetland. Low water also facilitates drying and wildfires in the littoral zone, which in turn has an influence on expansion of non-native plants and recovery of native plants from buried seed banks. All of these factors influence fish, wading birds, and other animals, which depend on littoral and near-shore plant communities for nesting and foraging habitat. This paper describes our current knowledge of these complex processes, the lake's expected responses to ongoing and planned restoration programs, and key areas of uncertainty requiring future research.																	0277-5212					DEC	2005	25	4					908	925		10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0908:LOCEM]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000234192800010						
J	Roovers, P; Gulinck, H; Hermy, M				Roovers, P; Gulinck, H; Hermy, M			Experimental assessment of initial revegetation on abandoned paths in temperate deciduous forest	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Do soil treatments and addition of seed facilitate rapid vegetation restoration on forest paths excluded from trampling? Location: Six mesophilic mixed deciduous Querco-Fagetea forests in Flanders, northern Belgium. Methods: Enclosures on paths were excluded from trampling by fencing. In a full factorial design, plots were subjected to seeding, soil scarification, addition of organic material and inoculum. The following two years, seedling establishment and growth were sampled during spring and summer. Soil treatments and seeding effect was tested and seedling occurrence was analysed in relation to species' origin. Results: Spontaneous revegetation was significant in all plots since fencing. Throughout the observation period seedling cover and height continued to increase. Seeding had an overall effect on seedling density, cover and height. Some soil treatment interactions significantly enhance revegetation, although each individual soil treatment had no significant effect. Regardless of the seeded individuals, invading species mostly originated from the surrounding area and the seed bank. Conclusion: The preliminary results of this experiment imply that seeding is the only treatment which has a positive effect on revegetation success in all circumstances, provided that the exclusion from trampling is effective.

Location: 'Les Pairees', province of Luxembourg,Belgium. Methods: The seed bank and the above-ground vegetation were surveyed in three adjacent stands, previously forming a unique calcareous grassland: a 60-year-old Pinus forest, a four-year-old clear-cutting and a typical calcareous grassland. Floristic diversity was compared among stands and between vegetation and seed bank. Results: The species richness of the vegetation and the seed bank was significantly lower in the Pinus forest. More floristic similarities were found between the clear-cutting and the calcareous grassland. Seed bank was essentially transient, dominated by annual species. Its correspondence with the above-ground vegetation was weak. Conclusion: Very few calcareous grassland species have persisted in the Pinus stand. Four years after clear-cutting, the stand was nearing restoration towards a calcareous grassland. Seed longevity in the soil was not the most explicative factor. Dispersal of propagules from adjacent sources was also important.																	1402-2001					NOV	2005	8	2					167	174		10.1658/1402-2001(2005)008[0167:VASBIA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000235079600007						
J	Amrein, D; Rusterholz, HP; Baur, B				Amrein, D; Rusterholz, HP; Baur, B			Disturbance of suburban Fagus forests by recreational activities: Effects on soil characteristics, above-ground vegetation and seed bank	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: How does recreational disturbance (human trampling) affect soil characteristics, the performance of the understorey vegetation, and the density and species composition of the soil seed bank in Fagus sylvatica forests? Location: Suburban forests near Basel, northwestern Switzerland. Methods: We compared various soil characteristics and the performance of the understorey vegetation in six beech forest areas frequently disturbed by recreational activities with those in six undisturbed control areas, in spring 2003. In the same forest areas, the soil seed bank was investigated using the seedling emergence method. Samples were obtained from soil cores in January 2003. Results: We found substantial changes in soil compaction, above-ground vegetation and in the soil seed bank due to recreational activities. In frequently visited areas, soil compaction was enhanced which caused a decrease in cover, height and species richness of both herb and shrub layers. Compared with control areas, the number of trampling-tolerant species of the seed bank was significantly higher in disturbed areas, and total species richness tended to be higher in disturbed than in control areas. Furthermore, the similarity in species composition between the above-ground vegetation and seed bank was significant lower in disturbed than in control areas. Conclusions: The intensive use of suburban forests for recreational activities, mainly picnicking, affects the vegetation of natural beech forests. Our study indicates that a restoration of degraded forest areas from the soil seed bank would result in a substantial change of the vegetation composition.																	1402-2001					NOV	2005	8	2					175	182		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2005.tb00643.x							WOS:000235079600008						
J	Dorland, E; Hart, MAC; Vermeer, ML; Bobbink, R				Dorland, E; Hart, MAC; Vermeer, ML; Bobbink, R			Assessing the success of wet heath restoration by combined sod cutting and liming	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Can combined sod cutting and liming successfully restore species composition of degraded wet heaths? Location: The Netherlands. Methods: The effects of sod cutting with or without liming on plant species composition were studied in two degraded wet heath areas. Seeds and seedlings of Arnica montana were put out in the treated plots to test the suitability of the restored soil conditions. In addition, seed banks of both degraded areas were studied. Results: Germination, growth and survival of Arnica montana were significantly greater after sod cutting and liming compared to sod cutting alone. At the end of the four-year study period, the number of endangered wet heath species was significantly greater in the sod-cut plots than in the untreated vegetation. Acid-tolerant species were especially positively affected. Additional liming only slightly increased the total number of species over the two-year study period and the number of endangered species did not increase. Viable seeds of most of the endangered species were absent in the seed banks of both areas. Conclusions: Sod cutting is sufficient for the return of acid-tolerant, endangered wet heath species of early successional stages, because their seeds are still present in the seed bank. In contrast, acid-sensitive species likely depend on combined sod cutting and liming, as they need the weakly buffered soil conditions created by these restoration measures. However, successful restoration of formerly species-rich wet heaths is limited significantly by the absence of seeds of the target species in the seed banks. Therefore, re-introduction of wet heath target species in areas with limited seed availability should be seriously considered.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				NOV	2005	8	2					209	218		10.1658/1402-2001(2005)008[0209:ATSOWH]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000235079600012						
J	Mata, DI; Moreno-Casasola, P				Mata, DI; Moreno-Casasola, P			Effect of in situ storage, light, and moisture on the germination of two Wetland tropical trees	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seed germination was evaluated for Annona glabra L. and Pachira aquatica Aubl. in the wetland conditions of La Mancha, Veracruz, Mexico. These species have recalcitrant seeds and hydrochoral dispersal. Germination experiments were carried out under varying moisture (high, middle, and low) and light (below canopy and open sky) levels as well as after being stored in contrasting natural conditions. Seeds were stored both floating in water and buried in wetland soil for 15, 30, 60, and 90 days. P. aquatica seeds germinated faster in low and medium moisture, regardless of light intensity. After 45 days, for example, they exhibited 87-73% germination in medium-moisture/canopy and low-moisture/canopy treatments, respectively. In high moisture, seeds reached similar percentages after 60 days (80%). Storage by burial caused the death of seeds regardless the time they spent underground, while those stored in water germinated at a rate of over 90%. A. glabra seeds germinated better (98%) in low-moisture/sunny conditions. As to storage, they responded favorably to both burial and water techniques but germinated more readily in treatments that involved a long storage period. Evaluation of the germination behavior of A. glabra and P. aquatica seeds subject to varying in situ storage and germination conditions illustrates the response capacity of each species during early phases of development.

J	Keeley, JE; Fotheringham, CJ; Baer-Keeley, M				Keeley, JE; Fotheringham, CJ; Baer-Keeley, M			Factors affecting plant diversity during post-fire recovery and succession of mediterranean-climate shrublands in California, USA	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Plant community diversity measured as species richness, is typically highest in the early post-fire years in California shrublands. However, this generalization is overly simplistic and the present study demonstrates that diversity is determined by a complex of temporal and spatial effects. Ninety sites distributed across southern California were studied for 5 years after a series of fires. Characteristics of the disturbance event, in this case fire severity, call alter post-fire diversity, both decreasing and increasing diversity, depending on life form. Spatial variability in resource availability is an important factor explaining patterns of diversity, and there is a complex interaction between landscape features and life form. Temporal variability in resource availability affects diversity, and the diversity peak in the immediate post-fire year (or two) appears to be driven by factors different from subsequent diversity peaks. Early post-fire diversity is influenced by life-history specialization, illustrated by species that spend the bulk of their life cycle as a dormant seed bank, which is then triggered to germinate by fire. Resource fluctuations, precipitation in particular, may be associated with subsequent post-fire diversity peaks. These later peaks in diversity comprise a flora that is compositionally different from the immediate post-fire flora, and their presence may be due to mass effects from population expansion of local populations in adjacent burned areas.																	1366-9516					NOV	2005	11	6					525	537		10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00200.x							WOS:000233565700006						
J	Legendre, P; Borcard, D; Peres-Neto, PR				Legendre, P; Borcard, D; Peres-Neto, PR			Analyzing beta diversity: Partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data (presence-absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base functions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination; hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses about the variation of community composition among sites. The theoretical developments and simulation results led to the following observations: (1) the variance of a community composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the variance of the community composition table nor a measure of beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should not be used to study the variation in community composition among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in community composition explained by the raw-data approach, and (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition among sites, is canonical partitioning. The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses, such as the variation in beta diversity among groups of sites. Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting models to similarity decay plots.

J	Takagawa, S; Nishihiro, J; Washitani, I				Takagawa, S; Nishihiro, J; Washitani, I			Safe sites for establishment of Nymphoides peltata seedlings for recovering the population from the soil seed bank	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The population of the endangered plant species Nymphoides peltata in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, has been declining drastically recently, and seedlings that emerge from the remaining soil seed bank have entirely failed to establish. The decline has followed artificial control of the water level in the lake. To examine the environmental requirements at the seedling establishment stage, we investigated the survival and growth of emerged seedlings at various microsites on the lakeshore by manipulating environmental conditions such as exposure to waves, inundation, and light availability so as to include the conditions of the presumed safe sites. Seedling survival at the early stage was affected most by environmental variables relating to the susceptibility to inundation. Survival until seedling establishment was profoundly affected by light availability as well as by susceptibility to inundation. In all, 136 genets were established in quadrats less prone to inundation and with sufficient light availability, which is consistent with the presumed safe-site characteristics of the original water regime: bare ground exposed during the spring water-level drawdown. Recovering the original water regime with seasonal drawdown will be indispensable for recovering a self-sustainable population. However, as first-aid measures, active restoration efforts through adaptive management using the remnant soil seed bank are urgently needed before the soil seed bank becomes exhausted.																	0912-3814					NOV	2005	20	6					661	667		10.1007/s11284-005-0079-0							WOS:000233245400005						
J	Facelli, JM; Chesson, P; Barnes, N				Facelli, JM; Chesson, P; Barnes, N			Differences in seed biology of annual plants in arid lands: A key ingredient of the storage effect	ECOLOGY												We used a combination of field studies and laboratory experiments to characterize key ecological aspects of the seed biology and soil seed bank dynamics of annual plant communities in chenopod shrublands of South Australia. A sequential study of the soil seed bank demonstrated seasonal and between-year variability in numbers and composition of the soil seed bank. Soil samples incubated under different temperature and watering regimes produced different communities, indicating that species respond differentially to various environmental combinations. Emergence was extremely low at low water availability and at high temperatures, even in trays with ample water. A high percentage of seeds of four out of five species buried in the field remained viable for two years, while the fifth, Carrichtera annua, showed a sharp decline in seed viability, reaching nearly zero survivorship. Our results indicate that, in this system, annual plant communities result from germination of a fraction of seeds present in the soil seed bank, when autumn or winter rainfalls occur. Because different species have different responses to various combinations of environmental conditions, the community composition varies from year to year. This variability is likely to be a component of coexistence through the storage effect.

J	Barrett, LG; He, TH; Lamont, BB; Krauss, SL				Barrett, LG; He, TH; Lamont, BB; Krauss, SL			Temporal patterns of genetic variation across a 9-year-old aerial seed bank of the shrub Banksia hookeriana (Proteaceae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The pattern of accumulation of genetic variation over time in seed banks is poorly understood. We examined the genetic structure of the aerial seed bank of Banksia hookeriana within a single 15-year-old population in fire-prone southwestern Australia, and compared genetic variation between adults and each year of a 9-year-old seed bank using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). B. hookeriana is well suited to the study of seed bank dynamics due to the canopy storage of its seeds, and because each annual crop can be identified. A total of 304 seeds from nine crop years and five maternal plants were genotyped, along with 113 plants from the adult population. Genetic variation, as assessed by the proportion of polymorphic markers (P-p) and Shannon's index (I), increased slightly within the seed bank over time, while gene diversity (H-j), did not change. P-p, I, and H-j all indicated that genetic variation within the seed bank quickly approached the maximal level detected. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that less than 4% of variation could be accounted for by variation among seeds produced in different years, whereas there was greater differentiation among maternal plants (12.7%), and among individual seeds produced by different maternal plants (83.4%). With increasing population age, offspring generated each year were slightly more outbred, as indicated by an increase in the mean number of nonmaternal markers per offspring. There were no significant differences for H-j or I between adults and the seed bank. Viability of seeds decreased with age, such that the viability of 9-year-old seeds was half that of 2-year-old seeds. These results suggest that variable fire frequencies have only limited potential to influence the amount of genetic variation stored within the seed bank of B. hookeriana.

Germination strategies of density-regulated desert annuals	OIKOS												Annual plants in unpredictable environments maintain dormant seeds to avoid extinction. Here, we present results for four desert annual species suggesting that germination rates are variable even in the absence of abiotic cues. Namely, seeds produced in a copious year had lower germination rates than seeds produced in drought years. Inspired by our data, we have extended previous bet-hedging models by including a structured seed bank. With density-dependence, the ESS (environmental stable strategy) involved a negative relationship between seed yield and subsequent germination probability. We suggest that heterogeneous germination rates are selected for by competition among seedlings after years with high seed production. In summary, our findings are suggestive of an intriguingly simple and effective mechanism that may allow annual plants to partly predict their future success.

J	de la Bandera, MC; Traveset, A				de la Bandera, MC; Traveset, A			Reproductive ecology of Thymelaea velutina (Thymelaeaceae)-Factors contributing to the maintenance of heterocarpy	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												Thymelaea velutina (Thymelaeaceae) is a dioecious shrub that presents a unique type of heterocarpy which consists of the simultaneous production of dry and fleshy fruits. It is endemic to the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean) and is found both in dunes and mountain areas. The goal of this study was to identify which factors influence the production of both fruit types, examining the variation of their effects at a spatio-temporal scale (comparing two localities in different years). Specifically, we investigated (1) whether pollen limitation influences the type of fruit produced, and (2) the possible differences in seed size, mass, dispersal capacity, seed predation, germination patterns and seedling survival between fruit types. We also examined if the production of fleshy fruits was modified with the application of gibberellins to reproductive branches. Although fleshy fruits were consistently more abundant than dry ones at both populations, their proportion was significantly higher at the site with greater precipitation. The addition of either pollen or gibberellins did not affect the proportion of each fruit type. Seeds in fleshy fruits are consistently larger, heavier and more likely to be dispersed than seeds in dry fruits, but germinability, germination rate and seedling survival was similar among fruit types. Heterocarpy in this species is currently maintained as there is no apparent factor that exerts any strong selective pressure on either fruit type. The two fruit types might even have different `functions', one serving especially for dispersal and population expansion and the other for producing a seed bank that ensures an eventual germination.

The Holocene vegetation has been influenced by spatially and temporally diverse patterns of both prehistoric human settlement and catastrophic volcanic events. We have hypothesized different landscape responses and recovery pathways to events during the last six millennia. Phytolith sequences on the coastal lowlands, the Willaumez Peninsula, and nearby island of Garua provide details of vegetational change and human interactions at different landscape scales since c. 5900 cal yr B.P. During this period four major volcanic eruptions (c. 5900, 3600, 1700 and 1400 cal yr B.P.) have disrupted the landscape. The evidence provides detailed descriptions of temporal and spatial patterning in the impacts and changes in the vegetation. In particular, vegetation responded differently from one event to another, reflecting both forest recovery from seed bank and shooting, and the influence of prehistoric people on recovering vegetation. Furthermore, after some events landscape recovery was moderately uniform, while after others there was considerable landscape partitioning. Although these differences largely relate to airfall tephra type, distribution and magnitude, the partitioning is more strongly influenced by human activity. (c) 2005 University of Washington.

We review the impacts of riparian invasions and identify factors limiting the recovery of natural vegetation following alien clearance. We propose a framework of strategic interventions for optimizing restoration success. The framework identifies abiotic and biotic barriers to restoration at the scales of catchments and local reaches. In highly transformed catchments, interventions at the reach scale may fail if important barriers at the catchment scale are not addressed. The extent to which propagule supply and microsite conditions inhibit vegetation recovery is unknown. We also know little of the relative importance of dispersing vegetative propagules, dispersing seeds and soil-stored seed banks in vegetation dynamics, particularly after severe disturbances such as dense invasion by alien plants. The importance of geomorphological and hydrological factors in mediating recovery of riparian vegetation has not been adequately explored for all climatic areas in South Africa. More research is needed to determine the influence of different alien species and clearing treatments on the recovery of riparian vegetation. The literature strongly suggests that in highly alien-transformed catchments, the re-introduction of riparian species is required to promote recovery and suppress re-invasion. However, such interventions are unlikely to be widely implemented unless the cost: benefit ratios are favourable.

J	Valleriani, A				Valleriani, A			Algebraic determination of the evolutionary stable germination fraction	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												In this article, we consider a bet-hedging model with density dependence for germination behavior of dormant seeds. We show how to compute accurate values of the evolutionary stable germination fraction using a method based on expansion around the average seed bank size. The expansion is made up to the fourth order and is expressed in terms of the first four moments of the distribution of the year-to-year variation in the average yield per adult plant. This method leads to a simple algebraic equation, which can be solved without recurring to simulations of the seed bank dynamics. We first show the analytical derivation under general assumptions about the effect of density dependence. We then test our results with a numerical analysis where an explicit form of the density dependence has been taken. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Determining wheat persistence in cropping systems will facilitate the development of effective volunteer wheat management strategies. In October of 2000, glyphosate-resistant (GR) spring wheat seeds were scattered on plots at eight western Canada sites. From 2001 to 2003, the plots were seeded to a canola-barley-field-pea rotation or a fallow-barley-fallow rotation, with five seeding systems involving seeding dates and soil disturbance levels, and monitored for wheat plant density Herbicides and tillage (in fallow systems) were used to ensure that no wheat plants produced seed. Seeding systems with greater levels of soil disturbance usually had greater wheat densities. Volunteer wheat densities at 2 (2002) and 3 (2003) yr after seed dispersal were close to zero detectable at most locations. At the end of 2003, viable wheat seeds were not detected in the soil seed bank at any location. The majority of wheat seedlings were recruited in the year following seed dispersal (2001) at the in-crop, prespray (PRES) interval. At the PRES interval in 2001, across all locations and treatments, wheat density averaged 2.6 plants m(-2). At the preplanting interval (PREP), overall wheat density averaged only 0.2 plants m(-2). By restricting density data to include only continuous cropping, low-disturbance direct-seeding (LDS) systems, the latter mean dropped below 0.1 plants m(-2). Only at one site were preplanting GR wheat densities sufficient (4.2 plants m(-2)) to justify a preseeding herbicide treatment in addition to glyphosate in LDS systems. Overall volunteer wheat recruitment at all spring and summer intervals in the continuous cropping rotation in 2001 was 1.7% (3.3 plants m(-2)). Despite the fact that volunteer wheat has become more common in the central and northern Great Plains, there is little evidence from this study to suggest that its persistence will be a major agronomic problem.																	0043-1745					NOV-DEC	2005	53	6					846	859		10.1614/WS-05-068R1.1							WOS:000233835300014

The plant population growth is considered as being dependent on the density of seedlings that spring from seeds of the two previous years. We have analyzed the effects of the seed bank on the total population size, on the population spatial distribution as well as on the population velocity of invasion. It is showed that the seed bank can significantly alter the dynamics of annual plants, since it can have both a stabilizing and a destabilizing effect on the total population and can also homogenize the spatial distribution of the plants.

J	Larson, AJ; Franklin, JF				Larson, AJ; Franklin, JF			Patterns of conifer tree regeneration following an autumn wildfire event in the western Oregon Cascade Range, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We investigated the effect of fire severity and environmental conditions on conifer tree regeneration 11 years after an autumn wildfire in the western Oregon Cascade Range. Conifer tree seedlings, including those of Pseudotsuga menziesii, established promptly and at high densities following fire, in contrast to long establishment periods documented for many other sites. P. menziesii, Tsuga heterophylla and Thuja plicata comprised 99.0% of the seedlings measured in the study. Pseudotsuga seedling density was greater on sites that had burned with moderate and high severity compared to low fire severity. Tsuga seedling density was greater on north aspects than on south aspects. Tsuga and Thuja seedling densities were correlated with pre-fire conspecific basal area. Coexistence of the three principal conifer species was more likely on sites that burned with moderate severity. We attribute the rapid initial establishment of Pseudotsuga observed in this study to the persistence of a canopy seed bank-a biological legacy not normally associated with Pseudotsuga forests. Environmental factors, fire severity and disturbance timing influence seedling establishment patterns, shaping future stand composition and development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lemenih, M; Teketay, D				Lemenih, M; Teketay, D			Effect of prior land use on the recolonization of native woody species under plantation forests in the highlands of Ethiopia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Effect of prior land use on the recolonization of native woody species in plantation forests was investigated by assessing naturally regenerating flora (NRF) and soil seed banks (SSB) in plantation forests established on abandoned farmland and cleared natural forest sites in southern highlands of Ethiopia. Eucalyptus saligna and Cupressus lusitanica, two of the most widely planted tree species in the highlands of Ethiopia, were considered in the plantation treatments. About 66 plant species were recorded in the NRF and 55 plant species germinated from the soil samples collected for SSB analysis. Seedlings from the SSB were dominantly herbs, which accounted for 75% of the identified species germinated from the SSB, and native woody species accounted only for 10%. On the contrary, in the NRF native woody species were slightly more dominant (49%) than the herbs (45%). There was high species similarity between the NRF beneath the plantations and the standing vegetation in the adjacent natural forest. On the contrary there was very low similarity between the seedlings emerged from the SSB and the standing vegetation in the adjacent natural forest. Effect of prior land use was apparently stronger on the species composition of the SSB than the species richness of NRF under the plantations. The results also showed that overstory plantation species had stronger influence on the species richness of NRF rather than the pre-plantation land use history. As the SSB of the plantation sites lacked viable seed reserves for most of the naturally regenerating woody plants recorded underneath the plantations of both sites, it was assumed that seed dispersal from the adjacent natural forest has played major role in the recolonization process. From these results it could be shown that establishment of plantation forests either on abandoned farmland or directly on degraded natural forest sites can create comparable enabling environment for the recovery of the native forest flora, even if SSB are devoid of viable seeds of woody species, provided that there is a natural forest in the vicinity to donate seeds.

J	Hutchinson, TF; Sutherland, EK; Yaussy, DA				Hutchinson, TF; Sutherland, EK; Yaussy, DA			Effects of repeated prescribed fires on the structure, composition, and regeneration of mixed-oak forests in Ohio	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study quantifies prescribed fire effects at four sites in southern Ohio, from 1995 to 2002. Each site had three treatment units: an unburned control, a unit burned 2 x (1996 and 1999), and a unit burned 4 x (1996-1999). Vegetation plots were stratified by an integrated moisture index (IMI) into xeric, intermediate, and mesic classes. Prior to treatments, oak (Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya spp.) comprised 74-83% of basal area among sites but shade-tolerant species (e.g., Acer rubrum) were abundant in the midstory and completely dominated the sapling layer. Fires were conducted in March and April. Fire intensity, estimated by temperature-sensitive paints, was highest on the 2 x burn units. Fires had little effect on large tree ( > 25 cm DBH) density and stand basal area. By contrast, the density of small trees (10-25 cm DBH) was reduced by 31% on 2 x burn units and by 19% on 4 x burn units. "Fire-induced" mortality (i.e., mortality on burn units above that of unburned units) for the most common species of small trees was: A. rubrum = 33%; Quercus alba = 17%; Carya spp. = 13%; Nyssa sylvatica = 10%; Acer saccharum = 4%; Quercus prinus = 2%. Sapling density was reduced by 86% on burn treatments. Despite reduced small tree and sapling densities on burned units, canopy openness, estimated by hemispherical photography, remained low (< 6%). In general, the composition of tree regeneration was not substantially altered by fire treatments. On burn units, a significant initial decrease in A. rubrum seedling density and a significant increase in Liriodendron tulipifera from the seed bank did not persist throughout the study. Oak + hickory seedling density was not significantly affected by fire nor was the density of shade-tolerant seedlings. Post-treatment (2002) sampling of large seedlings (> 30 cm height) indicated no significant differences in the abundance of oak + hickory nor that of shade-tolerant seedlings among fire treatments. For most vegetation response variables, fire effects tended to be similar among IMI classes. The application of fire alone, without partial harvesting, failed to improve oak regeneration consistently. However, given that two fires reduced stand density, the longer term application of periodic fire, coupled with natural gap dynamics, may still be a feasible management strategy for improving the sustainability of oak forests where harvesting is not permitted or desired.

J	Nangendo, G; Stein, A; ter Steege, H; Bongers, F				Nangendo, G; Stein, A; ter Steege, H; Bongers, F			Changes in woody plant composition of three vegetation types exposed to a similar fire regime for over 46 years	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The effect of regular burning of woodland vegetation in Africa over an extended period (46 years) was studied in the Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda. Areas identified as having different vegetation types in 1958 were revisited to analyze vegetation changes and to test the prediction that convergence would occur as a result of the regular fire. In each of the three vegetation cover types, a transect was analysed. Results show that the vegetation cover types have changed and there is evidence of vegetation convergence. A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and a Morisita similarity index analysis showed a good separation between the 1958 and 2004 transects for each of the vegetation cover types. The DCA also showed that the three 2004 transects were compositionally closer to each other than the 1958 transects. The 2004 transects had also shifted away from the 1958 transects. Whereas in 1958 compositional similarity was highest between the Terminalia glaucescens conversion transect (T2) and the wooded grassland conversion transect (T3) (0.86), in 2004 it was most similar between the transects closest to Wairingo river (T1 and T2, correlation coefficient of 0.80). T1 was referred to as the Terminalia woodland transect. Comparing the 2004 transects to the 1958 transects, a low compositional similarity was observed. The highest was between T3-1958 and T3-2004 (0.62). Additionally, fewer indicator species (species specific for one transect) were identified in 2004 than in 1958 and, the transects shared more species in 2004 than in 1958. All the big trees (DBH >= 30 cm) that existed along T1 in 1958 died off. Clustering of individual woody plants, a protective mechanism used by plants in presence of fire, was identified in each of the plots analysed. To counterbalance the unifying effect of fire for the vegetation in the area and to maintain diverse vegetation, a variety of fire management regimes are needed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Espinar, JL; Thompson, K; Garcia, LV				Espinar, JL; Thompson, K; Garcia, LV			Timing of seed dispersal generates a bimodal seed bank depth distribution	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The density of soil seed banks is normally highest at the soil surface and declines monotonically with depth. Sometimes. for a variety of reasons, peak density occurs below the surface but, except in severely disturbed soils, it is generally true that deeper seeds are older. In seasonally dry habitats that develop deep soil cracks during the dry season, it is possible that some seeds fall down cracks and rapidly become deeply buried. We investigated this possibility for three dominant clonal perennials (Scirpus maritimus, S. litoralis, and Juncus subulatus) in the Donana salt marsh, it nontidal marsh with a Mediterranean climate located in southwest Spain. Two species, which shed most of their seed during the dry season and have seeds with low buoyancy, had bimodal viable seed depth distributions, with peak densities at the surface and at 16-20 cm. A third species, which shed most seeds after soil cracks had closed and had seeds with high buoyancy, had viable seeds only in surface soil. Bimodal seed bank depth distributions may be relatively common in seasonally dry habitats with fine-textured soils, but their ecological significance has not been investigated.

J	Ogden, JAE; Rejmanek, M				Ogden, JAE; Rejmanek, M			Recovery of native plant communities after the control of a dominant invasive plant species, Foeniculum vulgare: Implications for management	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The control and/or removal of a dominant invasive species is expected to lead to increases in native species richness and diversity. Small pilot studies were performed on Santa Cruz Island (SCI), California, in the early 1990s to test the efficacy of different methods on the control of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) and management's effects on native species recovery. We chose a treatment that showed significant native species recovery, applied it at the landscape scale, and followed its effects on fennel infested plant communities. We tested the hypothesis that results from small-scale studies translate to the landscape level. We found that although the control of fennel translated from the small to landscape scale, decreasing from an average of 60% to less than 3% cover, native species recovery did not occur in the landscape study as it did in the pilot studies. Invasive fennel cover was replaced by non-native grass cover over time. Unexpectedly, fennel cover in untreated fennel plots decreased significantly (though not as drastically) from over 60% cover to just under 40% cover while native species richness in untreated areas increased significantly. The correlation between precipitation and changes in native and non-native species richness and abundance in this study imply that changes in species abundances were highly correlated with environmental fluctuations. The lack of a native seed bank and the accumulation of non-native grass litter likely prevented the recovery of native species in treated areas. Greater vertical complexity found in fennel communities, which increased visitation by frugivorous birds and likely increased native seed dispersal, may have been responsible for the increase in native species richness in the untreated areas. These results suggest that successful invasive species control and native species recovery experiments conducted at small scales may not translate to the landscape level, and active restoration should be an organic component of such large-scale projects.

However, A. tennesseensis has been extirpated from four counties in Illinois, from its only known site in Indiana, from one county in Tennessee, and from one county in Alabama. Astragalus bibullatus is closely related to the geographically widespread Great Plains taxon A. crassicarpus var. crassicarpus (section Sarcocarpi), whereas A. tennesseensis is the only taxon in section Tennesseensis. Both species are shallow-rooted, hemicryptophyte perennials without vegetative reproduction, have no effective means of seed dispersal, form long-lived seed banks, have similar life cycle phenologies, are intolerant of heavy shade, and have moderate amounts of genetic diversity. Much additional information is available on the autecology of A. tennesseensis. Its primary habitat is the transition zone between open glades and glade woods, where physical environmental factors are intermediate between those of the adjacent zones. Seedling-juvenile survival is low. Plants flower first in their second to fifth year and only a few times before dying, are self-incompatible, respond to drought by shedding leaves and by accumulating large amounts of proline, and compete poorly. Populations exhibit high fluctuations in number of individuals and have high turnover rates. A greenhouse study of A. bibullatits and A. crassicarpus var. crassicarpus did not identify any difference in responses of these species to light or soil moisture that could account for the great differences in geographic ranges. Thus, historical factors were also considered to explain the narrow endemism of A. bibullatus. Finally, we present previously unpublished data on the effect of light level and of competition with the cedar glade dominant Sporobolus vaginiflorus in several watering regimes on growth of A. tennesseensis. The role of these factors in restriction of this species to its transition zone microhabitat is discussed.																	0007-196X	1938-436X				OCT-DEC	2005	57	4					345	353		10.1663/0007-196X(2005)057[0345:EOTGRA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000234771500006						
J	Roselius, K; Stephan, W; Stadler, T				Roselius, K; Stephan, W; Stadler, T			The relationship of nucleotide polymorphism, recombination rate and selection in wild tomato species	GENETICS												We analyzed the effects of mating system and recombination rate on single nucleotide polymorphisms using 14 single-copy nuclear loci from single populations of five species of wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon). The taxa investigated comprise two self-compatible (SC) and three self-incompatible (SI) species. The observed reduction in nucleoride diversity in the SC Populations compared to the SI populations is much stronger than expected under the neutral effects of the mating system on effective population size. Importantly, outgroup sequences available for 11 of the 14 loci yield strong positive correlations between silent nucleoride diversity and Silent divergence, indicative of marked among-locus differences in mutation rates and/or selective Constraints. Furthermore, using a physical estimate of local recombination rates, we find that silent nucleotide diversity (but not divergence) is positively correlated with recombination rate in two of the SI species. However, this correlation is not nearly as strong as in other well-characterized species (in particular, Drosophila). We propose that nucleotide diversity in Lycopersicon is dominated mainly by differences in neutral Mutation rates and/or selective constraints among loci, dentographic processes (such as population subdivision), and back-round selection. In addition, we hypothesize that the soil seed bank plays an important role in the maintenance of the large genetic diversity in the SI species (in particular L. peruvianum).

J	Humston, R; Mortensen, DA; Bjornstad, ON				Humston, R; Mortensen, DA; Bjornstad, ON			Anthropogenic forcing on the spatial dynamics of an agricultural weed: the case of the common sunflower	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Establishment and spread are central in weed invasion. In this study we quantified the impact of harvest and weed management practices on these processes in row-crop agriculture. Quantifying the dynamics of patch expansion can direct management aimed at containment of weed populations. 2. We assessed annual patterns of common sunflower Helianthus annuus seedling recruitment to determine the influence of management on seed dispersal and patch expansion. Weed seed banks were sowed at three initial densities and exposed to either high or low intensity weed management. Fields were maintained in a maize-soybean crop rotation, with cultivation and harvest orientated in a single direction. We analysed spatial pattern in annual seedling recruitment using geostatistics and an integro-difference model to determine treatment effects on spatial dynamics. 3. The two spatial analyses allowed us to separate and quantify the contributions of natural and anthropogenic dispersal to seedling emergence and patch expansion. Expansion was predominantly isotropic, and estimated rates of isotropic spread (i.e. diffusion) were consistent between analysis methods. 4. We also confirmed that directional management practices can effect significant anisotropy on dispersal and expansion. Crop rotation had the greatest impact on expansion; anisotropy in patch expansion was more pronounced in maize compared with soybean. However, the scale of weed seed dispersal by machine (combine harvester) was greater following harvest of soybean. Simulation of patch dynamics indicated that harvest can increase expansion rate nearly fourfold. 5. Synthesis and applications. Patches of H. annuus originating from intermediate and high seed bank densities had the potential to spread rapidly from the source population. Patches with a low initial seed bank experienced extinction when subjected to high levels of chemical weed management. The combined approach of spatial modelling and geostatistics was particularly effective for quantifying admixed modes of dispersal from sequential data of population distribution. Independence of the two methods provided a system for cross-validating model assumptions and estimated parameters. The scales of spatial dynamics we assessed were well suited to these methods. The results of the analysis underscore the importance of managing populations in order to keep local populations at low densities. Helianthus annuus is difficult to manage and once intermediate or high local densities are reached, the rate of spread is accelerated, distributing this weed widely across fields. A targeted site-specific approach to maintaining populations at low levels would reduce the necessity for more costly field-wide management.

J	Roschewitz, I; Gabriel, D; Tscharntke, T; Thies, C				Roschewitz, I; Gabriel, D; Tscharntke, T; Thies, C			The effects of landscape complexity on arable weed species diversity in organic and conventional farming	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. There is growing concern about declining species diversity in agro-ecosystems caused by agricultural intensification at the field and landscape scales. Species diversity of arable weeds is classically related to local abiotic factors and resource conditions. It is believed to be enhanced by organic farming but the surrounding landscape may also be important. 2. This study assessed the ruderal vegetation, seed bank and seed rain in 24 winter wheat fields to examine the relative importance of organic vs. conventional farming and landscape complexity for weed species diversity. Diversity was partitioned into its additive components: alpha, beta and gamma diversity. Percentage arable land in a circular landscape sector of 1-km radius around each study site was used as an indicator of landscape complexity. 3. Weed species diversity in the vegetation, seed rain and seed bank was higher in organic than in conventional fields. Increasing landscape complexity enhanced species diversity more strongly in the vegetation of conventional than organic fields, to the extent that diversity was similar in both farming systems when the landscape was complex. Species diversity of the seed bank was increased by landscape complexity irrespective of farming system. 4. Overall diversity was largely determined by the high heterogeneity between and within the fields (beta diversity). Only in very few cases could higher weed species diversity in complex landscapes and/or organic farming be related to species dependence on landscape or farming system. 5. Synthesis and applications. Local weed species diversity was influenced by both landscape complexity and farming system. Species diversity under organic farming systems was clearly higher in simple landscapes. Conventional vegetation reached similar diversity levels when the surrounding landscape was complex through the presence of refugia for weed populations. Consequently, agri-environment schemes designed to preserve and enhance biodiversity should not only consider the management of single fields but also of the surrounding landscape.

J	Wang, SM; Zhang, X; Li, Y; Zhang, L; Xiong, YC; Wang, G				Wang, SM; Zhang, X; Li, Y; Zhang, L; Xiong, YC; Wang, G			Spatial distribution patterns of the soil seed bank of Stipagrostis pennata (Trin.) de Winter in the Gurbantonggut Desert of north-west China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution patterns of soil seed bank of Stipagrostis pennata (Trin.) de Winter during different seasons in the Gurbantonggut Desert of north-west China. Results indicated that spatial patterns of the soil seed bank of S. pennata were similar to the distribution patterns of its associated standing vegetation, and there was a significant variation in soil seed densities among the different parts of the dunes. The highest soil seed density was found on the top of sampled dunes and in the soil of the underlayers of standing vegetation beds of S. pennata. The number of seeds stored in the soil decreased with distance from established stands of this grass species. Moreover, during secondary seed dispersal, which is air-borne in the windy season, a small proportion of seeds was also trapped by other plant species. Furthermore, the directional density distribution of seeds was strongly associated with the directions of the prevailing threshold wind (>= 6 m s(-1)), and higher soil seed densities usually occurred on the leeward side of the vegetation stands. Based on these investigations, wind is, probably, the key factor in forming the spatial patterns of S. pennata seed banks in the region. On the other hand, grazing affected the quality and quantity of S. pennata seed storage, as a result of delayed development and the above-ground shoots being damaged by grazing. This occurred in spring to early summer, which is the most suitable growth season for the grass. Nevertheless, grazing had little influence on the spatial distribution patterns of the seed bank over all seasons. Germination trials showed that the percentage of viable soil seeds increased continuously throughout summer and autumn. The results also revealed the clear ecological characteristics influencing the population distribution of S. pennata. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	van den Broek, T; van Diggelen, R; Bobbink, R				van den Broek, T; van Diggelen, R; Bobbink, R			Variation in seed buoyancy of species in wetland ecosystems with different flooding dynamics	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Do species from communities with different flooding dynamics differ in seed buoyancy? Is there a trade-off between seed buoyancy and seed longevity? Methods: Seeds of 55 freshwater wetland species were collected and related to communities along the hydrological gradient, ranging from constantly flooded reed beds, through tall herb fens and rich fens, to rarely flooded wet meadows. Species were experimentally tested for seed buoyancy over 2 10 days in standing water and moving water. Seed longevity for each species was calculated. Results: Community occurrence along the hydrologic gradient was mirrored by seed buoyancy. Seed buoyancy was highest for species of almost permanently inundated reed beds and lowest for species of rarely inundated wet meadows. The seed buoyancy characteristics of species of reed beds were best adapted to hydrological dynamic conditions mimicked by the treatment moving water and were the most independent of the flow rate of the water. A high percentage of the species used had a transient seed bank. Together with high buoyancy in many species, this suggests a trade-off between dispersal capacity and seed persistence. Conclusions: In freshwater wetlands with rather stable water levels, many species lack a persistent seed bank and depend on dispersal for colonization of new habitats. Seed buoyancy enhances aquatic seed dispersal, and can be of great importance in both vegetation dynamics and restoration. In wetlands that are inundated for a long period during the year and with a water level above soil surface, higher seed buoyancy enhances the possibility for hydrochory.					van Diggelen, Rudy/0000-0001-8053-945X												1100-9233	1654-1103				OCT	2005	16	5					579	586		10.1658/1100-9233(2005)16[579:VISBOS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000233215200011						
J	Albrecht, H				Albrecht, H			Development of arable weed seedbanks during the 6 years after the change from conventional to organic farming	WEED RESEARCH												All of the arable land of a farm in southern Germany was investigated during an 8-year period, starting 2 years before and ending 6 years after the change to organic farming. The first 3 years after the conversion, the total seed number in the soil increased from 4050 to 17 320 m(-2). From the fourth to the sixth year, it dropped back to 10 220 m(-2). The number of seeds increased particularly at sites with a low crop cover and a high density of weed plants at the soil surface. The increase predominantly occurring on the more fertile soils may have been caused by the rotation commencing with less competitive crops. Crops which increased the seedbank by 30-40% were winter cereals, sunflowers and lupins. Potatoes and sown fallow caused no significant change and grass-clover mixtures even reduced the number of seeds by 39%. Among 44 species occurring frequently enough for statistical analysis, 31 increased and only 3 decreased. The change of management particularly increased summer annual, perennial and dicotyledonous weeds. This can be attributed to both operations which are characteristic of organic farming (e.g. replacing herbicide applications by mechanical weed control) and to general modifications of the management practice which may also occur in non-organic farming systems (increasing the percentage of broad leaved and spring sown crops in crop rotation). The present study confirms investigations into the aboveground vegetation that indicate that arable organic farming favours plant species diversity and provides evidence that the conversion need not encourage the dominance of a few noxious weeds.

J	Lopez-Vila, JR; Garcia-Fayos, P				Lopez-Vila, JR; Garcia-Fayos, P			Diplochory in Ulex parviflorus pourr	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Ulex parviflorus (Fabaceae) is a fire-prone shrub of the western Mediterranean Basin that disperses their seeds both by the explosion of the legumes and the action of ants. Over 3 years we studied seed dispersal in a population from eastern Spain. We analysed the temporal and spatial patterns of primary seed dispersal and their consequences for the foraging behaviour of ants. We also studied the effect of seed manipulation by ants on germination success. Primary seed dispersal correlated positively with air temperature. The curve of seed abundance as a function of distance of the plant displayed one peak under the plant and another peak at 130 cm. Ants of the species Messor barbarus were observed collecting seeds and they were attracted by the elaiosome. However, the spatial pattern of the seeds in the soil did not shape the foraging activity of the ants. Ants brought the seeds to their nest stores, removed the elaiosome and threw away the seeds in the refuse piles. By removing the elaiosome ants increased the germination rate in relation to intact seeds. Results showed that diplochory operates on seeds of U. parviflorus allowing the species to exploit heterogeneous establishment conditions. Primary dispersal places seeds near the mother plant but at the expense of delayed germination. These seeds should be incorporated into the soil seed bank and then activated by forest-fires or canopy disturbance. Secondary seed dispersal by ants activates seed germination and allows the plant to establish immediately after seed dispersal. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Enright, NJ; Lamont, BB; Miller, BP				Enright, NJ; Lamont, BB; Miller, BP			Anomalies in grasstree fire history reconstructions for south-western Australian vegetation	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												A new fire history for south-western Australian sclerophyll forests was proposed recently based on grasstree (Xanthorrhoea preissii ) records that were interpreted to show a high frequency (3-5 years) 'pre-European burning regime'. Such a fire regime appears incompatible with the long-term survival of many fire-killed woody taxa. We investigated the local fire history in a small area of the northern sand-plain shrub-lands of south-western Australia using 15 grasstrees, examining individual grasstree records in detail and comparing this with the decadal or averaged approach used in the original research, and with fire histories reconstructed from satellite images for the period since 1975. Results lead us to question the utility of the proposed grasstree fire history record as a tool for understanding past fire regimes for two reasons: First, inconsistencies in fire histories among individual grasstrees were considerable - some individuals were not burnt by known fires, while some apparently were burned many times during periods when others were not burned at all. Second, the grasstree record indicates a possible increase in patchiness of fires since 1930, while contemporary evidence and interpretations of the nature of Aboriginal (pre-European) fire regimes would suggest the opposite. We believe that further research is needed to identify to what extent the grasstree method for reconstruction of fire histories can be used to re-interpret how fire operated in many highly diverse ecosystems prior to European settlement of Australia.

J	Rebek, KA; O'Neil, RJ				Rebek, KA; O'Neil, RJ			Impact of simulated herbivory on Alliaria petiolata survival, growth, and reproduction	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												In weed biological control, insect damage to target weeds can be simulated in invaded habitats to study potential responses of the plant to introduced natural enemies. In the present study, we investigated the impact of two levels of manual flower-shoot damage (shoots cut at tip or base) on Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) survival, size, and reproduction. Experiments were conducted in 2002 and 2003 using invasive field populations of A. petiolata under naturally varying plant densities. Plant survival was recorded, and size and reproduction parameters were measured. Manual flower-shoot damage had a significant effect on plant survival. In both years, fewer plants survived in the basal-cut treatment than in either the control (un-cut) or tip-cut treatment. Plant size and reproductive output were likewise reduced in the basal-cut treatment. In both years, total seed production was significantly lower in the basal-cut treatment than either the control or tip-cut treatment. When combined, increased mortality and reduced seed production of basal-cut plants greatly reduced the contribution these plants made to the seed bank. Plant density did not affect reproduction or plant size. The impacts of cutting were consistent across years and sites with distinct biotic and abiotic conditions, and A. petiolata densities. We anticipate that herbivore damage to A. petiolata populations by introduced biological control agents will likewise remain consistent under varying biotic and abiotic conditions if the agents are equally adapted to these.

J	Hafliger, P; Schwarzlaender, M; Blossey, B				Hafliger, P; Schwarzlaender, M; Blossey, B			Biology of Platycephala planifrons (Diptera : Chloropidae) and its potential effectiveness as biological control agent for invasive Phragmites australis in North America	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan clonal grass valued for its support of diversity-rich communities in its native range and feared for its devastating effects on native diversity where the species is introduced. Lack of successful control in North America resulted in the initiation of a biological control program. We used a combination of field surveys and common garden experiments in Europe to study life history and ecology of a chloropid fly, Platycephala planifrons, to assess its potential as a biological control agent. The fly is widely distributed (in non-flooded sites) throughout Eurasia but attack rates are generally low (mean 5-10%; max. 29%). Adults emerge in late June and may live for several months. Females lay eggs at the base of Ph. australis shoots. First instar larvae of this stem-feeding fly overwinter in dormant below-ground shoots of Ph. australis and rapidly complete development in early spring. Larval feeding destroys the growing meristem of the shoot causing premature wilting and 60-70% reductions in shoot biomass production. Early season attack and considerable impact suggest that Pl. planifrons could be a potent biocontrol agent, if it can escape suppression by natural enemies in the introduced range. However, the generally low attack rates in its native range and its dependence on dry sites appear to make the species a "second-choice" candidate for potential release in North America.

A total of 8416 seeds germinated in 60 soil samples, at 5-cm depth, corresponding to 107 species, 85 genera, and 48 families. Significant differences were found among study sites in seed densities with values ranging from 873 to 3632/m(2). Tree species contributed 20 percent of the total soil seed bank in four sites and herbs accounted for the majority of the species in each site. Among tree species, Trema micrantha displayed the highest seed density, accounting for 84 percent of the germinated seeds. In general, the tree species composition of the soil seed bank did not closely reflect the composition of the tree community. Results suggest that disturbance produced by human activities (trail use, selective cutting of trees, livestock) may influence the size and composition of the soil seed bank in forest fragments. Sites where human activity has been reduced showed the highest proportion of dormant seeds.

J	Panetta, FD; Lawes, R				Panetta, FD; Lawes, R			Evaluation of weed eradication programs: the delimitation of extent	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Eradication is a management strategy that can provide substantial ecological and economic benefits by eliminating incursions of pest organisms. In contrast to eradication efforts that target other pests, weed eradication programs can be very protracted owing to the presence of persistent seed banks and difficulties in detecting the target. Hence there is a need to develop criteria to assist in the evaluation of progress towards eradication. Knowledge of the extent of a weed incursion (the 'delimitation' criterion) is considered fundamental for eradication success, as an incursion will progress from any infestations that remain undetected and thus uncontrolled. This criterion is examined with regard to eradication programs targeting Bassia scoparia L. A.J. Scott [= Kochia scoparia L. Schrader], Chondrilla juncea L. (both in Western Australia) and Orobanche ramosa L. in South Australia. The B. scoparia incursion, which has been eradicated, was largely delimited within 12 months of the inception of its eradication program. In contrast, the Western Australian C. juncea incursion has never been delimited, owing to insufficient investment in surveillance during an eradication program spanning 30 years. An exponential decrease in the detection ratio (infested area detected/area searched) over time suggests that delimitation has been approached within 6 years of the inception of the eradication program for O. ramosa. An effective surveillance program is essential for achieving delimitation of a weed incursion.

Five stations were selected: a Grey dune, Pine plantation 1, Pine plantation 2, Clearing 1, and Clearing 2. In contrast to the pine plantations, clearing 1, subject to heavy human disturbance, had a great similarity between its seed banks and its established vegetation. The larger clearing (C2) tend to resemble the grey dune, whereas the other was dominated by ruderal species. The analysis of the seed banks demonstrated differences between the clearings and the pine plantations from which they were derived. The potential vegetation of the clearings was closer to that of the grey dune and had a larger number of species with a short life cycle than the pine plantations. The seed banks of the pine plantations were not similar to that of the grey dune, but also differed from that of closed vegetation. This study suggested that it may not be possible to obtain a short term restoration of a grey dune after just clear felling only with the help of seed banks. On the other hand, seed dissemination could facilitate a restoration in a larger time scale as for clearings.																	0749-0208					SEP	2005	21	5					991	999		10.2112/02067.1							WOS:000231956200012						
J	Kluth, C; Bruelheide, H				Kluth, C; Bruelheide, H			Effects of range position, inter-annual variation and density on demographic transition rates of Hornungia petraea populations	OECOLOGIA												The central-marginal model assumes unfavourable and more variable environmental conditions at the periphery of a species' distribution range to negatively affect demographic transition rates, finally resulting in reduced population sizes and densities. Previous studies on density-dependence as a crucial factor regulating plant population growth have mainly focussed on fecundity and survival. Our objective is to analyse density-dependence in combination with the effect of inter-annual variation and range position on all life stages of an annual plant species, Hornungia petraea, including germination and seed incorporation into the seed bank. As previous studies on H. petraea had revealed a pattern opposite to existing theory with lower population densities at the distribution centre in Italy than at the periphery in Germany, we hypothesised that (1) demographic transition rates are lower, (2) the inter-annual variation in demographic transition rates is higher and (3) the intensity of density-dependence is weaker in Italy than in Germany. To analyse demographic transition rates, we used an autoregressive covariance strategy for repeated measures including density and inter-annual variation. All the three hypotheses were confirmed, but the impact of range position, density-dependence and inter-annual variation differed among the transition steps. All transition rates except fecundity were higher in the German populations than in the Italian populations. Germination rate and incorporation rate into the seed bank were strongly density-dependent. Central populations showed a larger inter-annual variation in fecundity and winter survival rate. Winter survival rate was the only transition step with a stronger density-dependence in peripheral populations. In most cases, these differences between distribution centre and periphery would not have emerged without taking density-dependence and inter-annual variation into account. We conclude that including range position, inter-annual variation and density-dependence in one single statistical model is an important tool for the interpretation of demographic patterns regarding the central-marginal model.

J	Cochard, R; Jackes, BR				Cochard, R; Jackes, BR			Seed ecology of the invasive tropical tree Parkinsonia aculeata	PLANT ECOLOGY												Parkinsonia aculeata is an invasive tree native to tropical America, but introduced to Australia. Propagation and stand regeneration is mainly by seed. To gain baseline knowledge for management decisions, seed bank dynamics were monitored for two months during the fruit dispersal period at a coastal wetland in Costa Rica (native habitat), and at a coastal wetland and two semi-arid rangeland sites in Northern Queensland, Australia (introduced habitats). Seed bank densities underneath dense, uniform Parkinsonia stands were found to be lowest in the Australian wetland but highest in the Costa Rican wetland. Post-dispersal seed losses were highest in the Australian wetland, primarily due to seed germination and/or death. At the other sites, seed losses were minor during the study period, and predation was the most important cause of losses. At the two rangeland sites bruchid beetles accounted for more than 95% of the seed losses by predation. Total predation was lowest in the Costa Rican wetland. In order to test for intrinsic differences of seed characteristics, germination trials were conducted using both canopy seeds and seeds from the soil seed bank. Dormancy release and germination rate were studied under four temperature treatments. In all populations, dormancy release increased with increasing temperature, but averaged responses were significantly different between Costa Rican and Australian seed populations, and between seeds collected from the soil and from trees. Germination rate of scarified seeds was fastest at 35 degrees C in all tested seed populations. While high seed germination levels seem to explain low seed bank densities in the Australian wetland, the large seed banks at the rangeland sites reflect the lower incidence of favourable conditions for germination. In the Australian wetland biocontrol with bruchids is unlikely to be successful, while control by conventional methods, such as killing stands by basal bark spraying, seems feasible, due to a lower long-term risk of re-infestation from the soil seed bank. At the rangeland sites conventional control will be difficult and costly. Parkinsonia stands may be better left to their own, while bruchid populations are monitored and management efforts are concentrated on preventing further invasion.																	1385-0237					SEP	2005	180	1					13	31		10.1007/s11258-004-2780-4							WOS:000232627200002

The dynamic interactions between water, sediment, aquatic-terrestrial landforms and biotic elements control the functional processes and biodiversity patterns within the riparian zone and, thus, contribute directly to their ecological integrity and societal value. Numerous researchers from different disciplines publish work on the physical, biological, economic and societal functions of the riparian zone within various physiographic areas. The present paper aims to review the hydrogeomorphic processes of unconfined alluvial channel-floodplain rivers within the temperate zone. These processes and their interactions with the biotic environment provide the basis for understanding the physical as well as the ecological functioning of fluvial hydrosystems. The review focuses mainly on the European context, but major advances in riparian research from other continents are also considered. Rehabilitation and management strategies for the riparian zone are summarized and recommendations for further research conclude this review.

J	Walck, JL; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Hidayati, SN				Walck, JL; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Hidayati, SN			Defining transient and persistent seed banks in species with pronounced seasonal dormancy and germination patterns	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The most often used time-line for distinguishing a transient seed bank from a persistent seed bank is one calendar year. Thus, species whose seeds live in or on the soil for < 1 year have a transient seed bank, whereas those whose seeds live for g1 year have a persistent seed bank. However, dormancy cycling of seeds buried in soil has not been given due consideration in these models. When dormancy cycling is considered, it is shown that seeds of both autumn-germinators and spring-germinators are in the dormant state when they are 1 year old. Thus, unless the seeds live until at least the second germination season (i.e. usually 16-18 months following dispersal), they are, in effect, part of a transient seed bank, having lived through only one germination season. We propose that for seeds of such species to be considered part of a short-term persistent seed bank, they should remain viable and germinable until at least the second germination season, and to be part of a long-term persistent seed bank, until at least the sixth germination season. Our definitions are applicable to seeds with physiological, physical or morphophysiological dormancy, which often require > 1 year after maturity to come out of dormancy in nature. We discuss modifications of the seedling emergence method for detection of a soil seed bank, so that they correspond to our definitions of seed-bank strategies.																	0960-2585					SEP	2005	15	3					189	196		10.1079/SSR2005209							WOS:000232219500002

In each of seven study sites with dominating stands of the species, soil samples were taken in October (after the fruit release), April (before germination) and June-July (before the fruit release). Ten samples were taken from each site using a soil hand bore, 4.6 cm in diameter. Seeds elutriated from the samples were immediately germinated in laboratory conditions (10 degrees C, 12 h light/12 h dark); those that germinated during 1 month were considered as non-dormant. Non-germinated but viable seeds, tested for viability by tetrazolium, were considered as dormant. The number of dead seeds was also recorded. The total number of seeds significantly increased with mean density of flowering plants at a site. Of the total variation in seed-bank size, about four-fifths were attributed to that among sites, and one-fifth to that within sites. The number and proportion of living seeds differed significantly between years in summer, but not in autumn and spring. Total number and the numbers of dormant, non-dormant, living and dead seeds significantly differed among the autumn, spring and summer samples. The percentage of living seeds in the total seed bank decreased from 56% in autumn to 42% in spring to 15% in summer. The percentage of non-dormant seeds among those living was 0.3% in autumn, it increased to 87.5% in the spring sample, and decreased to 3% in summer. Pooled across all sites, the average seed numbers (expressed per m(2)) were 6719 +/- 4119 (mean +/- SD) in autumn, 4907 +/- 2278 in spring and 1301 +/- 1036 in summer for the total number of seeds, and 3759 +/- 2906, 2044 +/- 1198 and 192 +/- 165, respectively, for living seeds. The majority of seeds (95%) were concentrated in the upper 5 cm soil layer. However, some seeds were present in lower soil layers, which indicates a short-term persistent seed bank. The present data are the first quantitative estimate of the seed bank in H. mantegazzianum, and show that the reproductive potential of the species is enormous, which seems to be a crucial feature of its invasion success.

J	van Klinken, RD; Flack, L				van Klinken, RD; Flack, L			Wet heat as a mechanism for dormancy release and germination of seeds with physical dormancy	WEED SCIENCE												Mexican palo-verde is a serious woody weed in tropical parts of the world. Like many such leguminous species, it has relatively large seeds with hard-seeded (physical) dormancy. It therefore has the potential for long-lived seed banks that are difficult to manage. The physiology of hard-seeded dormancy is still relatively poorly understood but has important implications for weed management. We propose that wet heat is a potentially important dormancy release mechanism for summer rainfall tropical regions. We described the relationships between wet heat and dormancy release (in water; three seed sources) and germination (near saturation; single seed source) by testing seeds at constant temperatures between 10 and 60 C. The logistic transformation of the temperature-dormancy relationship was best described by a quadratic equation below a threshold of similar to 33.6 C and a linear equation above that threshold. The relationship was the same for all seed sources other than a phase shift of up to 6.6 C, which is likely to be of biological significance. Germination occurred between 15 and 40 C and was limited by cold stress at <= 20 C and heat stress > 35 C. The sensitivity of dormancy to naturally encountered temperature ranges suggests that wet heat is an important dormancy release mechanism and one that can be exploited when developing management strategies for invasive populations.				van Klinken, Rieks D/B-1772-2009	van Klinken, Rieks D/0000-0002-7578-8977												0043-1745					SEP-OCT	2005	53	5					663	669		10.1614/WS-05-008R.1							WOS:000232544100014						
J	Alvarez, MG; Tron, F; Mauchamp, A				Alvarez, MG; Tron, F; Mauchamp, A			Sexual versus asexual colonization by Phragmites australis: 25-year reed dynamics in a mediterranean marsh, Southern France	WETLANDS												Colonization by common reed (Phragmites australis) is often assumed to be driven mainly by vegetative growth of rhizomes. Seedlings are rarely observed in the field despite the annual flowering, the large seed production, and germination potential. We considered that this was mainly a consequence of the rare occurrence of the regeneration window of reed but, provided the suitable conditions were created, reed could efficiently colonize empty space by seedling establishment. We analyzed the relative importance of sexual and asexual propagation in a reed-dominated marsh in Southern France using past aerial photographs to reconstruct the reedbed dynamics over the last 25 years and a full-scale experiment simulating a rarely occurring low water level in spring. We observed phases of slow colonization corresponding to vegetative growth and periods of rapid closure of mudflats by reed. Reedbed dynamics were a combination of slow vegetative growth and a few phases of seedling establishment. The preservation of stable water levels favored colonization by vegetative growth. The experimental spring drawdown led to a 25% increase in reed area with up to 40 m progressions. Such rare events with low water levels in spring favor sexual colonization. Sexual reproduction plays an important role in the pioneer stage of reedbeds, allowing both fast progression and establishment of genetically diverse stands.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2005	25	3					639	647		10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0639:SVACBP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000232130300012						
J	Mulhouse, JM; Burbage, LE; Sharitz, RR				Mulhouse, JM; Burbage, LE; Sharitz, RR			Seed bank-vegetation relationships in herbaceous Carolina bays: Responses to climatic variability	WETLANDS												Vegetation in intermittently flooded wetlands is strongly affected by the influence of hydrologic condition on species establishment and survival. The vegetation of four herbaceous depression meadow Carolina bay wetlands on the Upper Coastal Plain in the southeastern USA was sampled while systems were flooded in 1999 and again in 2002, near the end of a multi-year drought during which all bays were dry. The seed banks of these bays were sampled in the spring of 2000 and their relationship to the extant vegetation at both ends of the hydrologic spectrum examined. All bays lost previously abundant perennial aquatic species during the drought, and grasses, especially a rhizomatous perennial, Panicum hemitomon, expanded. While approximately half the species in the vegetation were also found in the seed bank, more than 60% of species in the seed bank were never detected in the vegetation. Also, widespread species in the vegetation, especially grasses and aquatic herbs, were rare or absent in the seed bank. The results of the study were consistent with a cyclic model of herbaceous Carolina bay vegetation dynamics in which aquatic and grass species dominate in turn as climate oscillates between wet and dry periods. Further, it appears that, in herbaceous Carolina bays, a handful of dominant aquatic and grass species in the vegetation may influence composition more strongly than widespread recruitment from the seed bank as hydrologic condition fluctuates.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2005	25	3					738	747		10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0738:SBRIHC]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000232130300021						
J	Bissels, S; Donath, TW; Holzel, N; Otte, A				Bissels, S; Donath, TW; Holzel, N; Otte, A			Ephemeral wetland vegetation in irregularly flooded arable fields along the northern Upper Rhine: the importance of persistent seedbanks	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Along the northern Upper Rhine ephemeral wetland vegetation is not confined to primary habitats such as the fringes of backwaters and river banks, but is also found in irregularly flooded arable fields. Within these highly variable environments, where disturbance is not only by flooding but also by agricultural management, we assessed the role of seedbanks for the persistence of ephemeral vegetation. In order to achieve this, we analysed the floristic composition of the above-ground vegetation and the corresponding soil seedbank of arable fields after a long-lasting spring and early summer flood in 2001. Moreover, we compared our vegetation data with other phytosociological studies from primary and secondary habitats along the northern Upper Rhine. The comparison between primary and secondary habitats of mudflat species revealed differences in species composition. While primary habitats were characterised by the predominance of species of Isoeto-Nanojuncetea and Bidentetea, secondary habitats contained additionally species of the classes Agrostietea and Stellarietea. The studied soil seedbanks were dominated by species typical of both, mudflat and agricultural habitats. Most species found in the seedbank were characterised by short life cycles and the ability to rapidly exploit periods of favourable conditions for germination and growth. The flooding treatments that were applied prior to the third season of seedbank analysis almost generally resulted in a high proportion of additional germination of mudflat species, even two years after the start of the analysis. The emergence of some mudflat species such as Gnaphalium uliginosum, Veronica peregrina and semi-aquatic helophytes such as Alisma lanceolatum and A. plantago-aquatica was actually confined to the flooding treatment. Seed densities were exceptionally high and increased with the duration and frequency of inundation at the sampling sites. Juncus bufonius, Ranunculus sceleratus and Veronica catenata were the most abundant species. For juncus bufonius we found a maximum seed density of 707,072 seeds m(-2), which is to our knowledge the highest seed concentration that was ever found in a higher plant. The large persistent soil seedbanks proved to be of outstanding importance for the emergence of ephemeral wetland vegetation after flood disturbances in arable fields. This was also reflected by the relatively high similarity between the seedbank and the established vegetation directly after flooding. Our study highlights the importance of irregularly flooded arable fields as a secondary habitat for the conservation of ephemeral wetland species. At these sites, not only improved drainage and landfill threatens the occurrence of mudflat vegetation but also the replenishment of the seedbank is often prevented by early re-ploughing of the fields.

J	Rhazi, M; Grillas, P; Medail, F; Rhazi, L				Rhazi, M; Grillas, P; Medail, F; Rhazi, L			Consequences of shrub clearing on the richness of aquatic vegetation in oligotrophic seasonal pools in Southern France	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												The characteristic vegetation of Mediterranean seasonal oligotrophic pools is dominated by aquatic and amphibious annual plant species. Temporary flooded pools in southern France have experienced during the last decades a progressive decline of grazing, notably by sheep, favouring the encroachment of shrubs (Ulmus minor and Fraxinus angustifolia). A major consequence of this colonisation is the regression of the aquatic and amphibious annual plant species, resulting from shading by dominant vegetation and from litter accumulation. A restoration experiment has been established on 6 pools in southern France testing the impact of shrub clearing on vegetation dynamics. The objective of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of the restoration of the community dominated by aquatic and amphibious annuals and to identify indicators for success (restoration of the target vegetation). This project hypothesized that recruitment from seed bank is the dominant mechanism for regeneration and that seed bank of the target species persisted in shrub-dominated areas of the pools. The seed bank was analysed by the germination method. Our analysis showed that seed banks for the annual amphibious and aquatic species were present in shrub dominated areas of the pools. Shrub clearing was followed in 2 pools by a significant increase in the richness of the vegetation in aquatic annual species. Among the other 4 pools the abundance of perennial herbaceous species and of annual terrestrial species were significantly negatively correlated with the number of aquatic annual species. Preliminary indicators for the success of restoration by shrub clearing are proposed based on existing vegetation, seed banks and hydrology. The importance of perennial grasses suggest that grazing combined with shrub clearing should achieve better results for the restoration of these annual dominated temporary pools.																	0340-269X					AUG 26	2005	35	2-3					489	510		10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0489							WOS:000231718000015						
J	Urban, KE				Urban, KE			Plant species dynamics during restoration of heath ponds in northwestern Germany	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												This study aimed at testing different restoration measures in oligotrophic heath ponds inhabited by amphibious, oligo- or mesotraphent plant species, many of which belong to the Littorelletea communities, to better understand the underlying processes of vegetation dynamics and to improve restoration techniques. Colonisation processes after vegetation removal and other measures were studied up to nine years in two heath ponds in northwestern Germany. On bare sandy soils where vegetation had been removed, initially environmental conditions were unstable. Most species expanded (but slowly) interspecific competition played a minor role. Where only Sphagnum mosses had been removed, the remaining vegetation expanded rapidly into free spaces and, furthermore, promoted germination and seedling growth. However, later Sphagnum mosses reappeared and hampered the growth and expansion of many vascular plant species. Morphogenetic plasticity, the ability of re-structuring the local distribution of the population and the possibility to form a long-term persistent seed bank (similar to 30 years), were identified as important features of pioneer plants in dynamic environments. Water table variation effected germination. For seedling survival even slight differences were relevant. In one pond studied, acidification caused a decline of characteristic soft water species (Littorelletea) 10-13 years after vegetation removal. In the other pond, a vegetation removal experiment was assumed to result in a long-lasting benefit for Scheuchzerio-Caricetea species. However, during the up to 9-year long study period, species turnovers were high and fairly unpredictable due to considerable fluctuations of the water table.																	0340-269X					AUG 26	2005	35	2-3					511	532		10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0511							WOS:000231718000016						
J	Deil, U				Deil, U			A review on habitats, plant traits and vegetation of ephemeral wetlands - a global perspective	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Based upon a world-wide literature review and a database, which refers to 250 publications and documents about 8500 phytosociological releves, the following questions are discussed: What are the common ecological parameters for temporary wetlands and which environmental conditions offer a niche for dwarf ephemerals? Which taxa have evolved and speciated within ephemeral wetland habitats? How do the relations between relief features, local hydrology and climatic conditions change in different parts of the world? Which global patterns In flora and vegetation do occur? The review is restricted to ephemeral freshwater ecosystems with the following two properties: Above-ground plant cover is seasonal, and the habitats are water-saturated or submerged only part of the year. For a better understanding of large-scale patterns, the results of studies about small-scale zonation, variability in time (phenology and year-to-year dynamics), ecophysiology and life strategies are briefly reported. Finally, conservation aspects and trends of floristic globalization are considered. 1. Seasonal pools: They occur in semi-arid and subhumid climates at both sides of the Tropic of Cancer. The catchment areas are local or the ponds are purely rainwater systems. 2. Amphibic shorelines of permanent ponds, lakes and rivers: They concentrate in perhumid extratropical temperate zones and in orotropical climates. Along allochthonous rivers with extended catchments and with seasonal flood pulse, large temporary flood-plains also occur in semi-arid regions. 3. Ephemeral flush habitats: In the perhumid tropics and in the subhumid subtropics, ephemeral wetlands are linked to runoff-habitats like the slopes of inselbergs and rock outcrops and to interflow habitats along intermittent streams. The distribution of some keystone taxa reflects the present climatic differentiation of the globe and to some extent also historical events (palaeogeography, speciation processes). Myosurus for example is linked to extratropical regions, Lilaeopsis to the New World and the Southern Hemisphere, Limnophila and Rhamphicarpa to the Palaeotropical. region. Vicariance patterns are a common phenomenon. Examples can be seen in Isoetes, Marsilea, Ophioglossum, Juncus (sections Tenageia, Ozophyllum and Caespitosi), Limosella, Crassula (section Helophytum), Bacopa, Hydrocotyle, Eriocaulon and Xyris. These genera speciated within this environment and evolved habitat equivalent species. The reduced size and the spatial isolation of the habitat reduce gene flow and favour allopatric speciation. The variability in time and small-scale ecological gradients stimulate sympatric speciation by temporal separation of the populations. Niche-equivalent taxa replace each other in different parts of the world. The niche of dwarf ephemeroid annuals is occupied by Centrolepidaceae in the Australian region, by Restionaceae in the Capensis, by Eriocaulaceae in the Australian region and East Asia, by Juncaceae in the holarctic kingdom, by Orcuttieae in the Californian phytogeographical sector, and by Cyperaceae, Crassulaceae, Gentianaceae, Elatinaceae and Apiaceae in all floristic kingdoms. Other predominant life forms are herbaceous perennials with the isoetid syndrome, geophytic ferns (Ophioglossum, Marsilea), carnivorous plants from the families Lentibulariaceae and Droseraceae, and polkilohydric vascular plants with the xyroid syndrome. The latter occur in the Tropics, with Xyridaceae (pantropical), Velloziaceae (neotropical region), Afrotrilepis, Craterostigma, Lindernia, Chamaegigas (palaeotropical region), Trilepis (neotropical region) and Borya (Australian region). The floristic kingdoms of the world are also reflected in the phytosociological classification of the ephemeral wetland communities. They are further differentiated according to climate zones and altitudinal belts. High ranked syntaxa in the New World are the Beckmannio syzigachne-Rumicetalia salicifolii (temperate regions of North America), Downingio bicornutae-Lasthenietea fremontii (Californian phytogeographical province), Mayacetea fluviatilis, Xyridetea savanensis and Leptocoryphio-Trachypogonetea (neotropical lowlands from Cuba via the Guiana Shield to northern Argentina), and Limoselletea australis (Andean belt in the neotropical region, lowlands in the extratropical parts of South America). The communities in the Western Palaearctis belong to the Isoeto-Nanojuncetea. Within this class, two orders can be separated according to species combination, ecology, predominant life form and phenology: Isoetetalia in the Mediterranean area and Cyperetalia fusci in the temperate zone of Eastern and Central Eurasia. Amphibic vegetation on mud soils in East Asia belongs to the Lindernion procumbentis, on nutrient poor soils to Eriocaulion atratae (Northern Japan) and Eriocaulion hondoensis (Southern Japan). Seasonal waterlogged soils in arctic and subarctic climates, often kept open by cryoturbation, are colonized by Koenigia islandica-communities. In subsaharan Africa, observations are scanty for the montane and subalpine zones of Eastern Africa (Limoselletea africanae) and preliminary for Southern Africa. In West Africa, the vegetation of ephemeral flush sites on inselbergs and of seasonal ponds in plains is better known. Communities on meso- and eutrophic sites there belong to the Rhamphicarpo fistulosae-Hygrophiletea senegalensis, on oligotrophic sites to the Drosero-Xyridetea. The latter class ranges throughout inselbergs in Central and Eastern Africa. Seasonal waterlogged soils in Central African lowlands are colonized by the Microchloetea indicae. Southwestern outposts of this class occur in Namibia. A high degree of endemism characterizes the Centrolepidi aristatae-Hydrocolyletea alatae, distributed in the mediterranean climate of SW Australia, and the Crassulo sinclairii-Hydrocotyletea hydrophilae, which occur in New Zealand. Communities with Lilaeopsis polyantha are distributed from Tasmania to SE Australia. Vegetation zonation according to water depth, periods of inundation and time of emergence is a characteristic feature of temporary ponds and emergent shorelines. Other differentiating gradients can be soil depth and water storage capacity (on rock outcrops), duration of seepage water flow (on inselbergs), wave respectively ice scour intensity (in the shoreline habitat), frost-heaving intensity (in subarctic and oreotropical climates) and salinity (in endorheic playa lakes in arid and semi-arid climates). These environmental gradients result in repetitive patterns of contact series of plant communities (= zonation complexes). Inundation experiments and seed bank analysis show that in a given year, only part of the seeds are stimulated to germinate. At a given place different plant communities can be awakened by different flooding regimes. The seed bank makes the temporary wetland ecosystems resilient to the interannual variability of ponding. Seasonal dynamics and year-to-year variability are prominent attributes of ephemeral wetland vegetation. A high species turnover in the growing season allows to separate ecophases respectively chronocoenoses. Plant response to drought is individualistic and depends largely on the timing of meteorological events in relation to life-stages. Such a germination and sprouting ecology can explain the year-to-year fluctuations of vegetation zones. Interannual variability is greater on shallow soils and more accentuated in the summer ecophases respectively increases from the pool centre to the margins. The habitats are not submitted to progressive succession, when they are of primary nature and when the natural dynamic of the hydrological or geomorphological process continues. Temporary wetlands shelter extremely rare and isolated taxa. The habitats are sensitive to human impact and they are threatened in many parts of the world. A strong decline can be stated for many species in Central Europe. The main reasons are missing dynamics of the river systems, abandonment of extensive pasturing and - in consequence - rare soil disturbance. Some species shift from primary to man-made habitats such as drained fish-ponds, arable land, rice fields and irrigated turfs. First tendencies of a globalization of the ephemeral wetland flora can be observed.																	0340-269X					AUG 26	2005	35	2-3					533	705		10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0533							WOS:000231718000017

Seedling emergence for grasses, forbs and subshrubs was found to mainly occur in a brief pulse at the start of the wet season following fire or the removal of grass biomass. Only a minor number of tree and shrub seedlings were detected overall. Burning, or cutting away the grass layer in unburnt savanna, in both the early (i.e. May) and the late (i.e. October) dry seasons significantly increased seedling emergence over undisturbed savanna that had been unburnt for 3 years. Removing the grass layer in unburnt savanna, during either the early or the late dry season, triggered similar seedling densities to savanna burnt in the early dry season. Late dry season fires promoted the greatest seedling density. We attribute this to the higher intensity, late dry season fires releasing a greater proportion of seed from dormancy, coupled with the higher density of soil seed reserves present in the late dry season.

J	Adams, VM; Marsh, DM; Knox, JS				Adams, VM; Marsh, DM; Knox, JS			Importance of the seed bank for population viability and population monitoring in a threatened wetland herb	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Although demographic models have become increasingly important tools in plant conservation, few models have considered the implications of seed banks for population persistence. Based on a 15-year study of the threatened herb, Helenium virginicum, we created a stage-class transition matrix to model the population dynamics of the plant. Our goal was to determine the role of the seed bank in population persistence and in the design of monitoring programs for the plant. Using data from marked plants, a long-term study of seed viability, and a seed bank census, we created a deterministic model and three stochastic models. The stochastic models were a model in which yearly correlations among parameters were retained, a model in which parameters were uncorrelated, and a model in which parameters were derived from log-normal distribution. We also constructed a fourth model in which we assumed a minimum seed lifetime consistent with the seed viability data. Both elasticity and perturbation analysis suggested that seed survival within the seed bank had by far the largest effects on the population growth rate (lambda), with 47-64% of the change in lambda being controlled by seed survival. Correlations among life history parameters had little effect on lambda in the original models, but substantially reduced lambda (from 0.97 to 0.86) when seed survival was limited. Given the importance of the seed bank and the high yearly variability in adult plant density, we used simulations to compare power to detect declines with seed bank samples versus censuses of adult plants. The power of adult plant censuses was extremely low (13-22%). The power of seed bank censuses was substantially higher (48-59%), but was limited by large pulses of recruitment to the seed bank in good years. Power was only moderately reduced when seeds were sampled every two or four years instead of yearly (from 59% to 48%). Together, our results suggest that seed survival is crucial to persistence of Helenium populations and that future empirical studies should focus on understanding the factors that affect seed survival. In addition, managers should consider seed bank censuses rather than above-ground plants when designing monitoring programs for plants in variable environments where above-ground plants vary greatly from year to year.

Seed density in the soil seed bank for yellow starthistle and the number of overwintering insects provide between-season links. Seed germination intensity and pattern is determined by the timing and quantity of autumn rains and temperatures, while season-length is mostly determined by soil-water balance. Output from the yellow starthistle systems model was integrated into a geographic information system to examine regional differences in abundance for all species across several ecological zones of California. A marginal analysis of the simulation results was performed to examine the efficacy of each capitulum-feeding insect, their within-capitulum competitive interactions, and the effect of competition from annual grasses on yellow starthistle populations. The model suggests that lack of complete control of yellow starthistle may be due to plant compensation via increased per-plant seed production at lower plant densities and the incomplete destruction of seed in attacked capitula. The model suggests herbivory that reduces the plant's ability to compensate and/or kills whole plants before seed maturity would most likely lead to control of yellow starthistle.

J	Brock, MA; Nielsen, DL; Crossle, K				Brock, MA; Nielsen, DL; Crossle, K			Changes in biotic communities developing from freshwater wetland sediments under experimental salinity and water regimes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Reduction in diversity of both freshwater aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems has been attributed to salinity increase and such increases are a symptom of changes to land use. Hydrological alteration to ground and surface water are likely to be associated with salinity increase and its influence on biodiversity. However the combined effects of salinity and hydrology on aquatic biodiversity have not been elucidated fully in either field or experimental situations. 2. The effect of salinity and water regime on the biota in sediments from seven wetlands from inland south-eastern Australia was tested experimentally using germination of aquatic plant seeds (five salinity and two water levels) and emergence of zooplankton eggs (five salinity levels). Salinity levels were < 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000 mg L-1 and water regimes were damp (waterlogged) and submerged. 3. Aquatic plant germination and zooplankton hatching was not consistent for all seven wetland sediments. Four of the wetland sediments, Narran Lakes, Gwydir Wetlands, Macquarie Marshes and Billybung Lagoon showed similar responses to salinity and water regime but the other three wetland sediments from Lake Cowal, Great Cumbung Swamp and Darling Anabranch did not. 4. As salinity increased above 1000 mg L-1 there was a decrease in the species richness and the abundance of biota germinating or hatching from sediment from four of the wetlands. 5. Salinity had a particularly strong effect in reducing germination from sediments in damp conditions when compared to the flooded conditions. In parallel, salts accumulated in the sediment in damp conditions but did not in flooded conditions. 6. There is potential for increasing salinity in freshwater rivers and wetlands to decrease the species richness of aquatic communities and thus of the wetland community as a whole, resulting in loss of wetland biodiversity. This reduction in diversity varies between wetlands and is at least partly related to hydrology. For aquatic plants the reduction in diversity will be more marked for plants germinating from seed banks at the edges of wetlands where plants are not completely submerged than for the same seed bank germinating in submerged conditions.

J	Nicole, F; Brzosko, E; Till-Bottraud, I				Nicole, F; Brzosko, E; Till-Bottraud, I			Population viability analysis of Cypripedium calceolus in a protected area: longevity, stability and persistence	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Cypripedium calceolus L. is an emblematic long-lived clonal orchid which has suffered an alarming decline throughout Eurasia. We performed a population viability analysis on three island populations in a protected area to estimate population viability and thus to gain a better understanding of the species and its needs. We developed a 10-stage matrix model, comprising the seed bank, the first 4 years underground, juveniles, young and adult clump stages and three dormant stages, from an 11-year census. All analyses indicate that the three populations have remarkably slow and stable dynamics, with stochastic growth rates close to 1 after 100 years and very slow convergence to equilibrium. The system is probably stabilized by the long life span of clumps (mean longevity from 110 to 350 years). Retrospective and perturbation analyses showed that adult dormancy had an important role in the dynamics, and adult survival and seed persistence were key factors in maintaining population stability and persistence. A young, uniformly distributed population had fewer, shorter lived adult clumps than two older, aggregated populations. Although no perceptible change was predicted for the next 100 years, the younger population was more sensitive to environmental variations and may go extinct in the next 250-500 years, depending on longevity of the seed bank. C. calceolus populations can persist in a protected area where there are only slow changes in habitat through secondary forest succession. The dramatic decrease in C. calceolus population size and area over 20 years in Eurasia suggests that many populations have experienced unforeseeable extrinsic disturbances or unfavourable habitat disturbances. Our Population Viability Analysis indicated the importance of habitat vs. individual conservation for the protection of C. calceolus populations. As this species is usually found within rich orchid communities, it should be used as an umbrella species in management plans.

A part of the plantation was cleared in December 1997 and study plots were set up on a cleared site and a preserved site. Soil samples (a total of 1051 for the preserved plot and 901 for the cleared plot) were collected from surface soils in spring 1998 and were incubated in a greenhouse for 120 days. There were an estimated 1064 buried viable seeds per square meter from 67 species in the preserved plot and 1754 seeds/m(2) from 53 species in the cleared plot. The soil seed bank was from mostly low density species with some high density species, and contained many pioneer species that were absent in the floor vegetation. Buried viable seeds were clumped together, especially in gravity-dispersal species. Although plenty of buried viable seeds were pooled in the soil, few seedlings emerged on the forest floor. In contrast, a number of seedlings, including many pioneer species, emerged in the cleared plots, showing a positive correlation between seed weight and germination rate. It is assumed that dominance of the seedlings established after clear-cutting depends on germination rates and/or growth rates of the seedlings rather than the initial density of buried viable seeds. These results suggest strong contribution of the soil seed bank to the establishment of the secondary vegetation after disturbance in a mature conifer plantation.																	1341-6979	1610-7403				AUG	2005	10	4					295	304		10.1007/s10310-004-0138-3							WOS:000231325900005

Method: Species richness was recorded annually for seven years following plowing of an upland and lowland old-field subject to crossed fertilizer and disturbance treatments (mowing and rototilling). Species occupancy distributions were assessed with respect to the numbers of core and satellite species. Results: In both fields, species richness became higher in disturbed plots than in undisturbed plots over time, and decreased in fertilized plots irrespective of time. A bimodal pattern of species richness consistent with the Core-satellite species (CSS) hypothesis occurred in the initial seed bank and through the course of early succession. The identity of native and exotic core species (those present in > 90% of blocks) changed with time. Some core species from the seed bank became core species in the vegetation, albeit after several years. At the scale of individual plots, a bimodal fit consistent with the CSS hypothesis applied only in year I and rarely thereafter. Conclusions: The CSS hypothesis provides a metapopulation perspective for understanding patterns of species richness but requires the assessment of spatial and temporal scaling effects. Regional processes (e.g. propagule availability) at the largest scale have the greatest impact influencing community structure during early secondary succession. Local processes (e.g., disturbance and soil nutrients) are more important at smaller scales and place constraints on species establishment and community structure of both native and exotic species. Under the highest intensity of disturbance, exotic species may be able to use resources unavailable to, or unused by, native species.

J	Legere, A; Stevenson, FC; Benoit, DL				Legere, A; Stevenson, FC; Benoit, DL			Diversity and assembly of weed communities: contrasting responses across cropping systems	WEED RESEARCH												Diversity and weed community composition of mid-season plant stands and autumn seedbanks were examined in spring barley-red clover cropping systems that varied according to crop rotation, tillage and weed management. Weed plant and seed density data collected over 4 years were used in the calculation of species richness (number of species), evenness (Shannon's E) and diversity (Shannon's H'), and in multivariate analysis (canonical discriminant analysis) of weed communities. Weed diversity indices were low (H' < 2.0) but sensitive to management practices. Evenness had intermediate values (E = 0.4-0.8), suggesting little evidence of truly dominant species, particularly in the seedbanks. The difference in the number of species between treatments was never large (approximately two to four species). Overall, diversity indices were highest in the low disturbance treatments, particularly those with minimum weed management. Factors affecting ordination were somewhat different from those affecting diversity. Tillage had little effect on weed diversity indices but had a more major role in determining weed community composition. Seed-banks in no-till and monoculture-chisel plough treatments appeared to have more distinctive species composition compared with other treatments. Weed species assembly in seedbanks showed little discrimination across treatments and over time, confirming the ability of seedbanks to buffer disturbances across a variety of cropping systems. The use of diversity indices revealed part of the complexity of weed communities associated with disturbance in cropping systems, whereas ordination singled out species-cropping systems associations, which may be more meaningful to weed management.																	0043-1737					AUG	2005	45	4					303	315		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2005.00459.x							WOS:000230881300008						
J	Smith, RG; Gross, KL; Januchowski, S				Smith, RG; Gross, KL; Januchowski, S			Earthworms and weed seed distribution in annual crops	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												A field study was conducted to determine if earthworm activity would affect the abundance and composition of weed seed banks in annual row-crops. The abundance of weed seeds in surface-deposited earthworm casts was determined in continuous monocultures and rotations that included corn, soybean, and winter wheat, with or without cover crop. Casts were collected weekly over the growing season and the weed seed content determined by direct germination in a heated greenhouse. Weed seed composition in surface casts was compared to that in the seed bank (0-5 cm) and soil surface by the same method. Earthworm cast production varied temporally and among crops and was higher in winter wheat compared to corn or soybean. The effect of crop rotation on cast production was significant only in soybean, with the highest production in monocultures compared to three-crop rotations. Weed seed densities were significantly higher in casts collected from winter wheat than corn or soybean. Comparisons of the composition and relative abundance of seeds in earthworm casts with the surface soil layer and seed batik suggest that earthworms contribute to redistribution of weed seeds over the growing season.

The legume species maintain or enhance wheat yield and regenerate from the soil seed bank. Our objectives were to determine: (i) grain yield when wheat followed legume forages and (ii) if legume species regenerated naturally following wheat in western North Dakota. Ten to 30 legume species were established in field experiments in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Legumes that regenerated or persisted in the second year were terminated chemically before seeding wheat in the third year. Plots were fallowed in the second year where legumes failed to regenerate or persist. Grain yield ranged from 1290 to 4100 kg ha(-1) across the 3 yr when wheat followed yellow-flowered sweetclover (Melitotus officinalis Lam.) and was equal or enhanced compared with fallowed plots where legumes did not reseed in 2 yr (P < 0.05). Grain yield never was enhanced and sometimes was reduced when wheat followed other legume forages compared with fallowed plots. Legume seedlings regenerated following wheat in birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) plots in all 3 yr, and forage production exceeded 3 Mg ha(-1) in 2 yr. Other legume species failed to regenerate or produced less forage than birdsfoot trefoil in at least I yr. Birdsfoot trefoil has potential as a regenerating pasture species, but strategies are needed to enhance grain yield in legume-wheat rotations.																	0002-1962	1435-0645				JUL-AUG	2005	97	4					1270	1277		10.2134/agronj2005.0007							WOS:000231038100029

Seed exposure to extended flooding and saline conditions significantly affected the outcome of the germination process in a different, though predictable, way for cacti species, after favorable conditions for germination were restored. Tolerance of the germination process was related to the average salinity level measured during the growth/germination season at sites, where established individuals of each Species dominated the species cover. No relationship was found between salinity tolerance of the germination process and seed response to extended exposure to flooding and salinity conditions. The salinity response was significantly related to the conditions prevailing in the habitats of the respective species during the unfavorable (nongrowth/nongermination) season. Our results indicate that changes in salinity and hydrology while seeds are dormant affect the outcome of the seed-bank response. even when conditions it germination are identical. Because these environmental-history-dependent responses differentially affect seed germination, seedling density. and probably sexual recruitment in the studied and related species, these influences should be considered for wetland restoration and management.

J	Henderson, DC; Naeth, MA				Henderson, DC; Naeth, MA			Multi-scale impacts of crested wheatgrass invasion in mixed-grass prairie	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Most of North America's northern Great Plains have been cultivated for crop production, leaving remnants of natural mixed-grass prairie fragmented and threatened by alien plant invasions. The region's most widespread alien perennial forage crop, crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum sensu amplo), has invaded native grassland and raised concerns regarding its ecological impact. To evaluate impacts at multiple scales of organization, adjacent invaded and uninvaded mixed-grass prairie were sampled at eight widely separated locations. At the population level, native C-3 mid-grasses and forbs were less abundant in invaded grasslands, while native C-3 and C-4 short-grass abundance was not different. At community and landscape levels, diversity was lower in invaded grasslands largely because of lower forb species richness and cover, and crested wheatgrass dominance of both cover (14% basal cover) and seed-bank (404 seeds m(-2)). At the ecosystem level, both vegetation and litter biomass were greater in invaded grasslands, however, below ground organic matter (roots and litter), soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus were not different. Crested wheatgrass invasion of mixed-grass prairie was associated with lower diversity within and among plant communities, and appears to simplify the composition of mixed-grass prairie landscapes. Hypotheses for crested wheatgrass dominance and persistence following invasion are suggested.

We compared the number and species composition of seedlings emerging from soil sampled in 11 uninvaded wetlands and paired uninvaded and invaded sites within 10 invaded wetlands under both seedling competition and noncompetitive conditions. Almost no L. salicaria emerged in samples from uninvaded wetlands, indicating dispersal limitation despite prodigious seed production in nearby wetlands. However L. salicaria emerged in all samples from uninvaded sites in invaded wetlands, suggesting environmental limits on establishment within invaded wetlands. Conditions that provided opportunities for seedlings to compete reduced survival of Typha spp. but not L. salicaria seedlings. However, this was due to species-specific differences in post-emergence mortality rather than response to competition. Competition did reduce seedling mass, but this effect did not differ among species. Species richness of emerging seedlings was lower for invaded than uninvaded wetlands. Lower seed bank richness may be a cause or consequence of L. salicaria invasion. Efforts to reduce seed dispersal to uninvaded wetlands would likely slow the spread of this invader.

We investigated whether introduced bison on Santa Catalina Island, California, have the potential to spread non-native plants through the shedding of clumps of seed-laden hair and/or ingesting and later excreting seeds. We collected clumps of hair shaved from bison during a roundup and dislodged by wallowing activity. Greenhouse and field trials were used to test for seed viability and persistence of hair clumps in wallows. In addition to trials with bison hair, we collected samples of bison dung and tested for seed germination in a greenhouse. The majority of seeds extracted from bison hair clumps were of non-native forbs. There was a significant positive relationship between the size of hair clumps and the number of seeds extracted from the clumps, suggesting that managing the introduced bison population at a lower level will help minimize the spread of non-native plants by the species. Seeds of non-native plants were capable of germinating under conditions similar to those on Santa Catalina Island. Clumps of bison hair persisted in wallows, but did not remain intact and lost nearly 40% of their original mass. The number of germinable seeds contained in bison dung was low: 18 seeds germinated from 6 of 18 dung samples. Introduced bison appear to facilitate the dispersal of non-native plants over native plants on Santa Catalina Island. Our study suggests that a comprehensive strategy to control non-native plants must involve the management of the animal agents of plant dispersal.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				JUL	2005	7	4					699	709		10.1007/s10530-004-5859-x							WOS:000231804500014						
J	Simard, M; Payette, S				Simard, M; Payette, S			Reduction of black spruce seed bank by spruce budworm infestation compromises postfire stand regeneration	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												In the southern boreal forest of eastern Canada, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) is subjected to both defoliating insect and fire disturbances. As black spruce depends on its aerial seed bank for postfire regeneration, reduction of cone crop during a spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreak opens a vulnerability window during which stand regeneration could be hindered in the event of a fire. To assess the long-term effect of spruce budworm outbreak on black spruce reproductive potential, cone production and viable seed bank were estimated using cone crop surveys and germination trials in black spruce - lichen woodland stands that sustained different levels of defoliation during the 1980s. Black spruce cone crop was significantly related to the defoliation history of the stands (R-2 = 0.89), but not to stand age, basal area, or tree density. Black spruce stands damaged by severe defoliation showed a smaller number of cones, a higher incidence of insect-damaged cones, and a viable seed bank 3 to 17 times smaller than a lightly defoliated stand. The vulnerability window for black spruce regeneration following a spruce budworm outbreak may be as long as 20 years in the study area because black spruce seed bank in heavily defoliated stands has not yet replenished. Our work supports conclusions from stand reconstruction studies that suggest closed-crown spruce-moss stands convert to open lichen woodlands as a result of weak postfire regeneration caused by successive insect and fire disturbances.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												A review of biological information is provided for Raphanus raphanistrum L. Native to the Mediterranean region, the species is widely introduced and naturalized in temperate regions around the world. In Canada, it currently occurs in all provinces except Saskatchewan and Manitoba, has only a limited distribution in Alberta, and is also absent from the Yukon; the Northwest Territories and Nunavut: It is most abundant in the Atlantic and Pacific regions and is an important weed of field crops in the Maritime provinces and Quebec. A persistent seed bank, competitive annual growth habit and high fecundity all contribute to its weedy nature and ensure that it will be a continuing problem. It can easily hybridize with cultivated radish, R. sativus L., and commonly does so when they occur together. Limited hybridization with canola, Brassica napus L., has been reported from several experimental field and greenhouse trials. Selective herbicide control is most difficult in canola and other cruciferous crops. It is the most important dicot weed in the southwestern region of Australia, primarily due to the evolution of several different herbicide-resistant biotypes. These include biotypes resistant to the acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibitors (group 2 herbicides) and/or photosystem II-inhibitors (group 5), and a biotype with multiple resistance to ALS-inhibitors, photosystem II-inhibitors, an auxin (2,4-D amine), and a phytoene desaturase (PSDS)-inhibitor (diflufenican). A biotype resistant to the ALS-inhibiting herbicide chlorsulfuron has also been detected in South Africa.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				JUL	2005	85	3					709	733		10.4141/P04-120							WOS:000232484400025

The results show that continuous heavy grazing results in a considerable decrease in vegetation cover, height, standing biomass and root biomass, and a significant increase in animal hoof impacts. As a result, small bare spots appeared on the ground and later merged into larger bare areas in the rangeland. Total bare area reached up to 52% and the average depth of wind erosion was 25 cm in the fifth year of the study. We conclude that sandy rangeland with wind-erodible soil is susceptible to desertification. Heavy grazing of such rangeland should be avoided. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of dominant species on vegetation change in Carolina bay wetlands following a multi-year drought. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 132: 411-420. 2005.-Wetland vegetation is strongly dependent upon climate-influenced hydrologic conditions, and plant composition responds in generally consistent ways to droughts. However, the extent of species composition change during drought may be influenced by the pre-existing structure of wetland vegetation. We characterized the vegetation of ten herbaceous Carolina bay wetlands on the South Carolina Upper Coastal Plain during a period of average rainfall and again near the end of a four-year drought. We hypothesized that, as a group, bays dominated by less robust plant species (characteristic of open-water pond and depression meadow vegetation types) would show greater compositional change than bays dominated by dense, robust-form clonal graminoids (characteristic of grass and sedge marsh vegetation types). Aquatic species decreased during the drought in all wetlands, regardless of vegetation group. Compared to grass/sedge marshes, pond/meadow wetlands acquired more species, particularly non-wetland species, during the drought. Pond/meadow wetlands also had greater increases in the abundances of species that require unflooded conditions to establish. Prior to the drought, all wetlands were ponded almost continuously, but during drought the pond/meadow wetlands had shorter and more variable hydroperiods than the grass/sedge marshes. Thus, vegetation change may be partly confounded with hydrologic conditions that provide greater opportunities for species recruitment in pond/meadow bays. The results suggest that Carolina bay vegetation dynamics may differ as a function of dominant vegetation and climate-driven variation in wetland hydrologic condition.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL-SEP	2005	132	3					411	420		10.3159/1095-5674(2005)132[411:EODSOV]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000233692800004

Part 1: implications of environmental stochasticity	OIKOS												Transgenes in plants affect life history traits including seed survival and germination. With stochastic matrix models we predict population-level consequences of transgene induced life history changes. We assess systematically which changes in life history traits, resulting from genetic modification, may increase the risk of invasion and persistence of feral crops or increase fitness in case of introgression from arable fields into conspecific, feral populations. We apply our method to feral populations of oilseed rape. Like many annual weeds, oilseed rape depends critically on disturbance; in undisturbed habitats it is generally outcompeted by perennials. The associated inherent variability and unpredictability render deterministic models inappropriate. With a stochastic matrix model we study population growth rate, elasticities and quasi-extinction times. Our results indicate that changes in survival in the seed bank impact population growth and persistence most. Less important are dormancy, fecundity and seedling survival. The predicted distribution of extinction times is highly skewed, with some patches persisting for decades.

J	Claessen, D; Gilligan, CA; van den Bosch, F				Claessen, D; Gilligan, CA; van den Bosch, F			Which traits promote persistence of feral GM crops? Part 2: implications of metapopulation structure	OIKOS												Transgenes may spread from crops into the environment via the establishment of feral populations, often initiated by seed spill from transport lorries or farm machinery. Locally, such populations are often subject to large environmental variability and usually do not persist longer than a few years. Because secondary feral populations may arise from seed dispersal to adjacent sites, the dynamics of such populations should be studied in a metapopulation context. We study a structured metapopulation model with local dispersal, mimicking a string of roadside subpopulations of a feral crop. Population growth is assumed to be subject to local disturbances, introducing spatially random environmental stochasticity. Our aim is to understand the role of dispersal and environmental variability in the dynamics of such ephemeral populations. We determine the effect of dispersal on the extinction boundary and on the distribution of persistence times, and investigate the influence of spatially correlated disturbances as opposed to spatially random disturbances. We find that, given spatially random disturbances, dispersal slows down the decline of the metapopulation and results in the occurrence of long-lasting local populations which remain more or less static in space. We identify which life history traits, if changed by genetic modification, have the largest impact on the population growth rate and persistence times. For oilseed rape, these are seed bank survival and dormancy. Combining our findings with literature data on transgene-induced life history changes, we predict that persistence is promoted by transgenes for oil-modifications (high stearate or high laurate) and, possibly, for insect resistence (Bt). Transgenic tolerance to glufosinate herbicide is predicted to reduce persistence.

All thirteen isolated Carex sylvatica populations in the Dutch Rhine floodplain (including the river branches Waal and IJssel) were mapped in detail and analysed for genetic variation at a large number of AFLP loci and one microsatellite locus. Across all populations, only 40% of the sampled individuals (n = 216) represented a unique genotype. A high number of the studied patches (spatial clusters of tussocks, 210 m in diameter) within populations contained only one or a few genotypes. identical plants (tussocks) were also found 20500 m apart and in one case even 1000 m apart. Observed heterozygosity levels (H-O = 0.029) were low, indicating low levels of gene flow, which is in agreement with the selfing nature of other caespitose sedges. Although the number of genotypes in populations is low, these genotypes are genetically very distinct and variation within populations accounted for 55% of the total variation. The absence of a correlation between genetic and geographic distances among populations, and the scattered distribution of genotypes among patches within woodlands, support our hypothesis of rare establishments and subsequent local dispersal within woodlands in this forest floor species, which may benefit from and partly depend on human land use and forest management activities.

J	Jones, RE; Medd, RW				Jones, RE; Medd, RW			A methodology for evaluating risk and efficacy of weed management technologies	WEED SCIENCE												A stochastic simulation modeling framework was developed for measuring the impact of weed management technologies in terms of their risk and efficacy. The framework explicitly accounted for the variability of environmental conditions, which underpins risk, and its effect upon the weed population dynamics and crop yields. It was applied to wild oat and wild radish in spring wheat as case studies. Technologies considered included a postemergence herbicide, preseeding tillage, increased crop density and a selective spray-topping (seed-head sterilizing) herbicide. All stages of the weed life cycle were specified as random variables on the basis of triangular probability distributions, which either were derived from daily environmental conditions or specified as a subjective probability distribution. By using probability density functions the study identified the risks to changes in the weed seed bank and weed density associated with various integrated weed management strategies. This approach not only quantified the probabilities associated with the different outcomes, but also identified how the probability distributions of outcomes were changed as a result of different technology combinations used in weed management strategies. For instance, strategies involving a selective spray-topping herbicide to control seed rain not only resulted in lower seed banks, but the range in possible values was considerably reduced, implying lower likelihood of a population increase. The use of such a risk framework not only benefits weed scientists in terms of designing more effective weed management technologies, but can also assist farmer adoption by being able to quantify the probabilities of success and failure of a technology.																	0043-1745					JUL-AUG	2005	53	4					505	514		10.1614/WS-04-153-R							WOS:000230999200012

Seed shed was prevented in two patches and allowed to occur in two patches (nontreated controls). Annual patch expansion was determined by seed bank sampling and mapping. Crop management practices were performed by the grower. Area of treated patches increased by 35% over the 6-yr period, whereas nontreated patches increased by 330%. Patch expansion was attributed mainly to natural seed dispersal (nontreated) or seed movement by equipment at time of seeding (nontreated and treated). Extensive seed shed from plants in nontreated patches before harvest or control of resistant plants by alternative herbicides minimized seed movement by the combine harvester. Although both treated and nontreated patches were relatively stable over time in this cropping system, preventing seed production and shed in herbicide-resistant wild oat patches can markedly slow the rate of patch expansion.

J	Greve, TM; Krause-Jensen, D; Rasmussen, MB; Christensen, PB				Greve, TM; Krause-Jensen, D; Rasmussen, MB; Christensen, PB			Means of rapid eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) recolonisation in former dieback areas	AQUATIC BOTANY												Recolonisation of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) was studied in a Danish estuary during summer 2001 following an anoxia event the previous summer. Leaf bundles had detached from the rhizomes while healthy-looking roots and rhizomes remained in the sediment. We hypothesise that the stabilising effect of remaining belowground biomass, the presence of rhizomes with buds, the presence of a large seed bank and the potential surviving shoots from the previous population may stimulate and speed up recovery in previously colonised areas compared to bare areas. A large seed bank containing more than 11,000 seeds m(-2) Was found in the dieback area. Seeds were found in the upper 14 cm of the sediment but judging from the length of the hypocotyle of the seedlings, only seeds from the upper 5.5 cm of sediment germinated successfully. The upper 5.5 cm represented a seed pool of approximately 1000 seeds m(-2). Germination of these seeds was the primary mode of recolonisation in the estuary, since 96% of the plants in the investigated plot were seedlings. Only 4% of the plants were survivors from the previous year. Although densities of seedlings may exceed densities of surviving shoots, we argue that plants surviving oxygen depletion may still contribute considerably to the recolonisation of a former dieback area as these plants have faster elongation and branching rates and lower mortality rates relative to seedlings. There was no indication of recolonisation from dormant buds on rhizomes. This finding was confirmed in laboratory experiments where buds failed to germinate in the absence of the apical shoot. We examined the structure and ageing of buds and found general withering with age, indicating that buds should germinate shortly after the dieback if at all. Our results, therefore, suggest that rhizome buds are not dormant buds but simply side shoots that have failed to grow. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	McIvor, JG; McIntyre, S; Saeli, I; Hodgkinson, JJ				McIvor, JG; McIntyre, S; Saeli, I; Hodgkinson, JJ			Patch dynamics in grazed subtropical native pastures in south-east Queensland	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Patch formation is common in grazed grasslands but the mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of patches are not clear. To increase our knowledge on this subject we examined possible reasons for patch formation and the influence of management on changes between patch states in three experiments in native pasture communities in the Crows Nest district, south-east Queensland. In these communities, small-scale patches (tall grassland (dominated by large and medium tussock grasses), short swards (dominated by short tussock grasses and sedges), and lawns (dominated by stoloniferous and/or rhizomatous grasses)) are readily apparent. We hypothesized that the formation of short sward and lawn patches in areas of tall grassland was due to combinations of grazing and soil fertility effects. This was tested in Experiment 1 by applying a factorial combination of defoliation, nutrient application and transplants of short tussock and stoloniferous species to a uniform area of tall grassland. Total species density declined during the experiment, was lower with high nutrient applications, but was not affected by defoliation. There were significant changes in abundance of species that provided support for our hypotheses. With light defoliation and low nutrients, the tall grassland remained dominated by large tussock grasses and contained considerable amounts of forbs. With heavy defoliation, the pastures were dominated by medium tussock grasses and there were significant decreases in forbs and increases in sedges (mainly with low nutrients) and stoloniferous grasses (mainly with high nutrients). Total germinable seed densities and those of most species groups were significantly lower in the heavy defoliation than the light defoliation plots. Total soil seed numbers were not affected by nutrient application but there were fewer seeds of the erect forbs and more sedge seeds in plots with high nutrients. The use of resting from grazing and fire to manage transitions between patches was tested. In Experiment 2, changes in species density and abundance were measured for 5 years in the three patch types with and without grazing. Experiment 3 examined the effects of fire, grazing and resting on short sward patches over 4 years. In Experiment 2, total species density was lower in lawn than short sward or tall grassland patches, and there were more species of erect forbs than other plant groups in all patch types. The lawn patches were originally dominated by Cynodon spp. This dominance continued with grazing but in ungrazed patches the abundance of Cynodon spp. declined and that of forbs increased. In the short sward patches, dominance of short tussock grasses continued with grazing but in ungrazed plots their abundance declined while that of large tussock grasses increased. The tall grassland patches remained dominated by large and medium tussock species. In Experiment 3, fire had no effect on species abundance. On the grazed plots the short tussock grasses remained dominant but where the plots were rested from grazing the small tussock grasses declined and the large tussock grasses increased in abundance. The slow and relatively small changes in these experiments over 4 or 5 years showed how stable the composition of these pastures is, and that rapid changes between patch types are unlikely.

J	Kolb, A; Diekmann, M				Kolb, A; Diekmann, M			Effects of life-history traits on responses of plant species to forest fragmentation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Knowing the general principles of plant-environment relationships is required to be able to predict changes in species occurrence and abundance in changing landscapes. Because habitat fragmentation may affect the dispersal, establishment, and persistence of species in various ways, we expected associations between species life-history traits related to these processes and their responses to fragmentation. We tested (1) whether groups of plant species with specific biological attributes are especially affected by forest fragmentation and (2) whether regionally rare species are more negatively affected than more common species. We surveyed 145 deciduous forest patches in northwestern Germany for the presence of a large set of forest plant species. For each of 82 species, we collected data on eight life-history traits and estimated species' responses to decreased patch size and increased distance to other occupied forest patches. We classified species into two emergent groups that differed strongly with respect to most considered life-history traits. The group of species that was more negatively affected by isolation mostly consisted of clonal forest specialist species characterized by few and heavy diaspores, lack of dispersal structures, small size, short-lived seeds, and insect pollination. There was no effect of patch area. Univariate analyses revealed (marginally) significant relationships between species' responses to isolation and diaspore number and mass, plant height, and habitat preference and between responses to patch area and seed-bank longevity plant height, and habitat preference. Regional frequency of occurrence was not correlated to species' responses to fragmentation and did not differ between the two emergent groups. Rare species, however, were smaller and produced fewer and shorter-lived diaspores than common species. Forest fragmentation may thus threaten species differently, depending on their specific biological characteristics. Approaches based on life-history traits potentially allow prediction of species' responses to habitat fragmentation and may therefore aid in the assessment of the endangerment of plant species and ultimately in the conservation of biological diversity.

J	Orrock, JL; Damschen, EI				Orrock, JL; Damschen, EI			Corridors cause differential seed predation	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Corridors that connect disjunct populations are heavily debated in conservation, largely because the effects of corridors have rarely been evaluated by replicated, large-scale studies. Using large-scale experimental landscapes, we found that, in addition to documented positive effects, corridors also have negative impacts on bird-dispersed plants by affecting seed predation, and that overall predation is a function of the seeds' primary consumer (rodents or arthropods). Both large-seeded Prunus serotina and small-seeded Rubus allegheniensis experienced greater predation in connected patches. However, P. serotina experienced significantly less seed predation compared to R. allegheniensis in unconnected patches, due to decreased impacts of rodent seed predators on this large-seeded species. Viewed in light of previous evidence that corridors have beneficial impacts by increasing pollination and seed dispersal, this work demonstrates that corridors may have both positive and negative effects for the same plant species at different life stages. Moreover, these effects may differentially affect plant species within the same community: seeds primarily consumed by rodents suffer less predation in unconnected patches. By shifting the impact of rodent and arthropod seed predators, corridors constructed for plant conservation could lead to shifts in the seed bank.

J	Hirst, RA; Pywell, RF; Marrs, RH; Putwain, PD				Hirst, RA; Pywell, RF; Marrs, RH; Putwain, PD			The resilience of calcareous and mesotrophic grasslands following disturbance	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Understanding habitat disturbance and recovery is vital for successful conservation management and restoration, particularly of subseral communities with high nature conservation interest and sites subject to unavoidable disturbance pressures, such as that arising from access and recreational activities. 2. Grassland resilience was investigated on the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA) in southern England, the largest of the UK military training areas. SPTA contains the greatest expanse of unimproved chalk grassland in north-west Europe, a habitat of particular nature conservation interest. 3. Historical aerial photographs were used to identify 82 calcareous and mesotrophic grassland sites disturbed over a 50-year time period. Vegetation, soils and seed bank data were collected from each old disturbance site. Revegetation time periods following disturbance were compared, and habitat resilience following disturbance investigated using the succession of surface vegetation along the chronosequence, the combined changes of vegetation and soil chemistry, and finally vegetation and seed bank composition. 4. The sampled calcareous grasslands were less resilient following disturbance than the mesotrophic grasslands, with slower colonization of bare ground and target species re-assembly. The mesotrophic grasslands typically took between 30 and 40 years to re-establish following disturbance, whereas calcareous grasslands took at least 50 years. 5. Even after such long time periods, there remained subtle but significant differences between the vegetation composition of the disturbed and undisturbed swards. Perennial forb species, particularly hemicryptophytes, persisted at higher frequencies in swards disturbed 50 years ago than in undisturbed swards. 6. Synthesis and applications. Prediction of habitat resilience following disturbance is dependent on which components of the system are investigated. However, data such as that presented here can help land managers understand how palimpsests of current habitat characteristics may have evolved, and how disturbance regimes may be managed in the future. It is likely that the resilience of grasslands such as those on SPTA may have been overestimated, and perceptions of habitat carrying capacity for disturbance events may require re-evaluation.

J	Herault, B; Honnay, O; Thoen, D				Herault, B; Honnay, O; Thoen, D			Evaluation of the ecological restoration potential of plant communities in Norway spruce plantations using a life-trait based approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. In Europe, intensively managed coniferous plantations rarely achieve similar nature conservation functions as deciduous woodlands. The ability to identify coniferous plantations that might be successfully converted to deciduous woodland is a key goal in forest management. The herbaceous plant community composition of mature plantations may be an accurate selection criterion for stands that are most suitable for initiating the conversion process to deciduous forest. 2 The herbaceous plant communities in Norway spruce plantations were analysed using a functional group approach. The analysis was conducted in three steps: (i) identification of emergent groups (EG) by multivariate classification; (ii) comparison of EG abundance between coniferous and deciduous stands (i.e. the target communities); (iii) partitioning the variation in EG abundance in coniferous plantations between forest management, local environmental and regional variables. 3. Seven EG were identified: two core forest groups (short geophytes and zoochoreous perennials), two groups from open habitats (annuals and helophytes) and three mixed groups (anemochoreous perennials, graminoids and short perennials). 4. Among the core forest groups, short geophytes were severely under-represented in plantations (because of their low dispersal abilities and specific habitat requirements) while zoochoreous perennials were slightly more abundant (because of their good dispersal and competitive abilities). 5. Regional variables largely influenced the abundance of core-forest EG. Restoration of communities rich in zoochoreous perennials is far easier than restoring short geophyte-rich communities because of the different colonization abilities of these EG. 6. Forest management variables were of secondary importance for the restoration potential of plantations. Because generalist EG were favoured by low stand densities, forest practitioners should avoid large thinning operations. 7. Local environmental variables played a minor role in determining EG abundance. However, short geophytes preferred rather high soil pH values and were therefore negatively affected by acidification caused by coniferous litter. 8. Synthesis and applications. The performance of short geophytes is the key to conversion success of Norway spruce plantations to deciduous forest. Stands located on base-rich soils and in landscapes with high forest connectivity are the most appropriate candidates for initiating the conversion process. For other types of stands, future work should explore the possibility of restoring other land-use types, such as annually mown meadows.

J	Kluth, C; Bruelheide, H				Kluth, C; Bruelheide, H			Central and peripheral Hornungia petraea populations: patterns and dynamics	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 More or less continuous distributions tend to become fragmented towards species' distribution limits. Peripheral or isolated populations of a species are predicted to have lower population sizes and densities than central populations, as a result of environmental and/or genetic stress. Population densities at the periphery may be reduced by decreased reproduction or higher interannual variation in reproduction. In particular, fecundity and survival are likely to be reduced by less favourable growing conditions. 2 We compared populations of the annual species Hornungia petraea (Brassicaceae) in two contrasting regions of the species' range and at the population scale within regions. Ten populations in Italy (central to the species range) and 10 German populations (peripheral) were monitored for three growing periods from spring 1999 to spring 2001. 3 All life-cycle stages, adult plant density, seed production and pre- and post-dispersal seed bank density were studied in a nested sampling design and variation in various demographic factors was attributed to the effects of the two countries, of populations nested within country and to temporal effects. 4 Peripheral populations had higher densities than populations in the centre of the species distribution, both as adult plants and in the seed bank. 5 Fecundity was strongly influenced by temporal effects, but only affected to a minor degree by the study region. High interannual variation in fecundity was not reflected in high interannual variation of either adult plant density in spring or of the seed bank. Significant regional differences were, however, found in seasonal seed bank dynamics, which were more pronounced in peripheral German populations than in central Italian populations. 6 We conclude that seasonal seed bank dynamics are a key factor in explaining differences in H. petraea density patterns, particularly in central populations, where fewer seeds are incorporated into the seed bank.

J	Lortie, CJ; Ellis, E; Novoplansky, A; Turkington, R				Lortie, CJ; Ellis, E; Novoplansky, A; Turkington, R			Implications of spatial pattern and local density on community-level interactions	OIKOS												The importance of spatial aggregation and density dependence have been extensively explored in ecology. However, both factors might interact or modify one another to differentially influence net population or community-level dynamics. In a desert annual plant community, we experimentally tested for these effects at nested spatial scales by planting different number of patches within a plot but holding plot-level seed density constant, by manipulating the number of occupied patches adjacent to a target patch, and by varying local seed density within patches. In doing so, we addressed the following specific questions: (i) is there an effect of the number of patches of seeds planted on plot-level community measures, (ii) are there patch-patch interactions within plots, (iii) are there density-dependent responses to changing initial seed density within patches, and (iv) do patterns observed at finer spatial scales predict patterns at larger scales? Community parameters measured at the plot level-emergence, plant density, and mean plant size-were negatively affected by increasing seed aggregation into fewer patches within a plot. However, converse effects were detected at finer spatial scales. The presence of neighbouring patches increased emergence within a plot, while increased seed density within patches decreased emergence but strongly increased survival and mean plant size. Hence, the net negative effects detected at the arbitrary plot level do not necessarily correspond to the interactions occurring at finer spatial scales within the plot. These findings suggest that the use of single scales of inquiry can potentially misrepresent the importance of a particular interaction, such as competition, and that the experimental consideration of finer scales within a community reveal different patterns and do not predict final net effects within a community.				lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014	lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023												0030-1299	1600-0706				JUN	2005	109	3					495	502		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13779.x							WOS:000227722400008						
J	Daehler, CC; Goergen, EM				Daehler, CC; Goergen, EM			Experimental restoration of an indigenous Hawaiian grassland after invasion by Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Introduced grasses have displaced Hawaiian Pili grass (Heteropogon contortus) in most dry, leeward habitats of the Hawaiian Islands. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of restoring an indigenous Heteropogon grassland at the Puukohola Heiau National Historic Site, where introduced Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is now dominant. Heteropogon seeds (50 seedlings/m(2)) were added to replicate plots within a Cenchrus grassland. Some plots were subjected to one-time herbicide or hand-pulling treatments to remove established Cenchrus. Because Hawaiians historically used fire to promote Heteropogon grasslands, the plots were burned biennially. Plots were also subjected to two levels of water supplementation. Heteropogon establishment was monitored over 2 and 4 years in the higher- and lower-water plots, respectively. In treatments containing established Cenchrus, Heteropogon establishment was consistently poor (< 10% cover). But in the burned plots where established Cenchrus had been removed, as many as 31 Heteropogon seedlings per square meter were recorded, and Heteropogon became the dominant cover, averaging 34% absolute cover (81% relative cover) after 4 years in the lower-water plot and 34% absolute cover (60% relative cover) after 2 years in the higher-water plot. Few Cenchrus grass seedlings survived, possibly due to insufficient water. Water supplementation promoted growth of other alien grasses from the seed bank (Digitaria insularis and Eragrostis spp.); however, these grasses quickly declined after supplemental watering was terminated. Although initial suppression of Cenchrus was required, Heteropogon expanded quickly when seeds and fire were reintroduced, demonstrating that a Heteropogon-dominated grassland can be reestablished in 2-4 years.																	1061-2971					JUN	2005	13	2					380	389		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00047.x							WOS:000229180600018						
J	Matilla, A; Gallardo, M; Puga-Hermida, MI				Matilla, A; Gallardo, M; Puga-Hermida, MI			Structural, physiological and molecular aspects of heterogeneity in seeds: a review	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Higher plants have several strategies to perpetuate themselves under adequate ecophysiological conditions. The production of heterogeneous seeds is one such strategy. That is, to ensure the survival of the next generation, an individual plant might produce seeds that are heterogeneous with respect to the extent of dormancy, dispersion and persistence within the seed bank. Heterogeneity can affect not only certain physiological and molecular properties related to seed germination, but also such characteristics as colour, size and shape, parameters commonly used to differentiate morphs within a heterogeneous seed population. In heterogeneous seeds, the above features determine seed behaviour and alter their mechanism of germination. In this work, emphasis is placed on the existence of seed mutants having major alterations in characteristics of the testa and hormonal response. These mutants constitute a valuable tool for elucidating the mechanism of dormancy, germination and perpetuation of seeds. Finally, ontogeny and heterogeneity are reviewed, providing the first data related to the possible hormonal control of heterogeneity in seeds. These results raise the hypothesis that one of the factors triggering differences in germination among heterogeneous seeds may be an alteration in the signalling and action mechanism of ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA).

J	Leon-Lobos, P; Ellis, RH				Leon-Lobos, P; Ellis, RH			Seed survival in Chilean Nothofagus in response to desiccation and storage	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Nothofagus alpina, N. obliqua, N. glauca, N. leonii, N. dombeyi and N. pumilio seeds exhibited consistent, albeit slight, sensitivity to extreme desiccation, but nevertheless maintained viability at low moisture contents and cool temperatures (-10 degrees to -20 degrees C) over 2 years. Nothofagus alpina, N. obliqua, N. glauca, N. leonii and N. dombeyi conformed to the seed viability equation of Ellis and Roberts; sensitivity of longevity to temperature was quantitatively similar to that of crop seeds, sensitivity to moisture was somewhat less, and a low-moisture-content limit to the equation was detected at 4.8% moisture content in hermetic storage at 65 degrees C, and possibly similar moisture contents at 30-40 degrees C. These five species show orthodox seed storage behaviour. Therefore, ex-situ conservation of these Nothofagus species in seed banks is possible, but the quality of seed lots collected requires attention. Seed storage behaviour was not defined in N. pumilio: initial seed quality was poor and loss of viability was detected over 2 years at 0 degrees, -10 degrees and -20 degrees C at 2.7% moisture content, but not at 5.2%. The results confirm that the economy of nature in seed storage physiology extends to forest tree seeds, but the repeated observation of reduced sensitivity of longevity to moisture in forest tree seeds requires further investigation.

Six soil cores from each garden revealed 2759 seedlings of 119 taxa, although the real species richness is likely to be much higher than this. By far the most abundant species were weedy natives, while the most common alien was Buddleja davidii. Seeds of perennial herbs were more abundant than hundreds of all other life forms combined. More frequent species were also more abundant, but the relationship was weak. Numbers of species in the seed bank and in the garden flora were positively but very weakly related. Seeds were quite evenly distributed between 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm soil layers, and most seeds were of species known to have persistent seed banks. Seeds of some species were largely confined to gardens in which the plant was growing, but others were not.																	0960-2585					JUN	2005	15	2					133	141		10.1079/SSR2005201							WOS:000230082800007						
J	Brandel, M; Jensen, K				Brandel, M; Jensen, K			Effect of temperature on dormancy and germination of Eupatorium cannabinum L. achenes	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												This study investigated the effects of various temperature regimes on dormancy and germination in Eupatorium cannabinum, a common wetland species in Central Europe. Germination of dry-stored achenes was tested at increasing amplitudes of temperature fluctuations, and stratified achenes were germinated at constant temperatures. Dormancy release was examined in the laboratory at constant temperatures of 3, 8, 12, 15 and 18 degrees C. The effect of an increase in temperature during stratification from 5 degrees C to 15, 18 or 20/10 degrees C on dormancy was tested. Moreover, achenes were exposed to yearly seasonal temperature cycles in the soil in an experimental garden. Germination of dry-stored achenes was not promoted by fluctuating temperatures, while stratified achenes germinated (> 5%) over a range of constant temperatures between 9 and 36 degrees C. Dormancy was relieved at all stratification temperatures, but temperatures l12 degrees C were more effective than higher temperatures, since germination occurred over a wider range of test conditions after these pretreatments. An induction of secondary dormancy occurred only if the temperature was increased during stratification. Annual dormancy cycles were apparent when achenes were germinated at 15 degrees C, while at 25 and 15/5 degrees C germination was always > 60%. The germination behaviour of Eupatorium is that of a typical wetland species. Thus, non-dormant achenes germinated at relatively high temperatures, and germination was promoted by fluctuating temperatures. The annual course of dormancy revealed that achenes can germinate throughout the growing season under favourable conditions. Achenes sown in an experimental garden germinated in spring, when daily mean temperatures were around 14 degrees C. A decline in viability of achenes after 19 months' burial indicated that Eupatorium does not form a long-term persistent seed bank.

However, seed banks have high temporal and spatial variability, with dramatic changes in density and composition. The aim of this study was to test whether seasonal change affected seed bank community structure and spatial pattern. Moreover, we wanted to know if the effect driven by environmental factors on the seed bank was constant year round. We sampled the seed bank at 188 points along seven parallel transects through a gypsum system in central Spain. Soil samples were taken twice (September and April) in contiguous plots. In each plot we measured environmental parameters, including micro- and macroslope, vegetation band, shrub cover, lichen crust cover and landform. A nearly threefold decrease in seed bank density occurred between September (16,230 seeds m(-2)) and April (5960 seeds m(-2)). Seasonal changes in density varied widely among species; however, a seed bank was present for most species at both sampling dates. For several well-studied species (Lepidium subulatum and Helianthemum squamatum), seed losses were within the range of losses by emergence reported in the literature. In both seasons, seed bank composition was controlled mainly by community band and microslope. Sampling season had a significant, but minor effect on seed bank composition. Moreover, a high spatial correlation existed in terms of seed density and richness through the two studied seasons. These results show that the seed bank keeps a constant structure even under substantial variation in density.

The influence of proximity of a forest stand was qualitative rather than quantitative and limited to a 3 m zone from the field/forest margin. Density and species richness of the seed bank were significantly higher there, and declined sharply with distance into the field. A comparison of the composition of forest vegetation and the crop seed bank showed that most species in the latter presumably dispersed from the forest and forest edge vegetation. Seeds occurred however at very low densities in the field and the most abundant species in the seed bank, Juncus bufonius, did not originate from the nearby forest. Dispersal of individual species into the field was very limited, the ranking of decreasing dispersal distance into the cropland being Stellaria media > Urtica dioica > Rumex obtusifolius and Sonchus oleraceus > Juncus effusus > Hypericum humifusum, Poa nemoralis and Rubus spp. The forest edge cannot be regarded as an important source of weed infestation in the adjacent cropland, whereas there was evidence for the reverse dispersal of seeds from the field into the forest edge.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: What is the contribution of the seed bank to restoration of species-rich vegetation in oligotrophic wet dune slacks? Does the restoration management affect the seed bank? Location: Calcareous coastal dune slacks at the west coast of The Netherlands. Methods: Species composition of the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation was sampled in dune slacks that had a variable extent of groundwater level rise in combination with either topsoil removal or mowing. Results: The seed bank had a high potential for restoration of species-rich vegetation: 60 species were found in the seed bank of which 14 were characteristic of oligotrophic, wet dune vegetation. While topsoil removal almost completely removed the seed bank, groundwater level rise did not permanently submerge the seed bank of species of oligotrophic, wet conditions. Chanaes in abundance in the established vegetation were unrelated to species abundance in the seed bank. Of all new species establishments in the vegetation releves, 76% occurred where the species was not found in the seed bank. The chance that presence of a species in the seed bank led to establishment the following year was only 11%. Conclusion: The seed bank was not the dominant source for newly establishing species following the large disturbance that was induced by restoration management. Changes in species abundance after the restoration impact were not related to species abundance in the seed bank, but to ongoing succession and current year dispersal. To attain a high number of new establishments, restoration projects should preferably be planned in the proximity of refuge populations, rather than relying on the seed bank alone.				van Bodegom, Peter/N-8150-2015	van Bodegom, Peter/0000-0003-0771-4500												1402-2001	1654-109X				MAY	2005	8	1					39	48		10.1658/1402-2001(2005)008[0039:DTSBCT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000232547000006						
J	Korb, JE; Springer, JD; Powers, SR; Moore, MM				Korb, JE; Springer, JD; Powers, SR; Moore, MM			Soil seed banks in Pinus ponderosa forests in Arizona: Clues to site history and restoration potential	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How does the relationship between the viable soil seed bank species composition and the above-ground vegetation in northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests differ under varying historical land use disturbances (low, intermediate, high)? Is above-ground vegetation correlated to the viable soil seed bank immediately following soil disturbance from restoration thinning treatments? Location: Northern Arizona, USA. Methods: Soil seed bank samples were taken along replicated transects and collected with a 5-cm diameter bulk density hammer. Samples included a 5-cm diameter O-horizon sample (at varying depths) plus the underlying mineral soil to a depth of 5 c m. The seedling emergent method was used to quantify seed bank species composition and density. The herbaceous and shrub plant community was quantified along the same transects using the point intercept method. Results: Early-successional or ruderal species were common in the soil seed bank at all three disturbance sites. Non-native species, notably Verbascum thapsus, were more numerous (up to 940 seeds/m(2)) under high disturbance with overgrazing and logging, and less common or absent under low disturbance. Most viable seeds were found in the O-horizon and the upper 5 cm of mineral soil; there was little correlation between species in the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation. Conclusions: We recommend that restoration plans be geared toward minimizing activities, such as severe soil disturbance, that may promote the spread of non-native invasive species, and that manual seeding be explored as an option to restore plant species diversity and abundance.																	1402-2001					MAY	2005	8	1					103	112		10.1658/1402-2001(2005)008[0103:SSBIPP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000232547000013						
J	Greenwood, ME; DuBowy, PJ				Greenwood, ME; DuBowy, PJ			Germination characteristics of Zannichellia palustris from New South Wales, Australia	AQUATIC BOTANY												We describe the germination characteristics of a population of Zanichella palustris from the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Laboratory experiments indicate that germination of Z. palustris is affected by temperature, dormancy, stratification and salinity. Five trials, conducted at 30-day intervals, on stored seeds were undertaken. The pattern of germination differed between fresh seed and seed-bank seeds. Higher germination occured at 20 degrees C (18-67%) than 28 degrees C (7-60%) and seeds within the seed-bank outperformed fresh seeds (49 versus 36%), in terms of total percentage and rate of germination. Germination was lower in freshly collected seeds and increased after harvest, peaking in 1- and 2-month old seeds, before tapering off (40, 54, 58, 35, 22%, respectively). Stratification enabled a higher and more regularly paced germination to occur. However, no significant difference was discerned between seeds stratified at 5 degrees C for 30 days and non-stratified seeds. Although salinity did not appear to affect seed viability, concentrations of >= 6 ppt NaCl prevented germination. These germination patterns suggest that cool water, cold stratification and low salinity are optimal germination conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	van der Valk, AG				van der Valk, AG			Water-level fluctuations in North American prairie wetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th INTECOL International Wetland Conference	JUL 25-30, 2004	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS	Utrecht Univ, Landscape Ecol Grp, Int & Natl Sci Comm				Oscillatory water-level fluctuations are reversible changes in water levels around a long-term mean. Longterm water-level studies in wetlands in the prairie pothole region of North America and proxy data (e.g., tree rings) for water levels in this region indicate that oscillatory water-level fluctuations have occurred for thousands of years. Because there has been no standard set of terms to describe oscillatory water-level fluctuations, some terminology is proposed that is based on previous work on riverine wetlands. Changes in prairie wetland vegetation caused by oscillating water levels are called wet-dry cycles. Field studies indicate that two kinds of vegetation change are common during wet-dry cycles, fluctuations and successions. Fluctuations are changes in the relative abundance of species between the wet and dry phases of the cycles. They occur whenever the range of water levels during a cycle is small (ca. 50 cm), as in seasonal wetlands. Succesions are changes in species composition. They occur wherever the range of water levels is large (ca. 1.5-2.0 in), as in semi-permanent wetlands. During successions, high water levels during the wet phase can typically eliminate most emergent species and low or no water during the dry phase allows emergent species to become re-established from seed and terrestrial annuals to dominate the vegetation. Experimental studies at the ecosystem- and species-level have confirmed observations made during field studies of semi-permanent wetlands, e.g., that water depth tolerance is the primary determinant of distribution of emergent species. Both qualitative and quantitative assembly-rule models of wet-dry cycles have been developed. When adequate data are available, the latest quantitative models can accurately predict changes in composition and distribution of emergent vegetation in semi-permanent wetlands during all or parts of a wet-dry cycle.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 1	2005	539						171	188		10.1007/s10750-004-4866-3							WOS:000231029600019						
J	van den Berg, L; Kellner, K				van den Berg, L; Kellner, K			Restoring degraded patches in a semi-arid rangeland of South Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												dit is known that, depending on the degree of degradation, the vegetation recovery of severely degraded areas by means of natural succession processes is very slow, if not impossible, and that active intervention in the form of restoration technologies has to be applied. Combinations of different restoration technologies, including ripping, over-sowing, brushpacking and the addition of organic material, were evaluated in a study site (characterized by denuded saline patches) in the semi-arid areas of South Africa. Quantitative vegetation sampling procedures, which included the monitoring of vegetation cover, frequency and density measurements were carried out over a period of 2 years (2000-2002) to determine the establishment and dynamics of the over-sown species used in the restoration treatments. The germination capacity and viability of the over-sown species were also tested in the laboratory, using methods prescribed by the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA). The over-sown species were positively correlated in the over-sowing treatments, while only annual pioneer species which were still represented in the soil seed bank in the degraded patches, correlated with the control and cultivation-only treatments. Of the over-sown species Digitaria eriantha and Chloris gayana had the highest frequencies. The restoration treatment that included a combination of ripping, over-sowing, brushpacking and organic material showed the highest establishment rate of all over-sown species. The results of the seed purity analysis indicated that seed obtained from a registered seed merchant showed higher purity percentages than seed collected locally by the land user. Species with high frequency and density values under natural conditions in the field trials also had a high purity and germination percentage in the laboratory experiments. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ding, Y; Zang, RG				Ding, Y; Zang, RG			Community characteristics of early recovery vegetation on abandoned lands of shifting cultivation in Bawangling of Hainan Island, south China	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY												Shifting cultivation is a major form of agricultural practice in most parts of tropical regions worldwide. In places where the bush fallow period is excessively shortened or the period of cultivation is extended for too long, the rate of vegetation recovery and biodiversity on abandoned lands of shifting cultivation would decline. The recovery of the secondary plant communities could even be inhibited for a prolonged period because of grass occupancy. Because of the vital significance of the early recovery communities to secondary succession, we studied the community characteristics of early recovery vegetation on abandoned lands of shifting cultivation in Bawangling of Hainan Island. Measurements were made of the community composition and structure of early recovery vegetation. The sprouting abilities of different functional groups and different species in the same functional group, and the effect of the grass functional group on the composition and quantitative characteristics of tree and shrub functional groups were analyzed. Results indicated that only a few families, genera, or species apparently dominated in the early recovery vegetation on the abandoned lands of shifting cultivation and that deciduous species occurred with a rather high percentage in this early recovery community compared with the natural secondary or old growth forests. Smallsized individuals dominated the woody community. The abundance and basal area of sprouting stems for species in the tree functional group were greater than those of seeder stems, whereas the abundance and basal area of resprouters and seeders for species in the shrub functional group did not differ. The total abundance of stems for the community, stem abundances for species in tree or shrub functional groups, and for seeder or resprouter stems were all negatively correlated with coverage of the grass functional group. The mean sprouting ability in the tree functional group was greater than in the shrub functional group. The sprouting ability for different species in the same functional group was also significantly different.

J	Gugerli, F; Parducci, L; Petit, RJ				Gugerli, F; Parducci, L; Petit, RJ			Ancient plant DNA: review and prospects	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Ancient DNA has received much attention since the mid-1980s, when the first sequence of an extinct animal species was recovered from a museum specimen. Since then, the majority of ancient DNA studies have focused predominantly on animal species, while studies in plant palaeogenetics have been rather limited, with the notable exception of cultivated species found in archaeological sites. Here, we outline the recent developments in the analysis of plant ancient DNA. We emphasize the trend from species identification to population-level investigation and highlight the potential and the difficulties in this field, related to DNA preservation and to risks of contamination. Further efforts towards the analysis of ancient DNA from the abundant store of fossil plant remains should provide new research opportunities in palaeoecology and phylogeography. In particular, intraspecific variation should be considered not only in cultivated plants but also in wild taxa if palaeogenetics is to become a fully emancipated field of plant research.

J	Brose, U; Tielborger, K				Brose, U; Tielborger, K			Subtle differences in environmental stress along a flooding gradient affect the importance of inter-specific competition in an annual plant community	PLANT ECOLOGY												Empirical evidence suggests that the direction and intensity of plant-plant interactions may depend on the favourability of the environment. Previous studies have mainly focused on steep gradients of environmental stress or disturbance, while the interplay of competition and environment has not been tested for subtle environmental differences. Here, we present results from a study on plant communities of temporary wetlands in East-German farmland. Due to yearly ploughing in autumn, the vegetation is composed of annual species. Flooding does not affect adult plants and the elevation on the gradient expresses differences in the length of the growing season rather than in disturbance intensity or severe environmental stress. We tested whether such subtle differences in environmental stress may affect the importance of interspecific competition by the dominant species. Two treatments were applied at two elevations: removal of the dominant species (Matricaria maritima ssp. inodora) and reciprocal transplants of the seed-bank of the two elevations. At both elevations, removal of Matricaria inodora led to an increase in total species richness and number of wetland species, but the effects were substantially stronger at high elevations. Removal and the elevation on the flooding gradient significantly influenced the plant community composition. In particular, the weed communities became more similar to the wetland communities after the removal. Transplanted weed species did not emerge at low elevations. While two of four target species had significantly higher densities after the removal at high elevations, none of them was influenced by removal at low elevations. This indicates that, consistent with previous studies from other habitat types, competition by the dominant species was more intense under conditions of low environmental stress. The overall results suggest that both flooding as well as interspecific competition are important in structuring the plant communities along the freshwater gradient studied.

J	Richter, R; Stromberg, JC				Richter, R; Stromberg, JC			Soil seed banks of two montane riparian areas: implications for restoration	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Understanding the role of seed banks can be important for designing restoration projects. Using the seedling emergence method, we investigated the soil seed banks of two montane, deciduous riparian forest ecosystems of southeastern Arizona. We contrasted the seed banks and extant vegetation of Ramsey Canyon, which is the site of riparian restoration activities, with that of Garden Canyon, which has been less affected by human land uses. Fewer plant species were found at Ramsey Canyon than Garden Canyon, for both the seed bank and extant vegetation, and the vegetation at Ramsey Canyon (seed bank and extant) had consistently drier wetland indicator scores. As well, vegetation patterns within sampling zones (channel margins and adjacent riparian forests) differed between canyons. At Garden Canyon channel margins, the seed bank and extant vegetation had relatively high similarity, with herbaceous wetland perennial species dominating. Extant vegetation in the floodplain riparian forest zone at Garden Canyon had a drier wetland indicator score than the seed bank, suggesting that the floodplains are storing seeds dispersed from wetter fluvial surfaces. Vegetation patterns for Ramsey Canyon channel margins were similar to those for Garden Canyon floodplains. Vegetation patterns in the Ramsey Canyon riparian forest zone were indicative of non-flooded conditions with an abundance of upland species in the soil seed bank and extant vegetation. Channel geomorphology measurements indicated that much of the riparian forest zone at Ramsey Canyon is functionally a terrace, a condition that may be a legacy of channel erosion from historic land uses. Steep, erodible channel slopes may contribute to the low seed bank germinant density at Ramsey Canyon channel margins, and narrower flood-prone area may explain the greater terrestrialization of the vegetation in both sampling zones. We recommend testing the use of donor soils from more diverse stream reaches to restore biodiversity levels at Ramsey Canyon, following restoration activities such as channel-widening. Seed banks from Garden Canyon, for example, although predominantly consisting of herbaceous perennials, would supply species with a range of moisture tolerances, life spans, and growth forms. We also recommend that restorationists take care not to harm seed banks exposed during removal of introduced species; at Ramsey Canyon, soil seed banks were equally diverse in areas with high and low cover of the introduced Vinca major (a legacy of Ramsey Canyon land use).																	0960-3115	1572-9710				APR	2005	14	4					993	1016		10.1007/s10531-004-7844-1							WOS:000228503800013						
J	HilleRisLambers, J; Clark, JS				HilleRisLambers, J; Clark, JS			The benefits of seed banking for red maple (Acer rubrum): maximizing seedling recruitment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												Seed banking is assumed to be unimportant for temperate trees, because their seeds are short-lived in soils. However, even short-term seed banking could increase recruitment and affect population dynamics of seed-banking trees. To investigate this possibility, we examined early life-history stages of red maple (Acer rubrum L.), an abundant seed-banking tree in eastern forests. We found that seed banking benefits red maple by increasing germination when seedling survival is likely. Most red maple seeds germinate soon after spring dispersal, when seedling survival is high, or postpone germination to the following growing season, once seedling survival becomes less likely late in the summer. This occurs because seed dormancy increases during the growing season, matching a concurrent decrease in seedling survival. Our results and those of other studies suggest seed dormancy is increased by the same environmental factors (low light and low moisture) that also decrease seedling survival. We speculate that early life-history traits, including seed banking, may have contributed to this species' increased abundance in eastern deciduous forests in the last century.																	0045-5067					APR	2005	35	4					806	813		10.1139/X05-017							WOS:000229414600005

Here we describe the herbaceous layer response to fires over a 5-year period. In four study sites, treatments imposed were unburned, periodic (1996 and 1999), and annual (1996-1999) fires. Sample plots (n = 108) were stratified by an integrated moisture index. Species' frequencies were recorded annually, and a total of 452 species (97% native) were documented. Though species composition was significantly affected by fire, the effects were shown by ordination to be small in magnitude relative to overall compositional variation. Burned areas developed greater small-scale species richness as grasses, summer forbs, and seed-banking species increased in frequency; however, these changes were also not large in magnitude. Though a few species increased substantially via germination after fire, most common species exhibited frequency increases or decreases of < 10% on burned units. Fire effects on vegetation were largely similar between annual and periodic burns and also among integrated moisture index classes. Direct fire effects on vegetation were limited by the dormant-season timing of burns and the resprouting of woody plants. Indirect effects were limited, as fires caused relatively minor changes in forest structure and resource availability in these long-unburned forests.

The species has been revised taxonomically and the six subspecies that occur in Canada are presented. Three of the subspecies, P. aviculare subsp. aviculare, P. aviculare subsp. neglectum and P. aviculare subsp. depressum are weeds introduced to Canada from Europe. A fourth subspecies, P. aviculare subsp. buxiforme is apparently native to North America. The geographical distribution of the latter four subspecies is very wide. Plants exhibit a high phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability, and they easily adapt to a multitude of agrestal and ruderal habitats. The seeds have a variable dormancy and polymorphic germination as a result of heterocarpy, genetic and environmental factors. In other areas (Europe), the species has developed resistance to triazines. Plants are hosts to nematodes, viruses, and fungi that also affect cultivated plants.

It is a major weed problem in field crops in the mid-western United States, where it has become increasingly difficult to control during the past 10 yr. Morphological differences between Amaranthus tuberculatus var. rudis and var. tuberculatus are presented. A review of the biological information published is provided. Plants exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability. Emergence is prolonged, growth rapid, and female plants produce a large number of viable seeds that contribute to a persistent seed bank. Amaranthus tuberculatus var. rudis has developed multiple resistance to triazine and acetolactate synthase- and protoporphyrinogen-inhibiting herbicides. Airborne pollen can travel significant distances and A. tuberculatus var. rudis may hybridize with other noxious Amaranthus spp. transferring herbicide resistance or other traits.

J	Buschmann, H; Keller, M; Porret, N; Dietz, H; Edwards, PJ				Buschmann, H; Keller, M; Porret, N; Dietz, H; Edwards, PJ			The effect of slug grazing on vegetation development and plant species diversity in an experimental grassland	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Generalist herbivores such as slugs have the potential not only to reduce plant density and biomass, but also to alter species diversity within vegetation. Their impact on species diversity may be either negative, if they concentrate feeding on less abundant plant species, or positive, if they feed on the most abundant species. 2. This study investigated the influence of slugs on plant species diversity in experimental swards produced by sowing a Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens seed mixture in field plots with a large seed bank of mainly arable species. Half of the plots were grazed by Arion lusitanicus Mabille. Plant cover, above-ground biomass and number of plant species were measured over a 3-year period. 3. Vegetation cover increased in the control plots from 50% in the first year to 90% in the third year. Cover was significantly lower in the slug plots in the first year (> 22%), while there were only small differences between treatments in the third year. Slugs reduced total above-ground biomass by > 25% in both the first and third years. 4. Slugs had a negative impact on plant species diversity in the first year, particularly by reducing forb species. In contrast, plant species diversity after 3 years was higher in the slug plots than in the controls, because of the higher number of forb species. Under slug grazing, the biomass and cover of annual and palatable species were reduced, but not the numbers of these species. 5. Our results suggest that slugs can have a significant effect on plant species diversity in plant communities, but that the direction of the effect changes during the course of succession. In the earliest stages, when most species are present as seedlings or juveniles, slug grazing leads to reduced species diversity because favoured species are eliminated. In closed vegetation, in which competitive interactions are important, slugs may reduce the dominance of the more competitive species and thus provide gaps in which plants can establish from seed. As a consequence, slugs tend to cause an increase in plant species diversity, and may also reduce the rate of successional change by promoting the persistence of annual species.																	0269-8463	1365-2435				APR	2005	19	2					291	298		10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00960.x							WOS:000229370500012

It is gradually becoming scarce due to overcollecting and habitat perturbation. For this reason, and for preservation purposes, the aim of the present work was to obtain the conditions to successfully propagate this species, through the use of mature seeds stored at 4 degreesC, and basal buds following in vitro techniques. Seeds with different storage periods (lot I and lot 2) were analyzed for seed viability as determined by the TTC method, germination percentage and germination index were analyzed on a monthly basis for 11 months on two Knudson C (K-4003, K-4128; Sigma). Seedlings were initially grown on the same culture media variants, but 30 days later they needed to be supplemented with potato starch (20 g(.)L(-1)). Basal buds were cultured on Knudson C containing nine BAP and NAA combinations two of which were also supplemented with potato starch (20 g(.)L(-1)) and coconut water (10%). Seed viability ranged from 78% to 98% throughout the 11 months and germination percentage was 70% to 90% without significant differences between the two lots. K-4003, either alone or supplemented with potato starch, was the best culture medium used to achieve all the development stages as well as seedlings with rhizoids. Bud proliferation was also successful on K-4003 added with BAP, NAA, potato starch and coconut water. The BAP (7.4 mum) and NAA (5.3 mum) combination promoted shoots and protocorm-like bodies (PLB). The results obtained with basal buds, make its preservation through in vitro culture possible and give the possibility to obtain available plantlets for its cultivation in regional nurseries.

Estimates of seed bank depletion rates are essential for modelling and management of plant populations. The seed bag burial method is often used to measure seed mortality in the soil. However, the density of seeds within seed bags is higher than densities in natural seed banks, which may elevate levels of pathogens and influence seed mortality. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of fungi and seed density within buried mesh bags on the mortality of seeds. Striga hermonthica was chosen as the study species because it has been widely studied but different methods for measuring seed mortality in the soil have yielded contradictory estimates. 2. Seed bags were buried in soil and exhumed at regular time intervals to monitor mortality of the seeds in three field experiments during two rainy seasons. The effect of fungal activity on seed mortality was evaluated in a fungi exclusion experiment. Differences in seed-to-seed interaction were obtained by using two and four densities within the seed bags in consecutive years. Densities were created by mixing 1000 seeds with 0, 10, 100 or 1000 g of coarse sand. 3. The mortality rate was significantly lower when fungi were excluded, indicating the possible role of pathogenic fungi. 4. Decreasing the density of seeds in bags significantly reduced seed mortality, most probably because of decreased seed-to-seed contamination by pathogenic fungi. 5. Synthesis and applications. Models of plant populations in general and annual weeds in particular often use values from the literature for seed bank depletion rates. These depletion rates have often been estimated by the seed bag burial method, yet seed density within seed bags may be unrealistically high. Consequently, estimates of seed mortality rates may be too high because of an overestimation of the effects of soil or seed-borne pathogens. Species that have been classified from such studies as having short-lived seed banks may need to be re-assessed using realistic densities either within seed bags or otherwise. Similarly, models of seed bank dynamics based on such overestimated depletion rates may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the seed banks and, perhaps, the management of weeds and rare species.																	0021-8901					APR	2005	42	2					299	305		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01016.x							WOS:000228396600012						
J	Leck, MA; Leck, CF				Leck, MA; Leck, CF			Vascular plants of a Delaware River tidal freshwater wetland and adjacent terrestrial areas: Seed bank and vegetation comparisons of reference and constructed marshes and annotated species list	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Constructed wetland soil samples contained many more species with densities > 100 seeds/m(2) than reference marsh ones (102 vs. 28); constructed wetland densities for many species were considerably higher and richness (species/sample) were > 2X greater than the reference marsh. Of the total 218 seed bank species, 60 were common to both and 34 occurred only in reference marsh samples. Numbers of cover species were similar, but composition differed. Invasive species, notably Lythrum salicaria, Phalaris arundinacea, and Phragmites australis, were more important in constructed wetland soil samples and vegetation. Non-native species comprised 9 % and 13 % of the reference marsh and constructed wetland seed bank species and 8 % and 12 % of the cover species, respectively. Variable dispersal patterns and in situ seed production contributed to these differences. Over the entire study area (wetlands and adjacent terrestrial areas) we recorded 875 species, representing 141 families, more than doubling the number observed in a 1988 report. The families having the most species were Asteraceae (103 species), Poaceae (100), and Cyperaceae (83). The largest genera were Carex (46) and Polygonum (19); seven other genera also had ! 10 species. Nine species were pseudo-viviparous, producing plantlets on inflorescences. Non-native species comprised 27 % of the total flora. Overall there were 37 NJ rare/endangered species for the entire area; 11 occurred only in the constructed wetland with constructed wetland soil samples containing more than the reference marsh samples (8 vs. 1). Available lists from 1824, 1887, and 1964/65 and five species known only from herbarium specimens indicate that several species have been extirpated since the 19(th) C. Anthropogenic influences continue to have impact on diversity.																	0040-9618					APR-JUN	2005	132	2					323	354		10.3159/1095-5674(2005)132[323:VPOADR]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000231602400013						
J	Welling, P; Tolvanen, A; Laine, K				Welling, P; Tolvanen, A; Laine, K			Plant traits: Their role in the regeneration of alpine plant communities in sub-arctic Finland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How do the relative frequencies of plant traits (clonality, growth form, seed weight, diaspore mcrphology) vary during the life cycle and how does this affect regeneration? Location: Alpine meadow and heath communities at Kilpisjarvi, sub-Arctic Finland. Methods: Control plots and three treatments were used to measure relative species abundances for five life cycle stages: standing vegetation, seed rain, seed bank and seedlings emerging in gaps and in closed vegetation. Results: The relative frequencies of plant traits varied between the life cycle stages. The meadows were dominated by weakly clonal herbs, small or intermediate seeds and unappendaged diaspores, while the heaths were dominated by clonal dwarf shrubs, small seeds and fleshy fruits. In the meadows, species with small seeds dominated during the seed rain and in the seedling stage in gaps, while species with intermediate seeds dominated the seed bank and the seedling stage in closed vegetation. Species with unappendaged diaspores dominated throughout the life cycle. In the heaths, seed bank and seedling stage were practically absent. Conclusions: The observed differences in plant trait spectra between life cycle stages indicate that important environmental factors differ among the stages. Small seeds are advantageous for dispersal. whereas intermediate seeds have a greater probability of germinating and establishing in closed vegetation. Appendages facilitate dispersal, whereas unappendaged diaspores favour seed burial. Although the plant growth form spectrum largely reflects environmental constraints during the regeneration cycle. information on seed weight and diaspore morphology improves our knowledge of the relative importance of morphological adaptations of sexual structures in different stages during the life cycle.

Location: 510 in a.s.l.. central Spain. Methods: Seven transects and 136 quadrats were established in a semi-arid gypsum system. Seed bank samples were collected in each quadrat in September. The community was sampled the following April. For each quadrat we measured slope, microslope, landform, elevation, perennial cover and crust cover. Seed bank was estimated using the direct emergence method in glasshouse. Relationship among seed bank and annual community was assessed by Mantel correlations. Above-ground cover for the five most abundant species was modelled with GLMs. Results: Seed bank density was the best predictor for annual community cover; perennial cover and landform were also included in the model. Species composition between September seed bank and April annual Community cover was also highly related according to the Mantel test. This relationship was constant, even when the effect due to other abiotic (landform. microslope) or biotic (perennial cover, crust cover) parameters were partialled Out. Microslope, elevation and seed bank density were the best parameters to predict spring cover of the five most abundant species. Conclusions: Above-ground and below-ground community compartments are strongly related in terms of abundance and species composition. This relationship is filtered by several environmental factors (e.g. perennial cover, landform, microslope) that exert a strong control at community and individual levels. Our results support the hypothesis that annual community performance is affected by seed bank pattern.

J	Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Tyndall, RW				Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Tyndall, RW			Natural Areas Journal - Introduction	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Dormancy in seeds of Aeschynomene virginica is caused by a water-impermeable ("hard") seed coat. In the laboratory, dormancy was broken by mechanical scarification, dry heat, wet heat (boiling), dry storage, incubation on a moist substrate for several months, and (to a lesser extent) freezing. Wetting/drying cycles were ineffective in breaking dormancy. Nondormant seeds germinated over a wide range of temperatures in both white light and darkness, in far-red light, at salinities (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4) of 0-1%, and while flooded or buried in soil. Fewer seedlings emerged from nondormant seeds buried > 3 cm in soil than from those buried 1 or 2 cm; emergence was 93% at 1 cm and 19% at 5 cm. Germination of only a few of the dormant seeds sown on the soil surface in a nonheated greenhouse in autumn 1995 was delayed until spring 1997, while 44% of those buried 7 cm deep in soil were still dormant ("hard") in spring 1999. Thus, it seems likely that A. virginica has the potential to form a persistent seed bank in its natural habitat.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2005	25	2					147	155									WOS:000228816700007						
J	Flores, J; Arredondo, A; Jurado, E				Flores, J; Arredondo, A; Jurado, E			Comparative seed germination in species of Turbinicarpus: an endangered cacti genus	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												All species of the genus Turbinicarpus are considered to be at risk and are thus included in CITES Appendix I. Ex situ plant reproduction has been suggested to reduce illegal extraction of these species. However, literature regarding seed germination of these species is scarce and often contradictory. Propagation requirements among 17 taxa (including 12 species, six subspecies, and one hybrid) were analyzed. We used fresh seeds for all taxa plus aged seeds for five species. The response variable measured was Germinative Value (GV), which measures germination quality resulting from three variables: germinability, germination speed, and germination uniformity. For fresh seeds, significant differences were found between taxa. Germination varied broadly across taxa from 8% to 97% and GV ranged from 0.848 to 20.112. The two taxa with lower GV, T. lophophoroides and T. pseudopectinatus, showed higher GV in old seeds than in fresh seeds, which indicates this species might form seed-banks in the soil. T. knuthianus did not show significant differences between fresh and old seeds, which can be interpreted as a strategy to produce both seeds for immediate propagation and seeds for securing the medium and long-term survival of the species. In contrast, T. swobodae and T. valdezianus showed higher GV in fresh seeds than in old seeds, which would appear to represent an adaptation to germinate as soon as rainfall occurs. Our results contribute to understanding germination biology of a threatened genus and the potential role of soil seed banks. In addition, results presented here could contribute to in situ conservation of Turbinicarpus spp. populations, through promoting natural regeneration, and ex situ conservation, by promoting large numbers of cultivated individuals outside their habitats.

J	Kim, KD; Lee, EJ				Kim, KD; Lee, EJ			Soil seed bank of the waste landfills in South Korea	PLANT AND SOIL												The restoration of urban landfill is a topic of growing interest in reclamation ecology as the acreage of abandoned sites near cities increases. The goals of this study were to assess the ecological status of waste landfills and to elucidate the role of seed banks in the establishment of vegetation at these sites. The study sites were located at five landfills around Seoul and Kyongki Province. On average, soils were sampled on 20 plots per landfill in 2001 to record species composition and to estimate the number of seeds in the soil. Soil seed bank vegetation and the individual number of seedlings that germinated were recorded using the seedling emergence method. Relative density per species was calculated from the number of individual seedlings. We conducted canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) using the program CANOCO to survey the relationships between 23 environmental variables and plant importance values. Environmental variables included categorical and numerical variables (landfill age, landfill size, distance from landfill edge, human disturbance level, slope, periodic management level) and soil physico-chemical variables (bulk density, soil moisture content, organic matter content, total N, available P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn). The mean seedling density per m 2 differed significantly among sites (P < 0.05). As landfill age increased, the mean seedling density per m(2) decreased. The mean seedling density of the Sangpaedong landfill, which was less than I year old, was higher than that found in 6- and 7-year-old landfills. The Sangpaedong landfill mainly contained seeds of Chenopodium album L. and Digitaria. ciliaris (L.) SCOP. With regard to early vegetative colonization in landfills, our results highlighted the importance of seed banks occurring in cover soils. Cover soils, derived from various sources, will determine landfill landscapes because of different seed banks present in them. The first axis of the CCA was correlated with landfill age, Na, and human disturbance level, while the second axis was correlated with landfill size, slope, periodic management level, Zn, total N, and organic matter content. Understanding seed banks in landfill cover soils is important, therefore, for proper landfill management and restoration.																	0032-079X					APR	2005	271	1-2					109	121		10.1007/s11104-004-2159-2							WOS:000230397200010						
J	Arrieta, S; Suarez, F				Arrieta, S; Suarez, F			Spatial dynamics of Ilex aquifolium populations seed dispersal and seed bank: understanding the first steps of regeneration	PLANT ECOLOGY												The objective of this study was to analyse quantitatively the spatial distribution of holly (Ilex aquifolium L.) seed rain and seed bank, and to detect the relationships between these consecutive processes. We measured seed dispersal by birds and fallen fruits, and also density and viability of seed bank in two Ilex populations in central Spain. Analysis was made distinguishing the following microhabitats: holly woodland, edge of holly woodland, open grassland 10 m and 100 m from the woodland, fleshy fruit shrubs, dry fruit shrubs, and adjacent non-holly woodland. Spatial distribution of dispersed and in-soil seeds was measured by the clumping index. Seed rain and seed bank under holly woodlands were significantly higher than in the other microhabitats. Forest edges and fleshy fruit shrubs were the next microhabitats with the highest seed rain and seed bank density. Interannual and interlocality variations were not significant. The relative importance of the different dispersal methods varied between microhabitats, with a similar support of bird dispersed seeds and fallen fruits within the woodland and a greater influence of cattle dispersal in open areas. Seed spatial aggregation was significant in both dispersed seeds and soil seeds from holly woodlands and the edge of the forest. Aggregation under shrubs, grasslands and the adjacent forests evidenced a general random distribution of holly seeds (only in some cases clumping index was significant). Quantitative differences between seed rain and seed bank are important. Post-dispersal seed predation did not modify seed rain distribution, which was mirrored in the seed bank pattern. These two phases of holly regeneration had a heavy spatial influence, determined by the landscape structure and activity of the dispersal agents, that reflects a differential recruitment potential. Comparisons between both populations suggest that in the southern locality (Robregordo) holly has a weaker capacity to colonize open areas, and a stronger recruitment limitation due to propagule availability.																	1385-0237					APR	2005	177	2					237	248		10.1007/s11258-005-2186-y							WOS:000230175900008						
J	Gallandt, ER				Gallandt, ER			Experimental substrate affects rate of seed removal in assays of invertebrate seed predation	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Postdispersal seed predation by ground beetles may be an important form of biological weed control. Field experiments conducted in 2002 and 2003 determined invertebrate seed predators' ability to detect and remove seeds from different experimental substrates. Predation of wild mustard and common lambsquarters was greater when seeds were presented on sand compared with the two types of synthetic finishing pads; however, predation of velvetleaf, redroot pigweed, and hairy galinsoga was unaffected by substrate. Predation rates were not consistent across all experimental substrates. Estimates of invertebrate predation of common lambsquarters, yellow foxtail, and velvetleaf were greater for seeds offered on sand or synthetic pads than for seeds offered on soil or double-sided tape covered with soil. Although each substrate would be useful to estimate treatment effects on relative predation rates, the weed species by substrate interaction should be considered when comparing predation rates across experiments or when the absolute rate predation is of critical importance.

The principle has been demonstrated by the success of a diverse repertoire of proteins, with therapeutic molecules showing the most potential for added value. Over the past 10 years, several efficient plant-based expression systems have emerged. However, a number of issues remain to be addressed before plant bioreactors can be accepted and adopted widely in preference to the established microbial and mammalian platforms. Overcoming bottlenecks imposed by low yields, poor and inconsistent product quality and difficulties with downstream processing are the most important goals for researchers working in this field. The achievement of these goals is conditional on the development of extraction and processing steps that comply with GMP standards, including extensive quality assurance and control procedures. Such rigorous and validated standards should be combined with measures applied earlier in production to ensure product sustainability and quality, such as the use of master seed banking procedures. Moreover, there are several further challenges concerning topics of environmental impact, biosafety and risk assessment, which reflect the release of transgenic plants, as well the safety of the plant-derived products themselves. We are facing a growing demand for protein diagnostics and therapeutics, but lack the capacity to meet those demands using established facilities. A shift to plant bioreactors may, therefore, become necessary within the next few years, making it more imperative that the technical and regulatory limitations are addressed and solved. The production of pharmaceutical proteins in plants will only realize its huge potential if the products are provided at consistent high quality levels, allowing the delivery of clinical grade proteins that will gain regulatory approval and which can be used routinely in clinical trials.

J	Tarasjev, A				Tarasjev, A			Impact of genet size and flowering stage on fruit set in Iris pumila L. clones in wild	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The interplay between vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction in clonal plants affects the fitness of individuals as well as the structure of genetic diversity. The relevance of studies of that interaction depends on how well chosen genotypes and environmental conditions reflect the real situation in natural populations. In order to analyze the relationship between genet size (and consequently its vegetative success) and fruit set (its female reproductive success) under undisturbed natural conditions I utilized 2916 ramets that bear hermaphrodite flowers on 137 naturally growing Iris pumila clones in a protected area of Deliblato Sand, Serbia. The number of flowers (i.e. flowering ramets) served as a fair estimator of genet size and the larger clones produced more fruits than the smaller ones. However, the smaller clones had significantly higher fruit to flower ratio compared to the larger ones and that difference was detectable in later flowering stages of a clone but not in the earlier ones. In the large clones, flowers that opened later had significantly lower fruit to flower ratio. Since the deleterious effect of geitonogamy on fruit set in L pumila was documented by hand pollinations, the reduction of fruit to flower ratio in more abundant genets and in later flowering stages is most likely the result of increased geitonogamy. That reduction could lead to a different genetic structure in the seed bank compared to the structure in aboveground population, which can imply important ecological and micro-evolutionary consequences.

Replacing fallow with legume pasture enhanced wheat production in Australian ley farming. The legume species used in ley farming regenerated from seed produced during previous pasture periods. Our objective was to identify legumes that regenerated from the seed bank in western North Dakota. Ten legume species were established in one experiment, 30 species in a second experiment, and 29 species in a third experiment. Seedlings were counted in the spring following the year of establishment. Over 200 seedlings m(-2) germinated in balansa clover (Trifolium michelianum Savi), berseem clover (T. alexandrinum L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), black medic (Medicago lapulina L.), burr medic (M. polymorpha L.), crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.), Persian clover (T. resupinatum L.), and red clover (T. pratense L.) plots in at least one experiment. Forage dry matter yield ranged from 2 to 5 Mg ha(-1) for birdsfoot trefoil and red clover depending on the experiment and was similar to forage yield by alfalfa (M. sativa L.) that persisted in the second year following establishment (P > 0.05). Crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber concentrations suggested that forage quality was equal or superior for birdsfoot trefoil compared with alfalfa and red clover. Birdsfoot trefoil has potential as a self-seeding pasture species in the Great Plains.																	0002-1962					MAR-APR	2005	97	2					505	513		10.2134/agronj2005.0505							WOS:000228037700021						
J	Tobe, K; Zhang, LP; Omasa, K				Tobe, K; Zhang, LP; Omasa, K			Seed germination and seedling emergence of three annuals growing on desert sand dunes in China	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Information on the initial growth characteristics of annuals found in Chinese deserts is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate seed germination and interactive effects of irrigation and seed burial depth in sand on seedling emergence and seedling survival in three annuals (Agriophyllum squarrosum, Bassia dasyphylla and Aristida adscensionis) commonly growing on sand dunes in these regions. Methods Effects of temperature, light and polyethylene glycol-6000 on seed germination were examined by irrigating seeds sown on filter paper in Petri dishes. Seedling emergence was examined for seeds sown on the surface of, or at different depths (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mm) in, sand-filled pots, which were irrigated under different regimes. For seeds buried at a depth of 50 mm, seed viability was examined after irrigation of the pots. Key Results Seeds of three species germinated at most temperatures recorded between spring and autumn in their native habitats. No seed dormancy was found in any species. For all three species, seedling emergence was most favoured when seeds were buried at a depth of 10 mm. When seeds sown on the sand surface were irrigated, seed germination was considerably suppressed due to water deficiency, but many seeds remained viable. For A. squarrosum and B. dasyphylla, many seeds that were deeply buried and irrigated remained ungerminated but viable, while for A. adscensionis deeply buried seeds germinated, but the seedlings did not emerge due to unfavourable seedling growth in deep sand. Conclusions Precipitation is the most crucial factor in determining the seasonal emergence of seedlings of the three tested species in the field. The vertical distribution of seeds in sand determines the proportion of seeds that germinate after precipitation and acts to maintain seed banks over multiple years.

These mats also prevent gaseous exchange between water and atmosphere resulting in anoxic conditions of the water layer. In shallow waters, nutrient fluxes from the sediment to the water layer are expected to play a key role in the shift to floating plant dominance. This study investigated the potential recruitment and development of duckweed mats from propagule banks in field enclosures containing either muddy or sandy sediment. It was observed that free-floating fronds of Lemna minor were derived from both sediment types, but that dense duckweed mats developed exclusively in enclosures with muddy sediment. The results can be explained by differences in nutrient release from the sediments to the overlying water during summer, when high fluxes, especially of phosphorus and nitrogen, were observed almost exclusively in enclosures with muddy sediment involving anoxia of the water layer. This study discusses the results in relation to free-floating plant dominance and the management of shallow waters.

J	Piessens, K; Honnay, O; Hermy, M				Piessens, K; Honnay, O; Hermy, M			The role of fragment area and isolation in the conservation of heathland species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Heathland area in the northwestern part of Belgium has been strongly reduced during the past 200 years, and the remaining heathland is forced back into several small and isolated relics. In this study, we investigated how the fragmentation of these heathlands affects the distribution patterns of heathland plant species. Furthermore, we tested whether differences in patch occupancy patterns could be explained in terms of life history traits related to dispersal capacity and persistence. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that the incidence of almost three quarters of the species was influenced by fragmentation. For the majority of these species, isolation was the most important factor determining their presence or absence in a heathland patch. Differences between the species in isolation-sensitivity could be attributed mainly to differences in seed bank characteristics, with species having a long living seed bank being less affected by isolation. In contrast, species having mechanisms facilitating long distance dispersal were as much affected by isolation as species lacking these mechanisms. Our results suggest that for the majority of the species extinction in a patch can be prevented by dispersal from neighbouring patches. Further isolation of the patches should therefore be prevented and connectivity between the patches needs to be assured. As almost none of the species is affected by a declining patch area, for most even small patches are important for their survival.

J	Lopez-Garcia, MC; Maillet, J				Lopez-Garcia, MC; Maillet, J			Biological characteristics of an invasive south African species	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Senecio inaequidens, a south African species that has recently invaded parts of Europe, especially human disturbed habitats, was examined under laboratory and glasshouse conditions to assess the germination of achenes, soil seed banks, growth of seedlings and its breeding system. These observations allowed identification of ecological characteristics that may contribute to the invasiveness of the species. Achenes derived from three populations of S. inaequidens were germinated over a wide temperature range ( from 14/6 degrees C day/night temperatures to a constant temperature of 30 degrees C). They exhibited a rapid achene germination especially when temperatures reached 20 degrees C. Germination of seeds from soil samples also exhibited a prolonged germination over time suggesting therefore different types of dormancy. Growth response was studied along a nitrogen gradient from 0.33 to 16.0 mmol l(-1) and data were interpreted using growth analysis. Seedlings of S. inaequidens exhibited a slow growth in low nutrient availability and a rapid growth rate when exposed to high nutrient availability, which contributed to producing a large leaf area and biomass. Four types of pollination were studied in S. inaequidens. Hand-pollinations showed that S. inaequidens was mostly self-incompatible. Self-pollinated capitula only showed 7.6% viable achenes, significantly lower than insect-pollinated and cross-pollinated capitula. Some individuals were more self-fertile than others ensuring the production of some offspring in a situation of colonisation. Natural pollination occurred with generalist insects. Most of these results confirm the invasive ability of S. inaequidens.																	1387-3547					MAR	2005	7	2					181	194		10.1007/s10530-004-8978-5							WOS:000227957800004

The ability to make decisions as to when and where a response should occur is limited by knowledge of the efficacy and costs. We undertook an evaluation of manual removal of Undaria pinnatifida sporophytes in a new incursion in the Tinderbox Marine Reserve in Tasmania over a 2.5 year study period. Plants were removed, from a 800 m 2 area, on a monthly basis to minimise the likelihood of maturation of sporophytes and subsequent release of zoospores. While manual removal appears to have significantly reduced the number of developing sporophytes, the persistence of 'hot spots' through time suggests that either microscopic stages ( zoospores, gametophytes or sporelings) create a 'seed bank' that persists for longer than 2.5 years or selective gametophyte survival in microhabitats occurs. In order for manual removal of Undaria to be effective a long-term commitment to a removal activity needs to be coupled with vector management and education initiatives to reduce the chances of re-inoculation and spread, with monitoring ( and response) on a larger spatial scale for the early detection of other incursion sites, and with a treatment to remove persistent microscopic stages.

Knowledge of the degree and rate of seed dormancy loss would improve decisions concerning eastern garnagrass plantings and provide a better understanding of the seed bank longevity for this species. In this study, cold, moist stratified seed or unstratified seed was planted at 2.5- and 5.0-cm depths on 16 Aug. 1999, 1 Nov. 1999, 14 April 2000, 15 May 2000, and 16 June 2000 for the first year of the study and 15 Aug. 2000, 31 Oct. 2000, 17 April 2001, 15 May 2001, and 15 June 2001 in the second year. Plants and seeds were retrieved at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after planting of 50 seeds for each seed treatment and planting depth combination. Intact seeds were germinated for 28 d and the viability of ungerminated seeds was determined with a tetrazolium test. Seed dormancy of both stratified and unstratified eastern gamagrass seed was lost mostly between mid-September and mid-November. No more than 12% dormant seed remained after mid-December and dormancy was completely lost by April and May. Seed dormancy in eastern gamagrass was substantially reduced with several weeks of soil temperatures below 15 degrees C and adequate soil moisture.																	0011-183X					MAR-APR	2005	45	2					494	502		10.2135/cropsci2005.0494							WOS:000227602700010

Patterns of genetic variation within and among wheat LCs are usually unknown. Two sets of wheat LCs stored in CIMMYT's plant genetic resources center were assessed for genetic diversity by means of 76 (Set 1) and 44 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (Set 2). Set 1 included 36 LC accessions originating from different countries, either collected as bulks, composed of a single LC subline, or an unknown collection method. Set 2 consisted of three to 25 sublines of five Mexican and four Turkish LCs already included in Set 1. In a principal coordinate analysis based on modified Rogers' distance (MRD), only three Turkish LC accessions formed a distinct cluster in Set 1. The Mexican accessions clustered together with a Spanish accession and a close relationship between a Chilean and Nigerian accession was observed. In Set 2, gene diversity (H-e) among the Turkish LCs (0.43) was higher than among the Mexican LCs (0.35). Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed considerable genetic diversity within Mexican (52.7%) and within Turkish (67.6%) LCs. Pairwise fixation indices (F-ST) were significant, except between two Turkish LCs. Results were discussed in relation to the most suitable collection method of wheat LCs (bulk or individual sublines) as well as to the use of SSRs as a tool for seed bank management.

J	Shimono, Y; Kudo, G				Shimono, Y; Kudo, G			Comparisons of germination traits of alpine plants between fellfield and snowbed habitats	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												We examined the seed-germination responses of 27 alpine species with reference to habitat type (fellfield and snowbed), temperature (five regimes), and light requirement. About 70% of species showed > 40% germination at warm temperatures without cold stratification. However, a moist-chilling treatment markedly improved the germination percentages in most species, especially under cool conditions. Thus, cold stratification effectively reduced the temperature requirement for germination. Patterns of germination response within species were not consistent between the fellfield and snowbed habitats for species inhabiting both habitats. For interspecific comparisons, there were no significant differences in germination responses to the temperature regimes and the cold stratification between the fellfield and snowbed species. Also, germination speed and the length of germinating period did not differ between fellfield and snowbed species. Most species (86%) showed a requirement for light for germination without cold stratification. Although the extent of the light requirement was reduced after cold stratification in some species, the light requirement of most small-seeded species remained. The combination of cold stratification and the light requirement is a major factor determining the seedling emergence and formation of seed banks in alpine plants. However, habitat-specific patterns of germination traits were less clear, suggesting similar germination traits in fellfield and snowbed plants, at least under controlled conditions in the laboratory.

J	Florentine, SK; Westbrooke, ME				Florentine, SK; Westbrooke, ME			Invasion of the noxious weed Nicotiana glauca R. Graham after an episodic flooding event in the arid zone of Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												During November 1997, an extreme rainfall event caused flooding in the Olary Creek and created a terminal lake within mallee vegetation on Nagaela Station, far western New South Wales. To assess the effect of this rare event on native flora, six 25 x 25 m 2 grazing exclusion plots were established on flooded (4), and un-flooded control (2) areas. We investigated (i) the distribution of Nicotiana glauca in relation to the 1997 flooding event (ii) the variation in density of N. glauca soil-stored seed between soil in control and exclosure plots (iii) the allelopathic effects of N. glauca on germination of Lactuca sativa seeds. Analysis of N. glauca stem sections revealed a maximum of five growth rings, confirming an origin following the 1997 flood event. At a September 1998 assessment, no N. glauca were found across flooded and control plots. In October 2000 N. glauca occurred at densities of 24 and 12 N. glauca seedlings ha(-1) in the flooded unfenced and fenced plots respectively. No N. glauca individuals were recorded either from control fenced, or unfenced plots. The soil-stored seed study revealed that larger numbers of N. glauca seeds were recovered from the flooded open plot (1936+/-968) than in flooded fenced plots (856+/-428.12) but none was found in the control plots. Leachates obtained from dry leaves and twigs had a significantly greater negative impact (p>0.001) on germination of L. sativa seeds than leachates obtained from fresh leaves and bark. This study showed that the density of N. glauca is high in areas where grazing had eliminated competition from native shrubs and grasses. N. glauca is potentially a serious weed along the Olary Creek and ephemeral lake boundaries. Management strategies such as reducing grazing pressure from native and introduced animals and/or effective eradication programs should be adopted, to minimize further infestation.

We test whether the predictability of local species composition from environmental conditions is influenced by dispersal traits. We analyzed a large database with co-occurrence data, using ordination techniques (DCA and CCA) to identify the major environmental determinants of species composition. The percentage of explained variance in occurrence was quantified for individual species with CCA. Effects of life-history traits on the predictability of occurrence patterns were tested by means of regression analysis, using a generalized linear models approach. The results reveal close correlations between species composition and environmental conditions, implying that the predictability of the set of species that might occur in a given environmental setting ("habitat species pool") is high. The habitat species pool, however, reflects the potential species composition, and not the actual local situation. At the level of individual species, a large proportion (>90%) of the variation in occurrence remained unexplained. Predictability of species occurrence patterns was increased by a greater capacity for long-distance dispersal, greater adult longevity and the capacity to build a persistent seed bank. The results indicate that the predictability of species composition from environmental conditions is reduced by a few orders of magnitude by dispersal limitation and that poor dispersers are underrepresented.

J	Legere, A				Legere, A			Risks and consequences of gene flow from herbicide-resistant crops: canola (Brassica napus L) as a case study	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE					Symposium on Herbicide-Resistant Crops from Biotechnology held at the ACS 227th National Meeting	MAR 29-30, 2004	Anaheim, CA	Amer Chem Soc, Agrochem Div				Data from the literature and recent experiments with herbicide-resistant (HR) canola (Brassica napus L) repeatedly confirm that genes and transgenes will flow and hybrids will form if certain conditions are met. These include sympatry with a compatible relative (weedy, wild or crop), synchrony of flowering, successful fertilization and viable offspring. The chance of these events occurring is real; however, it is generally low and varies with species and circumstances. Plants of the same species (non-transgenic or with a different HR transgene) in neighbouring fields may inherit the new HR gene, potentially generating plants with single and multiple HR. For canola, seed losses at harvest and secondary dormancy ensures the persistence over time of the HR trait(s) in the seed bank, and the potential presence of crop volunteers in subsequent crops. Although canola has many wild/weedy relatives, the risk of gene flow is quite low for most of these species, except with Brassica rapa L. Introgression of genes and transgenes in B rapa populations occurs with apparently little or no fitness costs. Consequences of HR canola gene flow for the agro-ecosystem. include contamination of seed lots, potentially more complex and costly control strategy, and limitations in cropping system design. Consequences for non-agricultural habitats may be minor but appear largely undocumented.

J	Gamboa-Lapitan, P; Hyun, JO				Gamboa-Lapitan, P; Hyun, JO			Mating system of Parashorea malaanonan (M. Blanco) Merr. (Bagtikan) in Mt. Makiling, Laguna, Philippines	PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST												Isozyme analysis of thirteen (13) families of Parashorea malaanonan (M. Blaco) Merr. from two stands in Mt. Makiling (5 in the Mudspring and 8 in the Maralas area) was undertaken to determine the mating system of the species. P. malaanonan is an ecologically and economically important species of the world-renown timber-producing family Dipterocarpaceae, which has been under heavy exploitation for the past decades. The effective conservation of the species requires, among others, information on mating system. The mating system of P. malaanonan was estimated from single-locus, t(S), and multilocus, t(m), outcrossing rate based on Ritland's mixed mating model and using Ritland's MLTR computer program version 2.4. The stand at Mudspring was more highly outcrossing (t(m) = 0.991) than the stand at Maralas (t(m) = 0.939). Biparental inbreeding was estimated to occur in 10 of the 13 families investigated. The average estimates were 0.084 for the stand at Mudspring and 0.170 for Maralas. These results indicate that P. malaanonan is a highly outcrossing species. The rate of outcrossing varied among and within the stand. Outcrossing rate was higher when flowering was in synchrony and the density of flowering trees was higher. The violation of the assumptions that a homogeneous pollen pool surrounds the mother tree and that alleles are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium may have caused this variation too. Information gathered from this study suggests that the most appropriate and cost-effective conservation strategy for the species is in situ conservation of P. malaanonan in the Makiling Forest Reserve. Ex situ conservation through plantation instead of seed bank establishment should also be carried out, however, to complement the in situ approach. Seeds for plantation establishment, which are recalcitrants, should be collected from as many areas and individual trees as possible.																	0031-7454					MAR	2005	88	1					109	121									WOS:000228109000011						
J	Vega, JMA; Vasquez, JA; Buschmann, AH				Vega, JMA; Vasquez, JA; Buschmann, AH			Population biology of the subtidal kelps Macrocystis integrifolia and Lessonia trabeculata (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) in an upwelling ecosystem of Northern Chile: Interannual variability and El Nino 1997-1998	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												This paper describes the population biology of Lessonia trabeculata and Macrocystis, integrifolia during and after the 1997-1998 El Nino in an area of permanent coastal upwelling in northern Chile. Spatial and temporal pattern- of distribution were evaluated seasonally for adult and juvenile sporophytes of both species between 1996 and 2003. These two kelp form an assemblage distributed between 2 and 15 m depth, with disjunct patterns along a bathymetric gradient, including two morphs of L. trabeculata, the occurrence of which depends on t he presence or absence of M. integrifolia. During the 1997-1998 El Nino the spatial -temporal patterns of abundance of the kelp assemblage were maintained by the continuity of coastal upwelling, which buffered and moderated superficial warming of the sea and depiction of nutrients. In this context, localities associated with coastal upwelling areas Could function as "sources" of reproductive propagules after passage of El Nino. thus increasing kelp recolonization rates in "sink" localities, which suffered local kelp extinctions. Intensification of upwelling processes after the 1998-2000 La Nina increased nutrient inputs into subtidal habitats. favoring the productivity of the kelp assemblage. However, an abrupt change in the spatial-temporal patterns of abundance of the black sea urchin Tetrapygus niger, the most conspicuous benthic grazer in northern Chile. produced local extinctions of M. integrifolia and compression of the range of bathymetric distribution of L. trabeculata. Top-down (mortality of benthic carnivores during the 1997-1998 El Nino) and bottom-up effects (intensity and frequency of upwelling) in this subtidal coastal ecosystem appear to regulate the kelp-herbivore interactions in the study area. The main sources of reproductive propagules for the establishment of the assemblage kelp were fertile sporophytes which included isolated, low density patches of M.integrifolia located within the bed of L. trabeculata, although drifting kelp rafts and "seed banks" of microscopic dormant stages may provide supplementary recruitment. In the temperate SE Pacific, oceanographic events that act on different spatial -temporal Scales plus low Frequency biological processes (changes in grazer abundance), which act on local scales, produce inter-annual variability in the long-term dymanics of kelp populations. Furthermore, the interactive effects between centers of permanent upwelling and the oscillating temporal periodicity of oceanographic events that produce positive (El Nino) and negative (La Nino) thermal anomalies modify the spatial arrangement of subtidal kelp populations oil a latitudinal gradient.

J	Snyman, HA				Snyman, HA			The effect of fire on the soil seed bank of a semi-arid grassland in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												During the dormant winter period the semi-arid grassland areas of South Africa are characterised by planned and unplanned fires, either by lightning or negligence by man. The influence of burning (head and back fire) on the germinability of grass species in the soil seed bank was quantified in the greenhouse over the 2000/01 to 2001/02 growing seasons for a semi-arid grassland. The behaviour of the head and back fires was also monitored. Soil seed bank samples were collected immediately after burning and then every third month over a two-year period from 0.25m(2) blocks 50mm deep. The same was done on unburnt grassland. At ground level, the back fire exceeded 100 degrees C, while the head fire had temperatures of less than 100 degrees C. The fire caused a flush of seedlings from the seed bank over the first season after the fire. The head fire stimulated seedling density significantly (P <= 0.01) more than the back fire. The mean (head and back fire) seed bank density the first season following the fire, for burnt and unburnt grassland, was respectively 84.6 and 52.1 grass seedlings m(-2) for September, 50.5 and 21.9 grass seedlings m(-2) for December and 347 and 58 grass seedlings m(-2) for March. The pioneer species Aristida congesta and Tragus koelerioides only occurred in the soil seed bank of the burnt grassland, while the climax species Cymbopogon plurinodes, Digitaria eriantha and Panicum stapfianum only germinated in the unburnt grassland seed bank. The Eragrostis species showed the highest germination due to fire. The burning of semi-arid grassland did have a quantified impact on the soil seed bank over the short-term.																	0254-6299					MAR	2005	71	1					53	60		10.1016/S0254-6299(15)30149-6							WOS:000228473100006

The procedure utilises data on the spatial location of 99 individual C. rubicundum plants and the number of seeds of this species in the soil at 169 grid-nodes. We developed a regression equation that quantified the effects of shrub size, shrub height and prevailing wind direction on seed dispersal. The deterministic models revealed a good fit between the measured and simulated data using parameters estimated from the data set of soil seed bank values. The results presented in this paper provide a way to examine, quantify and model the spatial effects of shrubs on soil seed banks at the stand level. The method presented here can be applied to examine and estimate the influence of dominant plants on other biotic or abiotic properties of an ecosystem.																	0254-6299					MAR	2005	71	1					61	66		10.1016/S0254-6299(15)30150-2							WOS:000228473100007						
J	Wrubleski, DA				Wrubleski, DA			Chironomidae (Diptera) responses to the experimental flooding of prairie marshes	WETLANDS												This study examined chironomid responses to the flooding of ten drained experimental marshes in Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. Emergence traps were used to monitor chironomid emergence from three vegetation types (Symphyotrichum ciliatum, Scolochloa festucacea, and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) flooded at two water depths (shallow: 20-40 cm, deep: 50-70 cm) over a four-year period. The greatest number (7,651 m(-2) yr(-1)) and biomass (20.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) of chironomids emerged from Schoenoplectus-deep sites in the fourth year of flooding. Numbers, biomass, and size classes of emerging chironomids were similar over the four years from the Symphyotrichum habitat. However, chironomid emergence from Scolochloa and Schoenoplectus habitats was dominated initially by the smallest size class but shifted steadily toward production of much larger species over the four-year experiment. The production of chironomids as a potential food resource for waterfowl was high from the Symphyotrichum habitat during all four years of flooding, but emergence from the Scolochloa and Schoenoplectus habitats did not reach comparable levels until the third or fourth year.																	0277-5212					MAR	2005	25	1					200	209		10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0200:CDRTTE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000228542000018						
J	Smith, FP; Holzworth, DP; Robertson, MJ				Smith, FP; Holzworth, DP; Robertson, MJ			Linking icon-based models to code-based models: a case study with the agricultural production systems simulator	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												The traditional code-based modelling approach in agriculture and ecology has many strengths, particularly in terms of model flexibility, efficiency and power. Nonetheless code-based programming is a specialist skill and a barrier to simulation modelling to most scientists and students. Icon-based modelling systems on the other hand are easy to use and learn and have opened up simulation modelling to a much broader group of researchers. However there are limitations to the flexibility of these modelling systems and sometimes the size and complexity of models that can be constructed in them. One approach by which researchers can gain the best of both types of models is by linking icon-based models to code-based models within a modular modelling framework. By developing largely self-contained modules that communicate with other modules solely by means of defined input/output variables, modules can be developed in an easy to use icon-based modelling system and subsequently 'plugged in' to a larger code-based model. In this paper, we demonstrate this approach using Vensim(TM) to develop a new seed bank module for the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). In an example application we compare the persistence of two hypothetical annual pasture plants with differing life histories under two contrasting fanning systems. This approach has the benefits of: (i) rapid and efficient model development that allows specialist scientists and programmers to focus on their respective areas of expertise; (ii) ongoing maintenance and development of modules by science specialists without need for constant recourse to programmers; (iii) ease of sharing, exchange and comparison of icon-based modules between researchers; and, (iv) ease of communication of model structure.

Late dry season fires and the fire-related cues, heat shock and smoke, broke the seed dormancy of a range of tropical savanna species. Heat shock promoted the germination of the species groups natives, exotics, subshrubs, ephemeral and twining perennial forbs, and the common species Indigofera hirsuta, Pycnospora lutescens and Triumfetta rhomboidea. Exposure to smoke at ambient temperature promoted germination from the soil seed bank of the species groups combined natives, upright perennial forbs and grasses, as well as the common grasses Digitaria breviglumis and Heteropogon triticeus. The germinable soil seed bank varied seasonally, increasing from the mid wet season (February) and early dry season (May) to a maximum in the late dry season (October). The effect of recent fire history on soil seed bank dynamics was limited to the immediate release of some seed from dormancy; a reduction in seed densities of subshrubs and monocots, other than grasses, in recently burnt savanna; and enhanced seed density of the ephemeral I. hirsuta in the year following fire. The seed banks of most savanna species were replenished in the year following burning.

To evaluate these theories, we tested some biological traits of an invasive bramble (Rubus alceifolius Poiret), known for the importance of its sexual reproduction on lowlands, at La Reunion (Indian Ocean). We studied R. alceifolius seed distribution in one of the last tropical lowland rainforests of the island. Seed count was greater under R. alceifolius patches (> 10 000 seed/m(2)) than in understoreys not colonized by the bramble (approximately 3000 seed/m(2)). In R. alceifolius patches, localized within gaps, our results showed that seed-rain and seed-bank before and after the fruit period decreased significantly from the center to the edge of the gap. This pattern was certainly due to the variation in luminosity, which decreased from the center of the gap to the edge. We conclude that seed dispersal of this species within the forest is mainly via running water. A number of seeds (10%-20%) were able to wait for a new opening in which to germinate. A small proportion of these seeds remained viable in the soil for many years. Monospecific R. alceifolius patches can be considered nurseries and are the main source for colonization of new areas within the forest. Our quantitative results confirm that copious sexual reproduction, a large soil seedbank, and a high germination rate are biological traits that greatly contribute to the invasiveness of this plant. They also provide important information for forestry services establishing adapted control plans.

J	Wang, GG; Kemball, KJ				Wang, GG; Kemball, KJ			Effects of fire severity on early development of understory vegetation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												Four boreal mixedwood stands burned by the 1999 Black River wildfire in southeastern Manitoba were sampled to examine the effects of fire severity on early regeneration dynamics of understory vegetation. In each stand, three fire severity classes (scorched, lightly burned, and severely burned) were identified based on the degree of forest floor consumption, and six plots per severity class were randomly selected. Variation in fire severity significantly affected the initial regeneration of the understory plant community. Regeneration response after fire was largely controlled by interactions between fire severity and species ' regeneration strategy. Establishment of invaders, seed bankers, and sprouters was best on severely burned, lightly burned, and scorched plots, respectively. Species richness and Shannon's diversity index was reduced by severe fire only in the first postfire year. However, the effects of fire severity on species abundance and composition persisted through the entire study period (1999-2002). Rapid changes in the understory plant community were only observed during the initial 3 postfire years, regardless of fire severity. At the end of the study, herbaceous plants were the most dominant component, with woody plants being a codominant component on scorched plots, and nonvascular plants being a codominant component on severely burned plots.																	0045-5067					FEB	2005	35	2					254	262		10.1139/X04-177							WOS:000227613700004						
J	Liu, H; Menges, ES; Quintana-Ascencio, PF				Liu, H; Menges, ES; Quintana-Ascencio, PF			Population viability analyses of Chamaecrista keyensis: Effects of fire season and frequency	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Conservation of species of concern in fire-dependent ecosystems requires restoring the historical fire regime that has shaped the species' life history. The historical fire regime of the endangered pine rockland ecosystem is controversial. In this study, we attempted to infer the historical fire regime of this ecosystem by studying the effects of contrasting experimental fire regimes on Chamaecrista keyensis, a narrowly endemic species of the pine rocklands of the Lower Florida Keys, USA. We constructed multiple matrix population models for C. keyensis using demographic data from replicated wet- and dry-season burns, 1-30 years since fire, and seed bank dynamics derived from extensive field seed bank experiments. We then carried out deterministic analyses and stochastic simulations. Recently burned sites (1-2 years postfire) had the highest finite population growth rates of all sites. Differences in finite population growth rate between winter and summer fires were more pronounced during the year of burn than in subsequent years. Stochastic simulations show that dry-season (winter) burns generated lower extinction risks and population decline probabilities than a wet-season (summer) fire regime. Fire return intervals of 5-7 years generated the lowest, extinction and population decline probabilities for both seasons. C. keyensis may have evolved under a fire regime that consisted of both anthropogenic dry-season fires along with lightning caused wet-season fires. If phenology is also a key to fire responses in other pine rockland species, a diverse fire regime including a wide range of fire seasons may be critical, to maintaining the diversity of the pine rockland ecosystem.

J	Griffith, AB; Forseth, IN				Griffith, AB; Forseth, IN			Population matrix models of Aeschynomene virginica, a rare annual plant: Implications for conservation	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Matrix models are valuable tools for comparing population growth rates (lambda) in different environments. Life table response experiments (LTRE) can then be used to identify those life history stages that are most important to observed population growth rate differences. We used matrix models of population growth and LTREs to analyze the effects of standing vegetation and seed dispersal on the population growth rate of Aeschynomene virginica a rare, tidal, wetland annual. We combined seedling establishment, seedling survival to adulthood, adult fecundity, winter seed survival, probability of seeds entering a seed bank, and seed dispersal rates to calculate the matrix elements in a matrix model. Experimental removal of other plant species from field plots increased A. virginica fecundity, seedling establishment, and survival. The magnitude of these changes doubled between 1998 and 1999. Removal of interspecific competitors from population patches of A. virginica explained 54% of the variability of lambda, while environmental variation between 1998 and 1999 explained only 1%. An additional 9% of the variability in lambda was explained by adding the interaction of interspecific removal and year to the regression. Sensitivities of X to changes in lower-level parameters varied over several orders of magnitude. Fecundity had the smallest sensitivity, while seedling establishment made the largest contribution to X in 1998, and seedling survival to adulthood made the largest contribution in 1999. Simulations indicated that changes in seed. dispersal would have small effects on X. Eighty percent (1998) to 90% (1999) of the seeds produced in local patches growing without interspecific vegetation would have to disperse before patch population growth rates would become negative. Although seed dispersal had little impact on within-patch population dynamics, it may make seeds available to establish populations in nearby, open habitat patches. In population patches with interspecific vegetation, 30 seeds per plant (1998) and 80 seeds per plant (1999) would have to be added before patch population growth rates were positive. The most, efficacious treatment to increase population sizes of this rare plant would be creating disturbed patches and not adding seeds.																	1051-0761					FEB	2005	15	1					222	233		10.1890/02-5219							WOS:000227120700017						
J	Bi, IZ; Maquet, A; Baudoin, JP				Bi, IZ; Maquet, A; Baudoin, JP			Mating system of wild Phaseolus lunatus L. and its relationship to population size	HEREDITY												Using isozyme variation in a naturally pollinated seed family for 10 wild Phaseolus lunatus L. ( Lima bean) populations, ranging in sizes from 10 to 60 reproductive individuals, we estimated levels of outcrossing (t) and parental inbreeding coefficient ( F). We also examined the relationship between outcrossing rate and population size. Average estimates of the single-locus outcrossing rate (t(s)) ranged from 0.024 to 0.246 ( mean = 0.091 +/- 0.065). Estimates of the multilocus outcrossing rate (t(m)) ranged from 0.027 to 0.268, and averaged 0.096 +/- 0.071. Inbreeding coefficients based on genotypic frequencies of maternal plants were positive and significantly greater than zero ( F = 0.504), suggesting an excess of homozygotes in all the populations studied. There was indirect evidence of nonrandom mating for outcrosses and this was mainly attributed to self-fertilisation since the averaged difference between t(m) and t(s), which provides a measure of biparental inbreeding, represents only 1% of the autogamy rate. No significant correlation was observed between outcrossing rate and population size. Estimates of t showed significant heterogeneity among populations and factors explaining this tendency are suggested.																	0018-067X	1365-2540				FEB	2005	94	2					153	158		10.1038/sj.hdy.6800527							WOS:000226577300004	15578047					
J	Buckley, YM; Rees, M; Sheppard, AW; Smyth, MJ				Buckley, YM; Rees, M; Sheppard, AW; Smyth, MJ			Stable coexistence of an invasive plant and biocontrol agent: a parameterized coupled plant-herbivore model	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Coupled plant-herbivore models, allowing feedback from plant to herbivore populations and vice versa, enable us to predict the impact of biocontrol agents on their target weed populations; however, they are rarely used in biocontrol studies. We describe the population biology of the invasive plant Echium plantagineum and the weevil Mogulones larvatus, a biocontrol agent, in Australia. In order to understand the dynamics of this plant-herbivore system, a series of coupled models of increasing complexity was developed. 2. A simple model was extended to include a seed bank, density-dependent plant fecundity, competition between weevil larvae and plant tolerance of herbivory, where below a threshold plants could compensate for larval feeding. Parameters and functional forms were estimated from experimental and field data. 3. The plant model, in the absence of the weevil, exhibited stable dynamics and provided a good quantitative description of field densities before the weevil was introduced. 4. In the coupled plant-herbivore model, density dependence in both plant fecundity and weevil larval competition stabilized the dynamics. Without larval competition the model was unstable, and plant tolerance of herbivory exacerbated this instability. This was a result of a time delay in plant response to herbivore densities. 5. Synthesis and applications. The coupled plant-herbivore model allowed us to predict whether stable coexistence of target plant and biocontrol agents was achievable at an acceptable level. We found this to be the case for the Echium-Mogulones system and believe that similar models would be of use when assessing new agents in this and other invasive plant biocontrol systems. Density dependence in new biocontrol agents should be assessed in order to determine whether it is likely to result in the aims of classical biocontrol: low, stable and sustainable populations of plant and herbivore. Further work should be done to characterize the strength of density dependence according to the niche occupied by the biocontrol agent, for example the strength and functional form of density dependence in stem borers may be quite different to that of defoliators. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.00991.x				Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008; Sheppard, Andy W/C-1045-2009	Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; Sheppard, Andy W/0000-0002-6188-7122												0021-8901	1365-2664				FEB	2005	42	1					70	79		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.00991.x							WOS:000227175200008						
J	Pakeman, RJ; Small, JL				Pakeman, RJ; Small, JL			The role of the seed bank, seed rain and the timing of disturbance in gap regeneration	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Does the degree and timing of disturbance contribute significantly to the pattern and process of regeneration in plant communities as a consequence of the availability and number of species of propagules present? Location: Acid grassland at 230 in a.s.l., eastern Scotland, UK. Methods: Plots were surface disturbed or had their soil profile inverted at monthly intervals at 12 dates during a year. Seed bank and seed rain were assessed at each treatment time. The effect of disturbance intensity and timing on the regenerating vegetation was assessed. Results: Removing the seed bank significantly slowed regeneration, as it contributed 43% of developing cover after one year where it was present. At an individual seed level, seed in the seed rain had a much higher likelihood of contributing to the regenerating vegetation than a seed in the seed bank. Some species showed a reliance on the seed bank for regeneration, and hence there was a significant difference in the vegetation that developed between plots with the seed bank intact and those where it was removed. Winter disturbed plots (little seed rain) had slower rates of re-vegetation than summer disturbed plots. Timing had little effect on species composition, though a significantly higher cover of perennial forb species developed on the winter disturbed plots. Conclusion: Removing the contribution of the seed bank had a greater effect on the composition of regenerating vegetation than the effect of seasonal variation on the seed rain.

J	May, MJ; Champion, GT; Dewar, AM; Qi, AM; Pidgeon, JD				May, MJ; Champion, GT; Dewar, AM; Qi, AM; Pidgeon, JD			Management of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant sugar beet for spring and autumn environmental benefit	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												When used in genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops, glyphosate provides great flexibility to manipulate weed populations with consequences for invertebrates and higher trophic levels, for example birds. A range of timings of band and overall spray treatments of glyphosate to GMHT sugar beet were compared with a conventional weed control programme in four field trials over 2 years. Single overall sprays applied between 200 and 250 accumulated day degrees (above a base air temperature of 3degreesC; degreesCd) and band applied treatments applied at 10% or 20% ground cover within the crop rows generally gave significantly greater weed biomass and seed rain than conventional treatments, while later band sprays (more than 650degreesCd) reduced seed return. Two overall sprays of glyphosate produced low weed biomass and generally lowest seed return of all treatments but tended to give some of the highest yields. However, the early overall sprays (200-250degreesCd) and band sprays gave as good or better yields than the conventional and were generally equivalent to the two overall-spray programme. Viable seeds in the soil after the experiment were generally higher following the early overall (200-250degreesCd) and the band spray treatments than following the conventional. The results show that altered management of GMHT sugar beet can provide alternative scenarios to those of the recent Farm Scale Evaluation trials. Without yield loss they can enhance weed seed banks and autumn bird food availability compared with conventional management, or provide early season benefits to invertebrates and nesting birds, depending on the system chosen. Conventional weed control does not have the flexibility to enable these scenarios that benefit both agriculture and environment, although there may be some options for increasing weed seed return in autumn.																	0962-8452					JAN 22	2005	272	1559					111	119		10.1098/rspb.2004.2948							WOS:000226980800001	15695200					
J	Luzuriaga, AL; Escudero, A; Olano, JM; Loidi, J				Luzuriaga, AL; Escudero, A; Olano, JM; Loidi, J			Regenerative role of seed banks following an intense soil disturbance	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Our main aim was to determine the contribution of the seed bank to vegetation regeneration following a disturbance consisting in a deep ploughing and a thorough homogenisation of a perennial grassland. In the seed bank prior to disturbance, seed distribution through the vertical soil profile was evaluated to determine the initial seed species structure. Then, several characteristics of the shallow seed bank and the extant vegetation were evaluated prior and following field disturbance: seed species composition and abundance, and species composition of the aboveground vegetation. The contribution of seed rain versus seed bank was evaluated by means of the comparison of the vegetation developed in plots filled with sterilised soil (seed bank removal) and the vegetation developed in non-sterilised plots in the field. The distribution of seeds through the profile indicated a sharp decline in abundance with depth, and it was probably linked to propagule morphology, with small and rounded seeds proner to being buried deeper than larger seeds. In the grassland prior to disturbance, the aboveground vegetation and seed bank species composition showed very low similarity index, most likely because during the 5 years following field abandonment, sheep pressure had caused a faster change in aboveground vegetation species composition than in seed bank species composition. Ploughing and homogenisation of the grassland led to low seed abundance in the shallow soil layer caused by dilution of the seed bank. Regardless of impoverishment in seed abundance and species richness, comparison between sterilised and non-sterilised plots showed that the seed bank acted as an effective source of colonising species and determined the aboveground species composition. To summarise, this Study outlines the importance of considering several characteristics of the seed bank, such as species composition and seed abundance, in the understanding of the function of seed bank and dynamics of the vegetation following a deep ploughing and homogenisation treatment.

Pohl population in the initial zone of floating mat on an oligo-humotrophic lake in north-eastern Poland	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												In the initial phase of growth in an oligo-humotrophic lake, Cladium mariscus forms a dense and tall sawgrass bed invading the open water in the form of a floating mat. High densities of submerged evergreen perennial stems of C. mariscus, over two metres high and abundantly fruiting, ensure its persistence, and form a natural barrier to the invasion of other species. Dense mats of sawgrass are formed as a result of clonal and rhizome growth. Although diaspore production is abundant under natural conditions, only vegetative propagation of stems was observed. In different variants of the experiment only seeds wintering on stems of mother plants were capable of germinating. Hard seed coats had an important effect on the germination capacity of seeds.																	0001-6977	2083-9480					2005	74	2					167	173									WOS:000229326200010

If crop yield is not reduced or few or no seeds are added to the soil seed bank, then no control may be needed. Eight weed species were sown in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (i) before crop emergence, (ii) at crop emergence, (iii) at V-1, and (iv) at V-2 stages of crop growth in 2002 and 2003. Weed seed was sown close to the crop row and thinned to 1.3 plants M-2. Weed growth and fecundity were influenced by species, time of planting, and year. Only barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti L.) survived to produce seed. Plants from the pre-emergence seeding had the largest canopy and produced the most seeds. Barnyardgrass had maximum canopy cover in early July in corn and late July in soybean but only produced seed in corn. Redroot pigweed and velvetleaf had maximum canopy cover in late August or mid-September, and some plants from most seeding dates survived and produced seed in both corn and soybean. However, plants that grew from seed sown at V-1 and V-2 crop growth stages did not reduce yield or biomass of adjacent crop plants, had low fecundity, and may not warrant treatment. Control may be necessary, however, to prevent yield losses if weeds are present at high densities or to prevent establishment of uncommon species.																	0002-1962					JAN-FEB	2005	97	1					294	302									WOS:000226783300040						
J	Czarnecka, J				Czarnecka, J			Seed dispersal effectiveness in three adjacent plant communities: xerothermic grassland, brushwood and woodland	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												This study investigates the dispersal ability of seeds and fruits of plant species in three adjacent plant communities - xerothermic grassland, brushwood and woodland - through analysis of the soil seed bank and its changes at the borders of the communities. I tested the following null hypothesis: effective seed dispersal leads to negligible differences in the richness and structure of the seed bank among these plant communities. However, considerable differences, both quantitative and qualitative, were observed among the seed banks of the neighbouring plant communities. I noted the highest average density of seeds, 32 450 per square metre, within the brushwood, half of that density (14 058) in the grassland seed bank, and less than a tenth of that density (2245) in the woodland bank. Most of the seeds remain in the close vicinity of their parent plants. In the analysed arrangement of plant communities, the most effective methods of seed dispersal seem to be myrmecochoria and endozoochoria. Seeds and fruits of the last type of dispersal are the most abundant in the woodland seed bank, where tree crowns host a lot of birds. Very effective dispersal is also exhibited by Betula pendula, an anemochorous pioneer species, and Hypericum perforatum.																	0003-3847	1797-2442					2005	42	3					161	171									WOS:000230949200001

Core samples were divided into upper and lower layers (each 5 cm in depth) and allowed to germinate in three water levels (0, 5 and 10 cm) over a 4-month period. A total of 51 species germinated and the mean density was 9211 +/- 7188 seedlings m(-2). In the top 5 cm 41 species and 5747 +/- 5111 seedlings m(-2) germinated, whereas 40 species and 3464 +/- 3363 seedlings m(-2) did so from 5-10 cm. Germinated seedling density was significantly higher in the upper layer, largely due to differences in eight species. With increasing experimental water depth, less seedlings germinated: respectively, 9788 +/- 7157 m(-2), 2050 +/- 2412 m(-2) and 1978 +/- 2616 m(-2), of 44, 21 and 19 species, submerged under 0, 5 or 10 cm. Seven species could emerge only in 0 water level. Vallisneria natans occurred only in 5 cm water, whereas Ottelia alismoides occurred in 10 cm water. In the vegetation survey of the marsh, 25 species were recorded, which was less than half of the species recorded in the seed bank. The top 10 dominants in the standing vegetation, accounting for 89% of vegetation abundance, represented only 10% in the seed bank. Twenty germinated species that also occurred in the standing vegetation accounted for 56% of the total seed bank. Our observed number of species germinating from a Chinese wetland seed bank is within the range observed elsewhere in the northern hemisphere (15-113 species). (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Taylor, GB				Taylor, GB			Hardseededness in Mediterranean annual pasture legumes in Australia: a review	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Hardseededness (seed coat impermeability) is the main seed dormancy mechanism for regulating germination of annual pasture legumes both within and between years. Progress made in Australia over the past 30 years towards an understanding and better utilisation of the mechanism is the subject of this review, together with relevant overseas studies. Although some legumes produce virtually no hard seeds, newly ripened seeds of most cultivated annual pasture legumes are >90% hard when produced under favourable seed maturation conditions. The pattern of seed softening (loss of impermeability) varies widely among legumes both within and between years and is one of the more important considerations in selection programs. The many factors that influence the longevity of seed hardness are described. Differences among legumes in patterns of summer and autumn seed softening, which may influence the extent of seed losses through false breaks of season, are explained in terms of a 2-stage conceptual model of the seed softening process. This model has led to the development of laboratory techniques that effectively simulate field softening behaviour in a wide range of legumes. Different rates of seed imbibition, which may be attributable to a previously unrecognised stage in the seed softening process, and which can offer some further protection against false breaks of season are also described. The wide range of seed softening characteristics that are now recognised provides opportunities for better adapting pasture legumes to particular management systems, including rotations with crops.																	0004-9409						2005	56	7					645	661		10.1071/AR04284							WOS:000230774500001						
J	Vivian-Smith, G; Panetta, FD				Vivian-Smith, G; Panetta, FD			Seedling recruitment, seed persistence and aspects of dispersal ecology of the invasive moth vine, Araujia sericifera ( Asclepiadaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We investigated germination, seedling emergence and seed persistence of the invasive moth vine (Araujia sericifera Brot.) under controlled and field conditions in south-eastern Queensland. Fresh seed showed high viability (99.5%) and germinated readily, with 97.2% of all recorded germinations occurring within 14 days. Mean germination rates ranged from 74 to 100% across the range of temperature (10/20 degrees C, 15/25 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C alternating 12-h thermoperiods) and light (0- and 12-h photoperiods) treatments. Germination was significantly reduced only under cool, dark conditions. In a 24-month field experiment, seedling emergence was greatest for seeds buried at 1 cm (mean = 96.3%), intermediate for seeds buried at 5 cm (mean = 62.7%) and least for surface-sown seeds (mean = 30.7%). Seed persistence under field conditions was low, declining rapidly to 3.9% at 6 months and to 0.67% at 24 months. Moth vine's capacity to germinate readily and the rapid depletion of seeds under field conditions indicate that the species has a transient seed bank in south-eastern Queensland. In an additional experiment testing the capacity of seeds for secondary dispersal by water, the mean floating time of seeds was 15.4 days, suggesting that water could act as a secondary dispersal vector, contributing to long-distance dispersal. We recommend that surveillance methods for detecting moth-vine populations should consider both water-flow patterns and wind direction.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2005	53	3					225	230		10.1071/BT04118							WOS:000229339400005

We then examined the applicability of the technique in the field by using post-fire seedling emergence. We found that the mean length of the swollen hypocotyl in seedlings was a good predictor of the depth of seed burial (R-2 = 0.97). Most variation occurred for seeds buried near the surface at 2-cm depth, where the swollen hypocotyl overestimated the depth of seed burial by about 1 cm. There was a decline in the ability of seeds to successfully emerge from soil depths below 2 cm, with seedlings of G. speciosa able to emerge from soil depths up to 8 cm in the glasshouse. This corresponds with the estimated maximum emergence depth based on seed mass. In the field, seedlings were estimated to have emerged from depths of 1-7 cm after an intense wild. re. There was an approximately normal distribution of seedling emergence depths; however, the mode of this distribution varied among locations. The technique gave comparable results to a similar technique developed for Acacia spp., allowing consideration of a greater range of species and post-fire locations. Use of the technique has the potential to provide insights into the impacts of. res below ground, including the nature of post-fire germination, residual soil seed banks, the depth-related action of fire-induced germination cues and small-scale spatial variation.

J	Chong, C; Walker, KF				Chong, C; Walker, KF			Does lignum rely on a soil seed bank? Germination and reproductive phenology of Muehlenbeckia florulenta (Polygonaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Tangled lignum ('lignum') is a dioecious, multi-stemmed woody shrub that is common in flood-prone areas of inland Australia, including the Murray-Darling Basin. It is often leafless during dry periods, but maintains vegetative growth by stem layering, and responds rapidly to rainfall or flooding by production of shoots, leaves and flowers. This study considers the viability of lignum seeds (contained in achenes) under various conditions of temperature, light, moisture and storage or burial. The seeds are not innately dormant, and germinate within 14 days under ideal conditions. From 66 to 86% of fresh and dry-stored seeds germinate in fluctuating temperatures (15 degrees C/5 degrees C, 24 degrees C/10 degrees C, 31 degrees C/15 degrees C), and optimally at 24 degrees C/10 degrees C, given moisture and light. They also germinate in water (56% success), and remain buoyant for 5-25 days. Germination is inhibited by constant temperatures of 12 and 24 degrees C (4.0-4.8% success) and continuous darkness (6.0-56.0% success), but increases on return to light. Seed viability is depressed by 10% after 70-day dry storage and by 48% after 92-day burial in soil over winter. In one year's (2002) observations of a population on the River Murray floodplain near Morgan, South Australia, winter- and spring-seeding plants produced viable seeds 14-30 days after anthesis, and although rainfall in winter (July) produced a pulse of seedlings, none became established. Achenes were shed soon after maturation, but soil samples revealed very few germinable seeds. It therefore appears that the seeds do not persist for long on the mother plant or in the soil. The persistence of lignum in environments prone to erratic droughts and floods appears to depend mainly on its capacity to tolerate drought, maintain vegetative growth and respond quickly to watering.

J	Clarke, S; French, K				Clarke, S; French, K			Germination response to heat and smoke of 22 Poaceae species from grassy woodlands	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Grasses form an important component of grassy woodlands, although their response to. re has been understudied. In this study, fire germination responses of 22 Poaceae species from an endangered grassy-woodland community in eastern Australia were investigated. Seeds of 20 native and two exotic species were subjected to heat (no heat, 40, 80 and 120 degrees C) and smoke treatment (10% dilution smoke water) and the percentage germination was compared. Germination response of species showed no consistent pattern to phylogeny and was highly variable. Germination in six species was unaffected by the application of heat or smoke. In five species, heat, irrespective of smoke application, influenced germination. Smoke, irrespective of heat treatment, influenced six species. For a further six species, the effect of smoke varied with temperature. These results suggest that. re regimes will influence the recruitment of grass species differentially and maintaining regional species richness is likely to require the maintenance of a heterogeneous. re regime across the landscape.

Agricultural intensification led to a considerable habitat loss and fragmentation, especially for dry semi-natural grasslands. This current study investigates the impact of former melon and cereal cultivation (cultivation period: 1950 1987) on the semi-natural vegetation of the Crau, representing the last xeric Mediterranean steppe in France. Today, the ex-cultivated melon and cereal fields are characterised by different vegetation compositions, species richness and evenness compared to the undisturbed steppe community. Also the abiotic conditions (N, P, K, pH, soil granule fractions) have been changed by former cultivation practices. The rather transient seed bank of the steppe was depleted during the cultivation periods; ancient weed species and ruderals now determine the seed bank of the ex-cultivated fields. It is concluded that the conservation of the last parts of undisturbed steppe must have absolute priority. A re-development of the original and unique steppe community on formerly cultivated fields may take decades or centuries, if at all. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Recasens, J; Calvet, V; Cirujeda, A; Conesa, JA				Recasens, J; Calvet, V; Cirujeda, A; Conesa, JA			Phenological and demographic behaviour of an exotic invasive weed in agroecosystems	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												An experimental work was conducted in Lleida (Spain) aiming to characterise the phenology and to quantify the demographic processes regulating the populations of Abutilon theophrasti Medicus in maize fields. Seedling emergence started a few days after crop sowing in early May and continued during two more months. The vegetative phase was very long due to the late seeding emergence; these later emerged plants showed a slower development, and many of them did not reach the fertility stage. A flowering peak was observed 12 weeks after emergence in late July, and fruit dehiscence and seed setting started in mid August, several weeks before crop harvest. Four different cohorts were identified, and two main peaks of emergence were determined 21 and 49 days after crop sowing nearest related with field irrigation. A functional logarithmic relationship between cumulative growing degree-days (GDD) and cumulative emergence was also described. The resulting demographic diagram reflects. greater values relating to seedling survival for May cohorts (90.2 vs 7.9%), to fertility (100 vs 75%) and to fecundity (3774 vs 92 seeds pl(-1)) than those determined for the June cohorts. The late emerged plants are subjected to a high density and are strongly affected by light competition, and their reproductive phase initiation delay is of about 10-20 days. In an assay conducted in Petri dishes, the seeds provided from plants emerged earlier were found more vigorous and germinated more than those from late emerged plants, which seem to be affected by incomplete fruit and seed ripening. Following the crop cycle without any weed control, the population rate increase was about 21.2. These values explain the high invasion capacity of this weed in the local summer irrigated fields, which consists in assuring their presence through a persistent soil seed bank and increasing the probability to spread to other fields.

The objective of our study was to examine 10 dissimilarity coefficients widely used in germplasm surveys, with special focus on applications in plant breeding and seed banks. In particular, we (i) investigated the genetical and mathematical properties of these coefficients, (ii) examined consequences of these properties for different areas of application in plant breeding and seed banks, and (iii) determined relationships between these 10 coefficients. The genetical and mathematical concepts of the coefficients were described in detail. A Procrustes analysis of a published data set consisting of seven CIMMYT maize populations demonstrated close affinity between Euclidean, Rogers', modified Rogers', and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards' distance on one hand, and Nei's standard and Reynolds dissimilarity on the other hand. Our investigations show that genetical and mathematical properties of dissimilarity measures are of crucial importance when choosing a genetic dissimilarity coefficient for analyzing molecular marker data. The presented results assist experimenters to extract the maximum amount of information from genetic data and, thus, facilitate the interpretation of findings from molecular marker studies on a theoretically sound basis.

J	Lawrence, D				Lawrence, D			Biomass accumulation after 10-200 years of shifting cultivation in bornean rain forest	ECOLOGY												I examined the effect of repeated long-fallow shifting cultivation on biomass accumulation in a rain-forest landscape occupied for over 200 years in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, The diameters of stems >5 cm dbh were measured in nine secondary forests using a stratified random design of nested plots (3000 m(2) per site). The stands were 9-12 years old and had experienced from I to 10 or more cycles of shifting cultivation. Accounting for differences in soil fertility, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that aboveground live biomass increment (ABI, in megagrams per hectare per year) was significantly greater after four cycles than after six or more cycles. ABI was lowest after two cycles, highest after one or four cycles and intermediate after 6-10 cycles. Differences were driven by the density and biomass of trees >10 cm dbh, which followed a similar pattern. Although the diameter increment and contribution to total biomass of trees >10 cm dbh increased significantly with inherent soil fertility, variation in the rate of biomass accumulation depended primarily on the number of prior cultivation cycles. An ANCOVA with soil fertility as the main effect was not significant. One hypothesis to explain observed patterns of ABI associated with changes in tree density is a shift, over many cycles, in the dominance of seed-banking vs. resprouting species. Previous work has shown that total phosphorus did not decline after six or more cycles; however, a shift from available to occluded forms may be related to lower ABI in sites with the longest cultivation history. An 11% decline in ABI could substantially alter the carbon-sequestration value of secondary tropical forests as they enter their second century of persistent human disturbance.																	0012-9658					JAN	2005	86	1					26	33		10.1890/03-0564							WOS:000226791700004						
J	HilleRisLambers, J; Clark, JS; Lavine, M				HilleRisLambers, J; Clark, JS; Lavine, M			Implications of seed banking for recruitment of southern Appalachian woody species	ECOLOGY												Seed dormancy is assumed to be unimportant for population dynamics of temperate woody species, because seeds occur at low densities and are short lived in forest soils. However, low soil seed densities may result from low seed production, and even modest seed longevity can buffer against fluctuating seed production, potentially limiting density-dependent mortality and ensuring that seeds are available for germination when recruitment success is likely. To investigate whether seed banking affects woody seedling dynamics in the southern Appalachians, we monitored seed rain, seed bank, and seedling densities to (1) determine the prevalence of seed banking among southern Appalachian woody species, (2) quantify annual seed mortality rates for three seed-banking species using a Bayesian statistical approach, and (3) assess whether or not the ability to,seed bank affects recruitment rates. We found that the seeds of eight woody taxa (Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron talipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rubus spp., Sassafras albidum, and Vitis sp.) remain viable in the soil for more than one year. Seeds of six taxa (Amelanchier spp., Acer pennsylvanicum, Carya spp., Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) were never found in the soil seed bank, despite high seed production and germination. For three species, a substantial proportion of seeds available for germination came from dispersal events two or more years in the past (Acer rubrum 12-37%, Betula spp. 59-73%, Liriodendron tulipifera 40-76%), even though annual seed mortality was high (Acer rubrum 70-98%, Betula spp. 21-81%, Liriodendron tulipifera 12-59%). In years when no seeds fall in local microsites (approximately one in five years), seed banks are the only source of seedling recruitment for these species. Comparing our results to those of previous studies led to valuable insights: first, that seeds of Acer rubrum and Betula spp. suffer high mortality while being incorporated into the seed bank; and second, that seed decay varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales (i.e., within a watershed). Taken together, these results demonstrate that seed banking may play a critical role during woody seedling recruitment in temperate forests.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	2005	86	1					85	95		10.1890/03-0685							WOS:000226791700010						
J	Kemeny, G; Nagy, Z; Tuba, Z				Kemeny, G; Nagy, Z; Tuba, Z			Seed bank dynamics in a semiarid sandy grassland in Hungary	EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA												Vegetation and soil seed bank of four neighbouring patches of a semiarid sandy grassland (Festucetum vaginatae danubialae S o o (1929) 1933) were studied during two vegetation periods. 1. We took coenological descriptions in the patches of the association. Soil samples were taken four times from the patches and seed bank composition was determined by the seedling emergence method. Similarity between the composition of the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation was estimated by the Sorensen index, showing high similarity in the autumn period and smaller in the spring, probably due to the depletion of the soil seed bank. 2. Density of the seed bank varied from 58 to 3155 seeds/m(2), with larger differences within single patches than between the patches. We concluded that the vigorous seed production of a few species is responsible for the extensive fluctuation of the seed bank. 3. Seeds of 88% of the examined annual species and 59% of the perennial species were occurred in the soil samples during two vegetation periods. Out of the 57 species found in the aboveground vegetation, 6 annual (Arenaria serpyllifolia, Cerastiurn semidecandrum, Erigeron canadensis, Erophila verna, Holosteum umbellatum, Saxifraga tridactylites) and 5 perennial (Euphorbia seguieriana, Festuca vaginata, Minuartia verna, Poa bulbosa, Silene otites) species had persistent seed bank. The association is most vulnerable at the time of early spring and at the beginning of summer, in the period when all species have the less seed reserve in the soil. This calls the attention on the importance of the transient seed bank.

Progress in assessing risk demands a coherent theoretical framework within which questions such as the reversibility of breakdown in pest resistance or 'escape' of herbicide-tolerance genes can be phrased and tested. Here we begin to sketch out a framework that provides some answers while taking account of the inherent spatial and temporal variability of agricultural and semi-natural systems. After a brief summary of the risks associated with the deployment of novel crop varieties, we define what we mean by invasion and persistence in variable environments. This leads to a discussion of stochasticity and spatial scales in which we distinguish between different sources of variability that affect the probability of invasion and persistence times. We illustrate this with the distributions of global extinction times of crop plants or hybrids that persist as local patches in the landscape following the introduction of a new variety. Empirical studies of persistence of transgenes are next discussed. We begin with pollen dispersal, which leads to the dispersal profiles from point sources from which separation distances can be calculated to minimize contamination between transgenic and conventional crops. Three important aspects that emerge from some work on the dynamics of feral populations of transgenic crops are identified: feral patches of some transgenic crops are transient with short persistence times; there is large environmentally-driven variability in ecological performance; the seed bank is an important reservoir from which plants may emerge even after a patch appears to have gone extinct. Next we show how such variability can be incorporated into stochastic life history models, from which it is possible to identify intrinsic, genetically controlled properties of crop plants that favour persistence. These analyses suggest how to design new crop varieties with characters that minimize the risk of spread and persistence in the landscape. Finally, we introduce landscape-dynamic models in which we show, using individual-based percolation and metapopulation models, how the spatial arrangement of crop plants and feral patches of 'escaped' plants in the landscape influence invasion and persistence.																			1-4020-3247-1				2005	7						143	161									WOS:000228889100018						
J	Dostal, P				Dostal, P			Effect of three mound-building ant species on the formation of soil seed bank in mountain grassland	FLORA												The effect of three ant species (Lasius flavus, Formica spp., Tetramorium caespitum) on soil seed bank formation was studied in temperate mountain grassland. Seed removal experiments, analysis of soil seed content and seed survival experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of ground ants on the seed fate. In the seed removal experiment seeds of 16 species, including 5 species with elaiosome-bearing seeds (myrmecochores), were exposed and their removal followed for 39 h. On average, ants removed 63.8% of myrmecochorous seeds and 10.9% of seeds without adaptation to ant dispersal. Analysis of soil seed content revealed that myrmecochores, in spite of expectations that they would accumulate in nests of seed dispersing ants, were most abundant in the soil of control plots. Evidence on seed relocation to the ant nests was obtained from a comparison of mounds of seed dispersing and seed non-dispersing ant species, as more seeds were found in the mounds of Formica spp. and Tetramorium caespitum (seed dispersers) in comparison with the mounds of Lasius favus (non-disperser). The soil seed bank of the compared microhabitats (control plots and mounds of 3 ant species) differed in their species composition, seed abundance and vertical distribution. The most distinct qualitative differences were between seed flora of control plots and mounds of Tetramorium caespitum. Control plots had approximately 30,000 propagules per m, which was double the number of seeds found in the ant mounds. In control plots, abundance and diversity of seeds steeply declined with depth; this trend was not observed in the mounds probably due to bioturbation. In the seed survival experiment, more seeds (2 out of 3 species) survived in control plots, which may also contribute to the higher seed abundance in this microhabitat. This study showed that seed relocation by ants does not contribute significantly to seed bank build-up at this study site. Ants may, however, increase the regeneration success of myrmecochores, mainly by dispersal for distance and placement in a larger spectrum of microsites, in contrast to species not adapted for myrmecochory.

A stand overgrazed by domestic geese and a reference stand void of overgrazing were compared. Apart from this both stands were accidentally grazed by cattle, Vegetation of the overgrazed stand was significantly more species-rich, especially in summer annuals. The reference was dominated with perennials and winter annuals. Composition and dominance changed considerably at both stands but only composition became more alike. Declining species richness and increasing dominance of perennials was found in the overgrazed stand. The reference stand became dominated with the dwarf-shrub Thymus degenianus. Species richness or the overgrazed stand showed greater seasonal and year-to-year variation than that of the reference. No temporal change of nutrient availability was found and neither was a difference detected between the stands. Greenhouse germination revealed more dense and more species-rich seed bank in the overgrazed stand. Its established vegetation and soil seed bank were also more alike. Higher species richness of the overgrazed stand can be associated with intensive propagule dispersal of geese, as indicated by den-se seed banks of zoochorous hygrophytes delivered from neighbouring wetlands. Relatively high representation of persistent seed bank records suggests that, except for some sensitive perennials, the studied community is adapted to recurrent disturbances, Community regeneration seems to be limited by slow spread of perennial graminoids.

J	Zobel, M; Kalamees, R				Zobel, M; Kalamees, R			Diversity and dispersal - Can the link be approached experimentally?	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												It has been hypothesized that the relative role of species dispersal in determining plant community composition and species richness changes along primary productivity and disturbance intensity gradients. Manipulative experiments with either diaspore addition or prevention are needed to validate this hypothesis. Due to methodological constraints, diaspore prevention experiments are rarely used. In the case of diaspore addition experiments, there are some potential sources of error. (1) Experiments may be confounded since patchiness of microbial communities is not considered and techniques equalizing microbial communities over study plots are not used. (2) The length of the period of observation may not be sufficient to understand whether the establishment of sown individuals was really successful. (3) The effect of the sowing treatment and the theoretical context of the whole experiment depends on the number and identity of species sown. When addressing the role of long-distance dispersal, it is almost impossible to say what the appropriate number and composition of species to be used for the experiment should be. (4) Until now, most of the attention has been on dispersal in space, while the role of "dispersal in time" (seed bank) has rarely been addressed. We conclude that stepwise accumulation of experimental studies, addressing the role of dispersal in shaping plant communities, will sooner or later reveal general patterns, given the experiments are well planned and aim to avoid the sources of errors described above.

One way to explore the importance of dispersal limitation is to use seed-sowing experiments, but these do not enable the screening of large sets of species and habitats. In the present paper we present a complementary approach based on comparing small plots with larger regions with regard to species composition and distribution of functional traits. We developed a GIS tool based on ecological and geographical criteria to quantify species pools at various spatial scales. In this GIS tool, containing floristic, large databases, phytosociological and functional information are exploited. Our premise is that differences in the nature of the species in local and regional species pools with regard to functional traits can give important clues to the processes at work in the assembly of communities. We illustrate the approach with a case study for mesotrophic hay meadows (Calthion palustris). We tested the effects of differences in frequency in the local Habitat Species Pool and differences in dispersal and persistence traits of species on local species composition. Our results show that both species pool effects and functional traits affect the probability of occurrence in small plots. Species with a high propagule weight have, given the frequency in the Local Habitat Species Pool, a lower probability of occurrence in small plots. The probability of local occurrence, however, is increased by the ability to form a persistent soil seed bank and by adult longevity. This provides support for the view that the degree of dispersal limitation is dependent on the degree of spatial isolation of the focal site relative to source populations and moreover that species inherently differ in the degree to which dispersal limitation is a limiting factor for local occurrence.

J	Bekker, RM; Kwak, MM				Bekker, RM; Kwak, MM			Life history traits as predictors of plant rarity, with particular reference to hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA					1st International Symposium on the Biology of Non-Weedy Hemiparasitic (ex-) Scrophulariaceae	APR 15-16, 2004	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS					We made a comparison between life history and reproductive characteristics of a group of Dutch rare (30) and common (105) plant species, all dicotyledonous and insect-visited forbs. The traits life span, clonality, breeding system, seed production, seed dispersal, and soil seed bank longevity are considered. All trait values have been ranked according to their possible effect on the vulnerability of a species for extinction, where low values indicate a low risk and high values a high risk for a species. Rare and common plants differed significantly in four traits: seed production, breeding system, seed bank longevity and clonality. The discriminant analysis showed that 79% of the 135 species was correctly classified in the group they presently belong to. Especially species that are rare now but were much more common 50-100 years ago were classified as being common species, pointing at the detrimental effect of habitat loss these species encountered at which they have not yet been able to adapted to. The data set included eight hemiparasitic plant species (family Orobanchaceae), of which six are endangered in The Netherlands and two more common. Both rare and common hemiparasites scored high traits values, indicating that they are vulnerable for extinction. The hemiparasites had several characteristics in common: they are all annuals or biennials that have no means of clonal reproduction. They all have non-clustered, zygomorphic flowers that produce nectar and have a precise pollen presentation and are mainly visited by (bumble) bees. Mean life span was significantly shorter in the eight hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae than in the non-hemiparasitic Scrophulariaceae used for comparison (4 species). Overall, we concluded that hemiparasitic plants have a special combination of life history traits which makes them vulnerable for local and regional extinction.																	1211-9520	1874-9348					2005	40	2-3					231	242		10.1007/BF02803237							WOS:000230540200010

The species and community diversity of grasslands is a result of a traditional extensive grassland management interacting with a broad range of site conditions. Until the early decades of the last century, grassland sites were hardly ameliorated and the agronomic potential was generally low, depending on the fertility of the soils. From the second half of the last century onwards, the production from grassland was markedly improved by regular fertilisation and liming and by artificial drainage of wet sites. Correspondingly, the stocking rates and the cutting frequency increased. Thus, biodiversity strongly decreased, and unimproved species-rich swards only persisted on a low percentage of the total grassland area. The preservation of the remaining species-rich grassland is a primary goal of nature conservation. The continuation of traditional ways of grassland management that would best preserve biodiversity is often not compatible with the requirements of intensive livestock production. Therefore, this grassland is at risk of being abandoned from agricultural use and there is a need for compensation payments for farmers to maintain grassland management. Apart from the unimproved species-rich grassland, there is an increasing area of now de-intensified species-poor grassland which can be managed to increase biodiversity. Grazing at a low stocking rate seems to have the potential to facilitate the restoration of diverse swards and to support reasonable individual performances of the grazing animals.																			9985-9611-3-7				2005	10						211	220									WOS:000235293800041						
J	Keeley, JE; Pfaff, AH; Safford, HD				Keeley, JE; Pfaff, AH; Safford, HD			Fire suppression impacts on postfire recovery of Sierra Nevada chaparral shrublands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												A substantial portion of chaparral shrublands in the southern part of California's Sierra Nevada Mountain Range has never had a recorded fire since record keeping began in 1910. We hypothesised that such long periods without fire are outside the historical range of variability and that when such areas burn, postfire recovery is weaker than in younger stands. We predicted that long fire- free periods will result in loss of shrub species and deterioration of soil seed banks, which, coupled with higher fire intensities from the greater accumulation of dead biomass, will lead to poorer postfire regeneration. The 2002 McNally Fire burned ancient stands that were as much as 150 years old, as well as much younger ( mature) stands. Based on shrub skeletons in the burned area as a surrogate for prefire density, we found that ancient stands change in structure, owing primarily to the loss of obligate seeding Ceanothus cuneatus; other species appear to have great longevity. Despite the reduction in C. cuneatus, postfire shrub - seedling recruitment remained strong in these ancient stands, although some seed bank deterioration is suggested by the three- quarters lower seedling recruitment than recorded from mature stands. Total diversity and the abundance of postfire endemic annuals are two other response variables that suggest that these ancient stands are recovering as well as mature stands. The one area of some concern is that non- native species richness and abundance increased in the ancient stands, suggesting that these are more open to alien colonisers. It is concluded that chaparral more than a century old is resilient to such long fire- free periods and fire severity impacts are indistinguishable from those in younger chaparral stands.																	1049-8001						2005	14	3					255	265		10.1071/WF05049							WOS:000231906300006						
J	Mura, G				Mura, G			Cyst distribution and hatching pattern of Chirocephalus ruffoi (Crustacea, Anostraca) in an experimental undisturbed pool	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The pattern of cyst distribution in the absence of turbation and their hatching behaviour were studied in an outdoor artificial pool, where just differentiated adults of the anostracan Chirocephalus ruffoi (sex ratio 1: 3) lived until it dried up. The horizontal and vertical distributions of cysts in the pool bed were determined. The comparison between cyst bank estimate (MURA, 2004) and the actual number of cysts counted in the pool bed revealed an estimate error of 20.9%. Resting eggs occurred only in the upper 2.5 cm thick soil sections and decreased within this section as depth increased. Peripheral areas of the pool contained significantly larger numbers of cysts than the central area. Multiway analysis on the results recorded in hatching success (nested ANOVA) revealed that the differences were significantly affected by initial soil conditions, treatment and vertical distribution of cysts. Among these factors, vertical distribution (sections nested in cores) was the most influential. Hatching success was significantly inversely related to depth. Differences in the timing of hatching depending on the above considered factors were also noted. A nearly synchronous hatching pattern was observed only for cysts from initially dry sediment of the uppermost layers. In all successively deeper layers, hatching showed multiple peaks and was increasingly delayed and erratic (already mentioned). ANCOVA within each of the experimental conditions revealed significant differences in hatching frequencies (time as covariate) depending on sediment depth. Within any given layer, ANCOVA revealed a significant influence of initial sediment conditions and treatment on the timing of hatching.																	1434-2944	1522-2632					2005	90	3					277	291		10.1002/iroh.200410729							WOS:000230200200003

Rapid response actions included containment under pvc tarps coupled with injection of liquid sodium hypochlorite. To assess the efficacy of these treatments, replicated sediment cores were removed from representative treated sites and transferred to grow-out facilities. Similar cores from uninfested (control) sediments were removed, inoculated with viable explants of C. taxifolia and placed in grow-out facilities. Results from two sampling periods (1 year, 2 years post-treatment) showed that no viable C. taxifolia emerged in cores, and that inoculated "control" sediments supported normal growth. Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) seedlings emerged from native seed-banks in "treated" cores, which also supported growth of some invertebrates (annelid worms and hydroids). This study provided essential verification of C. taxifolia eradication efforts, and demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating quality control/quality assurance components in rapid response actions. Results of this study also suggest that seeds of eelgrass are viable for at least two years.																	0146-6623					JAN	2005	43						1	9									WOS:000230703800001						
J	Kinloch, JE; Friedel, MH				Kinloch, JE; Friedel, MH			Soil seed reserves in arid grazing lands of central Australia. Part 1: seed bank and vegetation dynamics	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Heavy grazing can cause a long-term reduction in the capacity of vegetation to respond to rain particularly after drought. One potential cause is a lack of soil seed reserves. We found that the size and composition of the germinable seed bank in and calcareous grazing lands were changed where there had been several decades of heavy grazing, including a period of drought, but not when grazing was lighter, time was shorter and drought was absent. The same was true for the species numbers and composition in the standing herbage. Seed reserves were persistent and 'moderately similar' in species composition to the standing herbage at a broad level (Sorenson similarity index 60% and 66%). Similarity was likely to be strongly affected by prevailing seasonal conditions and so should be assessed over several years. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Part 2: availability of 'safe sites'	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In the and grazing lands of central Australia, a previous study found that the size and composition of seed banks were changed by heavy grazing. In this concurrent study we found that grazing decreased the number of 'safe sites' for seeds by reducing soil stability and damaging broad-scale resource traps. The loss of 'safe sites' was likely to have had a greater initial impact on seed bank size than the direct effect of grazing on seed-bearing plants. In this environment, changes to the soil preceded changes to the vegetation, so that soil-based rather than vegetation -based indicators may provide a better early warning of rangeland deterioration.

Fifty-eight woody species, representing 30 plant families, were recorded at Biyo-Kelala, of which only 25 were recorded both in the enclosure and open area while two were recorded outside of the sample plots. At Tiya, 31 woody species, representing 19 families, were recorded in the enclosure but only 15 of these species were encountered in the open area. Woody plant densities were 1746 and 2215 individuals/ha in the enclosure and open area at Biyo-Kelala, respectively, and 3705 and 3048 individuals/ha in the enclosure and open area at Tiya, respectively. Dodonaea angustifolia and Acacia etbaica were the most dominant species at Biyo-Kelala and Tiya, respectively. The enclosure at Biyo-Kelala had about twice the diversity value of the open area, while the corresponding values were 2.5 and 2 for the enclosure and open area at Tiya, respectively. The total numbers of species recovered from the soil samples collected in Biyo-Kelala site were 48 for the enclosure and 30 for the open area with mean seed densities of 2765 ( 124) and 1663 (+/-117) seeds m(2), respectively. At Tiya, 30 and 16 species were recovered in the enclosure and open area, respectively, with mean seed densities of 2811 (+/-276) and 996 (+/-243) seeds m(2), respectively. The diversity of all plant species in the soil seed bank was greater in the enclosure than the open area at both sites. Herbs and grasses dominated the soil seed banks at both sites while several of the woody species recorded in the above-ground vegetation were not represented at all. Overall results from this study indicate strongly that establishment of enclosures is very advantageous over other methods since it is a fast, cheap and lenient method for the rehabilitation of degraded lands.

Ecological engineering provides ecologically sound and cost-effective solution to solving this problem. As a case study, a 15 hm(2) ecological water storage basin for a water plant was designed and constructed on the TEDA area in Tianjin City. Located on saline, the. construction of this project has to face serious difficulties, such as high salinity, scarce seed banks of macrophytes, and strong winds. Freshwater replacement, soil amendation and macrophytes planting at the basinshore, wooden water breaker and plastic membrane installation and other measures were conducted for the assistance of plant community establishment. The result showed that the chloride concentration in the basin water decreased from 11600 mg/L to less than 100 mg/L, and the chloride content in the basin sediment decreased from 2.1 % to 0.35 % after freshwater soaking. The introduced macrophytes of 8 species all survived and I I other macrophytes species were occurred in the basin. A new ecosystem was created with increased biological diversity in the original saline, and the water quality was improved. This ecological water storage basin also provided a pleasing landscape for local people.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2005	17	1					62	66									WOS:000226147000012	15900759					
J	Herrick, BM; Wolf, AT				Herrick, BM; Wolf, AT			Invasive plant species in diked vs. undiked Great Lakes wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We compared the standing vegetation, seed banks, and substrate conditions in seven pairs of diked and undiked wetlands near the shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, North America. Our analysis tested the null hypothesis that construction of artificial dikes has no effect on the vulnerability of Great Lakes coastal wetlands to non-native and native invasive species. Both the standing vegetation and seed banks in diked wetlands contained significantly more species and individuals of invasive plants. In addition, diked wetlands exhibited significantly higher levels of organic matter and nutrient levels, and significantly higher average pH. Two pervasive non-native invasive species in the Great Lakes region, Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) and Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass) were significantly more abundant in diked wetlands. Typha spp. (cattail) also formed a much higher percent vegetation cover in the diked wetlands. Our results support the view that diking of shoreline wetlands modifies natural hydrologic regimes, leading to nutrient-rich aquatic environments that are vulnerable to invasion. The shallower, more variable water levels in non-diked wetlands, on the other hand, appear to favor another undesirable invasive species, Phragmites australis (common reed grass).																	0380-1330						2005	31	3					277	287		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70259-8							WOS:000232425200004						
J	Preisser, EL; Bastow, JL				Preisser, Evan L.; Bastow, Justin L.			Plant damage from and defenses against 'cryptic' herbivory: A guild perspective	JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS												Despite considerable interest in the factors affecting trophic cascades in terrestrial systems, there has been relatively little attention paid to the importance of the herbivore-plant link in explaining why some systems "cascade" (have strong top-down effects on plant survival and population growth) and others "trickle" (have top-down effects on plant damage, but little effect on plant fitness). This is despite the fact that herbivore guild identity has long been recognized as a major force affecting herbivore-plant interactions. We address the potential importance of herbivore guild identity in determining the strength of tritrophic interactions by reviewing literature concerning plant damage from and induced defenses against two "cryptic" herbivore guilds, predispersal seed predators and root/stem borers. Although both guilds are capable of strongly affecting plant fitness, the impact of root/stem borers on plants in natural systems seems far greater than that of predispersal seed predators. The large impact of root/stem borers occurs via their disruption of plant vascular systems, while a variety of factors (safe-site-limited plant populations, long-lived seed banks, temporal plant escape, etc.) each seem important in explaining the smaller effect of predispersal seed predators. While the lack of attention to herbivore guilds is understandable, given the (by necessity) single-species focus of much trophic cascade research, we suggest that predator suppression of root/stem borers and predispersal seed predators will, respectively, yield strong versus weak top-down effects on plant fitness. The potential tritrophic consequences of herbivore feeding mode highlight the importance of research on varied predator-herbivore chains that share a common basal resource.

Several control strategies have been approached with relative success. Moderate resistance is available in standard indeterminate field bean cultivars for animal feed, but not in determinate types for horticultural uses. In this paper, we present evidence that a new faba bean cultivar of determinate growth habit for early harvest of young pods for fresh consumption might serve as a profitable catch crop. It escapes broomrape damage due to early harvesting of young pods at the time that broomrape is being established. After this early harvest, the crop is removed, destroying established broomrapes before flowering, thus reducing the broomrape seed bank in the soil.

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential distance of dispersal of Rhizophora mangle propagules by comparing deposition density with landscape characteristics of mangrove forests. Propagule density was estimated at various distances to mangrove sources (R. mangle) on beaches in southwestern Florida in both high-and low-energy environments, either facing open gulf waters vs. sheltered, respectively. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems were used to identify source forests and to determine their landscape characteristics (forest size and distance to deposition area) for the regression analyses. Our results indicated that increasing density of propagules stranded on beaches was related negatively to the distance of the deposition sites from the nearest stands of R. mangle and that deposition was greatly diminished 2 kin or more from the source. Measures of fragmentation such as the area of the R. mangle forests were related to propagule deposition but only in low-energy environments. Our results suggest that geographic models involving the colonization of coastal mangrove systems should include dispersal dynamics at mid-range scales, i.e., for our purposes here, beyond the local scale of the forest and up to 5 kin distant. Studies of mangrove propagule deposition at various spatial scales are key to understanding regeneration limitations in natural gaps and restoration areas. Therefore, our study of mid-range propagule dispersal has broad application to plant ecology, restoration, and modeling.

Within the Great Barrier Reef region there are four different seagrass habitat types now recognised. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the different types of seagrass habitat is poorly understood. In general seagrass growth is limited by light, disturbance and nutrient supply, and changes to any or all of these limiting factors may cause seagrass decline. The capacity of seagrasses to recover requires either recruitment via seeds or through vegetative growth. The ability of seagrass meadows to recover from large scale loss of seagrass cover observed during major events such as cyclones or due to anthropogenic disturbances such as dredging will usually require regeneration from seed bank. Limited research into the role of pollutants on seagrass survival suggests there may be ongoing impacts due to herbicides, pesticides and other chemical contaminants. Further research and monitoring of seagrass meadow dynamics and the influence of changing water quality on these is needed to enhance our ability to manage seagrasses on the Great Barrier Reef.

J	Diemont, SAW; Martin, JF				Diemont, SAW; Martin, JF			Management impacts on the trophic diversity of nematode communities in an indigenous agroforestry system of Chiapas, Mexico	PEDOBIOLOGIA												The Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Mexico practice a system of agroforestry that mimics the surrounding ecosystem and its successional stages. Their fields rotate through grass (milpa), and shrub (acahual) and forest fallow stages that regenerate soil, nutrients, and seed banks. Each successional. stage, including the fallow stages, produces over 25 types of crops, raw materials, and medicines. Lacandon traditionally do not use fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. Nematodes were chosen to analyze soil ecology in the Lacandon system because they have been shown to be dynamic indicators of environmental conditions. Nematodes were classified by trophic level. as plant parasite, fungivore, bacterivore, and omnivore-predator, and were found to be a function of management practice. In milpas where weeds were removed and applied to the field, plant parasites were reduced by 44% and fungivorous nematode concentrations were reduced by 50%. In these same fields, percentage of bacterivorous nematodes was positively related to soil organic matter concentration (R-2 = 0.61, P < 0.001). These results indicate that management practices reduced concentrations of plant parasites and delayed the nematode successional pathway from bacterivorous to fungivorous. This study demonstrates the potential. for Lacandon Maya techniques to sustainably manage pests and maintain soil fertility in other tropical agroecosystems. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Leck, MA; Schutz, W				Leck, MA; Schutz, W			Regeneration of Cyperaceae, with particular reference to seed ecology and seed banks	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Cyperaceae (sedges) are an important component of many ecosystems. To understand better their regeneration, we examined seed ecology, including dispersal, seed characteristics, and germination behavior that relate to seed bank development and persistence. We also evaluated sedge seed banks from 104 studies, representing a wide array of habitats. Sedge seed bank development and persistence were associated with germination and dormancy traits, namely: dormancy level, seasonal dormancy patterns, and requirement for light, alternating temperatures, and aerobic conditions. Interplay of traits appears to have resulted in low-risk germination strategies adapted to exploit infrequent occurrence of gaps and facilitate formation of persistent seed banks. A variety of dispersal modes and morphological adaptations occurred, but many species had no apparent specialized structures. The main dispersal vectors were water and then animals. About 216 species, in 21 genera, were recorded in the seed bank survey. High densities (> 50,000 m(-2)) occurred occasionally in wet habitats, but generally values were low (< 500 m(- 2) in 70% of entries). Species richness was also generally low (mean 4.8 species study'), but ranged -from 10 to 33 species in certain wetlands. Our studies showed varied reproductive strategies within habitats, persistence, and ability of many species to colonize disturbed habitats. Overall, seed banks tended to be persistent (> 1 year). Maximum longevity ranged between 10 and 295 years, but for certain species viability was lost in < 3 years. Seeds of many sedges occurred in deeper soil layers to depths > 1 m. Seed production, low in rhizomatous species, ranged between 0 and 345,000 seeds m(-2) year(-1). Amphicarpy or pseudo-viviparous plantlets occurred in limited numbers of species. The relation between' seed production, seed rain, and seed bank is largely obscure and awaits further investigation. For successful restoration and species conservation projects, seed banks (or a source of seeds) are necessary, combined with suitable germination and establishment conditions. Future seed bank studies are considered. (c) 2005 Rubel Foundation, ETH Ziirich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

J	Meyer, SE; Pendleton, BK				Meyer, SE; Pendleton, BK			Factors affecting seed germination and seedling establishment of a long-lived desert shrub (Coleogyne ramosissima: Rosaceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Long-lived desert shrubs exhibit infrequent, episodic recruitment from seed. In spite of this long time scale, selection on life history attributes that affect seedling recruitment should be strong. We studied factors affecting germination phenology and seedling establishment for Coleogyne ramosissima, a dominant shrub species in the ecotone between warm and cold deserts in western North America. We also examined ecotypic differentiation in establishment strategy in response to selection regimes in two contrasting habitats. We followed patterns of dormancy loss, germination, emergence, and survival in reciprocal field experiments at warm winter Mojave Desert and cold winter Colorado Plateau study sites. Seed germination took place in late winter, under winter rain conditions at the warm desert site and under snow at the cold desert site. Distinctive germination phenologies for the two seed populations at contrasting field sites followed predictions based on laboratory germination experiments. There was no seed bank carryover across years. Seedling survival at the end of three growing seasons was remarkably high (mean survival 54%). Most seedling mortality was due to sprout predation by rodents early the first spring in unprotected caches. Emergence and establishment at each site were significantly higher for seeds from the local population, supporting the idea of ecotypic differentiation in establishment strategy. Establishment success was an order of magnitude greater overall at the Colorado Plateau site, which represents the leading edge of an upward elevational shift in distribution for this species under the current climatic regime. The Mojave Desert site is on the trailing edge of this shift, and recruitment there is apparently a much less frequent occurrence.																	1385-0237						2005	178	2					171	187		10.1007/s11258-004-3038-x							WOS:000231804900004						
J	Geertsema, W				Geertsema, W			Spatial dynamics of plant species in an agricultural landscape in the Netherlands	PLANT ECOLOGY												This study examined the changes in distribution patterns of 13 herbaceous plant species from 1998 to 2000 in ditch banks along the edges of arable fields in the Netherlands. The objective was to test if spatial dynamics could be related to spatial isolation and disturbance of habitat and to the dispersal and seed bank characteristics of the species. Knowledge of these relations should be used to increase the effectivity of agri-environmental schemes aiming at an increase of botanical diversity. All species frequently colonized empty patches and populations in occupied patches frequently went extinct. Most colonization events occurred within 50 m of conspecific source patches in the preceding year, but colonization events in patches at distances more than 200 m from conspecific source patches were also observed. The colonization probabilities decreased with isolation distance. For nine species this relation was statistically significant, after correction for year and habitat. The extinction probabilities increased with isolation. For only four species this relation was statistically significant. Both colonization and extinction probabilities were more often statistically significant related to isolation for species with transient seed banks than species with persistent seed banks. Implications for management options aiming at survival of plant species in fragmented landscapes are discussed.																	1385-0237						2005	178	2					237	247		10.1007/s11258-004-4639-0							WOS:000231804900009						
J	Devlaeminck, R; Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M				Devlaeminck, R; Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M			Inflow of seeds through the forest edge: evidence from seed bank and vegetation patterns	PLANT ECOLOGY												To determine the influence of the proximity of a forest edge on seed bank composition and diversity, we performed a seed bank sampling at ancient deciduous forests bordering intensive arable fields. Also vegetation patterns were taken into account. We hypothised that forest edges may facilitate the entrance of diaspores of invasive species into the forest and the successive incorporation of these species in the forest seed bank. We noticed a substantial influence of the proximity of an edge on seed bank composition at as well the forested side of the edge as the field side. The forest edge zone was limited to 3 m into the forest and the field edge zone extended 3 m into the field. The seed bank samples of field and forest edge are characterised by a higher species diversity and seed density and a higher similarity between seed bank and vegetation, compared to field or forest samples. The forest edges contains fewer pioneer species in comparison with the forest interior and more competitive species and species of edges and clearings compared with field and forest samples. The seed longevity index increases towards the forest interior. We can conclude from our data that the forest and edge seed bank are composed by both seeds from recent dispersal processes and local seed set and by seeds originating from past vegetation on the site. Near the edge, actual seed input seems of primal importance. Further towards the forest interior seed input decreases and long-living seeds of past vegetation become more important. Ancient forest edges thus act as a barrier for seeds of species of the surrounding arable field.

J	Brandel, M; Schutz, W				Brandel, M; Schutz, W			Temperature effects on dormancy levels and germination in temperate forest sedges (Carex)	PLANT ECOLOGY												The effects of stratification temperatures and burial in soil on dormancy levels of Carex pendula L. and C. remota L., two spring-germinating perennials occurring in moist forests, were investigated. Seeds buried for 34 months outdoors, and seeds stratified in the laboratory at temperatures between 3 and 18 degrees C for periods between 2 and 28 weeks, were tested over a range of temperatures. Seeds of the two species responded similarly to stratification treatments, except for an absolute light requirement in C. pendula. Primary dormancy was alleviated at all stratification temperatures, but low temperatures were more effective than higher ones ( >= 12 degrees C). Dormancy induction in non-dormant seeds kept at 5 degrees C occurred when seeds were subsequently exposed to 18 degrees C. Dormancy was not induced by a transfer to lower temperatures. Buried seeds of both species exhibited seasonal dormancy cycles with high germination from autumn to spring and low germination during summer. Temperatures at which the processes of dormancy relief and of dormancy induction occurred, overlapped to a high degree. Whether, and when, dormancy changes occurred depended on test conditions. The lower temperature limit for germination (> 10%) was 9 degrees C in C. remota and 15 degrees C in C. pendula. Germination ceased abruptly above 36 degrees C. Germination requirements and dormancy patterns suggest regeneration from seed in late spring and summer at disturbed, open sites (forest gaps) and the capability to form long, persistent seed banks in both species.																	1385-0237						2005	176	2					245	261		10.1007/s11258-004-0117-y							WOS:000227779800010

Targets include the aims (i) to conserve 70% of the genetic diversity of socio-economically valuable species, (ii) to develop protocols for plant conservation and sustainable use and (iii) to conserve 60% of threatened species ex situ. These targets will require the development of advanced technologies including in vitro and cryopreservation methods, particularly for many tropical species. They also require the identification and conservation of socio-economically important species within indigenous floras as many of our threatened species have potential as horticultural species or are wild relatives of important cultivated species. At Griffith University, we are actively involved in research and international collaboration aimed at developing advanced conservation technologies for tropical species, including horticultural species and their wild relatives. Current research projects and consultancies involve collaborative research in the Asia-Pacific region and active involvement and funding from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Millennium Seed Bank Project. The extent of these collaborations is discussed as well as a proposal for an Asia-Pacific Centre of Excellence in alternative technologies for conservation of problem species.																	0567-7572		90-6605-127-2				2005		694					337	342		10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.694.56							WOS:000235235400056

Current recommendations for rehabilitation of open-cut coal mines in the Hunter Valley involve the sowing of exotic pasture species to reinstate mined land to Class IV and V under the Rural Land Capability System. Despite the importance of native grasses in the pre-mined landscape, they are currently not widely included in mine rehabilitation. To address this issue a project was conducted between 1994 and 2000 to research the use of native grasses for rehabilitation of open-cut coal mines in the Hunter Valley. This paper reports on 2 mine site experiments that aimed to assess establishment and persistence of a broad range of native and exotic grass species from an autumn sowing in both topsoil and raw spoil over a period of 61 months. The most promising natives in terms of early establishment, persistence and spread over time, included six C-3 accessions (five Austrodanthonia spp. and Austrostipa bigeniculata) and one C-4 accession (Cynodon dactylon). Persistence of these accessions was better in raw spoil than topsoil, despite initial low numbers, due to a lack of weed competition and their ability to spread by self-seeding. In topsoil, and in the absence of any biomass reduction, native species were mostly out-competed by vigorous exotic perennial grasses which were sown in these experiments and from seed influx from adjacent rehabilitation areas or from the soil seed bank. The effects of climatic conditions and differences in soil physical, chemical and seed bank characteristics at the 2 mine sites are also discussed.																	1036-9872						2005	27	2					73	88		10.1071/RJ05006							WOS:000233430700001						
J	Zeng, LW; Cocks, PS; Kailis, SG				Zeng, LW; Cocks, PS; Kailis, SG			Softening of impermeable seeds of six Mediterranean annual legumes on the soil surface and buried beneath the soil surface	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Softening of the hard seeds of six species of Mediterranean annual legumes (five clovers and one medic) was measured over two years on the soil surface (Expt 1) and over six months buried at depths of 0, 2 and 6 cm in the soil (Expt 2). Reverse logistic equations were used to estimate three parameters: hardseededness after exposure to field conditions, proportion of seeds that softened during field exposure and time taken for half of the seeds to soften. There were marked differences in the seed softening patterns of the six legumes. After two years on the soil surface (Expt 1), M. polymorpha L., had 49% of the original seed population still hard and was the hardest-seeded species. Of the clovers, T. spumosum L. (11%) and T. lappaceum L. (9%) were the hardest and T. subterraneum L. (0%) was the softest. More than 70% of the hard seeds of T. subterraneum L. softened in the first year compared with 37% of T. spumosum L. and M. polymorpha L.. Half of the seeds of T. subterraneum L. that softened in the first year did so within 51 days of exposure. In contrast, it took 163 days for T. lappaceum L. seeds to soften to the same stage, 150 days for T. clypeatum L. and 137 days for T. spumosum L.. Burial affected the softening of hard seeds of the six species differently. Five of the species softened least when buried at 6 cm, while the sixth (T. clypeatum L.) softened least on the soil surface. Softening of hard seeds of T. subterraneum L. was significantly less at 2 cm than it was at 0 cm. There was no difference in seeds of T. lappaceum L., T. glanduliferum L. and M. polymorpha L., while those T. spumosum L. and T. clypeatum L. softened more rapidly at 2 cm than they did at 0 cm. Time for half the seeds to soften was less affected by depth of burial than was the proportion of hard seeds softening. However, at 6 cm half of the seeds of T. subterraneum L. softened in 105 days after the experiment began compared with only 52 days on the soil surface. In contrast, the time for half of the seeds of T. spumosum L. to soften at 6 cm was 113 days compared with 132 days on the soil surface. The results reveal that residual hardseededness and the seasonal pattern of softening vary between seasons and are affected by environment. Species that soften late in the autumn are most likely to resist germination from out-of-season rains, while seed banks of those that soften early, such as T. subterraneum L., are likely to be threatened in these conditions. The contrasting effects of seed burial indicate that the environmental requirements for seed softening are likely to vary between species. For example, T. spumosum L., which responds to shallow burial, behaves very like some accessions of Ornithopus compressus, in which softening has been shown to be inhibited by light. The softening of all but one species is slower when buried at 6 cm, which suggests that their requirement for heat may not be met when insulated from the extremes of temperature.																	0251-0952						2005	33	3					551	561		10.15258/sst.2005.33.3.03							WOS:000233503300003

SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In order to evaluate the influence of temperature and storage atmosphere on storability of rye seeds (Secale cereale L.), a long-term storage experiment was performed in Gatersleben genebank and also in the seed bank of the Botanical Garden in Warsaw. Seeds of 5.5% moisture content were kept at -15, 0 and 10 degrees C in hermetically sealed glasses filled with air, CO2, N-2, and under vacuum. Germination tests were accomplished after 1, 5, 15, 17 and 26 years of storage. In addition, seed and seedling vigour traits were determinated for the material stored 26 years in Gatersleben. Mean analysis data showed that germinability and viability were highest at -15 degrees C followed by 10 degrees C and 0 degrees C, and also highest under vacuum and N2 as opposed to air and CO2. Respectively, for the seed vigour traits the temperature of -15 degrees C together with vacuum gave the best results. For the traits obtained from the investigation of seven days old seedlings again seeds stored at -15 degrees C gave the highest values for shoot dry weight, seedling dry weight, shoot length, root length, and seedling length. Considering the storage media CO2 gave significantly lower values compared to all other atmospheres.

J	La Peyre, MKG; Thom, CSB; Winslow, C; Caldwell, A; Nyman, JA				La Peyre, MKG; Thom, CSB; Winslow, C; Caldwell, A; Nyman, JA			Comparison of seed bank size and composition in fringing, restored, and impounded marsh in southwest Louisiana	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In coastal Louisiana many restoration projects are approved based on assumed regeneration of submerged aquatic species (SAV) in shallow marsh interior ponds. In this study, we estimated seed bank size and composition of shallow water areas in oligohaline fringing and restored (terraced) marsh, and a freshwater managed (impounded) marsh, located in Sabine NWR, LA, using the sieving method. For the same marshes, we also provided an estimate of the readily germinable fraction of the seed bank using the germination method. Sieving results indicated that restored marsh edges had very low seed densities (5034 seeds/m(2)) compared to fringing marsh (331,185 seeds/m(2)), although species composition was similar. Managed freshwater marsh ponds had more diverse seed banks and mid-range seed densities (80,500 seeds/m(2)). Viability estimates of dominant species in the seed bank reduced seed density estimates at all sites by as much as 10 fold (fringing marsh: 36,185 seedS/m(2); restored marsh: 859 seeds/m(2); managed marsh 44,388 seeds/m(2)) suggesting that a correction factor should be applied to future seed density estimates in this region. Seedling emergence was significantly higher in the managed marsh under drawdown conditions (> 2500 seedlings/m(2)) as compared to flooded conditions (< 500 seedlings/ m(2); ANOVA, p = 0.0001). Seedling emergence in oligohaline marsh was significantly affected by salinity and management (fringing, restored) (ANOVA, p = 0.0186). Fringing marsh at 0 g/L had the highest seedling emergence (> 500 seedlings/ m(2)). At higher salinities, fringing and restored marsh had similar emergence (< 150 seedlings/m(2)). Results indicate that recruitment is likely to be more successful under drawdown conditions, and in low salinity conditions. However, both a lack of SAV emergence in the germination experiment and a lack of SAV seeds in the seed banks using the sieving method suggest that reliance on seed banks for the restoration of shallow water areas in southwest Louisiana may prove unsuccessful.

J	Kobayashi, H; Oyanagi, A				Kobayashi, H; Oyanagi, A			Digitaria ciliaris seed banks in untilled and tilled soybean fields	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We gained an understanding of the vertical distribution and seasonal dynamics of Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.) Koeler seed banks in untilled and tilled soybeanfields using studies on naturally established seed banks and on seeds stored in the field. In untilled fields, D. ciliaris seeds were highly concentrated on or near the soil surface from late autumn to spring, whereas only a few seeds were found on the soil surface in the following summer. One year after tillage, there was a high concentration of the seeds on the soil surface. In the tilled fields, seeds were distributed uniformly throughout the soil profile and were present all year long, with only a few seeds found in the following summer. A study of seeds that were artificially buried or stored on the soil surface verified that D. ciliaris seeds were extremely short-lived in the field and could not form a large, persistent seed bank, even when the seeds were buried by tillage. Tillage contributes to suppression of D. ciliaris seedling emergence by reducing the number of seeds that are on or near the soil surface. Furthermore, D. ciliaris seeds showed a greater need for light in order to germinate throughout the year, even when they were stored on the soil surface. Particularly, light was critical for germination during summer. The light requirementfor germination should be one reason why viable D. ciliaris seeds on the soilsurface are carried over into the next season in untilled fields.																	1444-6162						2005	5	2					53	61		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2005.00156.x							WOS:000230442700003						
J	Blackshaw, RE; Moyer, JR; Harker, KN; Clayton, GW				Blackshaw, RE; Moyer, JR; Harker, KN; Clayton, GW			Integration of agronomic practices and herbicides for sustainable weed management in a zero-till barley field pea rotation	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Research is needed to develop more comprehensive integrated weed management systems that would facilitate greater adoption by farmers. A field study was conducted to determine the combined effects of seed date (April or May), seed rate (recommended or 150% of recommended), fertilizer timing (fall or spring applied), and in-crop herbicide rate (50 or 100% of recommended) on weed growth and crop yield. This factorial set of treatments was applied in four consecutive years within a barley-field pea-barley-field pea rotation in a zero-till production system. Both barley and field pea phases of the rotation were grown each year to account for variable environmental conditions over years. Weed biomass was often lower with May than with April seeding because of more weeds being controlled with preplant glyphosate. However, despite fewer weeds being present with May seeding, barley yield was only greater in 1 of 4 yr and field pea yield was actually lower with May than with April seeding in 3 of 4 yr, indicating that optimum seed date is highly dependent on crop species and environmental conditions. Higher crop seed rates reduced weed biomass and increased crop yield in 2 of 4 yr in each of barley and field pea.. Fertilizer timing had little effect on weed competition in barley, but spring- compared with fall-applied fertilizer reduced weed biomass and increased field pea yield in 2 of 4 yr. In-crop herbicides applied at 50% compared with 100% rates sometimes resulted in greater weed biomass and lower crop yields with recommended crop seed rates, but few differences were noted at high crop seed rates. Indeed, the weed seed bank at the conclusion of the 4-yr study was not greater with the 50% compared with 100% herbicide rate when high crop seed rates were used. This study demonstrates the combined merits of early seeding (April), higher crop seed rates, and spring-applied fertilizer in conjunction with timely but limited herbicide use to manage weeds and maintain high yields in rotations containing barley and field pea.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2005	19	1					190	196		10.1614/WT-04-128R							WOS:000227979800028						
J	Meyer, SE; Quinney, D; Weaver, J				Meyer, SE; Quinney, D; Weaver, J			A life history study of the Snake River plains endemic Lepidium papilliferum (Brassicaceae)	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Lepidium papilliferum is an ephemeral species that occupies "slick spot" microhabitats in the matrix of sagebrush steppe vegetation of the southwestern Snake River plains, Idaho, USA. We related population demographic data collected from 1993 to 1996 to on-site precipitation data on the Orchard Training Area west of Boise. We also carried out field seed-retrieval and in situ seed bank studies. We found that L. papilliferum has a dual life history strategy. A fraction of each cohort sets seed as summer annuals, while the remaining plants remain vegetative and potentially biennial. Surviving biennials flower and set seed along with the annual cohort of the following year. The switch to flowering as an annual appears to be based on threshold rosette size. Probability of survival to flowering was much lower for biennials than for annuals of the same cohort, but surviving biennials sometimes had enhanced seed production. The summer-dry environment of the Snake River plains combined with the slick spot habitat has apparently selected for a primarily summer annual life cycle for this species. Seeds were highly dormant at dispersal and were not responsive to dormancy-breaking cues. Those from a given cohort of L. papilliferum remained viable in the soil for at least 11 years. This persistent seed bank provides a buffer against extinction in sequences of years when seed production is low or absent. Estimated seed bank size varied from near zero for a heavily disturbed site that formerly supported the species to 18 viable seeds dm(-2) for an extant population in high-quality habitat. Management for population preservation for L. papilliferum should focus on protecting the seed bank from destruction caused by livestock trampling and other anthropogenic disturbances.																	1527-0904					JAN	2005	65	1					11	23									WOS:000226986200002						
J	Hosogi, D; Kameyama, A				Hosogi, D; Kameyama, A			Timing for the collection of topsoil from a deciduous forest for use as planting material in suburban Tokyo, Japan	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In Japan, government and ecological scientists recommend that indigenous species should be used in planting to maintain biodiversity. Using forest topsoil is an efficient planting strategy for indigenous species. We wanted to find the best time of year for collecting forest topsoil. We regularly collected topsoil throughout 1 year from a deciduous forest in suburban Tokyo. The soil seed bank composition was estimated by recording seedling emergences. Additionally, the seed rain, influence of predation to dispersed seeds. and seedling emergence at the forest floor were also estimated. The soil seed bank composition did not change greatly during the year studied; however, the buried seeds were abundant comparatively in January and April. Therefore, it was suggested whenever possible to collect forest topsoil as planting material. Additionally, we suggested that the best time to collect topsoil was from November to February. This was also supported by the results of seed rain and seedling emergences at the forest floor added to the result of the seed bank. A method of measuring the value of soil seed bank as a planting material was evaluated. An evaluation based on seed density of pioneer tree species was suitable for even small amounts of topsoil.

J	Pausas, JG; Ribeiro, E; Vallejo, R				Pausas, JG; Ribeiro, E; Vallejo, R			Post-fire regeneration variability of Pinus halepensis in the eastern Iberian Peninsula	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Post-fire regeneration of Pinus halepensis, the most abundant tree in the Mediterranean Basin, can vary largely. In the present work, we aim to study the parameters determining this variability in the eastern Iberian Peninsula. For this reason we sampled in 2002 the sapling pine density on 22 plots that burned in 1993 and 71 plots that burned in 1994. Pre-fire vegetation (tree density and basal area) were obtained from the Spanish Forest Inventory. The regeneration ranged from 0.006 to 20.4 pines/m(2) (mean = 1.24, S.D. = 3.22). The statistical analysis suggested that the most important variables explaining this variability were the amount of branches found on the forest floor (branches collapsed from burned trees or branches left by foresters), the aspect of the plot, the pre-fire basal area, and whether the slope was terraced or not. High regeneration was observed in forests with large amounts of branches on the floor (which create appropriate microclimatic conditions), with northern aspects, with high pre-fire basal area, and on terraced slopes. Furthermore, other water-related variables (annual precipitation and slope) also had some (although lower) importance. These results have direct implications for forest managers in the study area.

The grass-producing communities originating from former cereal crops have remained rich in floristic terms to the present day. The effects of different agricultural techniques on the seed population were analysed via soil samples, from which seedlings were identified and counted. Buried seed number, fluctuated between 6029 and 54,517 seeds m(-2) depending on the type of agricultural management. The intensively farmed, old meadows had less seed and fewer species than the extensively managed, more recent meadows. Cutting and slurry application seemed the most influential factors in the reduction of seed reserves. Taxa such as Potentifa sp., Veranica sp., and Plantago sp., were more abundant in extensive plots, while Urtica dioica, Juncus inflexus and Lamium purpureum were associated with more intensive agricultural managements. Management intensification significantly favoured plant species of nutrient rich conditions, and decreased numbers of pioneer, and nutrient poor conditions species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We surveyed seed banks and vegetation in 10 forest stands under similar abiotic conditions but submitted either to a coppice-with-standards treatment (n = 5) or to a selective- cutting system ( n = 5). We analyzed species composition and diversity, community ecological profile, and distribution of taxa among different life forms, strategy, morphology and functional type categories. A total of 2085 seedlings ( 8296 seeds m(-2)) germinated, corresponding to 28 species, among which Juncus effusus was the most abundant. Fifty-seven percent of the species were also recorded in the aboveground vegetation, the dominant species being Rubus fruticosus agg., but only 28% of the aboveground species were present in the seed bank. Our results suggest that ( 1) vernal geophytes and shade-tolerant perennials, which group most true forest species, are not incorporated in the seed bank, ( 2) parent plants of most seeds were present either in the stand in an earlier dynamic stage or apart from the stand and long-distance dispersed, ( 3) as expected, early-successional species are well represented in the seed bank, ( 4) forestry vehicles seem to be a major means of dispersion for stress-tolerant species normally found in forest lanes and wheel tracks. We conclude that seed banks contain species that have a potentially negative impact on the true forest flora and, thus, forest management should minimize soil disturbance and retain remnants of old-coppice woods to conserve disturbance-sensitive true forest species.																	0960-3115					DEC	2004	13	13					2485	2509		10.1023/B:BIOC.0000048454.08438.c6							WOS:000225178400006

Three populations of each species were monitored over 5 years near Osoyoos, British Columbia, at the northern range limit for C. lyallii and near the elevational limit for C. macrocarpus. On average, C. macrocarpus bulbs flowered less frequently but had higher fruit set and produced more seeds per capsule than C. lyallii bulbs. In C. lyallii, low fruit set was related primarily to premature abortion of buds and flowers, whereas the potentially higher seed production of C. macrocarpus was largely offset by deer herbivory. Prolonged bulb dormancy was common in both species, with up to 18% of C. lyallii and 26% of C. macro carpus bulbs dormant in a given population and year. Dormancy episodes typically lasted a single year, although episodes as long as 4 years were also recorded. In both species dormancy was synchronized across sites, implying that it was not a random occurrence within populations but a response to the same external factor(s). Population surveys involving geophytes should consider the possibility that the visible population is not necessarily indicative of actual population size, and that a population may still be extant even when no individuals are observed.

Seed densities were similar to those already reported for other deserts, but we found consistent differences in seed composition among microhabitats. Whereas grass seeds (e.g., Aristida, Pappophorum, Neobouteloua, Trichloris, Digitaria) prevailed in natural depressions of open areas, forb seeds (e.g., Phacelia, Lappula, Descurainia, Plantago, Chenopodium) were more abundant under trees. The comparison of seed production during primary dispersal (i.e., seed rain) with seed density on the ground at the end of dispersal indicated that most forb seeds entered the habitat through the micro habitats located beneath the canopy of trees and tall shrubs, and remained there after redistribution. Most grass seeds, by contrast, entered it through bare-soil and under-grass microhabitats, and reached more even distributions after secondary dispersal, especially because of dramatic losses in bare soil.

This call come about as a result of variation in the frequency, timing, or intensity of events such as frosts, rainfall, Soil disturbance. herbivore outbreak, or drought, as long as species exhibit niche differences in their responses to one or more of these factors. Here, I describe an experiment oil a community of >50 predominantly annual plant species. in which the timing of soil disturbance was varied experimentally over a 10-year period (1992-2001). Replicate plots were plowed once per year in October, March, or May, and disturbance timing had a marked impact on botanical composition front the outset. Following cultivation of all plots in fall 2002 or spring 2003, the effects of long-term cultivation timing oil biomass in July 2003 were significant for most species, and the effects were large (10-fold to 100-fold) for many species. Three guilds of species were apparent: fall germinators, spring germinators (seed, with a chilling requirement to break dormancy), and indifferent species (species germinating after disturbance, irrespective of timing). Some species were driven close to local extinction by annual Soil disturbance at the "wrong" time of yearn presumably their seed banks were small or rapidly depleted, and recruitment to their populations may have been more reliant oil the annual seed rain. Proof that temporal variability of disturbance is all important contributor to tong-term species coexistence requires a demographic approach showing both a storaga effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. This experiment represents a first step. by showing that different timings of disturbance call have large effects oil the biomass, frequency. and relative abundance of coexisting species.																	0012-9658					DEC	2004	85	12					3277	3288		10.1890/03-0804							WOS:000226297500010

These field studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of dazomet(tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione), a granular soil sterilant that breaks down in soil to release methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), for controlling the soil seed bank of annual bluegrass during turfgrass renovation. Field trials in Urbana, III., and West Lafayette, Ind., in Spring and Fall 2000 and 2001 evaluated dazomet rate from 0 to 504 kg.ha(-1) and soil preparation techniques to determine the most effective practices to reduce annual bluegrass reestablishment into a creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) seeding. The interval, in days, between dazomet application and creeping bentgrass planting was also examined to determine the optimal seeding time as measured by the level of annual bluegrass reestablishment. Spring trials generally gave poor results that were attributed to windy conditions resulting in rapid loss of MITC. The annual bluegrass soil seed bank was reduced 46% in spring trials compared to 78% in fall trials. Increasing dazomet rates reduced the absolute number of viable annual bluegrass seeds remaining in the soil. However, significant quantities of viable seed remained, regardless of dazomet rate. Annual bluegrass infested the renovated turf in all trials to varying degrees. Dazomet rates of 420 or 504 kg.ha(-1) yielded the lowest rates of annual bluegrass reestablishment. Trials conducted in the fall at these rates resulted in annual bluegrass cover of 1% to 20% in the resulting turf. Creeping bentgrass planted at 1 day after dazomet application had significantly less annual bluegrass than when seeded at 7 or 9 days after dazomet application. Dazomet is a tool that can help reestablish a new turf with lower levels of annual bluegrass. However, eradication of annual bluegrass with dazomet is not likely and environmental conditions will dramatically affect the success of the sterilization.																	0018-5345					DEC	2004	39	7					1763	1767		10.21273/HORTSCI.39.7.1763							WOS:000225210800055						
J	Bosque, C; Pacheco, MA; Garcia-Amado, MA				Bosque, C; Pacheco, MA; Garcia-Amado, MA			The annual cycle of Columbina, ground-doves in seasonal savannas of Venezuela	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												We studied the gonadal and molt cycle of three species of Columbina ground-doves in seasonal savannas of Venezuela to explore whether gonadal development is related to seasonal patterns of rainfall. The study site is a strongly seasonal, open woodland-savanna displaying a predictable alternation of dry and wet seasons, providing strong cues on environmental periodicity and on the variation in the level of food resources associated with those fluctuations. All three species of doves had an extensive breeding season, bred (although not exclusively) during the dry season, had fully functional testes independent of rainfall, and displayed a relatively small seasonal fluctuation in testes size. Nevertheless, even though all three species were exposed to similar ambient conditions and their diets overlapped extensively, there were noticeable differences in their testicular cycles, and no simple generalizations regarding the possible stimulatory roles of photoperiod or rainfall were apparent. The testes of most Scaled Doves (C squammata) remained fully or partly recrudesced throughout the year, but a significant reduction in testes size occurred in May, at the beginning of the rainy season, when the size of the soil seed bank should be smallest. Maximum testes sizes were reached from November through March during the beginning and peak of the dry season, when the seed bank is expected to be large. In this species, neither rainfall nor longer photoperiod had a stimulatory effect on testicular development. Ruddy Ground-Doves (C talpacoti) had an extensive, and seemingly double, breeding season encompassing the latter part of the dry season and the rainy season. Male C talpacoti had fully functional testes in the peak of the dry season, some three months ahead of the first rains. Hence, as in the Scaled Dove, the influence of rainfall on testicular development was not apparent, but testicular recrudescence coincided with the period of increasing day length and we cannot rule out a possible degree of photo responsiveness in Ruddy Ground-Doves. Males of Plain-breasted Ground-Doves (C minuta) underwent testicular regression in April and May, at the beginning of the rainy period, and testicular recrudescence progressed along with the advancement of the rainy season. In this species, rainfall, but not increasing photoperiod, could have a stimulatory effect on gonadal development, since testes became smaller as day length increased towards May, but testis size increased until November while days were becoming shorter. In none of the species was the molt of primary wing feathers synchronous, but in all of them there was a tendency not to molt primaries during the peak of the rainy season. At the level of the population, the periods of breeding and wing molt overlapped. The molt was spread over most of the year in all species. An unforeseen finding was a highly biased sex ratio in favor of males among adults in all species.

J	Cohen, S; Braham, R; Sanchez, F				Cohen, S; Braham, R; Sanchez, F			Seed bank viability in disturbed longleaf pine sites	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Some of the most species-rich areas and highest concentrations of threatened and endangered species in the southeastern United States are found in wet savanna and flatwood longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) communities. Where intensive forestry practices have eliminated much of the natural understory of the longleaf ecosystem, the potential for reestablishment through a seed bank may present a valuable restoration opportunity. Longleaf pine sites converted to loblolly pine plantations and non-disturbed longleaf sites on the Coastal Plain of North Carolina were examined for seed bank presence and diversity. Conducting vegetation surveys and examining the seed bank using the seedling emergence technique allowed for verification of the seed bank presence, as well as evaluation of the quality of the seed bank on disturbed longleaf pine sites. Forty-three species and over 1,000 individuals germinated, and the seed banks of both the disturbed and non-disturbed stand types contained species not noted in the vegetation survey. Although many of these species were considered weedy and typical of disturbance, numerous taxa were indicative of stable longleaf pine communities. This study confirms both the presence and quality of seed banks in highly disturbed former longleaf pine sites, suggesting that the seed bank may be an important tool in restoration efforts.																	1061-2971					DEC	2004	12	4					503	515		10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00382.x							WOS:000225713800005						
J	Siebentritt, MA; Ganf, GG; Walker, KF				Siebentritt, MA; Ganf, GG; Walker, KF			Effects of an enhanced flood on riparian plants of the River Murray, South Australia	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												In October 2000, the flow of the River Murray entering South Australia was increased from 32000 to 42050 ML day(-1) by release of water from an offstream reservoir, and a downstream weir was raised by 500 mm to impound the flood and enhance local floodplain inundation. The flood was maintained for about two weeks, although the duration of inundation was longer at low elevations on the floodplain. Vegetation at three sites was surveyed before and after the flood to examine the impact of inundation on the growth and germination of flood-tolerant, flood-dependent and flood-intolerant species. Among 32 recorded species, Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush, Chenopodiaceae), Sporobolus mitchellii (rats tail couch, Graminae) and Sarcocomia quinqueflora (samphire, Chenopodiaceae) accounted for nearly 82% of the total cover/abundance. Flood-tolerant and flood-dependent species (e.g. S. mitchellii) grew and germinated and flood-intolerant species (e.g. A. vesicaria) senesced. No aquatic plants germinated or established, despite favourable conditions, suggesting an impoverished seed bank or grazing. Based on the growth but lack of germination of flood-tolerant and flood-dependent species, the value of small, occasional interventions in environmental flow management may be to maintain existing communities rather than restore degraded ones.

J	Jiang, XD; Wang, GZ; Li, SJ				Jiang, XD; Wang, GZ; Li, SJ			Age, distribution and abundance of viable resting eggs of Acartia pacifica (Copepoda : Calanoida) in Xiamen Bay, China	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The distribution and abundance of viable resting eggs of copepod Acartia pacifica in Xiamen Bay, China, were determined in the laboratory by the presence of natiplii hatched from the sediments. Sediment cores to a depth of 30 cm, sliced at 1.0 cm intervals, showed that most viable resting eggs of A. pacifica Occurred near the sediment surface (0-5 cm.), and the number of viable eggs sharply decreased with depth of the sediment, although resting eggs remained viable as deep as 23 cm. Pb-210 analyses of the sediments indicated that the maximum age of viable eggs of A. pacifica was 20.5 years and the mean egg age was 4.3 years. The egg mortality of A. pacifica in the sediment was 0.1408 year(-1), or 85.92% annual egg survival, calculated by regressing ln(egg density) on the age of the sediment. The horizontal distribution of viable resting eggs ranged from 2.27 x 10(3) to 3.85 x 10(5) m(-2). with a mean value of 9.49 x 10(4) m(-2). Regressions between viable eggs of A. pacifica and all fine-fraction particle size classes (at 2 mum intervals) were not significant. The accumulation of viable resting eggs that can persist for an extended period of time provided evidence for the existence of an egg bank of A. pacifica in the seabed of Xiamen Bay.

J	Colbach, N; Molinari, N; Clermont-Dauphin, C				Colbach, N; Molinari, N; Clermont-Dauphin, C			Sensitivity analyses for a model simulating demography and genotype evolutions with time application to GENESYS modelling gene flow between rape seed varieties and volunteers	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Sensitivity of models to input variables and parameters should be analysed before evaluating and using them in order to identify (a) the minimum input data required for satisfactory simulations, (b) the major cultivation techniques to adapt when designing new cropping systems and (c) the main parameters to be estimated with special care. Conventional methods of sensitivity analysis being inadequate, a new method based on Monte Carlo simulations was developed in the present work. The analysed model was GENESYS which quantifies the effects of cropping system on demography and genotype of cropped and volunteer rape plants. The studied output variables were the proportion of harvested rape seeds polluted by unwanted genes and the density and herbicide sensitivity of rape volunteers in winter cereals. Sensitivity of the model to the initial seed bank was first tested by simulating rape evolution from initial seed banks resulting from various seed density, genotype, age and distribution. Then, the effect of cropping systems was studied by simulating rape evolution for 100 000 randomly chosen combinations of crop succession and cultivation techniques. The effect of the model parameters was finally analysed by simulating rape evolution in six contrasted cropping systems and 100 000 randomly chosen parameter values. At all steps, linear models were used to test the significance of seed bank, cropping system variables or parameters. If the number of variables was too large for directly applying a linear model, a segmentation tree was used first to eliminate negligible variables. The study showed that the seed bank influenced simulated output during 5-6 years, which is therefore the minimum duration for simulations with an unknown initial seed bank. A survey list of cropping system variables to determine was established for comparing simulated and observed output. Major variables such as crop succession must be known for at least 3 years preceding the analysed crop, minor variables such as the date of set-aside cutting only for the preceding year. The major model parameters were those determining seed movements and survival in soil and seedling emergence. Seedling survival parameters relative to inter- and intra-specific competition were significant only when analysing volunteer density. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cobbaert, D; Rochefort, L; Price, JS				Cobbaert, D; Rochefort, L; Price, JS			Experimental restoration of a fen plant community after peat mining	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Which restoration measures (introduction of donor diaspore material, application of straw mulch, alteration of residual peat depths) contribute to the establishment of a fen plant community on minerotrophic surfaces after peat mining? Location: Riviere-du-Loup peatland, southern Quebec, Canada at 100 m a.s.l. Methods: The effectiveness of introducing fen plants with the application of donor diaspore material was tested. The donor diaspore material. containing seeds, rhizomes, moss fragments, and other plant propagules, was collected from two different types of natural fens. We tested whether the application of straw mulch would increase fen species cover and biodiversity compared to control plots without straw mulch. Terrace levels of different peat depths (15 cm, 40 cm, and 56 cm) were created to test the effects of different environmental site conditions on the success of re-vegetation. Results: Applying donor seed bank from natural fens was found to significantly increase fen plant cover and richness after the two growing seasons. Straw mulch proved to significantly increase fen plant richness. The intermediate terrace level (40 cm) had the highest fen plant establishment. Compared to reference sites. the low terrace level (15 cm) was richer in base cations. whereas the high terrace level (56 cm) was much drier. Conclusions: The application of donor diaspore material was demonstrated as an effective technique for establishing vascular fen plants. Further rewetting measures are considered necessary at the restoration site to create a fen ecosystem rather than simply restoring some fen species.																	1402-2001					NOV	2004	7	2					209	220		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2004.tb00612.x							WOS:000225645800008

Location: Liminka Bay, W Finland, 25degrees21'70 N,64degrees51'90 E. Methods: We constructed a matrix population model based on colonization and disappearance events and patch size changes of A.fulva. Patches were divided into hydric and non-hydric zones according to proximity to the seashore and intensity of disturbance. Perturbation analyses were carried out in order to identify transitions critical for population growth. Seed bank and seed germination studies provided background information for the model design. Results: A. fulva patches observed in the more disturbed hydric zone (closest to the sea) increased in number, as did the total number of patches. However, the number of patches in the less disturbed non-hydric zone decreased. Conclusions: Short-term dynamics of the A.fulva population at Liminka Bay seem to be determined by environmental fluctuations. which cause annual variation in transition rates between patch size classes. The long-term dynamics are probably governed by initiation of primary succession by isostatic land uplift. Increased disturbance at the water's edge may promote persistence of A.fulva through reduced interspecific competition. Our results suggest that shoreline disturbance of the hydric zone is sufficient for maintaining a viable population. Competitive exclusion of A. fulva in the non-hydric zone may be delayed by management practices, such as mowing.

Location: Nature reserves in Flanders, Belgium. Methods: Epizoochory was studied by brushing plant seeds from the fur of 201 domesticated large herbivores (Galloway cattle. donkeys and horses), grazing in 27 Flemish nature reserves. Several herbivores were examined after transport between different nature reserves as part of the seasonal grazing system in Flanders, allowing detection of seed dispersal both within and between reserves. The seedling emergence method was used to identify the dispersed plant species. Results: In total. 6385 epizoochorous seeds from 75 species germinated, yet the real seed quantity was underestimated by the seedling emergence method. A wide variety of seed morphology. seed weights and plant heights was represented among the dispersed species. many of which had a transient seed bank. There was a gradual turnover in epizoochorous species composition in the course of the vegetation season, and seed dispersal occurred both within and between different nature reserves. Conclusions: Domesticated large herbivores, as models for wild mammals in the present and the past, are important dispersers of many plant species. Through seasonal grazing, the herbivores function as 'mobile link organisms', connecting isolated nature reserves through seed dispersal, possibly influencing vegetation development and long-term survival of plant populations. As such, large herbivores are important instruments in ecological restoration, especially in fragmented ecosystems.

Location: Twente. in the eastern part of The Netherlands. Methods: Success or failure of restoration measures has been assessed by comparing experimental plots with that in reference plots for (1) species richness, (2) re-establishment of endangered species and (3) species composition, including life forms and Red List species. In total 119 samples were taken in 42 permanent plots in fen meadows, small-sedge marshes, wet heathlands. and soft-water pools. Topsoil samples were analysed for pH. Ca. Mg. Na, K and Cation Exchange Capacity. Gradient analysis was carried out by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Results: Sod-cutting. in combination with re-wetting measures (infilling of ditches and drains), led to restoration of communities of soft-water pools and small sedge marshes within five years. This rapid recovery is probably related to the presence of persistent seed banks of the component species of these communities. Complete restoration of fen meadows took longer (10-15 yr). Apparently, many species of fen meadows have short-lived seed banks. Sod-cutting of a degraded wet heathland and a soft-water pool was only successful temporarily. probably as a consequence of low water tables. Conclusions: To prevent depletion of (persistent) soil seed banks. sod-cutting in nutrient-poor wetlands is not recommended in areas where the groundwater regime and the base status of the soil can not be restored to levels required by plant communities of wet heathlands.

A survey of microtopography within and around a remnant fragment of lakeshore vegetation revealed that, over a large range, the habitat is frequently inundated in spring under the current water regime, although it was rarely inundated under past water regimes. Analysis of the patterns of seedling emergence and establishment at microsites at various elevations revealed a significant negative correlation between number of inundation days and abundance or species-richness of seedlings that emerged in the spring. Most seedling deaths occurred when the study site was inundated. We suggest that regeneration failure caused by the artificial raising of the lake's water level is one of the principal mechanisms of the recent vegetational decline in the lake.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2004	19	6					613	623		10.1111/j.1440-1703.2004.00676.x							WOS:000225061300006

The influence of phosphorus fertilizer and mulch application during the preceding crop period, and that of seasonal grazing regimes applied the last 2 y of fallowing, were assessed on the composition of the seed stock. Ctenium elegans, Fimbristylis hispidula, Merremia pinnata and Phyllanthus pentandrus accounted together for 75% of extracted seeds, 72% of ex situ, and 62% of in situ seedlings. Mulch treatment was correlated with the first axis of the canonical correspondence analyses performed on the seedling datasets. Mulch and phosphorus fertilizer treatments held similar responses, as they both favoured the seed bank of erect dicotyledons such as P. pentandrus and Cassia mimosoides. On the whole, the effects of grazing remained modest compared with the residual effects of past crop management practices. However, seedling densities increased as a result of dry-season grazing, while the soil seed bank decreased with wet-season grazing. Grazing also reduced the spatial heterogeneity of the seed bank rather than the overall number of species.

Soil samples were collected from burned and unburned portions of the forest using quadrants 15 x 15 cm and 9 cm deep; laid along line transects. Forest recovery was also monitored on burned sites using permanent plots of 0.1 ha. One hundred fifty-five seedlings germinated from the soil samples, of which 140 and 15 were from the unburned and burned sites, respectively. The proportion of woody species found on the unburned site was 47%, while on the burned site only one woody species was recorded. Overall mean densities were 621+/-15 and 66+/-2 seeds per m(2) on the unburned and burned sites; respectively. The greatest diversity was found in the upper soil layer, followed by the middle; litter, and lower soil layers collected from the unburned site. Eighteen months after the fire, the. burned site was covered with 32 species of dense vegetation, which attained a height of 3.5 m: Our results revealed that although the fire exhausted the soil seed bank, the vegetation could regenerate quickly with pioneer species, which differed in composition from the neighboring unburned stand. This implies that most species in Harenna Forest are sensitive to fire and could be eliminated easily from the area unless they are properly protected. Therefore, an appropriate management plan should be developed and implemented for the remaining forest, including protection from fire.																	0276-4741	1994-7151				NOV	2004	24	4					354	361		10.1659/0276-4741(2004)024[0354:TIOFOT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000225774200014

In highly variable environments the future of the lineage can be secured by spreading the risk, for example, by producing descendants that differ in their timing of emergence. Counter to this, in predictable environments a single "best-adapted" phenotype is expected. We asked whether ectoparasitic Argulus coregoni egg hatching pattern can be explained as a genetically canalized individual trait; an instance of phenotypic plasticity or bet-hedging. We collected egg clutches laid by individual A. coregoni females in early and late reproductive period of the lice population and randomized the clutches within 3 treatments. Intra- and inter-clutch variability in the hatching dynamics of A. coregoni eggs was monitored and the reproductive potential assessed. On average A. coregoni females laid 317 (SD+/-176.6) eggs. We found that the plasticity in the hatching dynamics among A. coregoni eggs was remarkable. Noticeable peaks in hatching were followed each of the repeated artificial "winter treatments" in 1degreesC. Repeated 2 weeks cold treatments induced relatively bigger hatching peaks than 2 days cold treatments compared to controls at room temperature. However, in all treatments, egg clutches hatched through an extended period of 7 months on average and the total hatching percentages were similar. We found that intra-clutch variability in hatching among eggs laid by single A. coregoni females was greater than inter-clutch variability. Our data support the predictions of the adaptive bet-hedging strategy in relation to egg-hatching dynamics. Response to cooling and bet-hedging may be adaptive for such species like A. coregoni since by synchronizing the life-cycle with the seasonal environment will assist transmission and parasite fitness.																	0030-1299	1600-0706				NOV	2004	107	2					295	302		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13213.x							WOS:000223863100008

One function is considered to be the adhesion of the seed to sand particles during dew which protects from predation by ants. We have questioned whether the germinating embryo could utilize this pellicle as a nutrient source in the poor desert soil. Embryo extracts from dry imbibing and germinating seeds were assayed for a number of specific endo-glycosylase and exo-glycosylase activities and for the ability of these enzymes to degrade preparations of isolated pellicle. No evidence was found for any enzymic cleavage or hydrolysis of the pellicle or for any products to be available for utilization during germination of the seeds. Of commercial enzymes tested only polygalacturonase released reducing sugars from pellicle preparations after long incubation times indicating the high level of resistance of pellicle to enzymic cleavage. Comparisons of the water holding capacity of seeds with or minus their pellicles showed that periods of hydration were extended after dew deposition if pellicle was present. We suggest that a value of pellicle at low water availability is the provision of an enhanced opportunity for metabolic events in the embryo including those of DNA repair, the maintenance of genomic integrity and sustained viability in the seed bank.				huang, zhenying/C-5969-2015													0931-1890	1432-2285				NOV	2004	18	6					669	676		10.1007/s00468-004-0349-4							WOS:000224755300007						
J	Wiles, L; Brodahl, M				Wiles, L; Brodahl, M			Exploratory data analysis to identify factors influencing spatial distributions of weed seed banks	WEED SCIENCE												Comparing distributions among fields, species, and management practices will help us understand the spatial dynamics of weed seed banks, but analyzing observational data requires nontraditional statistical methods. We used cluster analysis and classification and regression tree analysis (CART) to investigate factors that influence spatial distributions of seed banks. CART is a method for developing predictive models, but it is also used to explain variation in a response variable from a set of possible explanatory variables. With cluster analysis, we identified patterns of variation with direction of the distance over which seed bank density was correlated (range of spatial dependence) with single-species seed banks in corn. Then we predicted patterns of the seed banks with CART using field and species characteristics and seed bank density as explanatory variables. Patterns differed by magnitude of variation in the range of spatial dependence (strength of anisotropy) and direction of the maximum range. Density and type of irrigation explained the most variation in pattern. Long ranges were associated with large seed banks and stronger anisotropy with furrow than center pivot irrigation. Pattern was also explained by seed size and longevity, characteristics for natural dispersal, species, soil texture, and whether the weed was a grass or broadleaf, Significance of these factors depended on density or type of irrigation, and some patterns were predicted for more than one combination of factors. Dispersal was identified as a primary process of spatial dynamics and pattern varied for seed spread by tillage, wind, or natural dispersal. However, demographic characteristics and density were more important in this research than in previous research. Impact of these factors may have been clearer because interactions were modeled. Lack of data will be the greatest obstacle to using comparative studies and CART to understand the spatial dynamics of weed seed banks.																	0043-1745					NOV-DEC	2004	52	6					936	947		10.1614/WS-03-068R							WOS:000225150300005						
J	Rasheed, MA				Rasheed, MA			Recovery and succession in a multi-species tropical seagrass meadow following experimental disturbance: the role of sexual and asexual reproduction	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Recolonisation and succession in a multi-species tropical seagrass meadow was examined by creating gaps (50 x 50 cm) in the meadow and manipulating the supply of sexual and asexual propagules. Measurements of leaf shoot density and estimates of above-ground biomass were conducted monthly to measure recovery of gaps between September 1995 and November 1997. Measurements of the seeds stored in the sediment (seed bank) and horizontal rhizome growth of colonising species were also conducted to determine their role in the recovery process. Asexual colonisation through horizontal rhizome growth from the surrounding meadow was the main mechanism for colonisation of gaps created in the meadow. The seed bank played no role in recolonisation of cleared plots. Total shoot density and above-ground biomass (all species pooled) of cleared plots recovered asexually to the level of the undisturbed controls in 10 and 7 months, respectively. There was some sexual recruitment into cleared plots where asexual colonisation was prevented but seagrass abundance (shoot density and biomass) did not reach the level of unmanipulated controls. Seagrass species did not appear to form seed banks despite some species being capable of producing long-lived seeds. The species composition of cleared plots remained different to the undisturbed controls throughout the 26-month experiment. Syringodium isoetifolium was a rapid asexual coloniser of disturbed plots and remained at higher abundances than in the control treatments for the duration of the study. S. isoetifolium had the fastest horizontal rhizome growth of species asexually colonising cleared plots (6.9 min day(-1)). Halophila ovalis was the most successful sexual coloniser but was displaced by asexually colonising species. H. ovalis was the only species observed to produce fruits during the study. Small disturbances in the meadow led to long-term (>2 years) changes in community composition. This study demonstrated that succession in tropical seagrass communities was not a deterministic process. Variations in recovery observed for different tropical seagrass communities highlighted the importance of understanding life history characteristics of species within individual communities to effectively predict their response to disturbance. A reproductive strategy involving clonal growth and production of long-lived, locally dispersed seeds is suggested which may provide an evolutionary advantage to plants growing in tropical environments subject to temporally unpredictable major disturbances such as cyclones.

J	Furedi, M; McGraw, JB				Furedi, M; McGraw, JB			White-tailed deer: Dispersers or predators of American ginseng seeds?	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												As a result of game management practices and alterations in habitat, white-tailed deer populations (Odocoileus virginianus Z.) have increased to all time highs within the last century. Large herd numbers are having negative impacts at multiple levels in forest ecosystems, although there are many aspects that have not yet been investigated. One of the least understood impacts is the effect of deer browsing on the fate of valuable harvested understory species such as American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.). The objectives of this study were to quantify the natural frequency at which fruit-bearing ginseng plants are browsed by deer, to determine the amount of ginseng seeds consumed by deer and with feeding trials, to determine if white-tailed deer are seed dispersers or seed predators of American ginseng. Our results showed that fruits are frequently browsed in natural populations and that browsed seeds are most likely destroyed during the digestive process. The loss of ginseng seeds to deer browsing can negatively impact the seed bank and ultimately affect long term population growth and viability. Although white-tailed deer and American ginseng are managed species, effective growth of deer populations is adversely affecting ginseng, as well as other valuable forest species.																	0003-0031					OCT	2004	152	2					268	276		10.1674/0003-0031(2004)152[0268:WDDOPO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000224402500007						
J	Figueroa, JA; Teillier, S; Jaksic, FM				Figueroa, JA; Teillier, S; Jaksic, FM			Composition, size and dynamics of the seed bank in a mediterranean shrubland of Chile	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Analysis was performed of the richness and abundance of woody species, forbs, and annual grasses in the easily germinating soil seed bank (henceforth seed bank) in a mediterranean shrubland of central Chile. The effects of successional development after fire and by microsite type (underneath or outside shrubs) on the density of seeds in the soil, and the relationship of species abundance in the seed bank with its abundance in the aboveground vegetation was examined. A total of 64 plant species were recorded in the seed bank, of which 44 were annual or biannual. Eight species were woody and another eight were perennial herbs. Four could not be identified to species level. The highest richness of established herbaceous species was recorded in late spring, with 31 species. The regeneration of the herbaceous vegetation was driven by the annual production of seeds and by a reserve of short-lived propagules in the soil. Density of all germinating seeds was significantly higher during late spring and late summer. Density of grass seeds was greater during late spring, while that of all other species was greater during late summer. Annual grass seeds accumulated in higher proportion at exposed microsites rather than under woody canopy, and in young (< 5 years old) and intermediate-age patches (10-20 years old) rather than in mature vegetation (30-50 years old). The abundance of established woody and herb species was uncorrelated with that of the seed bank.

J	Jones, FE; Esler, KJ				Jones, FE; Esler, KJ			Relationship between soil-stored seed banks and degradation in eastern Nama Karoo rangelands (South Africa)	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Landscape, local scale and seasonal composition of soil-stored seed banks of a southern African semi-arid rangeland (Nama Karoo) were investigated through assessment of seed germinated from field-collected soil. Variables included percentage above-ground canopy cover, numbers of seeds germinated, and selected physical and chemical soil characteristics. Organic matter content of soil sampled from under plant canopies (closed-canopy) is significantly higher than that of intercanopy samples (open-canopy). Significantly more seeds germinated from closed-canopy soil samples are compared with those from open-canopy microsites. It is argued that reduction in rangeland canopy cover due to overgrazing ( and resultant erosion through wind and water movement) leads to reduced seed retention by the leaf litter layer and thus by the soil. This degraded resource appears to have gradually lost an inherent 'buffer capacity', undermining attempts at ecological restoration and necessitating concerted and directed efforts to restore these fragile systems.

Here we combined weed control and restoration treatments into an integrated land management strategy (ILMS) to provide a more sympathetic approach than previous prescriptions. We applied the following treatments in factorial combination to a Molinia-dominated moorland in the Yorkshire Dales: grazing (ESA prescription level versus no grazing), cutting (0, 1, 2 and 3 cuts), +/-application of a graminicide and +/-Calluna brash addition. The response of the vegetation was assessed for four years. These data were analyzed using a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis of variance based on constrained ordinations but combined with bivariate standard deviational ellipses. This combined approach was extremely useful in identifying trends in this complex dataset. The only treatment that had consistent effects in the univariate analysis of variance was cutting, where there was increased bare ground, reduced vegetation height, increased species diversity and reduced Molinia cover. Cutting three times had the greatest effect, maintaining a reduced Molinia cover over four years. The multivariate analysis showed that there were important community level interactions. Grazing generally produced vegetation which had a greater moorland species complement. Where grazing was restricted the vegetation had a greater component of Molinia and other acid grassland species. The most effective treatment was the grazed plots, cut thrice, which maintained a low Molinia cover for longest and had less variation in moorland species in the fourth year. Graminicide and brash application had marginal effects on species composition, but the best plots were those given herbicide alone, or in combination with brash addition. These results contrast with other studies, where non-selective herbicide treatment and Calluna addition were required to obtain Molinia control and Calluna regeneration. However, great variation has been found between sites, and managers should be prepared to tailor ILMS for their own site. This is likely to require a knowledge of the initial floristic composition, seed banks and experimentation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, P				Lee, P			The impact of burn intensity from wildfires on seed and vegetative banks, and emergent understory in aspen-dominated boreal forests	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												This paper compares seed and vegetative banks, and the emergent understory in unburned, lightly burned, and intensely burned patches within an aspen-dominated boreal forest in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Propagule banks were measured immediately after the fire, while the understory was surveyed 2 years later. Seedling and shoot emergence techniques were used to assess the abundance and assemblage of species within seed and vegetative banks. Median seed density was ordered unburned > lightly burned = intensely burned patches. A cumulative index of vegetative bank abundance was ordered unburned > lightly burned > intensely burned patches. Species assemblages were significantly different amongst burn intensities for seed banks and emergent understory. Vegetative bank assemblages were significantly different between unburned and burned patches but not between lightly and intensely burned patches. Furthermore, seed and vegetative bank assemblages within each burn intensity were also significantly different. Indicator species analysis suggested that all significant differences were due largely to broad assemblage differences rather than a few unique species. Ordination with nonmetric multidimensional scaling correspondence analysis separated seed and vegetative banks, and emergent understory along two axes (88.8% of the total variation). The first axis (50.3% of the total variation) indicated that the unburned and lightly burned species assemblages were more similar to the vegetative bank, while the intensely burned patches were more similar to the seed bank. The second axis (38.5% of the total variation) placed vegetative banks closer to emergent vegetation than seed banks.																	0008-4026					OCT	2004	82	10					1468	1480		10.1139/B04-108							WOS:000225057200007						
J	Laskurain, NA; Escudero, A; Olano, JM; Loidi, J				Laskurain, NA; Escudero, A; Olano, JM; Loidi, J			Seedling dynamics of shrubs in a fully closed temperate forest: greater than expected	ECOGRAPHY												Shrub seedling emergences were studied in a beech-birch forest in the Basque Country (Spain). During four years (1998-2001) all emerging shrubs were tagged and regularly monitored in 198 1 m(2) plots. Seedling emergence was intense during the entire study period and primarily occurred in early spring. Emerging seedlings mainly belonged to Hedera helix, Rubus gr. glandulosus and several heath species (including genera Erica, Calluna and Daboecia). In contrast, some dominant species components of the shrub layer (Vaccinium myrtillus and Lonicera periclymenum) showed no emergences. While small seeded species (heath species and Rubus) showed clear microsite preferences, avoiding litter for emergence, that was not the case of large seeded Hedera helix. Strict microsite requirements appear clearly associated with having seed bank, suggesting that this trait may allow these species to select favourable microenvironment prior to germination. Average life varied largely among the different taxa. It was very low for Rubus (7.4 months) and heath (4.9), and high for Hedera seedlings (23.1). Final survival was extremely low in the case of small-seeded species. Survival of Hedera seedlings was high, although their growth was very low, suggesting the existence of a conspicuous seedling bank. Our results clearly show that several shrubs species have dramatic seedling dynamics in full closed forest stands. Small seeded species preferentially emerge on bare surfaces in early spring from the soil seed banks. On the other hand, Hedera seedlings are able to emerge on litter and maintain a conspicuous seedling bank based on an efficient dispersal capability.

J	Holl, KD; Crone, EE				Holl, KD; Crone, EE			Applicability of landscape and island biogeography theory to restoration of riparian understorey plants	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Ecosystem recovery is influenced by processes at different spatial scales, yet land managers lack specific predictions on the relative importance of such processes that might guide management decisions. We tested whether ideas from landscape ecology (local vs. landscape scales) and island biogeography theory (patch size and isolation) predict restoration success for understorey plant communities in a highly fragmented riparian landscape, in an effort to provide guidance on how to allocate scarce restoration resources. 2. We sampled naturally colonizing riparian forest understorey plant communities in 15 riparian forests restored by planting native woody species along a 150-km stretch of the Sacramento River in central California. We analysed native and exotic understorey species richness and cover as a function of biotic and abiotic local and landscape variables. 3. Cover and species richness of exotic understorey plants decreased strongly with increasing overstorey cover, and were lower in quadrats closer to river base flow. 4. Native understorey species richness and cover were negatively related to exotic cover and positively related to connectivity with remnant forest. Cover of native wind-dispersed species was best explained by higher percentage forest cover surrounding a site within a 1000-m buffer, whereas cover of native water-dispersed species was higher closer to the river. 5. Neither patch size nor time since restoration explained a significant amount of native or exotic species richness or cover. 6. Synthesis and applications. Local factors explained more of the variance in understorey plant communities, but much of the variance remained unexplained. Our results provide weak support for the predictions of island biogeography theory and the importance of landscape-scale variables. These theories did not have strong predictive power in this applied restoration context at this temporal scale. Given limited resources, efforts to restore understorey plant communities in this highly fragmented system should focus on local-scale restoration methodologies, such as increasing cover of native overstorey species and reducing cover of exotic plants.

J	Bai, WM; Bao, XM; Li, LH				Bai, WM; Bao, XM; Li, LH			Effects of Agriophyllum squarrosum seed banks on its colonization in a moving sand dune in Hunshandake Sand Land of China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A field study was conducted in a moving sand dune to detect the effects of different positions of the dune and the burial depth on seed number, germination rates of Agriophyllum squarrosum in the soil seed banks and its colonization during natural succession processes. The results showed that wind and the movement of sand played an important role in the colonization of A. squarrosum seed banks. The positions of sand dune and burial depth significantly affected the number of seeds in soil seed banks. The number of seeds was more abundant at the top of the dune and windward slope than at leeward slope, and it reached a maximum at the 10-20 cm depth. The number of seeds was fewer at leeward, and decreased with increasing burial depth. However, there was no significant difference in the germination rates of seeds among positions of the sand dune. Therefore, the plant density at the windward slope and tops was higher than that at leeward. Our results suggested that the seeds of A. squarrosum were more likely to be deposited at the dune tops and windward slopes than at leeward, and thus to form larger seed banks. At the sand dune tops and the windward slope, the seed number at 10-20 cm depth was much greater than at 0-5 and 5-10 cm burial depths. However, the germination rate of seeds at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths were significantly higher than that at 10-20 cm depth. The results indicated that it was the germination rate at the top 0-5 and 5-10 cm, rather than the total number at the 10-20 cm that determined the observed higher density of A. squarrosum at the dune tops and the windward.

JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To study the effects of the degree of fragmentation of heathland patches on their species richness and species composition, and to infer the ecological mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Location The heathland patches of the north-western part of Flanders, Belgium. During the last 200 years, the heathland area in this study area has been reduced from c. 10,000 to c. 40 ha, yielding c. 150 small and highly isolated relic fragments. Methods Different isolation measures were calculated for each of the 153 inventoried heathland patches. The influence of isolation, area and habitat diversity on species richness was investigated using correlation techniques. Community composition of the patches was tested for nestedness, and the mechanisms potentially underlying this pattern were determined. Results and main conclusions Both the analyses at the species richness and community composition level yielded evidence for a positive species-area relation. This relation was not caused by higher habitat heterogeneity in larger patches. Patch isolation, measured in different ways, however seemed much more important in explaining species richness and community composition than fragment area. Our results indicate that area effects are overcompensated by the rescue-effect: if a patch is close to other patches, species can disperse between them and prevent the species from going extinct. Species having a short living seed bank were also more sensitive to isolation than species with a long living seed bank, indicating that the latter most probably depend on the seed bank to survive periods when environmental conditions are harsh. Analogously to the spatial rescue-effect, the existence of a persistent seed bank may lead to a sort of temporal rescue-effect, where the extinction of a plant species is prevented through survival in the seed bank of a patch.

How does the soil seed bank influence recovery of the standing vegetation in the mature forest and tree-fall gaps? Location: 1800 - 2020 m a.s.l., Quercus-Pinus forest, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Methods: Seed size, species composition and germination were estimated under different environmental conditions during dry and rainy seasons: a mature forest plot and gaps created by dead standing trees, snapped-off trees and uprooted trees. The soil seed bank was investigated using direct propagule emergence under laboratory conditions, from soil cores obtained during both seasons. Results: 21 species, 20 genera and 14 families constitute the seed bank of this forest community. Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae and Lamiaceae were the most frequently represented families in the seed bank. Floristic composition and species richness varied according to the different modes of tree death. Species composition of seed banks and standing vegetation had very low similarity coefficients and were statistically different. Seed bank sizes varied between 164 and 362 ind.m(-2) in the mature forest plot for the dry and rainy seasons, respectively, while soil seed bank sizes for gaps ranged between 23-208 ind.m(-2) for the dry season and between 81-282 ind.m(-2) for the rainy season. Conclusions: Seed bank sizes and germination response were always higher in the rainy season under all the environmental conditions analysed. Results suggest that timing responses to gap formation of the soil seed bank could be more delayed in this temperate forest than expected.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				OCT	2004	15	5					661	668		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2004.tb02308.x							WOS:000224638600009

High throughput transformation by knockout or other gene manipulation strategies to generate large numbers of transgenic Populus for functional elucidation of the estimated 36 000 genes will soon follow. The efficacy of large-scale transformation approaches for advancing Populus genomics will ultimately depend on the availability of properly maintained transgenic germ lines for distribution. The Arabidopsis community has already demonstrated the value of shared genetic resources, especially mutant and transgenic seed stocks, in functional genomics research. Seed bank will not work for the Populus research community. Instead, a stock distribution center for transgenic Populus research will have to be based on long-term preservation of clonal germplasm. This review presents recent progress in applying cryogenic techniques for clonal preservation of long-lived trees and discusses the challenges facing Populus molecular geneticists in germplasm preservation.

Although generalizations on urban weeds cannot easily be drawn on account of the wide range of microenvironments, anemochoric dissemination mechanisms (Asteraceae), resilience (grasses) and perennation are of particular importance. The reasons underlying the undesirability of weeds in the urban environment are investigated. Not only are weeds considered unsightly, but they may also give rise to 'functional' obstacles, damaging sidewalks or clogging storm drains. Furthermore, they may adversely affect human health by releasing allergenic pollen into the atmosphere. Management of urban weeds is based almost exclusively on mechanical control, as chemical measures may involve a toxicity risk for man. Paradoxically, certain weeds species may however have a positive effect if they are linked to fauna (butterflies, birds, etc.) considered to give a favourable impression in the cityscape. Finally, the possibility of favouring the biodiversity of the urban ecosystem by introducing some wildflowers typically associated with the degree of biodiversity of the surrounding environment is discussed.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				OCT	2004	44	5					341	354		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2004.00410.x							WOS:000223816200001

Picloram has been applied to rosettes in fall or spring, but new infestations of yellow starthistle are often discovered when plants are more noticeable in bud or flower stages. Eradication, containment, and revegetation are facilitated if weed seed rain can be stopped. This study evaluated whether registered rates (0.14, 0.28, and 0.42 kg ae/ha) of picloram, alone and with 2,4-D at 1.12 kg ae/ha, can prevent seed production when applied to yellow starthistle at bud or flower stage. Picloram applied at bud stage curtailed both seed production and germination, reducing seed production by 42 to 86% and viability by 80 to 99%. Neither the picloram rate nor the addition of 2,4-D to the spray solution affected the percentage of nonviable seeds. The addition of 2,4-D further decreased germination of developed seeds only at the lowest picloram rate. At flower stage, picloram and 2,4-D neither killed mature plants nor consistently reduced the quantity and quality (viability) of seeds. Bud stage was the phenological limit for effective reduction of viable seed by picloram, which caused both bud abortion and lower seed germination.																	0890-037X					OCT-DEC	2004	18	4					1065	1071		10.1614/WT-03-240R							WOS:000226339900027						
J	Doyle, P; Stypa, M				Doyle, P; Stypa, M			Reduced herbicide rates - A Canadian perspective	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Identification of the appropriate use rate is a critical first step in the herbicide development process because use rates affect product utility, market value, and the various risk assessments within the regulatory review process prior to registration. For a given herbicide to be commercially successful, it must provide consistent and sustained efficacy based on a use rate structure that meets customer requirements over a wide range of conditions. Recently, recommendations have been made that advocate the use of herbicide use rates below those outlined on registered product label text. Such advice tends to be based on field work and predictive models designed to identify specific conditions where reduced herbicide use rates are theoretically optimized as dictated by threshold values with assumed levels of commercially acceptable weed control. Unfortunately, many other studies indicate that the use of reduced herbicide rates is not without variability of herbicide efficacy and economic risk. Consequently, reduced use rate theories and related predictive models are often of limited practical value to growers. Aside from inconsistent performance, weed control strategies based on reduced herbicide use rates are not a solution to prevent or even delay target site resistance. In fact, prolonged use of sublethal use rates may select for metabolic resistance and add future weed management challenges by replenishing the weed seed bank. Much effort in terms of development time and resources are invested before product commercialization to ensure that product labels are easily understood and provide value to growers. In this regard, every effort is made to identify the lowest effective use rate that will consistently control target weeds and lead to economic optimization for both the grower and manufacturer.																	0890-037X					OCT-DEC	2004	18	4					1157	1165		10.1614/WT-04-050R2							WOS:000226339900040						
J	Harper, KT; Van Buren, R				Harper, KT; Van Buren, R			Dynamics of a dwarf bear-poppy (Arctomecon humilis) population over a sixteen-year period	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												A population of the dwarf bear-poppy (Arctomecon humilis Coville, Papaveraceae) at Red Bluff Washington County, Utah, was monitored twice annually between 1987 and 2002. This is a narrowly endemic, gypsophilous species that has been formally listed as endangered since 1979. During the 16 years of observation, density of this species has fluctuated between 3 and 1336 individuals on the 0.07-ha monitoring plot. Moderate to large recruitments of seedlings occurred in 1992, 1995, and 2001. Seedling recruitments front a large, long-lived seed bank are triggered by, abundant precipitation during the February-April period. At least 5.0 cm of rainfall is required during that interval to produce any seedlings. Seedlings experienced considerable mortality in the 1st few months of life in all observed cases. The average seedling initiated in the very large recruitment event of 1992 survived for only 2.6 years. Seedlings in that cohort that were alive 1 year after germination had an average longevity of 4.6 years. None of the seedlings that emerged in 1992 were still alive in October 2002. Mortality in this species was poorly correlated with fluctuations in precipitation or temperature. No epidemics of parasites or herbivores were observed. Mortality in the species appears to be caused by a variety of factors acting over a cohort's lifetime.																	1527-0904					OCT	2004	64	4					482	491									WOS:000224952700008						
J	Rengefors, K; Gustafsson, S; Stahl-Delbanco, A				Rengefors, K; Gustafsson, S; Stahl-Delbanco, A			Factors regulating the recruitment of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic phytoplankton from littoral and profundal sediments	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Many phytoplankton species produce resting cysts, forming 'seed banks' on lake sediments until they germinate and provide inocula (recruitment) for future pelagic populations. We have addressed the question of whether the littoral or the profundal zone provides the inoculum for planktonic populations in a eutrophic and dimictic lake (Lake Erken, Sweden). Our hypotheses were that high temperature, light, and sediment mixing would enhance recruitment. Also, we hypothesized that recruitment from littoral sediments would be greater than from profundal sediments. In situ recruitment traps were utilized to compare littoral and profundal recruitment, while laboratory experiments were performed to analyze which factors were most important. Seven common taxa were investigated: Asterionella formosa (Bacillariophyceae), Ceratium hirundinella (Dinophyceae), Microcystis botrys, M. wesenbergii, Anabaena sp., A. solitaria, and A. lemmermannii (Cyanobacteria). Our main findings were that light and sediment mixing were the most important factors in triggering and enhancing recruitment in the laboratory. Temperature and sediment origin (littoral/profundal) had a significant effect on recruitment only for A. lemmermannii and C. hirundinella, respectively. The field experiments showed that recruitment at the littoral site was much higher than at the profundal site, where little or no recruitment occurred. Together, these results strongly suggest that littoral sediments in temperate lakes provide inocula for most phytoplankton populations, likely due to favorable light conditions and high sediment mixing.

J	Levine, JM; Rees, M				Levine, JM; Rees, M			Effects of temporal variability on rare plant persistence in annual systems	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Traditional conservation biology regards environmental fluctuations as detrimental to persistence, reducing long-term average growth rates and increasing the probability of extinction. By contrast, coexistence models from community ecology suggest that for species with dormancy, environmental fluctuations may be essential for persistence in competitive communities. We used models based on California grasslands to examine the influence of interannual fluctuations in the environment on the persistence of rare forbs competing with exotic grasses. Despite grasses and forbs independently possessing high fecundity in the same types of years, interspecific differences in germination biology and dormancy caused the rare forb to benefit from variation in the environment. Owing to the buildup of grass competitors, consecutive favorable years proved highly detrimental to forb persistence. Consequently, negative temporal autocorrelation, a low probability of a favorable year, and high variation in year quality all benefited the forb. In addition, the litter produced by grasses in a previously favorable year benefited forb persistence by inhibiting its germination into highly competitive grass environments. We conclude that contrary to conventional predictions of conservation and population biology, yearly fluctuations in climate may be essential for the persistence of rare species in invaded habitats.

J	Walker, KJ; Stevens, PA; Stevens, DP; Mountford, JO; Manchester, SJ; Pywell, RF				Walker, KJ; Stevens, PA; Stevens, DP; Mountford, JO; Manchester, SJ; Pywell, RF			The restoration and re-creation of species-rich lowland grassland on land formerly managed for intensive agriculture in the UK	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Intensive agriculture has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and the specialist flora and fauna associated with the semi-natural grasslands of low-intensity pastoral systems throughout northwest Europe. Techniques employed to restore and re-create these grasslands on agricultural land in the UK are reviewed. Extensive cutting and grazing management have been shown to diversify improved swards and facilitate re-colonisation on ex-arable soils, although rates of re-assembly of plant communities with affinity to existing semi-natural grasslands have generally been slow. On former agriculturally improved swards, nutrient depletion has accelerated this process, especially where "gaps" for establishment have been created. Similarly, on ex-arable soils "nutrient stripping" and sowing with diverse seed mixtures has led to the rapid development of species-rich swards. On free draining brown earths such an approach may be required to restore grassland communities where soil phosphorous concentrations exceed semi-natural levels by more than 10 mg/l (using Olsen's bicarbonate extractant). However, the appropriateness of this threshold for other soil types requires further sampling. Although restored grasslands are likely to contribute to national biodiversity targets success will ultimately depend on the reinstatement of the communities and ecological functions of semi-natural references. Although this is technically feasible for a few plant assemblages, less is known about the re-assembly of microbial and faunal communities, or the importance of trophic interactions during grassland succession. As a consequence, more research is required on the functional attributes of semi-natural grasslands, as well as the methods required to restore localised types, novel nutrient depletion techniques, the "phased" introduction of desirable but poor-performing species and the performance of different genotypes during grassland restoration.

J	Boeken, B; Ariza, C; Gutterman, Y; Zaady, E				Boeken, B; Ariza, C; Gutterman, Y; Zaady, E			Environmental factors affecting dispersal, germination and distribution of Stipa capensis in the Negev Desert, Israel	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The effects of postmaturation ambient temperatures, light, as well as chemical and structural properties of the substrate on germination and patch distribution of Stipa capensis in a shrubland landscape were studied. This species is a dominant annual grass in exposed intershrub areas covered with biological loess soil crusts in the northern Negev Desert. Freshly matured caryopses do not germinate. After 7-8 months of dry storage at high temperatures, there was a significant reduction in primary dormancy and an increase in the rate and percentage of germination of caryopses stored at high temperatures. The speed and percentages of germination were lower on various sterile substrates, such as organic matter and loose loess soil, in comparison with similar live substrates or the control on filter paper. In 3 of 4 years of field observations in semi-arid shrubland, the density of Stipa capensis plants on soil crust in the exposed intershrub areas was significantly higher than below shrubs. The positive effects of higher temperatures on the dry soil during summer, before the season with rains, and of light during germination, can favor germination in exposed patches. Although germination responses to storage temperature and light regime differentiate between patch types before and during germination, other processes may be critical for the pattern of distribution of Stipa capensis. These include dispersal of caryopses, arrival, soil penetration and density of local seed banks, as well as substrate properties affecting germination and plant density, in different landscape patches.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				SEP	2004	19	5					533	540		10.1111/j.1440-1703.2004.00666.x							WOS:000222870300009						
J	Shimono, A; Washitani, I				Shimono, A; Washitani, I			Seedling emergence patterns and dormancy/germination physiology of Primula modesta in a subalpine region	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												On the basis of the germination/dormancy responses of seeds to temperature and light, and local seed rain, we attempted to interpret the seedling emergence patterns of Primula modesta Bisset et Moore (Primulaceae) in two different types of habitats in a subalpine zone of Mt. Asama: an oligotrophic flat moor and a grassland with relatively dense herbaceous vegetation cover. The seasonal pattern of seedling emergence was well explained by the dormancy/germination physiology revealed in laboratory germination tests. The seeds were demonstrated to have a strict light requirement even after experiencing moist chilling, which might facilitate the incorporation of the seeds into the soil seed bank. Despite sufficient seed production, the seedlings emerging were far less at the grassy site than the moor site, but the number of seedlings was significantly dependent on the seed rain within previous season and on the litter cover of the microsite in both sites. Therefore, the spatiotemporal patterns of seedling emergence in the habitats could be well explained by the spatiotemporal patterns of seed rain and safe-sites for germination.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				SEP	2004	19	5					541	551		10.1111/j.1440-1703.2004.00667.x							WOS:000222870300010						
J	Sun, S; Gao, XM; Chen, LZ				Sun, S; Gao, XM; Chen, LZ			High acorn predation prevents the regeneration of Quercus liaotungensis in the Dongling mountain region of north China	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The mature oak (Quercus liaotungensis Koidz) forests in the Dongling mountains of northern China have become degraded in recent years because regeneration has been limited. To determine whether or not seedling establishment of the oak is seed limited, microsite limited, or predator limited and to determine whether seedling establishment is affected by ground cover, we conducted field experiments during a mast year and investigated the fate of seeds and the soil seed bank dynamics of the oak. A large acorn crop (128.8 acorns/m(2)) was observed in the study period, and the peak density of acorns on the forest floor reached 46.5 acorns/m(2), suggesting that tree recruitment was not seed limited. Acorns in the soil seed bank were mainly lost through decay (principally after fungal attack), consumption in situ, and removal by animals. Predation (including consumption in situ and removal) accounted for 86.4% of acorn loss and was therefore likely to have been the most important factor influencing seed dynamics. More than 70% of acorns were found to have germinated, but no established seedling was observed on the forest floor. Using cages to exclude predators, it was estimated that 87% of acorns germinated and 49% became established as seedlings, indicating that the acorns on the forest floor could emerge and grow in the absence of predators. We conclude that the regeneration of the tree population is limited by predators rather than by the availability of microsites. The presence of ground cover increased the germination rate and increased the chance of seed survival in the early stage of the experiment, but at the end of the investigation, no established seedling was found in the quadrats both with and without ground cover, possibly because of high density of animal predators. On the basis of these results, we suggest that selective tree felling will increase the coverage of the herbaceous layer, which can further decrease the population density of the rodents, and thereby improve the regeneration of oak trees.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2004	12	3					335	342		10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.0158.x							WOS:000223534700004						
J	Figueroa, JA; Castro, SA; Marquet, PA; Jaksic, FM				Figueroa, JA; Castro, SA; Marquet, PA; Jaksic, FM			Exotic plant invasions to the mediterranean region of Chile: causes, history and impacts	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												We review the literature on patterns, causes, processes and impacts of exotic plants, primarily in the mediterranean region of Chile, considering three major non-independent drivers of the invasion process: (a) Availability of exotic species propagules, (b) attributes of the local communities in which exotic species establish and through which they will eventually spread out, and (c) attributes of exotic species that either facilitate or constraint their spread into new sites. Regarding availability of propagules, central Chile matorral presents the Communities with the greatest incidence of naturalized herbs, followed by the sclerophyllous forest and the espinal scrubland in the coastal range. In contrast, north-central communities have lower numbers and proportions of naturalized species of herbs in their seed banks. Availability and persistence of naturalized herbs do not differ between aboveground vegetation and seed bank. Regarding attributes of local communities associated with the establishment and the spread of exotics, grazing regime and land use emerge as the most prominent causes that render them more prone to invasion by exotics. Evidence on the effect of the fire regime is contradictory and native species richness does not seem to be an important factor. Regarding attributes of exotic species seeds, results Suggest that naturalized annuals germinate within a wide temperature range, are highly resistant to cold and dry conditions, and show some degree of physiological dormancy. Additionally, naturalized annuals are highly tolerant to poor soils, but are generally intolerant to shade. These general attributes have largely determined the invasion process in the mediterranean region of Chile. Historical data indicate that an important number of exotic species were intentionally introduced, and that the spread of exotic is uncontrolled. It has been demonstrated that arrival time of exotics is of great relevance to understand present day spread of exotics in Chile, independent of their biogeographic origin. Exotic species may cause strong disruptions of ecosystem processes and functions in Chile, as exemplified by exotic tree plantations, which have altered soil chemistry, nutrient cycling, water cycle, hydrology, microclimate, and fire frequency and intensity.

J	Reluga, TC				Reluga, TC			Analysis of periodic growth-disturbance models	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												In this paper, I present and discuss a potentially useful modeling approach for investigating population dynamics in the presence of disturbance. Using the motivating example of wildfire, I construct and analyze a deterministic model of population dynamics with periodic disturbances independent of spatial effects. Plant population growth is coupled to fire disturbance to create a growth-disturbance model for a fluctuating population. Changes in the disturbance frequency are shown to generate a period-bubbling bifurcation structure and population dynamics that are most variable at intermediate disturbance frequencies. Similar dynamics are observed when the model is extended to include a seed bank. Some general conditions necessary for a rich bifurcation structure in growth-disturbance models are discussed.

J	McIvor, JG				McIvor, JG			Pasture management in semi-arid tropical woodlands: levels of germinable seeds in soil and faeces of cattle grazing Stylosanthes pastures	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												Measurements of the soil seed banks in Stylosanthes pastures and native pastures, and the amount of Stylosanthes seed and presence of other species in faeces of cattle grazing Stylosanthes pastures, were made at Cardigan and Hillgrove, near Charters Towers, north-east Queensland. The total numbers of seeds in the seed banks at both sites (approximately 500-1500 seeds/m(2)) were at the low end of published values for pastures. Similarly, the seed banks of the stylos (Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano and S. scabra cv. Seca) (less than or equal to300 seeds/m(2)) in the sown pastures were much lower than those reported elsewhere in Australia. Forbs were the major group in the seed banks for all pastures. There was little relationship between sward and seed bank composition. A total of 69 species were recorded in the faeces. Seca seed was present in faeces throughout the year with peak values in June-August. Verano seed in faeces peaked in May-June with no seed present in September-January. The maximum value for Seca was higher than that for Verano and there were more seeds of Seca than Verano in the faeces for most of the year. The small seed banks of the stylos mean that these species will need careful management to ensure their long-term contribution to pastures in such marginal environments. This management should involve some reduction in grazing during seed setting to maximise the amount of seed entering the seed bank.

WEED SCIENCE					Symposium on Weed Ecology in Long-Term Experiments held at the WSSA 2002 Annual Meeting	2002	Reno, NV	WSSA				The Broadbalk experiment was started in 1843 to investigate the relative importance of different plant nutrients (N, P, K, Na, Mg) on grain yield of winter wheat. Weeds were controlled initially by hand hoeing and fallowing, but since 1964, herbicides have been applied to the whole experiment with the exception of the 18 plots on Section 8. Approximately 130 weed species have been recorded on Broadbalk and about 30 of these are currently recorded annually on Section 8. Detailed weed surveys, conducted from 1930 to 1979, provide a unique 50-yr record, but the relatively small number of frequency categories used (six) poses a limitation on the interpretation of these data for ecological studies. Weed surveys were restarted in 1991 on Section 8. The current assessment method records the presence of individual 2 weed species in 25 random 0.1-m(2) quadrats per plot, which is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots. A principal components analysis of the 1991-2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (common chickweed) was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(-1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e.g., black medic and field horsetail), some were slightly disadvantaged (e.g., common vetch and parsley-piert), and some showed little response to differing N rates (e.g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 160 yr after it was established.

J	Legere, A; Samson, N				Legere, A; Samson, N			Tillage and weed management effects on weeds in barley-red clover cropping systems	WEED SCIENCE					Symposium on Weed Ecology in Long-Term Experiments held at the WSSA 2002 Annual Meeting	2002	Reno, NV	WSSA				The main study objective was to measure the effects of tillage (moldboard plow, chisel plow, and no-till) and weed management (intensive, moderate, and minimum) on weeds and crops in a spring barley monoculture compared with a spring barley-red clover rotation. The study was initiated in 1987 and conducted at two sites. Residual effects of treatments were measured in a wheat test crop at the loam site in 1994 and at the clay site in 1995-1996. Weed seed bank densities ranged from less than 300 to nearly 30,000 seeds m(-2) and plant densities from 30 to 6,000 plants m(-2). Seven species were recorded on average per plot aboveground and 10 species per plot in the seed bank. Species number in the seed bank varied little with treatments compared with species numbers aboveground. Crop rotation and tillage had little effect on weed species diversity but affected relative species dominance. The presence and abundance of species was also influenced by their degree of tolerance to the herbicides used in each system. Annual dicots largely dominated in minimum weed management treatments. Their relative importance in each rotation varied with their level of susceptibility to the different postemergence herbicides. Perennials were not exclusively found in reduced tillage systems. The relationship between perennials and tillage was dependent on the response of perennating structures to the type and frequency of soil disturbance. For example, quackgrass dominated in chisel and moldboard plow systems where rhizomes would be frequently fragmented. Field horsetail, also a rhizomatous species, dominated in the monoculture/direct-seeded no-till treatment under minimum weed management. Its absence from the rotation was explained by the regular removal of aboveground biomass during the forage production year. Overall, weed response was regulated by agronomic factors but was largely determined by specific biological attributes and environmental conditions.																	0043-1745					SEP-OCT	2004	52	5					881	885		10.1614/WS-04-011R							WOS:000223970400027						
J	Mahaney, WM; Wardrop, DH; Brooks, RP				Mahaney, WM; Wardrop, DH; Brooks, RP			Impacts of stressors on the emergence and growth of wetland plant species in Pennsylvania, USA	WETLANDS												Agriculture and urbanization in the upland landscape often generate stressors, such as sedimentation and eutrophication, that may negatively impact wetland plant communities. Individual plant species responses to stressors are also likely influenced by the hydrologic and geomorphologic characteristics of different wetland hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclasses. The goal of this study was to determine to what extent the two stressors listed above influence the growth and development of wetland plant species and how these responses vary across HGM subclasses. The impacts of the two stressors on wetland plant species emergence and growth were examined in a 2 X 2 factorial greenhouse experiment, using soil moisture and organic matter content to simulate three HGM subclasses. Both stressors elicited significant responses in species establishment and growth, but overall trends in stressor responses differed by wetland type. For instance, sedimentation reduced the emergence of four species in simulated riparian depressions but only affected one species in simulated slope wetlands and none in simulated headwater floodplains. Sedimentation had little impact on any species establishment or growth in headwater floodplains. Approximately half of the species showed an increase in at least one growth variable in response to nitrogen enrichment. Additionally, the conditions used to Simulate HGM subclasses appeared to impact a species performance and sensitivity to stressors. Therefore, further investigation of the impacts of HGM subclass conditions on species performance is needed. We expected differences in species responses to be related to their natural distribution across pristine and impacted wetlands; however, no obvious relationships were found. Our results suggest that it will be difficult to make generalizations about species responses to stressors because responses varied by stressor type, stressor interactions, and HGNI subclass. Therefore, perhaps the next step in formulating broad generalizations and predictions about wetland plant community composition will require a shift from species-based approaches to a trait-based approach for examining how species composition may change in response to future disturbances.																	0277-5212					SEP	2004	24	3					538	549		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0538:IOSOTE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000224309600005						
J	Gleason, RA; Euliss, NH; Hubbard, DE; Duffy, WG				Gleason, RA; Euliss, NH; Hubbard, DE; Duffy, WG			Invertebrate egg banks of restored, natural, and drained wetlands in the prairie pothole region of the United States	WETLANDS												Analogous to 'seed banks,' 'egg banks' are important for seasonal succession and maintenance of invertebrate species diversity throughout wet and dry cycles in the prairie pothole region. Further, recruitment of invertebrates from relic egg banks in the sediments and dispersal of eggs into wetlands is believed to be important for reestablishment of invertebrates in recently restored wetlands. Alhough tens-of-thousands of wetlands have been restored in the prairie pothole region of the United States, studies have not been conducted to evaluate the recovery of invertebrate egg banks in restored wetlands. We used taxon richness and abundance as indicators of potential egg bank recovery and compared these parameters in restored wetlands to those of non-drained and drained wetlands with a history of cultivation and also to reference wetlands with no history of cultivation. We found few significant differences among wetland categories within three physiographic regions (Glaciated Plains, Missouri Coteau, and Prairie Coteau). Most statistical comparisons indicated that restored wetlands had invertebrate egg banks similar to reference, non-drained, and drained wetlands. The one exception was drained seasonal wetlands in the Glaciated Plains, which had significantly lower taxon richness and invertebrate abundance than the other wetland categories. Trends did suggest that invertebrate egg bank taxon richness and abundance are increasing in restored seasonal wetlands relative to their drained analogues, whereas a similar trend was not observed for restored semi-permanent wetlands. Although recovery was not related to years since restoration, comparisons of restored wetlands with reference wetlands suggest that recovery potential may be inversely related to the extent of wetland drainage and intensive agriculture that varies spatially in the prairie pothole region. Our research suggests that periodic drawdowns of semi-permanent restored wetlands may be needed to promote production and development of invertebrate egg banks. Inoculation of restored wetlands may also be needed in areas where extensive wetland drainage has resulted in fewer wetland habitats to provide sources of passively dispersed eggs to newly restored wetlands.																	0277-5212					SEP	2004	24	3					562	572		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0562:IEBORN]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000224309600007						
J	Reid, MA; Quinn, GP				Reid, MA; Quinn, GP			Hydrologic regime and macrophyte assemblages in temporary floodplain wetlands: Implications for detecting responses to environmental water allocations	WETLANDS												This study describes the macrophyte assemblages of temporary floodplain wetlands situated on the floodplain of the Murray River, southeast Australia. Wetlands in the study are subject to flooding, the frequency, duration, and magnitude of which are dictated by the current, regulated river-flow regime. Our aim was to examine the influence of the existing flooding regime on macrophyte assemblages and to trial a monitoring program, based on a multiple before-after-control-impact (MBACI) design, to detect the impact of proposed environmental water allocations (EWAs) on the wetlands. Two categories of flooding regime were identified based on the flow magnitudes required for flooding to occur (flooding thresholds). In this scheme, wetlands with relatively low flooding thresholds are classed as 'impact' and those with higher thresholds are classed as 'control.' The wetlands were surveyed over a two-year period that incorporated at least one wetting-drying cycle at all wetlands. Results showed significant differences between survey times (season and year), but differences between flooding regime categories were significant only for some components of macrophyte assemblages. Differences between survey dates appear to reflect largely short-term responses to the most recent flood events. However, macrophyte differences observed between control and impact wetlands reflected the Cumulative effect of flood events over several years. Differences between control and impact wetlands were strongest for post-flooding surveys based on full assemblages (using ANOSIM) and among specific taxa and functional groups (using ANOVA). Power to detect differences between control and impact wetlands was greatest for species richness and total abundance, but taxa with low variability among wetlands, and hence good power, were actually less sensitive to hydrologic change. We conclude that the MBACI design used in this study will be most effective in detecting wetland ecosystem responses to the implementation of EWAs if response variables are carefully chosen based on their sensitivity to hydrologic change.

J	Peterson, JE; Baldwin, AH				Peterson, JE; Baldwin, AH			Variation in wetland seed banks across a tidal freshwater landscape	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Almost nothing is known about landscape-level variation in seed bank composition across complexes of hydrologically connected wetlands. We examined species composition of seed and spore banks in three habitats of tidal freshwater wetlands (marshes, swamp hollows, and swamp hummocks) along 48 km of tributaries throughout the tidal freshwater portions of the Nanticoke River watershed (Maryland and Delaware). Taxa and seedling density decreased with increasing distance upstream in the swamp hollows and hummocks, but increased or remained constant proceeding upstream in the marshes. Species rarefaction curves indicated equal taxa richness (28) between marshes and swamp hummocks at 175 individuals, with lower richness in swamp hollows (19). However, communities in swamp hollows were patchier and had an estimated total taxa richness of 52, similar to the marshes (50) and higher than swamp hummocks (41). Coefficients of variation for seedling emergence densities (136-180%) were greater than those of published seed bank studies conducted at smaller spatial scales in tidal freshwater marshes (36-117%). Our literature searches suggest that ours is the first study to document significant spatial trends in seed bank diversity and density across a wetland landscape.

J	Johnson, S				Johnson, S			Effects of water level and phosphorus enrichment on seedling emergence from marsh seed banks collected from northern Belize	AQUATIC BOTANY												The effects of water level and nutrient additions on seed germination from the seed banks of phosphorus-limited freshwater herbaceous wetlands in Northern Belize, Central America, were tested in a greenhouse study. Seed bank soil was exposed to both draw-down and flooded conditions with and without added phosphorus (P) in a replicated germination assay. The seed banks of herbaceous species, as assessed by seedling emergence, in 7 marshes of the study area ranged in size from 55 to 1556 seeds m(-2) and from 4 to 15 species. The dominant species in the standing vegetation, Typha domingensis Pers., Eleocharis cellulosa Torr., and Cladium jamaicense Crantz, were almost completely absent in the seed banks. The addition of phosphorus and flooding each reduced the number of species germinating from the seed banks by 50%, although the effect of water level varied by marsh. Phosphorus had a greater effect on the total number of seedlings emerging in flooded than draw-down treatments, reducing emergence by 75 and 20%, respectively. Overall, flooding reduced seedling emergence by 50%. The emergence of Typha from the seed banks, a competitive dominant in the marshes, was not increased by the addition of P. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bissels, S; Holzel, N; Donath, TW; Otte, A				Bissels, S; Holzel, N; Donath, TW; Otte, A			Evaluation of restoration success in alluvial grasslands under contrasting flooding regimes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Along the northern Upper Rhine, Germany, large-scaled restoration attempts aiming at the recovery of species-rich alluvial meadows from ex-arable fields were evaluated. We analysed floristic composition, soil nutrient status and biomass production of old and newly established meadows with respect to their position in both, the recent functional flood-plain and the fossil flood-plain compartment which is protected from flooding by a dyke. It is hypothesised that restoration in terms of species-enrichment will be more successful in the functional floodplain due to the input of propagules in the course of flooding events. Generally, we found great floristic differences between old and new meadows, independent of their position in the floodplain. After 15-20 years of restoration management, the floristic structure of new meadows was still dominated by sown grasses and a high proportion of ruderal and arable species, whereas target species of flood-meadows largely failed to establish in both compartments. Old and new meadows differed only slightly in the environmental variables, while measured significant differences in plant available phosphorus and biomass yield were revealed between floodplain compartments. The results indicated a minor effect of edaphic site conditions on the low restoration success and limited dispersal and recruitment were revealed to be the main constraints for restoration. We found no evidence that species enrichment is enhanced in the functional floodplain via the input of diaspores by flooding. Our results strongly suggest that dispersal limitation of target species is unlikely to be overcome merely by the restoration of more natural flooding conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rhazi, M; Grillas, P; Charpentier, A; Medail, F				Rhazi, M; Grillas, P; Charpentier, A; Medail, F			Experimental management of Mediterranean temporary pools for conservation of the rare quillwort Isoetes setacea	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Mediterranean temporary pools represent unique species-rich habitats with many rare and endangered species. The Roque-Haute Natural Reserve is one of the few sites in France with Isoetes setacea Lam., a very rare Mediterranean quillwort, considered as a keystone species determining a priority habitat for the European Union. Land uses changes have favoured the invasion of the pools by several shrub and tree species (e.g., Ulmus minor, Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. oxycarpa). Clearing shrubs in an experimental area of one pool resulted in the increase of I. setacea as compared to control, combining a higher cover in previously occupied quadrats and more quadrats occupied. Litter accumulation had a negative effect on the population of Isoetes but this effect was detectable only in the cleared area. Light attenuation was shown experimentally to be detrimental to the vegetative and regenerative production of I. setacea. Clearing of the shrubs and removal of the litter led to an increase in the L setacea populations and therefore appears to be an effective technique for restoring these plant communities invaded by shrubs. Long-term shrub control should be ensured by reintroducing sheep grazing in order to enhance the sustainable conservation of this oligotrophic habitat. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gonzalez-Andujar, JL; Fernandez-Quintanilla, C				Gonzalez-Andujar, JL; Fernandez-Quintanilla, C			Modelling the population dynamics of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) under various weed management systems	CROP PROTECTION												A mathematical model for simulating the population dynamics of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) has been constructed using previous reported data. The model is used to describe the bahaviour of the population in the absence of control practices and to predict the effect of various control strategies. In the absence of control and under continuous winter barley cropping the population grew sigmodally, reaching an equilibrium at a density of 2357 seeds m(-2) (1508 seedlings m(-2)). Annual application of herbicides at 100%, 50% and 25% the standard rate resulted in reductions in the equilibrium position of the population of 90%, 80% and 70%, respectively. Using various types of cultural control tactics (delayed seeding, crop competition, seed catching, crop rotation) resulted in partial control of this weed, maintaining relatively high population levels. Keeping the prevailing crop rotation (continuous barley) and integrating the use of various chemical and cultural tactics resulted in the best long-term results with a seed bank equilibrium level of 77 seeds m(-2) (49 seedlings m(-2)). Results from the sensitivity analysis indicate that the size of ryegrass populations is particularly vulnerable to small changes in the reproductive capacity and the loss of seeds. These two processes should be studied with greater detail in order to provide possible clues for the control of this weed. Furthermore, control tactics specifically focused on those life cycle periods should be investigated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M				Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M			Seed bank assembly follows vegetation succession in dune slacks	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Is the seed bank in dune slacks during the whole successional range mainly composed of early successional species or does it vary according to the changing vegetation? Location: Belgium, western part of the coast. Methods: We investigated the soil seed bank composition using a seedling germination method in a chronosequence of 20 dune slacks, ranging in age from five to 55 yr. Results: Both seed density and species richness in the seed bank were very low in the first successional stages and increased with age. mainly as a result of increasing seed production. The similarity between seed bank and vegetation was higher in older slacks. A comparison of characteristics between seed bank and vegetation showed that the seed bank was, to a large extent, composed of later successional species. Occurrence patterns of individual species also showed that seeds become incorporated in the soil after the species has established in the vegetation. Conclusion: The seed bank is not likely to be the driving force for successional changes in the vegetation, and successional changes rely on dispersal. Some early successional species persist in the seed bank, but generally only in low numbers. The results also confirm that most typical dune slack species do not form persistent seeds, so that re-establishment from the seed bank is not to be expected when the species has disappeared from the vegetation.

However, few studies have investigated the impacts of pathogens on regeneration in temperate forests. To determine whether losses to fungi of seeds of Betula papyrifera, a light-loving species, varied between habitats that differed in their degree of openness, we applied fungicide to seeds buried in old fields, treefall gaps, and forest understory sites. We found that the application of fungicide significantly reduced losses in all habitats, relative to control values. This effect was habitat-dependent: the benefit of fungicide was greater in forest understory than in openings. This suggests that B. papyrifera is prevented from establishing in understory environments in part by its susceptibility to pathogen attack, and not solely because of a high light requirement.

We analysed the effects of tree size, tree density and fire history on the level of serotiny. The level of serotiny decreased with an increase in tree height. The high level of serotiny in short trees could be explained by selection to increase regeneration chances after burning at pre-mature age. Also, limitation of long-distance seed dispersal opportunities in short trees may favour high serotiny levels. The level of serotiny was higher in post-fire stands than in unburned stands, suggesting a fast selection for serotiny by fire. Unburned stands had a higher total stand seed density than post-fire regenerated stands, but the proportion of seeds in serotinous cones of the total stand seed density was higher in post-fire regenerated stands. The fact that P. halepensis bears simultaneously serotinous and non-serotinous cones reflects its dual strategy as both a post-fire obligate seeder, mainly from serotinous cones and an early coloniser during fire-free periods, mainly from non-serotinous cones. The relative investment in these strategies is dependent on fire history and varies with tree height. Furthermore, mature brown cones can contribute to post-fire regeneration in case of spring fires, and serotinous cones are known to open partially also in dry spell events. Thus, post-fire regeneration and invasion are strategies, which seem to complement each other.

J	Traba, J; Azcarate, FM; Peco, B				Traba, J; Azcarate, FM; Peco, B			From what depth do seeds emerge? A soil seed bank experiment with Mediterranean grassland species	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed germination and emergence are influenced by the position of seeds in the soil bank profile. Mediterranean grasslands are heavily dependent on seed banks, as these systems are mainly composed of annual species. Seed bank germination experiments in a greenhouse were conducted to analyse the role played by burial depth on seed bank dynamics in annual Mediterranean grasslands. Specifically, they addressed two objectives: (1) to assess the ability of seeds in the shallow layer of the soil bank to emerge when they are buried at different depths, and (2) to ascertain the ability of seeds from deep layers to germinate and emerge to the surface. The study also produced a depth profile of species and seeds. The results show that: (1) all species (100%) and the majority of viable seeds (98.9%) are situated in the first centimetre, with a significant fall in the number of species and seeds in the soil bank as depth increases; (2) for the majority of species (92%) and seeds (85.4%) in the shallow bank, the emergence percentage declines significantly with burial depth; and (3) seeds that are present in deep layers need to rise to the surface in order to produce seedlings. In conclusion, the function of the seed bank in Mediterranean grasslands depends on the number of species and seeds in it, but also on the seed position in the profile and vertical movements that enable them to reach the surface.

J	Arrieta, S; Suarez, F				Arrieta, S; Suarez, F			Germination and seed bank depletion of holly (Ilex aquifolium L.) in four microhabitat types	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The germination dynamics of Ilex aquifolium L. were studied in central Spain using a 3-year field sowing experiment. Ten triads of bags (n = 30 seeds per bag) were buried randomly in four different microhabitats: inside the holly woodland, along the forest edge, in open grassland and under isolated shrubs. Bags were harvested annually, and seeds were analysed for seed viability, embryo development changes and germination. Holly seeds did not germinate until the second year. Embryo development and seed germination were faster at the forest edge, with a total germination proportion of 63% of sown seeds. Germination in the holly woodland (48%), under the shrubs (46%) and in grassland (46%) were very similar. Thus, recruitment of Ilex populations in this region is not limited by requirements for germination. After the third year, the seed bank was reduced by 80-90% of the initial seeds, so it can be considered as a short-persistent seed bank. Holly seed behaviour can enhance recruitment in semi-open areas, such as forest edges. Linked to the short persistence of its seed bank, this species can be considered an intermediate strategist between mature forest specialists and early successional species. This work contributes to a deeper knowledge of the germination ecology of I. aquifolium, in an effort to determine the relative importance of germination/ dormancy processes within holly population dynamics.																	0960-2585					AUG	2004	14	3					305	313		10.1079/SSR2004180							WOS:000223548300006						
J	Ito, S; Nakayama, R; Buckley, GP				Ito, S; Nakayama, R; Buckley, GP			Effects of previous land-use on plant species diversity in semi-natural and plantation forests in a warm-temperate region in southeastern Kyushu, Japan	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We compared the species composition, occurrence and diversity of understorey of forestry plantations and semi-natural secondary forests in a warm-temperate region in southeastern Kyushu, Japan, in which the previous land-use history had been documented. Cluster analysis and a stand ordination, using detrended correspondence analysis, indicated that plant species composition in forest stands was primarily influenced by the previous land-use history (as meadows or coppices) compared with either the current status of the stand (semi-natural forest or plantation) or site micro-topography. Species occurrence was also dependent on the previous land-use, with a significantly greater proportion of native woodland species being present in former coppice stands. Species richness, however, was higher in plantations and stands developing on former meadow sites. This was true of perennial forbs and climbing plants, but not the evergreen species which were originally common in native woodland of the region. Species diversity indices (Shannon's H') showed a similar tendency to species richness. The light environment within forest stands, evaluated by gap light intensity (GLI) using hemispherical photography, had less effect on species richness. We conclude that previous land-use has a significant effect on the species composition and diversity of forest, persisting even after the establishment of conifer plantations, and that the restoration of the original 'woodland' species composition and diversity will require the retention of efficient seed sources near stands which have developed on land previously cleared of native forest cover.

We describe a 55-year-old secondary rain forest at Barito Ulu, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and compare it with the adjacent, undisturbed, primary forest. Three 0.25 ha plots were set up in each forest type and all stems over 10 cm dbh were measured and identified, soil samples were taken and analysed, and the composition of the seed bank was examined. Although the basal area, tree height and biomass of the old secondary forest approached that of the primary forest (82% for basal area, 88% for tree height and 74% for biomass), there were still major differences in the floristics and species diversity. The old secondary forest was dominated by Cratoxylon arborescens (Hypericaceae) and Pternandra caerulescens (Melastomataceae), whereas the primary forest was dominated by dipterocarps. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was 3.40 for the old secondary forest plots and 4.17 for the primary forest plots; the Jaccard's coefficient of similarity was 24%. Mortality, recruitment, turnover and tree growth rates were greater in the old secondary forest. The seed bank of the old secondary forest contained more than double the number of seeds of the primary forest seed bank and many more seeds were of shrub species; there were the same number of species in the two forests seed banks. There were no major differences between the two forest types in terms of soil chemistry. Despite the close proximity to potential seed sources. succession in the Barito Ulu area has proceeded more slowly than in some other tropical areas. This may be due to the low concentrations of soil nutrients and/or the poor dispersal of dipterocarp seeds. Fifty-five years of succession is concluded to be insufficient time for the return of most primary forest species. However, the forest structure of the old secondary forest shows a closer resemblance to the primary forest than does the floristic composition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW			Seed germination ecology of the summer annual Cyperus squarrosus in an unpredictable mudflat habitat	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The purpose of our study was to better understand seed germination ecology of the summer annual sedge Cyperus squorrosus, which grows in various habitats, including mudflats and shallow soil over limestone bedrock (rock outcrops), where timing of the period favorable for germination and completion of the life cycle is unpredictable. Over a 28.5-month period, temperature and light:dark requirements for germination were determined at monthly intervals for seeds collected from mudflats and buried under flooded and under nonflooded conditions at natural temperature regimes. Data on dormancy and germination were compared to those published for seeds collected from plants growing on rock outcrops. Under both flooded and nonflooded conditions, seeds from mudflats exhibited an annual conditional dormancy/nondormancy cycle, similar to those from rock outcrops buried under nonflooded conditions. Seeds from mudflats germinated to higher percentages at mid-summer temperatures (35/20 degreesC) in mid-summer than those from rock outcrops. On the other hand, seeds from rock outcrops germinated to higher percentages at March temperatures (15/6 degreesC) in March than those from mudflats. Thus, seeds could germinate on mudflats any time from April through September if dewatering occurred, and they could germinate on rock outcrops any time from March through June and in September if soil moisture was nonlimiting; in both habitats light would be required for germination. Since seeds on mudflats may be flooded for several consecutive years, mudflats are more unpredictable than rock outcrops. Ability of seeds from mudflats to germinate to high percentages in light at 35/20 degreesC throughout the summer and those from rock outcrops not to do so may be related to the greater unpredictability of the mudflat. Each year for 11 years, seeds germinated in mudflat soil samples kept in a nonheated greenhouse, reaching a total of 22526 +/- 1401 (mean +/-S.E.) seeds m(-2); thus, the species has the potential to form a large long-lived persistent soil seed bank.

(Oligochaeta, Glossoscolecidae) is a large native earthworm from the natural savannas of the eastern plains of Colombia. The description of the main biological, ecological and functional attributes of this species in a natural savanna and several introduced pastures at the Carimagua Research Station (320 km east from Villavicencio) was the main objective in this study. Density and biomass of this species were significantly much higher in the introduced pastures compared with the savanna (ANOVA, P < 0.01). Evidence of vertical migration during the year was observed, while it is active in the topsoil during the beginning of the rainy season, it enters in a true diapause to withstand adverse environmental conditions before the onset of the dry period, being adults the last to enter into this phase (after reproduction period). Martiodrilus n. sp. seemed to select food substrates with high organic contents since casts produced in the two systems had significantly higher total C and total N contents than the bulk soil. Besides, C content also increased significantly during ageing of casts (+ 100%), possibly because Of CO2 fixation processes, accumulation of dead roots and/or macrofaunal activities. The effects of earthworm activities on soil and cast seed banks were revealed in another experiment. The composition of the above standing vegetation was relatively closer to that of the cast seed bank than that of the soil seed bank. The results obtained in this study support the general knowledge of how earthworms can affect soil fertility and plant growth. Martiodrilus n. sp., through the production of casts affects the availability and nature of both the spatial and trophic resource in soil. This species certainly belongs to the functional group of "ecosystem engineers", as it affects the availability of some resources for other organisms through the production of physical biostructures. The next step in research should be directed now to test whether Martiodrilus n. sp. is a keystone species within the soil community or not. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main aim of this restoration attempt within a nature reserve was to recreate sustainable conditions for wetland species, particularly aquatic plants. 2. In the process of restoration, two phases of activity were distinguished: a pre-restoration phase, during which information on land-use history and past vegetation was collected and used to establish clear restoration goals; and a restoration phase for stimulating germination and establishment of target species originating from the soil seed bank and species pool. 3. Within the first year of the study, pond digging allowed the establishment of extremely rare native species that react positively to mudflat creation and standing water availability. The results of this experiment indicate that pond digging can be a very suitable technique for re-establishing aquatic and wetland vegetation, providing that the site is well chosen. 4. An essential prerequisite for successful restoration is a study of the past vegetation of the target site and its surroundings. This work illustrates the importance of past vegetation in affecting current restoration success and provides an example of how restoration projects benefit from knowledge and understanding of both historical and present conditions.

Differences between four types of dunes (mobile sand dune, MSD; semifixed sand dune, SSD; fixed sand dune, FSD; interdunal lowland, ILD) in floristic composition of the vegetation and the soil seed bank were examined using nonparametric methods. In the four types of dune, species composition varied significantly except between site MSD and site SSD as well as between site FSD and site ILD in aboveground vegetation. As for soil seed bank, the number of species and seeds differed significantly only between site FSD and site ILD. Species diversity revealed that species numbers increased in the sequence of MSD, SSD, FSD and ILD. The dominant species of aboveground vegetation in site MSD and site SSD were Agriophyllum squarrosum and Setaria viridis, respectively. While in both site FSD and site ILD, the dominant was Eragrostis pilosa. Of total germinated seed, the most abundant species in site MSD were Agriophyllum squarrosum, but the dominant species was Eragrostis pilosa in the other three sites. In each site, more than half of the species recorded in aboveground vegetation were found in the seed bank, even more in the seed bank of site FSD and site ILD. In site FSD and site ILD, high correspondence was observed between the species composition of the aboveground vegetation and of the associated soil seed bank. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were 0.295, 0.046, 0.704, and 0.612 for site MSD, site SSD, site FSD and site ILD, respectively. These results indicated that desertification development decreased correlation between the seed bank and vegetation in Kerqin Steppe.																	1532-4982	1532-4990				JUL-SEP	2004	18	3					283	293		10.1080/15324980490451410							WOS:000223043200007						
J	Baba, W				Baba, W			The species composition and dynamics in well-preserved and restored calcareous xerothermic grasslands (South Poland)	BIOLOGIA												In this paper the floristic composition and dynamics of species in unmanaged and restored xerothermic grasslands on soil of different depth were studied. On the control plots, independently of the soil thickness, there were no significant changes of the initial species composition. Mowing or cutting the calcareous grasslands on shallow soil significantly increased the species richness. However, contrary to mown plot, on the clear-cut ones, the abundance of the calcareous grassland species (Festuco-Brometea) was low. From the nature conservation point of view, it seems essential to preserve the existing patches of xerothermic grasslands. Restoration the calcareous grasslands from xerothermic shrubs is possible only on shallow soil.

J	Landenberger, RE; McGraw, JB				Landenberger, RE; McGraw, JB			Seed-bank characteristics in mixed-mesophytic forest clearcuts and edges: Does "edge effect" extend to the seed bank?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Little is known about the seed banks of mixed-mesophytic forest clearcuts or their associated forest edges. Seed banks were described and compared to better understand how seed density, species richness, and composition change with increasing distance from clearcuts. Thirty-two taxa were found in the seed bank of clearcuts, and 44 were found in adjacent forest edges. Annuals represented 41% of seeds in clearcuts, but only 8% in edges, while trees and shrubs represented 3% in both areas. Seed-bank density and species richness varied significantly within and between clearcuts, but clearcuts were no different in seed-bank density and richness from interior forest seed banks. Seed-bank density declined significantly with distance from clearcuts on west-facing forest edges, but demonstrated no discernable spatial pattern on south-facing edges. Overall, edge effects from clearcutting on adjacent forest seed banks were demonstrated in total seed density and in several common wind-dispersed, early-successional herbaceous species, including Erechtites hieraciifolia (L.) Raf. and Lobelia inflata L., and Vitis, a common ingestion-dispersed species. The seed-shadow edge effect may influence both current and future community characteristics and population dynamics of vegetation in mixed-mesophytic forest edges adjacent to clearcuts.																	0008-4026					JUL	2004	82	7					992	1000		10.1139/B04-080							WOS:000223555700013						
J	Pellissier, V; Gallet, S; Roze, F				Pellissier, V; Gallet, S; Roze, F			Comparison of the vegetation and seed bank on hedge banks of different ages in Brittany, France	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The composition of the herbaceous cover and the seed bank of old and recent hedge banks in Brittany were studied and compared. Concentration method was used for seed bank samples. Grime's plant strategies were used to explain observed patterns. The analysis of the seed bank of these hedge banks showed that the species richness and diversity differed in relation to the date of construction of the hedge banks. The seed banks of recent hedge banks were richer and more diversified than those of old hedge banks. Differences in the floristic composition of the established plant cover between the recent and old hedge banks were determined by multivariate analyses. The species exclusively found in the seed bank and in the herb cover of recent hedge banks were mainly grassland species, whereas the species that only occurred on old hedge banks tended to be woodland species. The floristic composition of the two compartments (established vegetation and seed bank) was very different. A multivariate analysis revealed that the difference between the composition of the seed banks of recent and old hedge banks was less than that between the composition of the established vegetation and seed bank of hedge banks of the same age. Both seed bank and vegetation of recent hedge banks were dominated by ruderal species, whereas old hedge vegetation was dominated by stress-tolerant woodland species, indicating that mechanically constructed hedge banks may impose limitations on colonization by late woodland species.																	0364-152X					JUL	2004	34	1					52	61		10.1007/s00267-004-0041-x							WOS:000223464900005	15383874					
J	Shiferaw, H; Teketay, D; Nemomissa, S; Assefa, F				Shiferaw, H; Teketay, D; Nemomissa, S; Assefa, F			Some biological characteristics that foster the invasion of Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. at Middle Awash Rift Valley Area, north-eastern Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A study on some biological features of Prosopis juliflora, a multipurpose leguminous species introduced to Ethiopia, was carried out at Melka-Worer, North-east Ethiopia. The study focused on the number of seeds produced in a pod during the study period, seed dispersal through droppings of animals, soil seed banks, seed germination and stumping height of trees and coppicing ability of P. juliflora. The overall mean number of seeds was 23 +/- 4 seeds/pod. The width and length of seeds ranged between 0.8-1.7 and 8-29 cm, respectively. The mean weight of a seed of Prosopis was 0.0275 g +/- 0.001 (S.E.) while there were 36,000-37,000 seeds/kg. The number of seeds recovered from 1 kg of droppings of each animal ranged between 760 (goats) and 2833 (cattle), suggesting that cattle are the major dispersers of seeds of the study species followed by warthogs, camels and goats. There was a highly significant difference in vertical distribution of the seed density of P. juliflora recovered from the soil samples while the horizontal distribution exhibited a great disparity in the density of soil seeds among the sample plots. The total mean soil seed density, in the litter layer and down to 9 cm depth, was 1932 seeds/m(2) (+/- 307S.E.). Germination of seeds of P. juliflora differed significantly among the various treatments. The highest germination percentage was obtained from seeds that were treated with mechanical scarification (100%) and sulfuric acid for 15-60 min (97-99%). About 37% and 47% of the seeds recovered from droppings of goats and warthogs, respectively, germinated. All stumped trees of P. juliflora produced coppices except those stumped at 10 cm below ground. The overall mean number of coppices at the studied plots was 17.8 +/- 0.9 (S.E.) while the overall mean height of coppices, in 6 months after stumping, was 68.4 cm +/- 2.7 (S.E.). The results clearly demonstrated that Prosopis is equipped with a number of biological characteristics that foster its rapid invasion of new areas. These include: (i) production of many, small and hard seeds capable of surviving passage through the digestive system of animals, entering into the soil to form soil seed banks and remaining viable until favorable conditions for germination and seedling establishment appear; (ii) attractive and rewarding pods for animals, containing fleshy and sweet mesocarp embodying the numerous small seeds, which is sought after by both domestic and wild animals, meant for long-distance dispersal; (iii) accumulation of dormant but long-lived viable seed reserves that would serve as sources of regeneration of new Prosopis plants in the event of disturbance that might eliminate the above-ground stands; (iv) production of a mixture of seeds, with a few capable of germinating immediately after dispersal to exploit the favorable conditions that might exist at the time of dispersal, while the majority remain dormant for spreading germination over time and space; and (v) great ability of resprouting and fast coppice growth from stumped/damaged trees, making it a very strong competitive invader combined with its sexual reproduction. Combinations of all these characteristics make Prosopis a powerful noxious invader as can be evidenced from its rampant invasion in the study site and elsewhere in the tropics. Therefore, any effort in the management, control or elimination of Prosopis, which does not take these biological characteristics is bound to fail. The results also revealed that stumping trees at 10 cm below the ground eliminates the chance of resprouting of Prosopis and, hence, might offer a viable option for controlling and even eliminating the plants from areas whee they are undesirable. The fact that Prosopis has great ecological and socio-economical importance, which have not been fully realized in Ethiopia, makes its control through utilization a very attractive, purposive and viable option.

J	Berger, TW; Sun, B; Glatzel, G				Berger, TW; Sun, B; Glatzel, G			Soil seed banks of pure spruce (Picea abies) and adjacent mixed species stands	PLANT AND SOIL					Conference on Ecology of Forest Transformation	SEP, 2002	Brandenburg Univ Technol, Cottbus, GERMANY		Brandenburg Univ Technol			The soil seedbank of long living seeds of herbs, graminoids and shrubs can survive several decades in the soil and germinate after disturbances like windthrow or clearcutting. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the risk of weeds, which may limit the success of conversions of secondary pure spruce stands (Picea abies) to mixed species stands. In a first step, germination experiments were performed in the greenhouse on soil samples collected under adjacent pure spruce and mixed species stands (mainly mixtures of spruce and beech - Fagus sylvatica) on two different soil substrates (Flysch: nutrient rich, basic soil; Molasse: nutrient poor, acidic soil). Seedling density and species richness were higher on the nutrient rich soil on Flysch. Comparisons between seedlings that emerged from soil samples collected at the end of the vegetation period and in spring justify the statement of the hypothesis that mixed spruce-beech stands advance the transient seed bank while pure spruce stands stimulate the persistent seed bank. In a second step, the seed banks of different soil horizons down to 35 cm soil depth were studied in a multivariate statistical design for the most dominant species J effusus, C. pallescens and R. idaeus, which are known to form long-term persistent seeds. Effects of bedrock material (Flysch, Molasse), species composition (pure spruce, mixed species) and treatment (control, nitrate) were tested. The total sum of these three species was significantly higher on Flysch than on Molasse. However, species composition indicated no significant differences, although there was a trend of higher amounts of germinating seeds under pure spruce. Nitrate treatments did not promote germination of viable buried seeds, indicating that the number of emerged seedlings is a realistic indicator of the seed bank density for the studied stands. It is concluded that overstorey tree species composition is not an important controlling factor for seed germination of the studied species after disturbances. The majority of emergents are the graminoids J. effusus and C. pallescens which were not present at all in the aboveground vegetation. Viable seeds were found down to 35 cm soil depth, although most seeds were concentrated in the upper 10 cm soil. Hence, care should be taken if management strategies create conditions that are generally favorable to germination. The success of forest regeneration or a conversion of pure spruce to mixed species stands could be endangered by any disturbance, which causes an immediate increase of light levels.

J	Leon, RG; Owen, MDK				Leon, RG; Owen, MDK			Artificial and natural seed banks differ in seedling emergence patterns	WEED SCIENCE												Artificial weed seed banks are practical for studying seed bank depletion and weed seedling emergence because the number, depth, and species composition of seed banks can be managed. However, no studies have determined whether artificial seed banks are representative of natural seed banks. We compared the emergence of velvetleaf, giant foxtail, and common waterhemp in a natural seed bank, an artificial seed bank with stratified seeds, and an artificial seed bank with nonstratified seeds. Velvetleaf seedling emergence was higher in the nonstratified seed bank in 2001, but no differences were observed in 2002. The number of viable velvetleaf seeds at the end of the experiment was lower in the natural seed bank than in the artificial seed banks in 2002. Velvetleaf emergence occurred earlier in the natural seed bank than in the artificial seed banks. Giant foxtail emergence was higher in the artificial seed banks (58 to 82%) than in the natural seed bank (5 to 23%). Common waterhemp emergence ranged from 7 to 65% in the artificial seed banks and from 1 to 5% in the natural seed bank. In general, the distribution of emergence with time differed in the natural seed bank compared with the artificial seed banks. These differences were attributed to differences in soil temperature and soil bulk density between the natural and artificial seed banks. Artificial seed banks showed lower soil bulk density and greater temperature fluctuation than the natural seed bank. However, there was no consistent relationship between growing degree days and emergence timing in the three treatments for any of the species studied.

J	Boyd, N; Van Acker, R				Boyd, N; Van Acker, R			Seed and microsite limitations to emergence of four annual weed species	WEED SCIENCE												The emergence of annual species depends on the number of seeds present and the biotic and abiotic conditions directly surrounding those seeds (the microsite). A field experiment was conducted to study the relative importance of seed presence vs. microsite conditions in determining the emergence of four annual species. Green foxtail, wild mustard, wild oat, and canola were seeded at 200, 400, and 1,200 seeds m(-2) in separate plots in a coarse, loamy, mixed Typic Haplocryoll and a fine, mixed Typic Haplocryoll soil. Five microsite modification treatments (control, irrigation, soil compaction, soil compaction plus irrigation, and no crop) were applied to all weed seed density treatments for each weed species. All plots were seeded to spring wheat. Irrigation or soil compaction increased percent emergence of wild oat. Green foxtail emergence tended to increase with soil compaction in 2001 but not in 2002. Wild mustard and canola emergence were largely unaffected by microsite modification treatments. Weed emergence increased with increasing seed density for all species, but the proportion of the total number of seeds emerging decreased with increasing seed density for all species. We suggest that the emergence of the four weed species in this experiment was both seed and microsite limited. Increasing the number of seeds in the soil increased the probability of seeds landing within an appropriate microsite. For these four species, therefore, weed spread and weed patch formation may be determined both by seed production and dispersal and by variability in soil microsite conditions. Results suggest that weed management practices should limit seed dispersal of all species and discourage weed emergence of hard-to-control species during critical establishment periods.																	0043-1745					JUL-AUG	2004	52	4					571	577		10.1614/WS-03-118R							WOS:000222859200013						
J	Gallandt, ER; Fuerst, EP; Kennedy, AC				Gallandt, ER; Fuerst, EP; Kennedy, AC			Effect of tillage, fungicide seed treatment, and soil fumigation on seed bank dynamics of wild oat (Avena fatua)	WEED SCIENCE												No-tillage offers potential for improved soil quality, reduced erosion, and equal or increased crop yields. We hypothesized that, compared with conservation tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT) offers conditions more conducive to microbial decay of weed seed. In NT systems seed remain at or near the soil surface where crop residues, moisture, and lack of disturbance create an environment with greater soil microbial diversity. In late fall of 1998 and 1999, dormant seed of wild oat, either individually glued to plastic toothpicks or mixed with soil and placed in mesh bags, were buried (mean seed depth of 2.5 cm) in replicated field plots managed by NT or CT since 1982. Treatments including fungicide seed treatment (thiram + metalaxyl + captan) and soil fumigation (propylene oxide) provided estimates of the contribution of microorganisms to observed mortality. Seed were retrieved in May and August, 1999 and 2000. Contrary to our original hypothesis, the proportion of dead seed was generally similar in NT and CT systems. Lack of tillage system by seed or soil treatments affecting the proportion of dead or decayed seed suggests that the contribution of microorganisms to seed fate is similar in these tillage environments. However, the proportion of dormant seed was consistently lower in the NT compared with CT treatments; there was a corresponding increase in the proportion of germinated seed. Overall, more than half of the wild oat seed bank losses could be directly attributed to germination whereas losses due to decay were relatively minor by comparison. Despite favorable distribution of seed and improved quality of the surface-strata of soil in NT systems, this study fails to provide evidence that enhanced microbial decay will contribute to a "weed-suppressive" capacity in such cropping systems.

Weed control decisions were based on field scouting and recommendations from the Ontario version of HADSS(TM), the herbicide application decision support system. Treatments were selected to maximize profit (economic threshold approach) or to maximize yield (highest treatment efficacy). Reduced rates of the high efficacy treatment for each field also were included. Weed density before and after treatment, crop yields, weed seed return, and the effect of weed control decisions on weed density 1 yr after treatment were assessed. Crop yield varied among years and farms but was not affected by weed control treatment. Weed control at 28 d after treatment (DAT) was often lower and weed density, biomass, and seed production 70 DAT were often higher with the profit maximization approach compared with the yield maximization approach. However, weed density 1 yr later, after each cooperator had applied a general weed control program, did not vary significantly among the previous year's weed control treatments. Reduced rates of the high efficacy treatments did not lead to increased weed problems the next year, despite lower weed control and increased weed seed production in some years. During the 3 yr of the study, weed control costs with the profit maximization approach were approximately Can$45/ha less than with the yield maximization approach.

J	O'Donovan, JT; Newman, JC; Harker, KN; Clayton, GW				O'Donovan, JT; Newman, JC; Harker, KN; Clayton, GW			Crop seeding rate influences the performance of variable herhicide rates in a Canola-Barley-Canola rotation	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Glyphosate-resistant canola was seeded at Vegreville, Alberta, in 1997 and 1999 and barley in rotation with the canola in 1998 at three seeding rates. The effects, at each crop seeding rate, of variable glyphosate (canola) and tralkoxydim plus bromoxynil plus MCPA (barley) rates on crop yield, net economic return and seed production by wild oat, wild mustard, and wild buckwheat, and the amount of weed seed in the soil seed bank was determined. Crop seeding rate influenced the response of canola and barley yield and weed seed production to herbicide rate. At the lowest crop seeding rates, yield responses tended to be parabolic with yields increasing up to one-half and three-quarters of the recommended herbicide rates and trends toward reduced yields at the full rates. This response was not evident at the higher crop seeding rates, where, in most cases the yield reached a maximum between one-half and the full recommended rate. The effects of the herbicides on weed seed production, especially at the lowest rate, were often superior at the higher crop seeding rates. The results indicate that seeding canola and barley at relatively high rates may reduce risk associated with lower crop yields and increased weed seed production at lower than recommended herbicide rates. However, the current cost of herbicide-resistant canola seed may preclude the adoption of this integrated weed management practice by growers.																	0890-037X					JUL-SEP	2004	18	3					733	741		10.1614/WT-03-168R							WOS:000224378800036						
J	Rainbolt, CR; Thill, DC; Yenish, JP; Ball, DA				Rainbolt, CR; Thill, DC; Yenish, JP; Ball, DA			Herbicide-resistant grass weed development in imidazolinone-resistant wheat: Weed biology and herbicide rotation	WEED TECHNOLOGY												A general life cycle model was modified to demonstrate how agronomic practices and weed biology factors affect the rate of appearance of herbicide-resistant downy brome, jointed goatgrass, and wild oat in Pacific Northwest wheat cropping systems. The model suggests herbicide rotation strategies for cropping systems that include imidazolinone-resistant wheat as a weed management tool. Simulation of continuous annual imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat and imazamox herbicide use resulted in the resistant soil seed banks of downy brome, jointed goatgrass, and wild oat surpassing their susceptible soil seed banks in 5, 7, and 10 yr, respectively. Reducing the initial seed bank density of downy brome before beginning a rotation that includes imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat reduces the likelihood of selecting for herbicide-resistant biotypes. The best simulated management option for reducing the total jointed goatgrass soil seed bank in low-precipitation areas is an imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat-fallow rotation. Rotations that include winter and spring crops and rotations that include non-group 2 herbicides minimize herbicide resistance selection pressure and reduce the wild oat soil seed bank.																	0890-037X					JUL-SEP	2004	18	3					860	868		10.1614/WT-03-167R							WOS:000224378800055						
J	Stammel, B; Kiehl, K				Stammel, B; Kiehl, K			Do hoof prints actually serve as a regeneration niche for plant species in fens?	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Plant species revegetation of hoof prints in a calcareous fen pasture and of artificially created hoof-print like gaps in an abandoned fen was investigated over two years and compared with the surrounding vegetation. The investigation of abiotic conditions showed that two hoof-print zones had to be distinguished: the steep, drained edge with good light conditions and the flat, dark, but wet bottom. Vegetative spreading and seedling recruitment were examined separately. After two years, hoof prints were not recolonized reasonably, indicating that both hoof-print zones did not offer good conditions for recolonization. Occurrence of frequent species and species numbers were similar in hoof prints, in the surrounding vegetation and in the seed bank. For many fen species germination from the seed bank was better in water-logged pots than in regularly-watered pots. Most species recolonized hoof prints both generatively and vegetatively. In the bottom zone more species germinated than spread vegetatively, but many seedlings died. At the edge, vegetative spreaders finally dominated in spite of high germination rates, because seedling mortality was also high. Overall, recolonization on the edges was more successful than on the bottom, probably because of better light conditions. Only few new species occurred inside hoof prints and only few species were frequent in hoof prints, but not in the surrounding vegetation. Those species were exclusively prostrate species germinating on the edges. The number of recolonizing species did not differ between pasture and abandoned site. Germination, however, was more severely limited in the abandoned fen due to low light availability, litter accumulation and competition by mosses. Altogether, our results show that the presumed importance of hoof prints for species recruitment has to be reconsidered for fen vegetation. On wet peat soil negative effects of soil compaction and changed water and light availability probably prevail over positive effects such as the promotion of subordinate species.

J	de Winton, MD; Casanova, MT; Clayton, JS				de Winton, MD; Casanova, MT; Clayton, JS			Charophyte germination and establishment under low irradiance	AQUATIC BOTANY												Charophyte establishment from oospores in lake sediment was measured under nine light regimes (range <0.01-7.4 mol photons PAR m(-2) d(-1)) in two short-term experiments (13-20 weeks). Natural light was modified by inorganic turbidity in Experiment I and controlled artificial light was used in Experiment 2. Germling response was dominated by Chara australis Brown or Chara globularis Thuill. Germling number was not significantly affected by the light regimes and germination occurred under <0.5 mumol photons PAR m(-2) s(-1) ('Dark' treatment). A three-fold range in PAR (1.7-5.2 mol photons m(-2) d(-1)) had less influence on the final germling number than pre-drying sediment, which increased germlings ca. 1.5- to 3-fold. Drying lake sediment could be used as a management tool to stimulate charophyte germination. Light influenced germling biomass, with negligible gain at less than or equal to0.4 mol photons PAR m(-2) d(-1) and biomass accrual with light greater than or equal to 1.7 mol photons PAR m(-2) d(-1). Germination at an irradiance insufficient to sustain germling growth suggests that this may be an important loss for oospore banks under unfavourable light conditions and might be an adaptation to germination within the soil profile. The results of these experiments indicate that for these species, light is required for establishment rather than germination. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Clarke, PJ; Davison, EA				Clarke, PJ; Davison, EA			Emergence and survival of herbaceous seedlings in temperate grassy woodlands: Recruitment limitations and regeneration niche	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Field experiments examined herbaceous seedling emergence and survival in temperate grassy woodlands on the New England Tablelands of New South Wales. Effects of intensity of previous grazing, removal of ground cover by fire or clearing, burial of seeds, grazing and seed theft by ants on seedling emergence and survival were studied in two field experiments. Thirteen species with a range of traits were used in the experiments and their cumulative emergence was compared with laboratory germination studies. Field emergence correlated to laboratory germination but all species had lower emergence in the field. Little natural emergence of native species was observed in the field in unsown treatments. Short-lived forbs had the highest emergence, followed by perennial grasses; rhizomatous graminoids and perennial forbs had the lowest emergence. Soil surface and cover treatments did not markedly enhance emergence suggesting that intertussock spaces were not prerequisites for forb emergence. No consistent pattern of enhanced emergence was found for any treatment combination across all species. Seedling survival varied among species, with perennial grasses and short-lived forbs having the highest seedling mortality. Low mortality rates in the graminoids and rhizomatous forbs appeared partially to compensate for lower seedling emergence. All perennial grasses and some short-lived forbs showed increased risk of mortality with grazing. Differences in emergence and survival of species were related to ground cover heterogeneity, soil surfaces and, to some extent, herbivory. The complexity of these patterns when superimposed on temporal variability suggests that no generalizations can be made about the regeneration niche of herbaceous species groups. Strong recruitment limitation and partitioning of resources in the regeneration niche may reduce competition among native species and explain the high species richness of the herbaceous layer in the temperate grassy communities of eastern Australia.

In a field study in the north-eastern part of Switzerland we compared the soil seed banks in plots representing two types of wild-flower strips, rotational fallow, natural regeneration and grass-clover ley during the first two years after establishment. There was a marked increase in the total seed bank in all vegetation types during the first year, which was most pronounced in the natural regeneration and least in the grass-clover ley. Six of the species sown were detected in the seed bank in the first year following establishment, and 14, species in the second year. The potential of sown wildflower species to persist in the subsequent crop was investigated by tilling the plots after 1.5 and 2 years and sowing them with winter or summer wheat, with or without application of herbicide. Altogether 26 out of 43 sown species occurred in the subsequent crop, the largest numbers being found in the former wildflower strips. Species diversity and cover of both sown and spontaneous species was higher in summer wheat than in winter wheat. 13 sown species were able to spread out into plots where they had not been sown. The spontaneous plant species were most affected by herbicide, but some sown wildflower species were also reduced. After tilling, the preservation of numerous plant species is possible by a conserving management, at least in the short term.																	0253-1453					JUN	2004	114	1					49	66									WOS:000223594400005						
J	Llorens, TM; Ayre, DJ; Whelan, RJ				Llorens, TM; Ayre, DJ; Whelan, RJ			Evidence for ancient genetic subdivision among recently fragmented populations of the endangered shrub Grevillea caleyi (Proteaceae)	HEREDITY												The genetic effects of population fragmentation cannot be interpreted without understanding the underlying pattern of genetic variation resulting from historic population processes. We used AFLP markers to determine genetic structure and distribution of genetic diversity among populations of an endangered Australian shrub Grevillea caleyi (Proteaceae). Populations that occurred historically on four ridges have new been fragmented to varying degrees, producing some large, relatively pristine populations and very small populations consisting of fewer than 10 adult plants. We found marked population genetic structure (65.9% of genetic variation was among populations) and a significant relationship between genetic and geographic distance (r(m) = 0.564, P = 0.004). However, only 14% of overall genetic differentiation was attributable to variation among ridges, compared with 52% among populations within ridges. Moreover, genetic diversity within samples of plants did not vary with either population size or degree of isolation. Thus, the present genetic structure of populations is probably almost entirely the product of historical events. Fine-scale structuring within populations prior to fragmentation may have been caused by limited seed and pollen dispersal, despite a complex suite of ( mostly avian) pollinators, and a mixed mating system that allows a large amount of selfing. The combined effects of adult longevity and a soil-stored seed bank may have buffered the recently fragmented populations against the effects of dramatic reductions in numbers of adult plants.

J	Arseneault, D; Sirois, L				Arseneault, D; Sirois, L			The millennial dynamics of a boreal forest stand from buried trees	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. We reconstructed the dynamics of a black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest stand in northern Quebec using a continuous, 5200-year-long sequence of stem remains buried in adjacent peatland. Simulations of recruitment of such remains provided guidelines for inferring past ecosystem structure and composition at the stand scale. 2. Compared with the late Holocene (4650-0 cal. year BP (CYBP)), the mid Holocene (5200-4650 CYBP) period was characterized by faster tree growth, larger stems and higher stem density, indicating higher forest productivity in association with a milder climate. 3. The presence of stem remains of both species from 17 out of 20 contiguous 250-year time intervals suggests that the spruce-pine stand exhibited high compositional stability, with both species regenerating after fire from canopy-stored seed banks. 4. Relative species abundance closely followed the duration of past fire intervals deduced from the number of tree rings in buried conifers. Time periods of long (4650-3950, 3400-1850 and 250-0 CYBP) and short fire intervals (4950-4650, 3950-3400 and 1850-250 CYBP) were associated, respectively, with decreasing and increasing pine abundance, probably reflecting faster juvenile growth, lower shade tolerance, earlier sexual maturity and shorter longevity in jack pine compared with black spruce. 5. We conclude that both climate change and climate-induced fire disturbance have been driving long-term ecosystem dynamics. Our field evidence supports the idea that interactions between disturbances and the life-history traits of species modulate the impact of climate change at the scale of forest stands. At the same time, disturbances may result in long-term stability of disturbance-adapted ecosystems.																	0022-0477					JUN	2004	92	3					490	504		10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00887.x							WOS:000221424600010						
J	Ishikawa-Goto, M; Tsuyuzaki, S				Ishikawa-Goto, M; Tsuyuzaki, S			Methods of estimating seed banks with reference to long-term seed burial	JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH												We compared two standard seed-bank estimation techniques using buried seed populations that had been covered to depths of >1 m by volcanic deposits for 20 years. Some seeds were germinated in a greenhouse (germination method [GM]), and other seeds were extracted by flotation using 50% K2CO3 solution (floatation method [FM]). In total, FM could detect more species and seeds in the soils than GM. However, many species that were extracted by FM did not germinate by GM and smaller seeds were extracted to a lesser extent by FM. FM and GM have distinct advantages and disadvantages. We concluded that the application of a single method should be avoided in estimating seed banks, in particular for long-lived seed banks, because the seeds cannot be readily germinated and are structurally weak.

J	Myster, RW				Myster, RW			Regeneration filters in post-agricultural fields of Puerto Rico and Ecuador	PLANT ECOLOGY												To better understand how rainforest regenerates after agriculture I sampled the seed rain and seed bank, and set out seeds and seedlings, on microsites defined by distance to the forest in fields both in Puerto Rico and Ecuador. I found that (1) total seeds, species richness and life-form richness were twice as great in the Ecuador seed rain compared to Puerto Rico but Puerto Rico seeds were more evenly distributed among species and (2) total seedlings from the seed bank were similar between Puerto Rico and Ecuador, (3) the majority of seeds were lost to predation among all species and study sites, (4) seed disease was absent in P. aduncum and Miconia prasina, and no seeds germinated for Gonzalagunia spicata and P. riparia, (5) in Ecuador pathogenic disease claimed more seeds than germinated for all species, and Solanum ovalifolium was the only species that had seeds germinate but did not lose seeds to disease, (6) also in Ecuador, insect predation was significantly lower in the forest border for P. aduncum, and seed disease was significantly greater at the 10 m micro site for S. ovalifolium, (7) distance has a significant effect on seedling height and basal diameter, (8) losses of leaf area due to herbivory and pathogens were always low and (9) biomass and leaf specific mass were significantly reduced in the border and forest microsites. I conclude that Ecuador fields had more seeds, species, and life-forms than Puerto Rico fields, predation was the most severe post-dispersal seed filter in all fields, seeds that survived predation on Puerto Rico were lost either to disease or germination but to both mechanisms in Ecuador, all three seed mechanisms in Ecuador fields showed distance effects of seedling growth but not survivorship.																	1385-0237					JUN	2004	172	2					199	209									WOS:000221178600004

PLANT ECOLOGY												Rubus alceifolius Poiret (Rosaceae) was introduced to the island of Reunion in the southeastern Indian Ocean about 1850 and is now highly invasive. This bramble, native from southeastern Asia and Malaysia, has invaded a wide variety of habitats (lowland rainforest, mountain and submountain rainforest, Acacia heterophylla rainforest) from sea level to 1700 m. It is suspected to be monoclonal so, its remarkable success may be due in part to great phenotypic plasticity. On Reunion, bud, flower, fruit and seed production, the duration of the flowering period and the importance of the seed bank were found to be negatively correlated with elevation (50-1500 m a.s.l.). At a lowland site, fruit production in mature stands averaged between 30 and 80 fruits/m(2) during 1999 and 2000. No fruit set occurred above 1100 m. This fruit production pattern was similar over two years. Although the number of leaves per unit area is similar along the whole gradient studied, decrease of fruit set in upland areas might be compensated for by an increase in vegetative growth. Temperature variation is very sharp along the elevation gradient and may control the fruit and the seed production. Fruit production allows establishment of new populations all around the island via bird dissemination. Once established, R. alceifolius maintains dense patches that can grow vegetatively. Our results may be relevant for eradication programs that should take into account variation in reproductive strategy in lowland vs. highland habitats.

J	Orr, DM				Orr, DM			Dynamics of plant populations in Heteropogon contortus (black speargrass) pastures on a granite landscape in southern Queensland. 4. The effects of burning on H-contortus and Aristida spp. populations	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												This paper reports an experiment undertaken to examine the impact of burning in spring together with reduced grazing pressure on the dynamics of H. contortus and Aristida spp. in H. contortus pasture in south-eastern Queensland. The overall results indicate that spring burning in combination with reduced grazing pressure had no marked effect on the density of either grass species. This was attributed to 2 factors. Firstly, extreme drought conditions restricted any increase in H. contortus seedling establishment despite the presence of an adequate soil seed bank prior to summer; and secondly, some differences occurred in the response to fire of the diverse taxonomic groupings in the species of Aristida spp. present at the study site. This study concluded that it is necessary to identify appropriate taxonomic units within the Aristida genus and that, where appropriate, burning in spring to manage pasture composition should be conducted under favorable rainfall conditions using seasonal forecasting indicators such as the Southern Oscillation Index.																	0049-4763					JUN	2004	38	2					77	87									WOS:000222767400002						
J	Koning, CO				Koning, CO			Impacts of small amounts of sandy sediment on wetland soils and vegetation: Results front field and greenhouse studies	WETLANDS												This project used three different experiments to test the hypothesis that deposition of small amounts of sediment in wetlands alters plant diversity and soil properties. Greenhouse experiments using potting soil and Sagittaria latifolia were used with 0.5-2 cm sediment treatments and controls. Thirty 2 m X 2 m plots were established in a freshwater palustrine marsh, and the plots were monitored before and after the addition of 1, 2, or 4 cm of sediment to half of the plots. Large vegetated cores of native soil were removed from the wetland and monitored in the greenhouse before and after the addition of 2 cm of sediment. Greenhouse experiments showed that less than 2 cm of sediment had no effects on the growth of S. latifolia, while 2 cm of sediment significantly increased aboveground biomass but had no effect on matrix potential or oxidation-reduction potential. Field plots showed significant differences in bulk density, organic matter, and phosphorus resulting from addition of sediment but did not show differences in water levels, temperature, plant diversity, biomass, or stem density under any amount of added sediment. Soil cores showed a significant difference in bulk density and in matrix potential near the soil surface under wetter conditions but showed no significant differences in temperature, evapotranspiration, oxidation-reduction potential, or aboveground biomass. The lack of effect seen in the field plots is likely the result of a low effective loading rate relative to the greenhouse experiments and the dense plant cover and thick debris layer of the wetland. Observed changes in bulk density would alter the hydrologic functions of the wetland if these depths of sediment occurred over a larger area. The tolerable level of sediment for a wetland depends on the structure and function of the individual wetland.																	0277-5212					JUN	2004	24	2					295	308		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0295:IOSAOS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000222485000006						
J	Warren, RJ; Rossell, IM; Moorhead, KK				Warren, RJ; Rossell, IM; Moorhead, KK			Colonization and establishment of red maple (Acer rubrum) in a southern Appalachian wetland	WETLANDS												We characterized the post-disturbance recruitment window for red maple (Acer rubrum) in a southern Appalachian wetland using size-class distributions and forest stand models. The DBH and core age of understory and overstory trees were measured in 108 plots in forested (closed) and unforested (open) fen and floodplain sites at the Tulula Creek wetland complex (a southern Appalachian wetland in Graham County, North Carolina) in 1994 and 2001 as part of a larger ecological study. In addition, the heights of red maple seedlings were measured in 379 quadrats in an unforested floodplain in 1996 and 2001. We examined the temporal patterning of wetland recruitment using red maple size-class data in order to determine (1) the recruitment window for seedling colonization and (2) temporal recruitment patterning based on the size/age structure of established tree stands. Diameter and height distributions were compared with power function, negative exponential and quadratic models in order to determine goodness of fit using the coefficient of determination (R-2). Diameter distributions and stand models showed that recruitment continued (at a diminishing rate) at sites that were last cleared 7, 14, and approximately 30 years earlier and ceased at a fourth site cleared approximately 45 years earlier. While there were minor recruitment fluctuations that possibly coincided with water-level changes, the unimodal size class distributions indicated that recruitment did not pulse subsequent to initial canopy disturbance. These results show that red maple readily colonized wetland habitats and that the recruitment window lasts at least twice as long as that reported in terrestrial systems. In addition, size-class distribution and regression analysis indicate that the colonization window is directly impacted by canopy disturbance and only indirectly influenced by water levels.

Although multidimensional, the wetland continuum is most easily represented as a two-dimensional gradient, with ground water and atmospheric water constituting the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. By locating the position of a wetland on both axes of the continuum, the potential biological expression of the wetland can be predicted at any point in time. The model provides a framework useful in the organization and interpretation of biological data from wetlands by incorporating the dynamic changes these systems undergo as a result of normal climatic variation rather than placing them into static categories common to many wetland classification systems. While we developed this model from the literature available for depressional wetlands in the prairie pothole region of North America, we believe the concept has application to wetlands in many other geographic locations.

J	Turner, D; Conran, JG				Turner, D; Conran, JG			The reproductive ecology of two naturalised Erica species (Ericaceae) in the Adelaide hills: the rise and fall of two 'would-be' weeds?	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												The pollination biology and reproductive ecology of the newly naturalised species Erica cinerea from Europe and E. glandulosa from South Africa (Ericaccac) arc reported from the Adelaide Hills from Surveys undertaken in 1995 and 2003. Examination of UV floral reflectance, nectar composition and floral visitors found that E. cinerea was honeybee pollinated (although the bees also practiced nectar theft by chewing through the corolla tube), whereas E. glandulosa was probably pollinated by New Holland Honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae: Meliphagidae) which filled the niche of the nectariniid Sunbirds which pollinate it in South Africa. Although fecundity data in 1995 suggested that there was considerable capacity for these plants to become weeds, the 2003 Survey found that they had declined significantly, apparently as a result of competition or shading from taller, more aggressive weeds, mainly Bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Tree Erica (E. arborea). Nevertheless, as E. cinerea reseeds and E. glandulosa resproutts after fire, and E. cinerea can persist in the soil seed bank for over 30 years, their Populations may recover and/or expand if the area where they are growing is opened Lip by fire.																	0372-1426	2204-0293				MAY 31	2004	128		1				23	31									WOS:000221781800003						
J	Wienk, CL; Sieg, CH; McPherson, GR				Wienk, CL; Sieg, CH; McPherson, GR			Evaluating the role of cutting treatments, fire and soil seed banks in an experimental framework in ponderosa pine forests of the Black Hills, South Dakota	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Pinus ponderosa Laws. (ponderosa pine) forests have changed considerably during the past century, partly because recurrent fires have been absent for a century or more. A number of studies have explored the influence of timber harvest or burning on understory production in ponderosa pine forests, but study designs incorporating cutting and prescribed burning in an experimental framework are needed to identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. In this study, we first characterized the disturbance history and the soil seed bank of a ponderosa pine stand in the northern Black Hills. We then experimentally addressed the effects of prescribed burning and overstory reduction on understory vegetation. Before Anglo settlement of the area, the mean fire interval was 14 years and no fires were recorded after 1879. Cessation of fires, prolific regeneration of ponderosa pine, and subsequent logging in 1903 has led to a very dense, even-aged ponderosa pine stand with very little understory vegetation and very few viable seeds in the soil seed bank. Only 57 individual plants, or 186 seeds/m(2), emerged from 1080 soil samples. Response of understory vegetation during the first growing season after application of treatments was sparse, with no significant treatment effect. There were, however, significant treatment effects during the second growing season. Total understory biomass ranged from 5.8 kg/ha on untreated plots to 1724 kg/ha on clearcut, unburned plots. Herbaceous dicots comprised over 90% of total understory biomass. Both understory species richness and evenness responded to treatments, but understory woody plant density did not respond to either treatment. Paucity of viable seeds in the soil seed bank does not appear to constrain recruitment of understory vegetation in dense ponderosa pine forests of South Dakota. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pykala, J				Pykala, J			Immediate increase in plant species richness after clear-cutting of boreal herb-rich forests	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												The flora of clear-cuttings with soil scarification in forests was compared < 1-2 yr after cutting with that in mature herb-rich forests in SW Finland. The total and mean numbers of vascular plant species both in the study areas and in the sample plots, were almost double in clear-cut areas compared to mature forests. Clear-cuttings and mature forests were distinctly separated by multivariate analyses (DCA). Several dozen species not found in forests were common in clear-cut areas. Most of them probably belong to the neglected native species pool of early boreal forest succession and are dependent on the long-term persistent seed bank or effective wind dispersal. It is emphasized that in forests many plant species are confined to the very early stages (< 2 yr) after disturbance. The storage effect of the long-term persistent seed bank is crucial for the maintenance of plant diversity in boreal forests. Probably a considerable part of the flora of agricultural areas is composed of species that were originally disturbance dependent forest plants. Scarification is beneficial to disturbance dependent plants and may be useful in restoration of populations of species of early succession.																	1402-2001					MAY	2004	7	1					29	34		10.1658/1402-2001(2004)007[0029:IIIPSR]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000221960200004						
J	Brandel, M				Brandel, M			The role of temperature in the regulation of dormancy and germination of two related summer-annual mudflat species	AQUATIC BOTANY												Dormancy and germination requirements were investigated in seeds (achenes) of the closely-related annuals Bidens cernua and Bidens tripartita (Asteraceae). They showed clear differences in their temperature requirements for germination, their dormancy and seed longevity in soil. In B. cernua seeds, primary dormancy was relieved when stratified at 3, 8, and 12 degreesC, as seeds ger-minated to a maximum of more than 80% (3 degreesC and 8 degreesC) and 20% (12 degreesC), while temperatures of 15 degreesC and 18 degreesC had no effect. Secondary dormancy was induced after 20 weeks at 12 degreesC. Temperatures between 3 and 18 degreesC were effective in relieving dormancy in B. tripartita seeds as they germinated to more than 60% regardless of stratification temperature. With prolonged incubation time, dormancy was induced at 18 degreesC. Both species exhibited an annual dormancy cycle. B. cernua seeds came out of dormancy in spring at temperatures < 15 degreesC and dormancy was induced in summer (> 15 degreesC). In late summer, seeds were completely dormant before temperatures of <7 degreesC led to a relief of secondary dormancy. B. tripartita seeds came out of both primary and secondary dormancy when ambient temperatures were < 12 degreesC in autumn. At temperatures >7 degreesC in spring and Summer, dormancy was induced. Nevertheless, B. tripartita seeds could germinate (>40%) during the whole year at high and fluctuating temperatures. B. tripartita had the potential to accumulate a persistent seed bank, while buried B. cernua seeds were all dead after 20 months. Germination tests with dry-stored seeds showed that a fluctuating-temperature amplitude of greater than or equal to8 degreesC (mean 22 degreesC) led to a significantly higher germination (40%) of B. tripartita seeds, while B. cernua seeds did not germinate even at high amplitudes. Stratified B. tripartita seeds germinated at high constant temperatures >21 degreesC, while B. cernua seeds showed a nearly absolute requirement for fluctuating temperatures. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Welling, P; Tolvanen, A; Laine, K				Welling, P; Tolvanen, A; Laine, K			The alpine soil seed standing vegetation bank in relation to field seedlings and in subarctic Finland	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												This study investigated the relationship of seed bank and field seedlings on the structure of standing vegetation. We also studied the roles in sexual regeneration of seed size, diaspore morphology, and the ability to regenerate vegetatively. Seed banks, field seedlings, and standing vegetation were sampled in 8 subarctic plant communities in Kilpisjarvi, Finland, in, 1995-1998. The seed bank densities varied from 99 to, 1109 viable seeds m(2-1) and decreased toward higher altitudes. The seed bank densities were significantly larger than the field seedling densities in the closed vegetation of the lower slopes, whereas the differences were smaller in the open, late-melting snowbeds on higher slopes. The species that occurred only in the seed bank had small seeds or appendaged diaspores. The field seedling densities were high in plant communities dominated by species with ineffective vegetative reproduction or by species with diaspores and with pappus. The floristic similarity was low between the seed bank, field seedlings, and standing vegetation. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed that the species diversity was lower in the seed banks than in standing vegetation and field seedlings. The results indicate that all transitions equally constrain the sexual regeneration of vegetation. Clonality, very small and very large seed sizes, appendaged diaspores, and possibly narrow first leaves in seedlings are traits that limit the transition of plants from standing vegetation to the phase of field seedlings via seed bank. Persistent seed bank has a minor role compared to clonal growth in the regulation of vegetation structure.

J	Salo, LF				Salo, LF			Population dynamics of red brome (Bromus madritensis subsp rubens): times for concern, opportunities for management	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Red brome is a Mediterranean winter annual grass that has invaded south-western USA deserts. Unlike native annuals, it does not maintain a soil seed bank, but exhibits early and uniform germination. Above-average winter precipitation in these regions allows red brome to reach high density and biomass. These are tune for concern, as large numbers of easily dispersed seeds increase the likelihood that it may spread into new areas. However, early and uniform germination can also lead to population crashes when drought precludes seed production. Winter droughts dramatically reduce densities of red brome, but provide opportunities for management of this exotic grass.

J	Shaukat, SS; Siddiqui, IA				Shaukat, SS; Siddiqui, IA			Spatial pattern analysis of seeds of an arable soil seed bank and its relationship with above-ground vegetation in an arid region	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The composition and spatial pattern of weeds was analysed in an arable-soil seed bank after the harvest of wheat. Four hundred cores were collected from a 10 x 10 to grid in April 1999. Three indices of pattern detection (variance/mean ratio, Lloyd's index of mean crowding, and Morisita's index of aggregation) and Moran's l statistic of spatial autocorrelation were computed. The above-ground vegetation of the corresponding area was sampled by 100 randomly placed quadrats in March and September 1999 and variance/mean ratio of all the species was calculated. The seed bank of the field was dominated by annuals including Convovulus arvensis, Amaranthus viridis, Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album and Conyza canadensis. In all 27 species were recorded from the seed bank. For most of the species with a mean higher than 0.05 per core, the seed pattern (with two exceptions) was aggregated as indicated by various indices of pattern detection. Among the common species, only Amaranthus viridis exhibited a random pattern. Aggregated pattern of seeds was generally due to seeds settling in the neighbourhood of the mother plant and the clumped distribution of plant species in the overlying vegetation. Suggestions have been made regarding the improvement of the precision of the soil seed bank sample, in view of the aggregated distribution of seeds in soil. Seed bank showed considerable qualitative similarity with the above-ground vegetation, which is presumably the consequence of recurrent disturbances in the arable field. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Romo, JT; Bai, Y				Romo, JT; Bai, Y			Seed bank and plant community composition, Mixed Prairie of Saskatchewan	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Many range managers have suggested that clubmoss (Selaginella densa Rydb.) negatively alters the composition of seed banks and inhibits the establishment of plant species that decrease under improper grazing management. Alternatively it is possible that soil seed banks contain few seeds of decreaser species and composition of the seed bank is independent of clubmoss. The purpose of this study was to determine the composition and diversity of the soil seed bank in relation to the clubmoss cover and compositional characteristics of plant communities in the Northern Mixed Prairie of southwestern Saskatchewan. Cover of vascular plants was determined and soil seed bank samples were collected in 100 grazed plant communities. Soil seed bank samples were incubated in the laboratory with emerging seedlings being identified to species. Eight percent (SE +/- 1.9) of emerging seedlings in the seed bank were decreasers, 73% (SE +/- 2.8) were increasers, and 19% (SE +/- 2.3) were invaders, indicating regeneration of decreaser species might be limited by low numbers of seeds in seed banks. Clubmoss cover was not correlated (P = 0.32 to 0.98) with species richness, species diversity, density of decreasers, density of increasers, density of invaders, and total seedling densities in the seed banks. Seed banks and plant communities shared few species as indicated by a low similarity index ((x) over bar = 0.31, SE +/- 0.02). Species richness ((x) over bar = 3.6 species per 102 cm(2), SE +/- 0.18) and diversity ((x) over bar = 1.00, SE +/- 0.05) of seed banks were poorly correlated with characteristics of the plant communities. Range condition score was positively correlated (r = 0.17, P = 0.09) with total seedling densities in the soil seed bank, indicating more seedlings can potentially develop from the seed bank with increasing range condition of plant communities. We reject the hypothesis that clubmoss negatively affects the composition of seed banks. Mechanically disturbing plant communities to control clubmoss is predicted to lead to plant communities that are dominated by increasers and/or invaders. Managing for production of seeds by desired species should be a priority in promoting establishment of desired species.																	0022-409X					MAY	2004	57	3					300	304		10.2307/4003799							WOS:000222045200011						
J	Holmes, PM; Newton, RJ				Holmes, PM; Newton, RJ			Patterns of seed persistence in South African fynbos	PLANT ECOLOGY												In fire-prone communities such as fynbos, many species rely on regeneration from seed banks in the soil. Persistent seed banks are particularly important for species with life spans shorter than the average fire cycle, in order to counter local extinction. Persistent seed banks also give potential for restoring ecosystems following disturbances such as alien plant invasion. This study investigated the seed persistence patterns of 25 perennial species, representing several growth forms and life histories, during a three-year burial. Long-term persistence (i.e., seed bank half-life exceeding two years) was found in the hard-seeded Fabaceae and Pelargonium, and the nut-fruited Proteaceae. In this group, germinability was low and dormancy increased further following burial, resulting in a highly viable, dormant seed bank after three-year's burial. A second group with potentially long-term persistent seeds includes four taxa (Pseudopentameris, Passerina, Elegia and Restio) that either have low germinability or develop secondary dormancy following burial. Dormancy in the latter group was partially countered by exposure to smoke-seed primer. Of the small-seeded species, only two Erica species with high initial dormancy had long-term persistent seed banks. The other species mostly displayed high initial germinability and short-term persistent seed banks (i.e., seed bank half-life less than two years). This group included taxa with short to medium life-spans (Syncarpha, Roella) that were expected to have long-term persistent seeds in order to buffer against local extinction following average to long fire-return intervals. We hypothesize that light may play a role in overcoming secondary dormancy in those species, and could have resulted in an underestimate for seed persistence in this study. Alternatively, those short to medium life-span species persist via inter-fire recruitment in gaps or long-distance dispersal ( of the smallest seed). No correlations were found between seed persistence and seed mass or variance in seed dimensions. Nor was a correlation found between seed persistence and phenol concentration. In fynbos, seed burial of larger seeds by ants and rodents are major processes that operate in conjunction with passive burial of small seeds. Selection for persistence can be expected to operate across all seed sizes and shapes in fire-prone communities.

Woolly cupgrass seed bank decline was rapid, declining by an average of 73, 96, and 99.5% after 1, 2, and 3 yr, respectively. Woolly cupgrass seed mortality accounted for a much greater portion of seed loss from the seed bank (80%) than germination and emergence (19.5%) during the 3-yr period. Annual rates of emergence ranged from 3 to 17% of the fall seed bank and were similar between seed banks established in different years when compared within the same year. Annual rates of mortality ranged from 50 to 92% and varied between seed banks established in different years when compared within the same year; older seed banks had higher rates of mortality than younger seed banks. For first-year seed banks, 97 to 99% of the total season emergence occurred within the first 3 wk of emergence. However, for second- and third-year seed banks, a greater percentage of the total season emergence occurred later in the season compared with emergence that occurred during the first year. The data suggest that in addition to various environmental and seed-source factors, seed bank age may also play a role in seed mortality rate and seedling emergence pattern.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	2004	52	3					346	351		10.1614/WS-03-011R							WOS:000221464600005						
J	Asteraki, EJ; Hart, BJ; Ings, TC; Manley, WJ				Asteraki, EJ; Hart, BJ; Ings, TC; Manley, WJ			Factors influencing the plant and invertebrate diversity of arable field margins	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Field margin plots, sown with either a simple grass mix, a complex grass mix with or without forbs or allowed to regenerate naturally were established around four fields on the Royal Agricultural College's Harnhill farm in the west of England. Two of the fields were managed conventionally and two were managed organically. Plants and invertebrates were recorded on the margin plots over a 2 year period to test the influence of the different mixtures on the community assemblages. There was no difference in the seed bank of the different plot types, however the organically managed margins contained more unsown species than the conventionally managed margins. The simple mix plots had significantly fewer plant species than the other plots. The naturally regenerating plots had significantly lower grass cover and grass species diversity than the other plots. In the second year perennial grass and perennial forb cover increased in all mixtures. Both the cover and numbers of unsown species were reduced in the sown plots in the second year. Percentage cover and species richness of forbs were significantly higher in the complex grass with forbs and naturally regenerating plots. Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera and Araneae abundance were significantly correlated with plant species richness. Also, both plant species richness and total plant cover significantly influenced the Auchenorrhyncha community. Invertebrate abundance was greater in the organically managed plots than in the conventional ones, except larval Coleoptera. In the second year significantly more predatory Coleoptera species were trapped in the natural regeneration plots. Farming system and field crop type influenced the Coleoptera communities, phytophagous Coleopteran diversity being significantly correlated with plant diversity. Sowing field margins with a complex seed mixture with some forb species and managing the field with reduced inputs suppressed undesirable plant species and increased invertebrate abundance and diversity. A mixture containing forbs increased plant species richness and maximised heterogeneity of the margin, providing a more diverse habitat for invertebrates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Barry, MJ; Bowers, R; De Szalay, FA				Barry, MJ; Bowers, R; De Szalay, FA			Effects of hydrology, herbivory and sediment disturbance on plant recruitment in a Lake Erie coastal wetland	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes provide many valuable ecological functions and, currently, there are extensive efforts to preserve and manage remaining habitats. We examined plant recruitment in a Lake Eric coastal marsh on bare mudflats exposed during 2 y of below average water levels. In 2000 mudflat vegetation was sampled in shallow, medium and deep water transects and compared to germinable seeds found in sediments from 0-15 cm below the surface. Effects of sediment disturbance and herbivory on plant recruitment were tested in 1 m(2) quadrats in 2000 and vegetation was sampled in 2001 to assess how well the disturbance/herbivory experiment predicted plant communities that became established on the mudflats. In 2000, 18 species were found on mudflats and 19 species were reared from the seedbanks. Seed densities (similar to3000 seedlings/ m(2)) were comparable to other freshwater wetlands and did not differ by sediment depth. Taxa richness was highest in sediments 0-5 cut below the surface. Most plants on the mudflats were found in the shallow transect, but seed abundance and richness were highest in deep transects. Sediment disturbance decreased taxa richness and herbivory decreased both plant cover and richness; however, responses varied among plant taxa. Our results indicate that abundant seedbanks exist in this wetland, but plant recruitment will be restricted to shallow areas due to turbidity. Communities in 2001 were more diverse (40 species) than predicted from vegetation in 2000 probably because propagules were introduced from nearby habitats. Communities in 2001 were most similar to ungrazed and undisturbed quadrats in 2000 because these had the most species.																	0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2004	151	2					217	232		10.1674/0003-0031(2004)151[0217:EOHHAS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000220789000003

In this study we assessed the success of heathland re-creation on 37 former arable, improved grassland and conifer plantation sites in southern England, UK. The similarity between the vegetation and seed banks of the re-creation sites and undisturbed heathland controls were examined in relation to former land use, soil properties and re-creation management. Former land use was found to be the most important determinant of re-creation success. On former arable, and to a lesser extent improved grassland. antecedent management had caused significant changes to seed bank and soil properties. As a result, regeneration of Calluna heath had been minimal, even on sites where appropriate management (e.g. cropping, addition of pH amendments) had been undertaken and heathland species introduced. In contrast, former plantation seed banks and soils were similar to heathland controls, and, as a result, rapid regeneration of Calluna heath had taken place. It was concluded that conifer removal provides the most practical and cost-effective means of re-creating Calluna heath on former heathland, although further research is required to assess the effect of litter removal and the rate at which heather seed banks decline following conversion to forestry. In contrast, recreation on former agricultural sites will require effective management to reduce soil pH, fertility and the abundance of competitive species as well as the introduction of heathland propagules. Given limited resources a more realistic objective for these sites is likely to be reversion to an acid grassland or grass-heath. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lawson, CS; Ford, MA; Mitchley, J; Warren, JM				Lawson, CS; Ford, MA; Mitchley, J; Warren, JM			The establishment of heathland vegetation on ex-arable land: the response of Calluna vulgaris to soil acidification	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The UK Biodiversity Action Plan has identified the creation of lowland heathland as an important objective. Heathland restoration studies have identified soil pH, elevated soil nutrients and large weed seed banks as major problems in the restoration of heathland vegetation on ex-arable land. Heathland vegetation is usually found on nutrient-poor acidic soils. Creating acidic soil conditions on ex-arable sites thus may produce a suitable environment for the establishment of heath vegetation. Soil acidification by the addition of sulphur has been shown to reduce the soil pH and the availability of nutrients in arable soils. A series of experiments was established to investigate the effects of soil acidification using sulphur on the establishment of Calluna vulgaris and the development of weed vegetation. The application of sulphur at 0.24 kg m(-2) to an arable soil was found to increase the survival rate of C. vulgaris cuttings planted in it. The mechanism of increased C. vulgaris survival appeared to be by sulphur application significantly reducing the cover of arable weeds arising from the soil seed bank. Higher rates of sulphur application (0.36 and 0.48 kg m(-2)) resulted in the death of many C. vidgaris plants. However C. vulgaris seedlings were able to establish successfully on these ex-arable soils within 1824 months following the addition of these levels of sulphur. The application of sulphur appears to offer a practical solution to heathland creation on ex-arable land. However, it may be necessary to provide an interval of between 18 and 24 months between the application of sulphur and the addition of C. vulgaris plants or seeds for the successful establishment of heathland vegetation.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												A review of the biological information published after 1980 is provided for three species of the genus Amaranthus: A. retroflexus L., A. powellii S. Watson and A. hybridus L. The three species are noxious weeds introduced to Canada from southern North America. Their geographical distribution has remained almost unchanged since the original paper published in 1980. The plants exhibit a high phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability and they easily adapt to a multitude of agrestal and ruderal habitats. The seeds contribute to a persistent seed bank; they exhibit a variable dormancy and polymorph germination as a result of maternal, genetic and environmental factors. Growth is rapid and plants produce a large number of viable seeds. The three species have developed multiple resistance to triazine and acetolactate-synthase-inhibiting herbicides. They are alternate hosts to many insects, nematodes, viruses, bacteria and fungi that affect cultivated plants.

J	Pausas, JG; Bradstock, RA; Keith, DA; Keeley, JE				Pausas, JG; Bradstock, RA; Keith, DA; Keeley, JE		GCTE Fire Network	Plant functional traits in relation to fire in crown-fire ecosystems	ECOLOGY												Disturbance is a dominant factor in many ecosystems, and the disturbance regime is likely to change over the next decades in response to land-use changes and global warming. We assume that predictions of vegetation dynamics can be made on the basis of a set of life-history traits that characterize the response of a species to disturbance. For crown-fire ecosystems, the main plant traits related to postfire persistence are the ability to resprout (persistence of individuals) and the ability to retain a persistent seed bank (persistence of populations). In this context, we asked (1) to what extent do different life-history traits co-occur with the ability to resprout and/or the ability to retain a persistent seed bank among differing ecosystems and (2) to what extent do combinations of fire-related traits (fire syndromes) change in a fire regime gradient? We explored these questions by reviewing the literature and analyzing databases compiled from different crown-fire ecosystems (mainly eastern Australia, California, and the Mediterranean basin). The review suggests that the pattern of correlation between the two basic postfire persistent traits and other plant traits varies between continents and ecosystems. From these results we predict, for instance, that not all resprouters respond in a similar way everywhere because the associated plant traits of resprouter species vary in different places. Thus, attempts to generalize predictions on the basis of the resprouting capacity may have limited power at a global scale. An example is presented for Australian heathlands. Considering the combination of persistence at individual (resprouting) and at population (seed bank) level, the predictive power at local scale was significantly increased.

J	Christian, CE; Stanton, ML				Christian, CE; Stanton, ML			Cryptic consequences of a dispersal mutualism: Seed burial, elaiosome removal, and seed-bank dynamics	ECOLOGY												In moving seeds from one location to another, dispersers define the ecological context that a plant will experience throughout its lifetime. Because seed deposition sites may benefit one plant life cycle stage but not others, dispersal may give rise to a conflict between a plant's dispersal needs (e.g., predator escape) and its requirements for successful establishment (e.g., suitable habitat). In this study, we assessed the effects of two components of seed dispersal by ants (seed burial depth and elaiosome removal) at several stages during the recruitment of Leucospermum truncatulum, an ant-dispersed plant from the fynbos shrublands of South Africa. A seed-predator exclusion experiment revealed that the removal of elaiosomes significantly reduced rodent predation on seeds buried I cm deep and increased the viability of seeds that were not consumed. In contrast, we found that elaiosomes had no effect on the probability of a living seed emerging as a seedling. In a seed burial depth experiment in which predators were not excluded, deeper burial significantly enhanced seed survival, but this benefit came at the expense of reduced seedling emergence, delayed emergence, and smaller cotyledon size. Despite the potential importance of these seedling characteristics, elaiosomes and burial depth had no significant effect on seedling survival through the first year of this study. In contrast, burial depth had strong positive effects on the fraction of seeds that persisted in the seed bank. Although dormant individuals may die before germinating and reproducing, those that persist at greater soil depths can play a crucial role in rescuing populations from local extinction in unpredictable environments. Given the extreme variability in fire frequency in fynbos, the net effect of seed dispersal by ants on plant populations will depend on how temporal fluctuations in fire regimes influence cost-benefit thresholds related to seed dormancy and seed mortality.

Apart from the agricultural disadvantages, the environment and the marketing of the seeds may also be affected, particularly if plants with special ingredients or genetically modified (gm) plants are grown. In order to investigate the influence of soil cultivation and genotype on seed persistence and gene flow via volunteers, a field experiment was Set up testing four tillage treatments and two cultivars in a split-plot design. The cultivars tested were near-isogenic to two gm cultivars. To Simulate harvesting losses, 10 000 seeds m(-2) were broadcast on a soil in July. The Subsequent tillage treatments were combinations of immediate or delayed stubble tillage by a rotary tiller, primary tillage with plough or cultivator, or zero tillage. Over the following year, the fate of the seeds was determined. Immediate Stubble tillage with following cultivator or plough resulted in 586 resp. 246 seeds m(-2) in the soil seed bank. After delayed Stubble tillage With following Plough, 76 seeds m(-2) were found, and no soil seed hank was built up in the zero tillage treatment. Nevertheless, in the zero tillage treatment, several robust volunteer plants survived the herbicide application before the direct drilling in autumn until following spring. In the zero tillage treatment and in the cultivator treatment. 0.19 volunteers m(-2) resp. 0.06 Volunteers m(-2) flowered simultaneously to ordinarily sown oilseed rape ill the following crop of winter wheat and produced 73 resp. 18 seeds m(-2). Delayed Stubble tillage reduced the risk of gene escape via the soil seed bank, while zero tillage resulted in the highest risk of gene escape by pollen and by production of a new generation of seeds. In terms of labelling threshold for gm food this number of seeds would be below the threshold of 0.9% of transgenic parts in conventially bred food or feed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Burning of slash (woody debris) piles resulting from the harvest of fuel wood is a common management technique designed to reduce fire risk and increase establishment of understorey vegetation in many semi-arid woodlands. However, the consequences of slash burning on plant communities and their below-ground fungal mutualists are poorly understood. 2. We examined how the burning of slash piles affected understorey plant communities and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a pinyon-juniper woodland in northern Arizona, USA, 5 years after harvesting. We analysed plant communities and AM inoculum potential along 16 transects in: (i) burned slash pile sites; (ii) interspaces between burned slash piles; (iii) non-burned canopy sites; and (iv) non-burned interspaces. We quantified AM colonization of dominant native and exotic plants in burned and non-burned areas. 3. Burned areas had significantly fewer understorey plant species than non-burned areas, and exotic species were four times more abundant at burned slash sites than at other sites. 4. Exotic plants from burned and non-burned areas exhibited levels of AM colonization that were 50% greater than native plants. Bioassay and field-collected plants exhibited similar levels of AM colonization and there were no significant treatment differences. 5. The total biomass of bioassay plants grown in soil from burned slash sites averaged 19% greater than plant biomass from other sites, and had 27% more phosphorus in their shoot tissue; however, tissue nitrogen contents were similar. 6. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that either fire did not reduce AM inoculum potential, or that AM fungal populations recovered in the 5 years after the slash was burned. Changes in understorey plant communities and increases in exotic species with burning could result from other soil changes (e.g. species of AM fungi present), reduction of native species in the seed bank or greater dispersal ability of exotic plants compared with native plant species. We suggest that burning slash piles as a management tool in pinyon-juniper woodlands can result in plant communities that are persistently dominated by exotic species. Management approaches that utilize fuel wood harvest alone or that incorporate seeding of native plants may achieve the desired results.																	0021-8901					APR	2004	41	2					379	388		10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00889.x							WOS:000220587800016

The germination rate of the test species has increased by 23-25%, when the concentration of NO3--N or H2S in culture medium has increased to 2.0 ppm. At the treatment of enriched NH4+-N and PO43--p, the germination of resting cyst was increased. Nevertheless, the increased range in germination rates was less than those of NO3--N and H2S. When BOF slag in culture medium increased to 50 mg/ml (or 500 g/m(2)), the cyst germination rate fell to less than 5%. At higher level of concentrations germination was completely inhibited. Adding BOF slag to the culture medium reduced the concentration of inorganic salts and H2S in seawater and sediments, resulting in the inhibition of cyst germination. These findings demonstrate the potential use of BOF slag on the sediments seed bank of red tide organism because it has an ability to inhibit resting cysts germination.																	0254-8704					APR	2004	25	2					147	150									WOS:000220873800005	15529870

Soc. 131: 126-139. 2004-Seed dormancy and germination, flowering, and biomass allocation patterns of the deciduous forest species Chaerophyllum procumbens var. shortii were investigated relative to its winter annual life cycle. It was determined that seeds had nondeep simple morphophysiological dormancy at maturity in late May. The physiological component of dormancy was broken during summer, and embryos grew (morphological component) in autumn if seeds were exposed to light. Seeds sown in late spring germinated only in autumn, but a few did not germinate until the second to seventh autumn, indicting the potential to form a small persistent seed bank. Vernalization was not required for flowering. In the field, plant growth and development occur-red during autumn, winter, and early spring, and individual plants reached highest total plant biomass [0.28 +/- 0.01 g (mean +/- SE)] at flowering. Total plant biomass decreased from flowering to mericarp maturity. In two successive years, the proportion of total biomass allocated to roots (less than or equal to 22.2 +/- 2.9%) at five growth stages was less than that allocated to any other vegetative structure. Changes in biomass allocation during reproductive growth stages occurred only in above-ground structures. Although mass of reproductive structures was strongly correlated with plant vegetative mass, differences in slopes of the regressions between years indicated that between cohort differences in percent reproductive allocation were not completely accounted for by overall plant size.

J	Vekemans, X; Hardy, OJ				Vekemans, X; Hardy, OJ			New insights from fine-scale spatial genetic structure analyses in plant populations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Many empirical studies have assessed fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS), i.e. the nonrandom spatial distribution of genotypes, within plant populations using genetic markers and spatial autocorrelation techniques. These studies mostly provided qualitative descriptions of SGS, rendering quantitative comparisons among studies difficult. The theory of isolation by distance can predict the pattern of SGS under limited gene dispersal, suggesting new approaches, based on the relationship between pairwise relatedness coefficients and the spatial distance between individuals, to quantify SGS and infer gene dispersal parameters. Here we review the theory underlying such methods and discuss issues about their application to plant populations, such as the choice of the relatedness statistics, the sampling scheme to adopt, the procedure to test SGS, and the interpretation of spatial autocorrelograms. We propose to quantify SGS by an 'Sp' statistic primarily dependent upon the rate of decrease of pairwise kinship coefficients between individuals with the logarithm of the distance in two dimensions. Under certain conditions, this statistic estimates the reciprocal of the neighbourhood size. Reanalysing data from, mostly, published studies, the Sp statistic was assessed for 47 plant species. It was found to be significantly related to the mating system (higher in selfing species) and to the life form (higher in herbs than trees), as well as to the population density (higher under low density). We discuss the necessity for comparing SGS with direct estimates of gene dispersal distances, and show how the approach presented can be extended to assess (i) the level of biparental inbreeding, and (ii) the kurtosis of the gene dispersal distribution.

A long-term restoration study was initiated on a former pasture at the Fernald Environmental Management Project in southwestern Ohio. Our objective was to establish a planting design that has the potential to accelerate the restoration and succession of a site by creating structural complexity with uneven-aged stands of native trees. Changes in herbaceous vegetation composition were observed among the planting treatment by the end of the first growing season. We hypothesized that the vegetation differences could be attributed to recruitment from the seed bank following planting related disturbances. The standing vegetation and seed bank were evaluated to determine if differences in above-ground vegetation observed among plots could be explained by differences in composition of the seed bank. Using principle coordinates analysis (PCO), we found that herbaceous composition differed significantly (P <0.0001) from other planting treatments where high densities of saplings were planted, specifically due to a significant increase in perennial herbs (P <0.001). Based on cluster analysis, the seed bank and above-ground vegetation composition form two discrete groups, suggesting the seed bank does not fully account for standing vegetation. We attribute this compositional change to increased colonization via wind-dispersal and rhizome exposure of gaps created in the pasture grasses following planting disturbance. The results of this study suggest that disturbances related to restoration planting may dramatically alter the herbaceous vegetation composition of a site.																	0030-0950					APR	2004	104	2					20	28									WOS:000222185200003						
J	Ellsworth, JW; Harrington, RA; Fownes, JH				Ellsworth, JW; Harrington, RA; Fownes, JH			Seedling emergence, growth, and allocation of Oriental bittersweet: effects of seed input, seed bank, and forest floor litter	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The establishment of invasive plant populations is controlled by seed input, survival in the soil seed bank, and effects of soil surface disturbance on emergence, growth, and survival. We studied the invasive vine Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. (Oriental bittersweet) to determine if seedlings in forest understory germinate from the seed bank or from seed rain. We also conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the role of leaf litter mass and physical texture on seedling survival, growth, and allocation. In the understory of an invaded mixed hardwood forest, we measured seed input, seedling emergence with seed rain, and seedling emergence without seed rain. Mean seed rain was 168 seeds m(-2): mean seedling emergence was 107 m(-2), and there was a strong correlation between seed rain and seedling emergence. The ratio of seedlings to seed input (0.61) was close to the seed viability (0.66) leaving very few seeds to enter the seed bank. Seed bank germination under field conditions was low (1 seedling m(-2)). Soil cores were incubated in a greenhouse to determine seed bank viability, and germination from these soil cores did not occur. To determine how litter affects seedling establishment and growth, we measured seedling emergence and biomass allocation in a greenhouse experiment. Seeds were placed below intact and fragmented deciduous leaf litter in amounts ranging from zero to the equivalent of 16 Mg ha(-1). Seedling emergence was not affected by fragmented litter, but decreased to <20% as intact litter increased to 16 Mg ha(-1). Increasing litter resulted in greater allocation to hypocotyl and less to cotyledon and radicle, and this effect was greater in intact litter. C orbiculatus seedlings achieve emergence through forest floor litter through plasticity in allocation to hypocotyl growth. The low survival of C. orbiculatus in the seed bank suggests that eradication of seedling advance regeneration and adult plants prior to seed rain may be an effective control strategy. However, the intact forest floor litter of an undisturbed forest will not prevent seedling establishment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Enrico, L; Funes, G; Cabido, M				Enrico, L; Funes, G; Cabido, M			Regeneration of Polylepis australis Bitt. in the mountains of central Argentina	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Polylepis australis woodlands range from northern to central Argentina. They support a high number of endemisms (both plants and animals) and constitute the main cover type in watersheds contributing to retain soil and catch water. Natural regeneration of P australis in the Cordoba mountains, Argentina, was studied in two communities dominated by P australis: shrublands and woodlands. The main objectives of the study were: (1) to characterize shrublands and woodlands in terms of physical (physical and chemical soil properties) and biological (Polylepis' growth form, fern and moss cover) characteristics; (2) to describe P australis' soil seed bank and compare seedling and sapling establishment between both communities. The presence of seedlings as well as saplings was quantified, and soil samples were taken so as to characterize the seed bank. Results showed significant differences in habitat conditions between shrublands and woodlands. Seedlings' density was higher in the shrublands, while no differences appeared regarding the sapling numbers. A negative correlation was found between seedling numbers and total community cover as well as mosses and ferns cover. Seed density in the soil bank was higher in the woodlands, but overall seed viability was less than 5%. In the shrublands, the most critical stage of the species regeneration cycle was the transition from seedling to sapling, while in the woodlands the main "filter" occurred during seed germination. The low number of saplings observed in both units suggests a stagnation of R australis regeneration, which could be translated into an unlikely expansion of the species throughout the Cordoba mountains.

J	Benson, EJ; Hartnett, DC; Mann, KH				Benson, EJ; Hartnett, DC; Mann, KH			Belowground bud banks and meristem limitation in tallgrass prairie plant populations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Rhizome meristem populations were sampled in tallgrass prairie to quantify the size, grass : forb composition, and temporal and spatial variability of the soil bud bank and to compare fire effects on bud bank and seed bank composition. Soil cores (10.5 cm diameter, 15 cm deep) were collected from replicate annually and infrequently burned tallgrass prairie sites, and intact rhizomes and rhizome buds were censused. Bud bank densities ranged from approximately 600 to 1800 meristems/m(2) among sites and had high spatial and seasonal variability. In annually burned prairie, the total bud bank density was two-fold greater and the grass : forb meristem ratio was more than 30-fold greater than that of infrequently burned prairie. These patterns are opposite those observed in soil seed banks at this site. The rhizome population in annually burned prairie was 34% larger than the established aboveground tiller population. By contrast, the bud bank density in unburned prairie was significantly lower than aboveground stem densities, indicating possible belowground meristem limitation of stem density and net primary production on infrequently burned prairie. The patterns observed in this study suggest that the densities and dynamics of tallgrass prairie plant populations, as well as their response to disturbance (e.g., fire and grazing) and climatic variability, may be mediated principally through effects on the demography of belowground bud populations. Patterns of seed reproduction and seed bank populations have little influence on short-term aboveground population dynamics of tallgrass prairie perennials.																	0002-9122					MAR	2004	91	3					416	421		10.3732/ajb.91.3.416							WOS:000220331800012	21653397					
J	Peterson, JE; Baldwin, AH				Peterson, JE; Baldwin, AH			Seedling emergence from seed banks of tidal freshwater wetlands: response to inundation and sedimentation	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seed banks play a critical role in the maintenance of many wetland plant communities, and recruitment from the seed bank in response to environmental heterogeneity may influence species diversity and the spatial pattern seen in vegetation. Reduced recruitment in tidal freshwater wetlands in the Nanticoke River watershed (Maryland and Delaware, USA) may result from sediment input or sea level rise. An experimental test of the effects of inundation and sedimentation was conducted on seedling emergence from a pooled seed bank of tidal freshwater wetlands in a 2 x 5 factorial greenhouse experiment. Treatments were two levels of inundation (flooded and non-flooded) and five levels of sediment addition (0-2 cm depth). Twenty taxa emerged from the pooled wetland seed bank, with Leersia oryzoides and Typha species occurring the most frequently. A significant decrease was seen in seedling emergence due to flooding (P = 0.003), and the addition of sediment significantly decreased taxa density (P = 0.023) and seedling emergence (P = 0.0069). These findings suggest that the expression of species from the seed bank is largely controlled by sedimentation rates and hydrology, and that increases in sedimentation and relative sea level may reduce plant biodiversity of tidal freshwater wetlands.

J	Guevara, S; Laborde, J; Sanchez-Rios, G				Guevara, S; Laborde, J; Sanchez-Rios, G			Rain forest regeneration beneath the canopy of fig trees isolated in pastures of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico	BIOTROPICA												In the highly fragmented landscape of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we studied seed rain, seed bank, and vegetation established beneath the canopies of five fig trees (Ficus spp.) isolated in pastures. The area beneath the canopy of each fig tree was enclosed with a barbed wire fence to exclude cattle, and weeding with machete and herbicide spraying were stopped. Annual seed rain beneath the canopy of the five trees was 20,936 seeds (1066 seeds/m(2)) belonging to 149 species. Seed rain was dominated by woody species dispersed by frugivorous birds and bats. Most captured seeds (94%) were small (seed diam < 3 mm). A total of 6290 individuals from 78 species germinated from the seed bank (1258 seeds/m(2)). Ruderal herbs dominated the seed bank (52% of spp. and 77% of seeds). After three years of exclusion, a dense, 4-5 m tall understory comprised of woody plants developed beneath the canopy of the five fig trees. A total of 621 plants (4.6 plants/m(2)) from 95 species were recorded along 15 transects placed beneath the canopy of the fenced trees. Primary forest and pioneer tree and shrub species dominated species richness (55%) and abundance (37%) of established vegetation, but secondary and pioneer species had higher overall biomass. Most of the established plants (68%) had relatively large seeds (>3 mm). When cattle was excluded and management practices were stopped, remnant trees in Los Tuxtlas pastures effectively favored the early establishment of late successional species, including large-seeded canopy and subcanopy trees.

J	Ripley, BJ; Holtz, J; Simovich, MA				Ripley, BJ; Holtz, J; Simovich, MA			Cyst bank life-history model for a fairy shrimp from ephemeral ponds	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Ephemeral wetland habitats provide a useful model system for studying how life-history patterns enable populations to persist despite high environmental variation. One important life-history trait of both plants and crustaceans in such habitats involves hatching/germination of only some of the eggs/seeds at any time. This bet-hedging leads to the development of a bank composed of dormant propagules of many ages. 2. The San Diego fairy shrimp, Branchinecta sandiegonensis (Crustacea: Anostraca), a dominant faunal element of ephemeral ponds in San Diego, California, is a suitable organism for studying the consequences of highly fluctuating environmental conditions. As a result of large-scale habitat loss, the species is also endangered, and this motivated our specific study towards understanding the hatching dynamics of its egg bank for planning conservation efforts such as pool restoration and re-creation. 3. We formulated a matrix population model using egg age within the bank to study the relationship between adult survival and reproduction, and survival in and hatching from the egg bank. As vital rates for fairy shrimp are only poorly known, we generated 48 matrices with parameters encompassing ranges of likely values for the vital rates of B. sandiegonensis. We calculated population growth rates and eigenvalue elasticities both for a static model and a model with periodic reproductive failure. 4. The model shows that in good filling events, population growth rate is very high and the egg bank is increased dramatically. While population growth rate is insensitive to long-term survival in the egg bank in our static deterministic model, it becomes sensitive to survival in the egg bank when a regime of periodically failed reproductive events is imposed. 5. Under favourable conditions, it was best for shrimp to hatch from eggs as soon as possible. However, under a regime where failed reproductive events were common, it was best to hatch after several pool fillings. Because conditions change from favourable to unfavourable unpredictably, variation in age within the egg bank appears to be critical for the persistence of the population. This attribute needs to be carefully considered when restoring or creating new pools for conservation purposes.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2004	49	3					221	231		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01179.x							WOS:000188989600001						
J	Bisigato, AJ; Bertiller, MB				Bisigato, AJ; Bertiller, MB			Seedling recruitment of perennial grasses in degraded areas of the Patagonian Monte	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												The recruitment of perennial grass seedlings in degraded areas of the Patagonian Monte was analyzed. Recolonization of large bare-soil areas by dwarf shrubs or perennial grasses was hypothesized to create favorable microsites for grass seedling recruitment. Under natural field conditions, soil moisture (0-20 cm), root biomass (0-20 cm), the soil seed bank of perennial grasses, and density of perennial grass seedlings in the center of large bare soil areas and in microsites neighboring isolated plants of perennial grasses and dwarf shrubs were assessed. A manipulative experiment was conducted to evaluate seedling recruitment at the 3 microsites with identical density of seed addition of perennial grasses, under situations of root exclusion, and water addition. Under natural field conditions, root biomass did not differ among microsites. Soil moisture, seed density, and seedling density of perennial grasses were higher near perennial grasses than in bare soil or next to dwarf shrubs. Recruitment of perennial grass seedlings did not differ among microsites when the density of seeds did not vary among them or roots of the established plants were excluded. Water increased perennial grass seedling recruitment at all microsites. In degraded areas of the Patagonian Monte the spatial distribution of the soil seed bank followed by water availability are the main limiting factors of seedling recruitment of perennial grasses. Managerial practices oriented to maintain and increase the soil seed bank of perennial grasses, such as grazing exclusion during the grass reproductive period, might contribute to promote the re-establishment of perennial grasses.

J	Snogerup, S; Snogerup, B				Snogerup, S; Snogerup, B			Changes in the flora of some Aegean islets 1968-2000	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												The flora of 17 islets was studied during the period 1968-2000, with thorough inventories from 1971. At each visit the species present and their population sizes were noted. The flora of the smallest islets of hard rock consisted mainly of perennials, and remained unchanged in terms of species present throughout the period of study. In the larger and more complex islets the major part of the flora consisted of islet-specialised taxa staying for long periods of time. To them are added some other mostly casual species from the close large islands, introduced by human influence, birds or winds and standing for most of the turnover in the islets' flora. Few changes were observed in the plant communities of rock crevices, the spray zone of the shores and other constant habitats. The dominant perennial species forming layer of shrubs or subshrubs also mostly remained the same. Most of the changes concerned soil spaces opened by animals or erosion. Most annual species were found to survive by an extreme seed bank strategy. Many taxa common on the neighbouring islands were lacking or casual on the islets. Some others reached dominance or high frequencies that have not been observed on islands or in mainland areas. The conditions for the flora on the Aegean islets are considered to differ fundamentally from that on large isolated islands because they are situated comparatively close among each other and to islands and mainland areas. They are also vulnerable towards catastrophic events and therefore frequently presenting opened targets for invasions. The islet-specialised taxa are found to retain good ability for dispersal over moderately long distances. The grazing of the islets is stated to be an important factor for the evolution of islet adapted and specialised taxa.																	0378-2697					MAR	2004	245	3-4					169	213		10.1007/s00606-003-0100-4							WOS:000220725600003						
J	Korb, JE; Johnson, NC; Covington, WW				Korb, JE; Johnson, NC; Covington, WW			Slash pile burning effects on soil biotic and chemical properties and plant establishment: Recommendations for amelioration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Ponderosa pine forest restoration consists of thinning trees and reintroducing prescribed fire to reduce unnaturally high tree densities and fuel loads to restore ecosystem structure and function. A current issue in ponderosa pine restoration is what to do with the large quantity of slash that is created from thinning dense forest stands. Slash piling burning is currently the preferred method of slash removal because it allows land managers to burn large quantities of slash in a more controlled environment in comparison with broadcast burning slash. However burning slash piles is known to have adverse effects such as soil sterilization and exotic species establishment. This study investigated the effects of slash pile burning on soil biotic and chemical variables and early herbaceous succession on burned slash pile areas. Slash piles were created following tree thinning in two adjacent approximately 20-ha ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) restoration treatments in the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. We selected 30 burned slash pile areas and sampled across a gradient of the burned piles for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) propagule densities, the soil seed bank, and soil chemical properties. In addition, we established five 1-m(2) plots in each burned pile to quantify the effect of living soil (AM inoculum) and seeding amendments on early herbaceous succession in burned slash pile areas. The five treatments consisted of a control (no treatment), living soil (AM inoculum) amendment, sterilized soil (no AM inoculum) amendment, seed amendment, and a seed/soil (AM inoculum) amendment. Slash pile burning nearly eliminated populations of viable seeds and AM propagules and altered soil chemical properties. Amending scars with native seeds increased the cover of native forbs and grasses. Furthermore adding both seed and living soil more than doubled total native plant cover and decreased ruderal and exotic plant cover. These results indicate that seed/soil amendments that increase native forbs and grasses may enhance the rate of succession in burned slash pile areas by allowing these species to outcompete exotic and ruderal species also establishing at the site through natural regeneration.																	1061-2971					MAR	2004	12	1					52	62		10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00304.x							WOS:000189142700008						
J	Figueroa, JA; Jaksic, FM				Figueroa, JA; Jaksic, FM			Seed bank and dormancy in plants of the Mediterranean region of central Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Seed banks on Mediterranean regions display characteristics that distinguish them from the seed banks of other regions. A seed bank is the concentration of viable propagules buried in the soil for variable periods of time. Seed banks in the Chilean matorral are chiefly transient and functionally similar to seed banks in other Mediterranean ecosystems not disturbed by fire, except for those of Australia. A transient seed bank is that composed of seeds that cannot survive in the upper levels of the soil for more than I year. The density of herb seeds in the Chilean matorral soil is one of the highest among Mediterranean ecosystems anywhere in the world, and a large proportion of these seeds is made up of seeds without dormancy that germinate easily, particularly annual grasses. With respect to the dormancy mechanisms that may be responsible for the behavior of these seeds stored in the transient bank, our analysis revealed the following germination syndromes: (1) species whose seeds must be stratified in cold due to the presence of physiological dormancy (particularly introduced herbs), (2) species whose seeds must be scarified with acids or mechanical means due to the presence of physical dormancy (mainly native woody species) and, (3) species that present physiological dormancy and need heat stratification to activate germination (both native and introduced species). These syndromes determine that the timing of germination in central Chile has an autumn and an early spring phase. Besides, there is absence of sporadic germination syndromes for the components of a persistent seed bank. We propose a structural and functional model of the seed bank for the matorral of central Chile that should be enriched with future research.

Seed production and soil seed banks of H-contortus	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												Seed production and soil seed banks of H. contortus were studied in a subset of treatments within an extensive grazing study conducted in H. contortus pasture in southern Queensland between 1990 and 1996. Seed production of H. contortus in autumn ranged from 260 to 1800 seeds/m(2) with much of this variation due to differences in rainfall between years. Seed production was generally higher in the silver-leaved ironbark than in the narrow-leaved ironbark land class and was also influenced by a consistent stocking rate X pasture type interaction. Inflorescence density was the main factor contributing to the variable seed production and was related to the rainfall received during February. The number of seeds per inflorescence was unaffected by seasonal rainfall, landscape position, stocking rate or legume oversowing. Seed viability was related to the rainfall received during March. Soil seed banks in spring varied from 130 to 520 seeds/m2 between 1990 and 1995 with generally more seed present in the silver-leaved ironbark than in the narrow-leaved ironbark land class. There were poor relationships between viable seed production and the size of the soil seed bank, and between the size of the soil seed bank and seedling recruitment. This study indicates that H. contortus has the potential to produce relatively large amounts of seed and showed that the seasonal pattern of rainfall plays a major role in achieving this potential.																	0049-4763					MAR	2004	38	1					31	41									WOS:000220858700003

Common waterhemp survival declined as emergence was delayed in relation to soybean. Ninety percent of plants emerging at approximately the same time as soybean survived, whereas only 13% of plants emerging approximately 50 d after planting (DAP) survived to maturity. Biomass accumulation declined rapidly as emergence. was delayed in relation to soybean. Delaying emergence from 14 to 28 DAT resulted 0 DAP hemp emerging in a 50 to 80% reduction in shoot biomass. Common water, produced only 1 to 10% of the biomass of plants emerging at the same time as soybean. Plants emerging with soybean produced approximately 300,000 to 2.3 million seeds plant(-1) depending on the location. Fecundity of common waterhemp plants was closely related to biomass accumulation and declined rapidly with delayed emergence. Although common waterhemp emerging after the V4 stage of soybean (40 DAP) are unlikely to affect crop yield because of high mortality levels and reduced growth, these plants may contribute significant seeds to the soil seed bank.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	2004	52	2					242	245		10.1614/WS-03-004R							WOS:000220323300010

Four common waterhemp emergence cohorts were established in each experiment and corresponded to the VE, V3, V5, and V8 stages of corn grown in rows spaced 38 and 76 cm apart. Common waterhemp mortality averaged 20, 56, 97, and 99% for the first, second, third, and fourth cohorts, respectively. Mean mature common waterhemp height for the first cohort was 140 cm, whereas plants emerging at the V8 corn stage were only 5 cm tall. Biomass of the first cohort was 20% less in 38-cm rows than in 76-cm rows, but later cohorts were not affected by row spacing. Biomass and seed production of waterhemp emerging at the V3, V5, and V8 corn stages decreased 80, 97, and 99%, respectively in comparison with the first cohort. Overall results indicate that common waterhemp biomass, survival, and fecundity decline sharply with delayed emergence relative to corn, but weeds emerging at or before the V5 corn stage may still contribute significantly to the seed bank.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	2004	52	2					255	259		10.1614/WS-03-060R							WOS:000220323300012						
J	De Steven, D; Toner, MM				De Steven, D; Toner, MM			Vegetation of upper coastal plain depression wetlands: Environmental templates and wetland dynamics within a landscape framework	WETLANDS												Reference wetlands play an important role in efforts to protect wetlands and assess wetland condition. Because wetland vegetation integrates the influence of many ecological factors, a useful reference system would identify natural vegetation types and include models relating vegetation to important regional geomorphic, hydrologic, and geochemical properties. Across the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain, depression wetlands are a major hydrogeomorphic class with diverse characteristics. For 57 functional depression wetlands in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, we characterized the principal vegetation types and used a landscape framework to assess how local (wetland-level) factors and regional landscape settings potentially influence vegetation composition and dynamics. Wetland sites were stratified across three Upper Coastal Plain landscape settings that differ in soils, surface geology, topography, and land use. We sampled plant composition, measured relevant local variables, and analyzed historical transitions in vegetative cover types. Cluster analysis identified six vegetation types, ranging from open-water ponds and emergent marshes to closed forests. Significant vegetation-environment relationships suggested environmental "templates" for plant community development. Of all local factors examined, wetland hydrologic regime was most strongly correlated with vegetation type, but depression size, soil textural type, and disturbance history were also significant. Because hydrogeologic settings influence wetland features, local factors important to vegetation were partly predictable from landscape setting, and thus wetland types were distributed non-randomly across landscape settings. Analysis of long-term vegetation change indicated relative stability in some wetlands and succession in others. We developed a landscape-contingent model for vegetation dynamics, with hydroperiod and fire as major driving variables. The wetland classification, environmental templates, and dynamics model provide a reference framework to guide conservation priorities and suggest possible outcomes of restoration or management.																	0277-5212					MAR	2004	24	1					23	42		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0023:VOUCPD]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000220437800003						
J	Jensen, K				Jensen, K			Dormancy patterns, germination ecology, and seed-bank types of twenty temperate fen grassland species	WETLANDS												The germination ecology, including primary and secondary dormancy, mortality of seeds, and seed-bank type, of 20 fen grassland species from Northern Germany was investigated using a combination of burial and germination experiments. To analyze primary dormancy and effects of after-ripening (dry storage for 28 days) on freshly matured seeds, germination was measured at two fluctuating temperature regimes (15/25degreesC and 5/15degreesC) in the light and in darkness. Temporal changes in dormancy were investigated by burying seeds at 8-10 cm depth in nylon bags, exhuming samples at bimonthly intervals over a period of two years, and analyzing germination at the above-mentioned temperature and light treatments. Additional seed samples were retrieved five years after burial to determine seed longevity and seed-bank type. Freshly matured seeds of all species except Bromus racemosus showed primary dormancy. Dry after-ripening significantly increased germination in Parnassia palustris and Triglochin palustre. Mortality of buried seeds of Bromus racemosus, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Succisa pratensis reached 100% within 12 months (transient seed banks). All other species germinated both in the first and in the second growth period after burial and (with the exception of Briza media) showed annual changes in dormancy. For Silene flos-cuculi and Juncus filiformis, dormancy cycles were detected only in the dark treatments. Most species had a lower percentage germination in darkness than in the light, and the greatest suppression of germination in darkness was found in the small-seeded species (Juncus filiformis and Parnassia palustris). The retrieval of seed samples after five years revealed that most of the fen grassland species examined have short-term, persistent seed banks and thus are buffered against years of poor seed production and/or seedling survival. In addition, a large proportion of the species maintain long-term, persistent seed banks from which re-establishment is possible if management practices and site conditions of degenerated fen grasslands become appropriate following restoration measures.

J	Luoga, EJ; Witkowski, ETF; Balkwill, K				Luoga, EJ; Witkowski, ETF; Balkwill, K			Regeneration by coppicing (resprouting) of miombo (African savanna) trees in relation to land use	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study compared and contrasted natural regeneration by coppicing of tree species in a forest reserve and more disturbed adjacent public lands in eastern Tanzanian miombo woodlands. Data were collected between August and October 1997 using sixty-four 20 m x 50 m plots. Eighty-three percent of the 30 harvested woody species in the forest reserve resprouted after harvesting compared with 90% of the 39 species in the public lands. Coppicing effectiveness (mean number of shoots per stump) varied among species and depended on,plant size at the time of cutting, stump height and percentage of the stand removed. Comparing the 16 species effectively sampled in both sites, coppicing effectiveness was 4.9 +/- 1.6 (S.E.) shoots per stump in public lands, which is greater than the 3.1 +/- 1.4 shoots per stump in the reserve (paired t(15) = 2.433, P = 0.014). However, the percentage of resprouting stumps did not differ (paired t(15) = 1.440, P = 0.085), but tended to be higher in public lands. The percentages of stumps sprouting per species varied from 0 to 100%, with means of 59 (reserve) and 74% (public lands). Coppicing effectiveness for the most utilised species, Combretum molle (fuelwood; 4.0 shoots per stump in the reserve, 6.1 shoots per stump in public lands), Julbernardia globiflora (fuelwood; 5.6 vs. 5.3 shoots per stump), Pterocarpus angolensis (carpentry; absent vs. 7.3 shoots per stump) and Spirostachys africana (building poles; 1.0 vs. 0.4 shoots per stump) showed typical variation. The greater levels of resprouting in public lands is interpreted as release from self-thinning dynamics, as the reserve has a much higher tree biomass. Despite high levels of harvesting in public lands, tree densities are virtually identical between land uses as a result of the high levels of resprouting. Due to the prolific coppicing of trees in public lands, it is recommended that the woodland should be managed using coppice rotation as a silvicultural system. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Sapling densities may greatly increase in Pinus halepensis forest stands after fire. This study examines the effects of different post-fire silvicultural treatments on Aleppo pine forests at sites of different quality in Spain: dry (good) (Yeste, Albacete) and semiarid (worse) (Calasparra, Murcia) by monitoring permanent plots from 1999 to 2001. Changes occurring as a consequence of thinning (to a constant density of 1600 trees/ha), full scrubbing and pruning (to one-half to total height) practices were examined measuring diameter and total height of the trees in a 2-year interval. The growth (except on relative diameter increment) of Aleppo pine from Yeste was greater than from Calasparra, probably as a result of its better site quality. Thinning in the good quality site, and thinning plus scrubbing, in the worse quality one, were the treatments that most improved pine growth. Pruning, in contrast should not be carried out in any site, at least under the conditions of this study. The different response in total growth between plots for the same treatment was caused by differences in initial characteristics of the plots: micro-site quality (dominant height by plot) was important in the good quality site, whereas initial density (saplings/ha) was important in the worse quality one. Regarding fructification, treatments that included thinning plus scrubbing improved, 22 months later, the probability of cone production by a factor of 2.07 in relation to control.

J	Mayer, P; Abs, C; Fischer, A				Mayer, P; Abs, C; Fischer, A			Colonisation by vascular plants after soil disturbance in the Bavarian Forest - key factors and relevance for forest dynamics	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tree uprooting and timber harvesting cause soil disturbances in forests. Plants colonise disturbed patches in two ways: generative (with germination of seeds) and vegetative (with ramets). In this study, the relative importance of the two means of colonisation was assessed and the influences of seed availability and site conditions on colonisation were explored. In a mixed mountain forest in southern Germany, topsoil was disturbed experimentally and colonisation with vascular plants was observed afterwards for 15 months. The compositions of the soil seed bank and the seed rain were investigated. Experiments were carried out in 12 forest stands with different canopy covers and forest management histories. In each stand between 10 and 18 soil disturbance plots were established. Species richness on experimental plots was significantly higher I year after soil disturbance than before the disturbance. The most numerous species emerging after soil disturbance was Rubus idaeus, followed by species of the genus Carex. R. idaeus colonised disturbed plots both generatively and vegetatively, but the vegetative colonisation of this species was important only on clear-cuts with high light intensities. The decisive factor for generative colonisation (considering all species) was the number of germinable seeds of R. idaeus in the soil seed bank, whereas the seed rain was unimportant. The factor with the highest explanatory power for vegetative colonisation was the cover of the adjacent vegetation. The results indicate that soil disturbances in forests increase germination rates, which are responsible for small-scale increases in species richness. R. idaeus on clear-cuts has high cover values because (1) soil disturbances by vehicle traffic and timber hauling during the harvest enhance its germination and (2) the high light intensities on clear-cuts favour the spread of this species vegetatively. Since R. idaeus is a potential competitor for tree seedlings, these findings are important for planning forest management. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigate the consequences of both conditional (dispersed seeds cannot enter a dormant stage) and unconditional seed dormancy on the amount and the distribution of neutral genetic diversity within and among populations. We present joint demographic and population genetics models for single and subdivided populations and derive the effective size and population differentiation at both local and metapopulation scales. We suggest that a Wahlund effect is unlikely to result from age structure alone. Furthermore, the differentiation among populations is decreased by the presence of seed banks. We also extend these models to describe monocarpic (semelparous) perennial life cycle, where the nonreproductive stages are vegetative rosettes instead of dormant seeds. The main difference between the models relies in the way the density-dependent regulation is acting. The effective size of monocarpic perennial species may be less than the census number of individuals, and among-population differentiation is always larger than in annual species. We discuss our results in the light of recent population genetics surveys of annual plants with seed banks.

J	Carter, CT; Ungar, IA				Carter, CT; Ungar, IA			Relationships between seed germinability of Spergularia marina (Caryophyllaceae) and the formation of zonal communities in an inland salt marsh	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims The formation of zonal communities may be attributed to differences in germination across the community and to timing of germination of seeds present in the seed bank. Our goals were two-fold: (1) to assess the annual germination pattern of Spergularia marina; and (2) to determine whether germination of S. marina differed across zonal communities. Methods Fresh seeds were buried in an experimental garden in polyester bags. Bags were harvested monthly for 1 year and exposed to differing 12 h/12 h temperature regimes (5/15 degreesC, 5/25 degreesC, 15/25 degreesC and 20/35 degreesC) with a 12 h dark/12 h light photoperiod. Replicate seeds were exposed to 24 h dark. Seeds were also placed in different zonal communities to assess germinability in the field. Key Results Spergularia marina has a primary physiological dormancy. Conditional dormancy occurs from December to May and non-dormancy from June to November. Field germination initiates in the spring when temperatures are cool and salinity is low due to flooding, and ceases in the summer when temperatures exceed germination requirements. Spergularia marina has a light requirement for germination. Conclusions If seeds become buried in the field or are light inhibited by Phragmites australis, they will remain dormant until they receive an adequate amount of light for germination. Since S. marina can germinate across all zones in a salt-marsh community, the formation of zonal communities is not determined at the germination stage, but at some later stage of development.

J	Menges, ES; Quintana-Ascencio, PF				Menges, ES; Quintana-Ascencio, PF			Population viability with fire in Eryngium cuneifolium: Deciphering a decade of demographic data	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												We analyzed and modeled the demography of Eryngium cuneifolium, an herbaceous species endemic to the fire-prone Florida scrub, using 10 annual censuses (1990-1999) of 11 populations at Archbold Biological Station. Nearly every aspect of the demography of this plant is affected by time since fire. Year, time since fire, life history stage, and plant age affected survival, growth, and fecundity of E. cuneifolium, but time since fire and life history stage had the most consistent effects. Survival, flowering stem production, and early seedling survival were highest in recently burned sites. Long-term survival, growth, and fecundity were highest for yearling cohorts recruiting recently after fire, with the largest contrast between plants recruiting two years postfire and those recruiting more than a decade postfire. Prior (historical) stage also affected individual plant fates. For example, plants with prior stasis or regression in stage subsequently died in greater numbers than plants with prior advancement in stage. Historical analyses did not suggest any cost associated with the initiation of flowering. We used a matrix selection approach to explicitly model Eryngium cuneifolium population viability in relation to fire. This simulation strategy included preserving observed data and variances within projection matrices formed for individual combinations of population and year. We built 54 of these matrices, each with six stages (seed bank, yearlings, vegetative plants, and three reproductive stages). Each of these matrices also represented a specific time since fire. In building matrices, we minimized the use of pooled data while retaining specific matrices whenever possible. In this way, we preserved both the correlation structure within individual matrices (populations, years) and protected patterns among matrices across the time-since-fire gradient. To deal with less-detailed data on recruitment processes, we evaluated 13 fertility and seed bank scenarios that bracketed a range of outcomes. All scenarios were similar in showing the positive effects of fire on the demography of E. cuneifolium. The scenario with high seed bank survival (0.5) and low germination rates (0-0.005) was the best predictor of observed postfire years of peak aboveground population size (similar to8 yr) and aboveground population disappearance (30-34 yr), and also did a good job of reproducing observed population trajectories. Finite rates of increase (lambda) were > 1 only during the first decade postfire but then declined beyond a decade postfire. Although prior (historical) stage affected most individual demographic parameters, it did not significantly influence finite rates of increase. Elasticities were highest for stasis and germination from the seed bank. Elasticities for survival increased with time since fire, while growth and fertility elasticities decreased. In historical models (those with information on stage from the second-to-last year), the elasticities for stasis were higher and the elasticities for growth lower, compared to models without this history. Bootstrapping suggested small standard errors for several types of model output. Most matrix elements were positively correlated, suggesting that favorable conditions affect many life history stages similarly, and that simulations using element selection would provide a less conservative risk assessment than the matrix selection technique used. We used a stochastic simulation program to simulate changing demography with time since fire, with various fire-return intervals, and for various initial population sizes. We obtained estimates of extinction risk and probability of population decline. Even populations as large as thousands of individuals will become extinct in the absence of fire. Fire-return intervals of 15 yr or less are necessary for E. cuneifolium persistence at individual sites. Fires at intervals longer than 20 yr create substantial extinction risks, and intervals longer than 12 yr produce declining populations. Cycles of widely divergent, alternating short and long fire-return intervals caused slightly higher chances of extinction compared to regular fire-return intervals. Although shrub regrowth is implicated in the decreased viability of E. cuneifolium populations under regimes of infrequent fire, aboveground fuel increases are often too slow to allow frequent burning in Florida rosemary scrub. If E. cuneifolium's rosemary scrub habitat burns less often than every 20 yr, local extinctions and metapopulation dynamics may be the norm. Other rosemary scrub specialists (e.g., Hypericum cumulicola) thrive with less frequent fires and persist in smaller gaps among the regrowing shrubs. Therefore, we suggest that temporal variation in fire-return intervals and spatial variation in fire intensity and patchiness (pyrodiversity) will allow coexistence of all Florida scrub species and hedge against local extinctions of specialists like E. cuneifolium.

J	Combroux, ICS; Bornette, G				Combroux, ICS; Bornette, G			Propagule banks and regenerative strategies of aquatic plants	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The role of the propagule bank in aquatic plant maintenance was studied in two riverine wetlands. Four sites were selected, characterized respectively by flooding, drying up. both disturbances operating, and neither operating. Our hypothesis was that recolonization after drying up would mostly involve seeds and buds from the propagule bank, whereas recolonization after floods would mostly involve rhizomes. Dry sites were characterized by a high density of seeds. and a high similarity between seed species and established vegetation. Unspecialized fragments remaining in wet parts of the sediment probably also contribute to species maintenance, Species maintenance in sites subjected to flooding was highly dependent on deeply anchored rhizomes, as indicated by the strong floristic similarity between species that occur in the established vegetation and rhizomes in the bank. Regeneration of the community after scouring floods also involved seeds. some species being able to flower under water. When scouring flooding and drying up were superimposed, regenerative strategies exhibited in the bank did not simply result from the 'addition' of the two disturbance effects. When the disturbances did not occur too closely together in time, species were able to survive either by: (1) producing many propagules under aquatic conditions or (2) coping with the temporal variability by producing several types of propagules.

J	Kahmen, S; Poschlod, P				Kahmen, S; Poschlod, P			Plant functional trait responses to grassland succession over 25 years	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Many grasslands and arable fields have been abandoned in Europe in the last decades. So far, however, ecologists have not been able to establish one general, unifying theory for successionally induced chances in species composition following abandonment. In fact, the course of succession seems to be unique for each site and year. Here we focused on the analysis of plant functional traits in order to detect general trends in trait responses to succession which would prove independent of site characteristics. We studied permanent plot series of 14 grassland sites in SW Germany that had been abandoned for 25 yr. Species composition as well as the course of succession varied significantly among the grasslands. Response to succession was analysed for the following traits: 'plant height', 'canopy structure', 'specific leaf area' (SLA), 'storage organs, 'vegetative spread', 'plant persistence', 'seed bank longevity. 'start of flowering', 'duration of flowering' and 'seed mass'. We compared a univariate with a multi-variate approach. In the univariate approach, attributes of each trait were analysed separately employing GLM whereas in the multivariate approach all traits were handled together in NMS. Both analyses indicated similar trait responses to succession. There was a significant increase in the proportion of species characterized by the following attributes: plant height > 0.6 in leaves distributed regularly along the stern, vegetative spread > 100 mm. start of flowering later than May, duration of flowering 1-2 months and seeds of either low or high mass.

J	Ghermandi, L; Guthmann, N; Bran, D				Ghermandi, L; Guthmann, N; Bran, D			Early post-fire succession in northwestern Patagonia grasslands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Large-scale disturbances, notably fire and grazing, structure grass and shrubland dynamics in semi-arid environments. We studied early post-fire succession in two burned grasslands. one unburned grassland, and one shrubland near the burned area. We observed three processes: (1) establishment of a 'phantom' community comprised of fugitive species. Although transient. these species increase diversity and recharge the seed bank before the next disturbance; (2) regeneration of the original community by persistence of resprouter species and by auto-replacement;, (3) early stages of invasion by seedlings of the shrub Fabiana imbricata, which germinate next to shrubland and create new F. imbricata patches. Weed invasion vas principally due to the ruderal exotic species Verbascum thapsus from the nearby road verge and by rapid increase of Rumex acetosella cover. another exotic species present before the fire. Although post-fire climatic conditions are particularly important in semi-arid environments, Succession depends greatly on the regeneration strategies and dispersal abilities of the species present in the burned area. The phantom community occurs only at the first stage of succession when there is little competition for resources. We could call this process 'the race for occupation of the area'. The second stage. when competition for resources becomes progressively more important, could be called 'the effort to maintain space'.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				FEB	2004	15	1					67	76		10.1658/1100-9233(2004)015[0067:EPSINP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000221005200009						
J	Holzel, N; Otte, A				Holzel, N; Otte, A			Assessing soil seed bank persistence in flood-meadows: The search for reliable traits	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												To assess seed bank persistence of target species in endangered flood-meadows (alliances Cnidion and Molinion), we investigated established vegetation and soil seed bank of 46 plots for 3 yr and 2 yr, respectively. As traits of seed persistence we calculated various continuous indices that refer to the frequency and abundance of species in above-ground vegetation and at different soil depths. Furthermore, we tested the si,significance and Soundness of easily observed traits such as maximum seed density per plot and seed attributes (mass, size and shape) as predictors of soil seed bank features. In linear regression, SAL the seed accumulation index, showed the best agreement (R-2 = 0.64) with the seed longevity index that was derived from the database by Thompson et al. (1997) for a set of 115 species. The second best predictor (R-2 = 0.39) of the seed longevity index was maximum seed density per plot in the lower soil layer (5-10 cm). Depth distribution indices and seed attributes showed weaker but still significant relations. The dynamic character of flood-meadows was reflected by a large proportion of species with a strong tendency to accumulate seeds in the soil relative to their importance in above-around vegetation. Most of these species have a ruderal strategy;. exploiting gaps after flood disturbances, while the dominants of flood-meadows tended to have short-lived seed banks. Compared to other grassland types, a relatively large proportion of rare and endangered target species can be expected to form long-term persistent seed banks. However, only under marginal conditions that facilitate seed survival in the soil (e.g. fallow) are these persistent seed banks likely to contribute to restoration. We conclude that easily observed traits of persistence such as seed weight. size and shape do not meet the accuracy needed in scientific and practical applications. Thus, there is a crucial demand for further seed bank studies in poorly investigated habitats and of rare species.

Of the 165 vascular plant species native to Svalbard, 72 were present as mature plants at the Study sites and of these 70% germinated seed. Proglacial soil had 12 seedlings per m(2), disturbed Dryas heath 131. intact Dryas heath 91, polar heath 715. thermophilic heath 3113, and a bird cliff 10437 seedlings. Highest seed batik species richness was at the thermophilic heath (26 species). Seedlings of 27 species emerged in the field. with fewer seedlings in disturbed habitats (60 seedlings per m(2)) than in intact Dryas heath (142), suggesting that an absence of 'safe sites' limited seedling establishment in disturbed habitats. Measurement of seedling emergence in the field increased awareness of which species are able to germinate naturally. This may be underestimated by up to 31% if greenhouse trials alone are used. owing partly to unsuitability Of greenhouse conditions for germination of some species and also to practical limitations of amount of soil sampled. Most thermophilic species failed to germinate and some species present at several sites only germinated from the thermophilic heath seed batik. suggesting that climate constrains recruitment from seeds in the High Arctic.

J	Walters, GM				Walters, GM			Perennial plants and ephemeral seed banks in Papago Park, Phoenix, Arizona	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												The park system of Phoenix, Arizona was established in the early 1900's. At that time, it contained mountains and buttes but is now enclosed by urban development. Since that time, Phoenix has become one of the fastest expanding cities in the United States which has resulted in increased use of local parks. The original Saguaro National Monument, once located within Phoenix, lost its protected status in 1930, later becoming a city park (Papago Park) with heavy recreational use. To assess differences in ephemeral and perennial plant diversity and density within and outside Papago Park, perennial plants were surveyed in plots and ephemeral plant populations were assessed via soil seed bank germination. Results were compared to an undisturbed adjacent area. Density of both ephemeral and perennial plants was significantly reduced within the park as was perennial diversity, notably ferns and succulents. Ephemeral diversity and density were greater beneath shrub canopies regardless of site. While ephemeral plants have short reproductive cycles, perennials are potentially more affected by recreation possibly due to longer exposure to harsh conditions before reaching reproductive maturity. In undisturbed parts of the Sonoran Desert, perennial plants hold a critical place in the ecosystem providing shady, protected habitat for the germination of succulent, ephemeral, and other perennial plants. This case study suggests that perennials are key in maintaining plant diversity and density in Papago Park and that their loss may have a negative effect on all plant recruitment in that community.																	0885-8608					FEB	2004	24	1					36	43									WOS:000189318300005
