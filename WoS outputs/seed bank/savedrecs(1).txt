J	Sosa, JLR; Espinosa, CA; Milanes, JYR				Rodriguez Sosa, Jose Luis; Aguilar Espinosa, Calixto; Rodriguez Milanes, Jose Yulier			Primary seed dispersal spatial patterns of Juglans jamaicensis C. DC. subsp. Jamaicensis	REVISTA CUBANA DE CIENCIAS FORESTALES												This work was carried out in two Zonal Units of Conservation of the Turquino National Park, with the seeds of seven trees in six locations, to characterize the dispersal of the seeds of Juglansjamaicensis subsp. jamaicensis in a protected area of national significance. For this, it was determined the dispersion of the seeds in parcels of 1 x 1 m located each 2 m along four 50-m length radial transects, guided toward the four cardinal points, from the base of the donating tree of seeds. Results revealed that the density of the seeds of Juglansjamaicensis dispersed on the surface of the ground, declined markedly with the distance from the plant. Maximum seed-dispersal distance was 23 m, and average distance was 13 m around the trees, comprising 84% of dispersed seeds. Seed dispersal varied among the cardinal points, resulting in an asymmetric distribution pattern biased toward the north, as consequence of the land slope. Seed density on the ground surface averages 12 seeds per m(2), forming a small seed bank under natural conditions. These elements constitute indicators of fragility of the species in front of interferences and external factors as well as the contagious distribution pattern of the species in the forest.																	2310-3469					MAY-AUG	2018	6	2					172	183									WOS:000444832900005

As a key hotspot for endemic biodiversity in Peru, it also has conservation value. Thus, ecological restoration strategies need to be developed to ensure that mining impacts on these biodiversity values are minimized. As a step toward this larger objective, we measured the composition of the soil seed bank on the Peruvian Altiplano and compared it with the standing vegetation in different plant communities. We calculated evolved persistence traits to evaluate the suitability of topsoil removal, storage, and redeployment as an ecological restoration strategy for the Peruvian Altiplano. The comparison demonstrates low similarities (Sorensen Index for sites A: 0.15, B:0.27, C:0.11, and D:0,12) between the seed bank and the standing vegetation. The flora of the germinable soil seed bank is dominated by ephemeral species. Meanwhile, the standing flora contains a higher percentage of perennial species, many of which invest in the capacity to persist via resprouting from underground storage organs. It is clear that the well-established restoration technique of topsoil removal, storage, and redeployment needs to be tested and will probably need modification to be an effective strategy for the Peruvian Altiplano. The required modifications are relatively straightforward and would ensure that this low-cost and effective restoration technique could be applied to good effect on the Peruvian Altiplano.

However, such impact of fragmentation has not always been consistently confirmed by previous studies and the issue still needs further research. Particularly little is known about the impact of fragmentation on steppe plants. Steppe once covered vast, continuous areas, and nowadays is among the most fragmented biomes. In Ukraine, remnants of this habitat survived in large but few nature reserves and loess ravines as well as on kurgans (burial mounds of ancient nomadic people), which, despite their small size, are still numerous and scattered throughout the landscape. We studied the impact of fragmentation on the genetic diversity and structure of Iris pumila, a typical species of European steppes, Our main focus was to compare the genetic characteristics between kurgan populations (n = 8), and populations from larger refugia (n = 6). We assessed The genetic diversity of the studied populations with Universal Rice Primers. Our analyses revealed high genetic diversity across all investigated populations (mean He: 0.233; mean PPB: 58.57). However in kurgan populations genetic diversity was significantly higher than in larger refugia. Genetic diversity (He) was negatively correlated with population size. Most of the molecular variance (82%) was represented within populations, whereas genetic differentiation among populations was moderate (Phi(ST) = 0.160), and low among refugia types (Phi(RT) = 0.026). The maintenance of high genetic diversity despite two centuries of fragmentation may be related to the moderate disturbance occurring on kurgans, which enhances the sexual reproduction of the species. Moreover, we assume that species traits such as longevity and polyploidy might counterbalance genetic drift, while its self-incompatibility and presence of a soil seed bank allows for the replenishment of the gene pool. Overall, our results suggest that kurgans can protect genetic diversity of steppe species. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft far Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Huebner, CD; McGill, DW				Huebner, Cynthia D.; McGill, David W.			The Importance of Disturbance versus Physiography in Defining Vegetation Composition and Predicting Possible Successional Trajectories	CASTANEA												Regional (climate/soils) and local (aspect) physiography determine plant community composition. However, changes in initial floristic composition after a disturbance may be severe enough to alter the successional trajectory predicted by physiography. We addressed the question of which is more important, disturbance or physiography, in determining vegetation composition and the consequent successional trajectory. We evaluated understory vegetation of forest communities exposed to four disturbance types (control, single burn, diameter-limit cut, and first-removal shelterwood) 2-5 yr postdisturbance. Study sites were located within each disturbance type on northeast and southwest aspects within the Appalachian Plateau and the Ridge and Valley provinces. Vegetation composition was analyzed with nonmetric-multidimensional scaling, two-way nonparametric multivariate ANOVA, and indicator species analysis. The relationship between disturbance and key environmental variables, including canopy opening and soil fertility, was analyzed with generalized linear mixed models. There were 363 species in our study area. Composition differed by province and aspect. Composition also differed by disturbance but with a significant province interaction. Although physiography was more important, some species served as disturbance indicators that differed by disturbance type with two possible outcomes. First, expected successional trajectories (as defined by the regional and local environmental filters) may deviate toward recovery of native species (e.g., Epigaea repens) that benefit from low-level disturbance (as defined by fire as a filter). Second, successional trajectories after a relatively severe disturbance (as defined by shelterwood harvest as a filter) may deviate toward systems that are vulnerable to invasion by exotics or dominant native species.																	0008-7475	1938-4386				MAY	2018	83	1					54	76		10.2179/17-139							WOS:000431791200005

Shallow and deep water aquatic vegetation potential for a midlatitude pool of the Upper Mississippi River System with drawdown	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Prior to navigation dam and levee placement, the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) flowed through a wide floodplain supporting a diverse ecosystem. Diversity was created by variable flood frequencies and water flow, but presently high and static water levels supporting river navigation have caused low diversity of aquatic vegetation in locations within the UMR. A pool-scale water level drawdown was proposed as a wetland management tool to mimic historic low water flow for UMR Navigation Pool 18, between Oquawka and Keithsburg, IL. The objectives of this research are to determine plant species, density, and diversity expected for a drawdown in Pool 18. A seedbank and propagule assay was used to evaluate drawdown plant species response. Emergence was tested using river bottom substrate samples collected in 2009 from the proposed drawdown area. Samples were treated at two hydrologic levels: shallow (3-cm depth) and deep (16-cm depth). Dominant species in the shallow flooded treatment were Gratiola neglecta, Leersia oryzoides, Eleocharis palustris, Sagittaria latifolia, and Ammania coccinea. Deep flooded dominant taxa included G.neglecta, S.latifolia, Vallisneria americana, and A.coccinea. Each treatment indicated a seedbank of moderate diversity with a shallow treatment diversity of D=0.56 and deep treatment diversity of D=0.44. Plant density for the shallow flooded treatment was 213 stems/m(2) (+/- 112; 95% CI), and deep flooded hydrologic treatment, 206 stems/m(2) (+/- 82; 95% CI). It is expected that this drawdown will provide an intermediate ecological disturbance resulting in greater species diversity and density currently lacking in this portion of the Upper Mississippi River System.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				MAY	2018	34	4					310	316		10.1002/rra.3260							WOS:000431674200003						
J	Strobl, K; Schmidt, C; Kollmann, J				Strobl, Katharina; Schmidt, Claudia; Kollmann, Johannes			Selecting plant species and traits for phytometer experiments. The case of peatland restoration	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Phytometers are indicator transplants that provide information on site conditions based on plant survival, growth and reproduction. Since this is a relatively new approach, standards for its implementation remain to be defined, for example, during peatland restoration. Peatland restoration frequently aims at recovering characteristic communities, and a key attribute of successfully restored ecosystems is their capacity to sustain viable populations of target species. When not actively introduced, these species are expected to establish on their own after improving site conditions, for example by rewetting. Assessments to determine whether this goal is met require the long-term monitoring of species' presence, whereas the underlying causes of these observations, i.e. site or dispersal limitation, often remain unknown. Using phytometers within ecological restoration helps addressing this question. The goal of this study is to compare the responses of several species and traits to environmental conditions in restored peatlands. Three target species (Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum, Vaccinium oxycoccos) were planted in restored montane peatlands in central Germany, while in a greenhouse experiment, the same species were grown on peat from the field sites and exposed to two water levels. Several plant traits were measured and compared with variation in light, water and soil conditions. The response to habitat conditions was species-specific, indicating that the use of different phytometers increases the reliability of monitoring. Survival and growth traits were suitable to assess a wide range of abiotic conditions, while differences in reproductive output were more time-consuming to measure. Survival provided the most conclusive results for species sensitive to stressful habitat conditions. Biomass and other size metrics of the phytometers, as well as growth and reproductive traits were partly redundant. Thus, we suggest recording survival and biomass and use non-destructive growth measurements for repeated assessments, while the choice of the most suitable size trait should depend on the growth form. Our study stresses the potential of phytometers for monitoring the restoration outcome, while highlighting the importance of species and trait selection.

We examined the floristic similarity among areas and determined the regional diversity along this gradient in Serra do Cip6 (Minas Gerais, Brazil). A total of 1975 individuals from 149 species were germinated. Richness and abundance were not linearly related to elevation, and exhibited a threshold at 1200 m. The low degree of similarity among the areas reflects environmental heterogeneity, resulting from a rich mosaic of habitats, distinguished by the substrate configuration, continuity of vegetation, floristic composition, and proportion of exposed rock. The diversity between plots of different areas (beta) contributed to regional diversity, and species turnover was the most important factor. The physical variables and base saturation, which had high spatial heterogeneity, may be the most important factors with which to determine species turnover and p diversity. The studied seed bank is strongly influenced by edaphic variables, with a gradient of increasing acidity and proportion of fine sand, and decreasing proportion of clay and organic matter, with elevation. In addition, species richness was influenced by cation exchange capacity, organic matter, and clay; and abundance was influenced by cation exchange capacity, H + Al, organic matter, and base saturation.

Fire severity drives variation in post-fire recruitment and residual seed bank size of Acacia species	PLANT ECOLOGY												Very high-severity fires are a component of many fire-prone ecosystems, yet are often viewed as detrimental to vegetation. However, species in such systems are likely to have adapted to persist under a fire regime that includes high-severity fires. We examined how fire severity affects post-fire recruitment and residual seed banks of Acacia species and whether severity may affect plant responses to fire intervals. Nine sites of either high or low burn severity were identified after a large-scale mixed-severity fire in Warrumbungle National Park, south-eastern Australia. Transects were used to sample above-ground woody plant density. Seed bank size was surveyed by soil extraction from two depths and manual searching for seeds. Residual soil seed bank and recruitment were compared across the two burn severities. Acacia seedling density was higher in areas burnt at high severity, indicating that increased severity triggers increased germination from the seed bank. Size of residual seed bank was smaller after high-severity fire, but varied between species, with few Acacia cheelii seeds remaining despite high above-ground abundance. In contrast, A. penninervis retained a small residual seed bank. There was little evidence of negative effects on populations of Acacia species after high-severity burns. However, we found that high fire severity may impact on the ability of a species to persist in response to a subsequent short fire interval. Fire management for maintaining biodiversity needs to consider other key aspects of the fire regime, including severity and season, rather than focusing solely on fire frequency.

It is the largest ex situ conservation programme in the world, currently involving 96 countries and territories. Where possible, seeds are collected and conserved in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to RBG Kew's MSB for storage. In this paper we assess the conservation value of the germplasm stored at the MSB using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The MSB holdings represent a high quality, rich biological resource. Substantial and unique taxonomic diversity exists amongst the collections, representing 365 families, 5813 genera, 36,975 species and 39,669 taxa conserved. The collections cover a wide geographic range, originating from 189 countries and territories, representing all nine bio-geographic regions and all 35 biodiversity hotspots. The collections possess significant natural capital and population value: 32% of taxa, representing 49% of collections, have at least one identified use to humans; and 74% of taxa, representing 78% of collections, are either endemic, endangered (nationally or globally) and/or have an economic, ecological, social, cultural or scientific value. While 10% of taxa, representing > 8% of collections, are either extinct, rare or vulnerable to extinction at the global and/or national level, 20% of taxa, representing 13% collections, are endemic at the country or territory scale. Over the 17-year period since 2000 at least 11,182 seed samples, representing 12% of taxa and 8% of collections, have been distributed globally for conservation, research, education and display. This analysis highlighted collection gaps in MSB holdings in relation to their geographic representativeness, the taxonomic diversity of large families and genera of angiosperms, and coverage of threatened taxa. Further analysis across the entire MSB Partnership is required to underpin future collection activities and maximize the usefulness of collections.

P.; Pandey, Rakesh; Paul, Sangeeta; Ghosh, Sourav			Impacts of tillage and herbicide mixture on weed interference, agronomic productivity and profitability of a maize Wheat system in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Weeds comprising of annual monocotyledons, dicotyledons and perennial Cyperus rotundus L. (hereafter referred to as nutsedge) are important constraints in maize-wheat production system in India. They can cause yield losses of 25-30% in maize and 10-25% in wheat. Recently, continuous use of selective herbicides has led to an increase of nutsedge and other annual weeds in maize. There is need for a broad-spectrum weed control strategy that includes control of nutsedge in maize. Herbicide mixtures, containing a nutsedge killer partner herbicide may prove to be more effective for this. Imazethapyr among herbicides available in India possesses nutsedge-killing action, but the tolerance of maize to this herbicide, which is usually recommended for application as post emergence in soybean and groundnut, is variable. We observed dose-dependent selectivity/tolerance of maize to imazethapyr when applied as post-emergence in a previous trial. Imazethapyr's pre-emergence application may prove more useful in offering selectivity to maize, but is hardly studied. In addition, its residual/carry-over effect may lead to weed control in following wheat crops grown in sequence with maize, economizing production costs of the maize-wheat system. Therefore, this experiment was designed to evaluate the efficacy of imazethapyr against weeds including nutsedge, and its selectivity in maize crops when applied as pre-emergence in tank mixture with pendimethalin; to compare these tank-mixtures effects with that of the sequential applications of pendimethalin (pre-emergence) and imazethapyr (post-emergence) in maize; and to evaluate their residual actions combined with tillage and crop residue in wheat under a maize - wheat system. The application of pre-emergence tank-mixture of pendimethalin 0.75 kg a.i. ha(-1) + imazethapyr 0.050 kg a.i. ha(-1) caused significant reductions in densities of broad-leaved (30%), nutsedge (45.2%), grassy (79.7%) and total weeds (49.1%) compared with un-weeded control (UWC) in maize. It reduced total weed dry weight by 58.3% and gave 56.1% higher maize yields than UWC. Among the tillage treatments adopted in the wheat crop, zero tillage (ZT) + residue (R) resulted in 14.0% greater reductions in weed dry weight and 6.9% higher wheat yields than conventional tillage (CT). It increased maize-wheat system productivity by 5.4% and 7%, respectively over CT and ZT without residue. The application of a tank-mixture of pendimethalin + imazethapyr gave 2.9% lower system productivity, but 8.2% higher net returns than the weed-free control, reducing the weed seed bank by 65% at 0-15 cm soil layer in two years. The application of this tank-mixture (in maize), followed by ZT + residue (in wheat) was more remunerative and could lead to better weed control with 25% and 50% lower doses of pendimethalin and imazethapyr, respectively, and 50% reduction in application cost. This practice can be adopted in maize-wheat system under irrigated conditions in the North-western Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and in similar agro-ecologies of the tropics and sub-tropics. This result can also be applicable to cropping systems like maize - mustard, maize - barley/oat, subject to further evaluation and refinement under field conditions.																	0378-4290	1872-6852				APR 15	2018	219						180	191		10.1016/j.fcr.2018.02.003							WOS:000428007800018

Chemicals that regulate the functions of SLs may therefore have the potential to become widely used in agricultural applications. For example, various SL analogs and mimics have been developed to reduce the seed banks of root parasites in the field. Other analogs and mimics act selectively to suppress branching, with weak, or no stimulation, of germination in root parasites. In addition, some antagonists for SL receptors have been developed based on the mechanisms of SL perception. A better understanding of the modes of action of SL perception by various receptors will help to support the design of SL analogs, mimics, and antagonists with high activity and selectivity. Here, we review the compounds reported so far from the viewpoint of their selectivity to their targets, and the possibilities for their use in agriculture.																	0022-0957	1460-2431				APR 13	2018	69	9			SI		2241	2254		10.1093/jxb/ery126							WOS:000430727000006	29635308

For this purpose, we analyzed the taxonomic diversity and abundance of seedlings from the soil seed bank in the thickets of the invasive ash-leaved maple Acer negundo L. We performed our experiments using the seedlings emerged from soil seed banks collected in two types of habitats in Yekaterinburg (dense thickets of A. negundo and habitats with similar geomorphological and edaphic features but without A. negundo). In addition, we analyzed the seedlings emerged from sod-podzolic soils collected from suburban meadow areas. We observed a small negative effect of A. negundo on the abundance of seedlings from the soil seed bank. The amount of seedlings on the soil from the thickets of A. negundo was lower by 1.5-2.5 times than in urban habitats without this species. The taxonomic diversity of seedlings differed between suburban and urban habitats but did not depend on the presence of habitat transformation by A. negundo.																	2075-1117	2075-1125				APR	2018	9	2					108	113		10.1134/S2075111718020133							WOS:000457638700002

In 2013, the F4-unit was divided into three subunits and planted with different compositions of emergent macrophytes (Phragmites australis, Iris pseudacorus, and a mixture of several macrophytes: F4-Reed, F4-Iris and F4-Mixed subunits). Two nine-month periods were monitored after planting, and water quality variables were measured in the inflows and outflows. Waterfowl occupation and plankton biomass were analyzed to evaluate their role in eutrophication reversion. The low removal efficiencies related to scarce vegetation development and wind disturbance in the first period, significantly improved in the second, particularly in the F4-Reed subunit (total cumulative mass removals of 438, 363 and 372 kg of nitrogen, 57, 30 and 48 kg of phosphorus and 7109, 573 and 2315 kg of suspended solids in the Reed, Iris and Mixed F4 subunits). This was due to the high continuous coverage (around 70%) achieved by reeds, but also by other species that spontaneously germinated from the seed bank (cattails, Paspalum sp). The constructed wetland significantly reduced the exported microalgal biomass, stimulated the potential mixotrophic phytoplankton groups, such as Euglenophyceae, and produced large quantities of zooplankton, particularly ostracods and cladocerans, which efficiently grazed on microalgae. The total cumulative mass removal of chlorophyll for the second period of operation represented 2.6 times more removal than in the first period. Almost 50% of the waterfowl species visiting the zone were of special conservation concern. Differences in vegetation structure between subunits drove a concrete selection of stopover sites for migratory, endangered shorebirds that had low impact on solid resuspension. Endangered, large and medium-sized waterfowl (higher impact on resuspension while foraging), more abundant in the post-breeding period, showed no preferences between subunits. This study supports the idea of recommending the configuration of these kinds of systems for managing eutrophicated waters in protected sites and enhancing waterfowl species of conservation concern.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				APR 1	2018	113						74	87		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.11.021							WOS:000426093400010						
J	Ssali, F; Moe, SR; Sheil, D				Ssali, Fredrick; Moe, Stein R.; Sheil, Douglas			Tree seed rain and seed removal, but not the seed bank, impede forest recovery in bracken (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn)-dominated clearings in the African highlands	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Considerable areas dominated by bracken Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn occur worldwide and are associated with arrested forest recovery. How forest recovery is impeded in these areas remains poorly understood, especially in the African highlands. The component processes that can lead to recruitment limitationincluding low seed arrival, availability and persistenceare important determinants of plant communities and offer a potential explanation for bracken persistence. We investigated key processes that can contribute to recruitment limitation in bracken-dominated clearings in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. We examined if differences in seed rain (dispersal limitation), soil seed bank, or seed removal (seed viability and persistence) can, individually or in combination, explain the differences in tree regeneration found between bracken-dominated areas and the neighboring forest. These processes were assessed along ten 50-m transects crossing the forest-bracken boundary. When compared to the neighboring forest, bracken clearings had fewer seedlings (bracken 11,557 +/- 5482 vs. forest 34,515 +/- 6066 seedlings/ha), lower seed rain (949 +/- 582 vs. 1605 +/- 335 tree seeds m(-2)year(-1)), comparable but sparse soil seed bank (304 +/- 236 vs. 264 +/- 99 viable tree seeds/m(2)), higher seed removal (70.1%+/- 2.4% vs. 40.6%+/- 2.4% over a 3-day interval), and markedly higher rodent densities (25.7 +/- 5.4 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.6 rodents per 100 trapping sessions). Camera traps revealed that rodents were the dominant animals visiting the seeds in our seed removal study. Synthesis: Recruitment limitation contributes to both the slow recovery of forest in bracken-dominated areas, and to the composition of the tree species that occur. Low seed arrival and low persistence of unburied seeds can both explain the reduced density of seedlings found in bracken versus neighboring forest. Seed removal, likely due to rodents, in particular appears sufficient to constrain forest recovery and impacts some species more severely than others.

In a series of glasshouse experiments, we evaluated variation in drought responses of (i) 21 arid zone plant species from the mining intensive Pilbara region of Western Australia in an original topsoil substrate and (ii) four selected species (Acacia inaequilatera, Acacia spondylophylla, Eucalyptus leucophloia and Triodia epactia) in three different soil substrates (topsoil, overburden material and a blend of both soil materials) that may be considered as an alternative substrate for restoration. Seedling drought responses were tested using ecophysiological indicators (e.g. stomatal conductance and leaf water potential ((leaf)) at the time of stomatal closure, among others) during soil drying. Our results showed that plant life form and morphological traits interact with ecophysiological indicators to show that trees are significantly less tolerant to drought-related stress than shrubs and herbs (p0<bold></bold>05). When grown in overburden material seedlings experienced a decline in overall plant growth (87% in T.epactia and 62% in E.leucophloia) and ecophysiological drought tolerance. These responses are evidence of the low quality of the overburden substrate, which has a depleted nutrient content and low water retention capacity. Overall, this study highlights the sensitivity of early seedling development and the importance of facilitating seedling recruitment and survival to secure successful arid zone restoration.

Restoration of Open-Cut Mining in Semi-Arid Systems: A Synthesis of Long-Term Monitoring Data and Implications for Management	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Restoration is becoming an increasing global priority. Particularly in high impact developments like open cut mining, restoring ecosystems to pre-disturbance states is difficult but essential. Successful restoration of vegetation communities requires complex achievements of cover, density, community composition, species richness, and structural elements. This study synthesises 10years of monitoring surveys to measure restoration success in six mining operations in the semi-arid Pilbara of Western Australia, with the goal of quantifying current and past restoration performance. We assessed composition, structure, cover, density, and richness. We found that each metric resulted in slightly different performance measures within mining operations. For example, native perennial grasses in restored sites fell short of reference density and cover, while woody species density and cover were regularly within the reference range. Richness was often much higher in restored than in reference sites. Finally, to explore the potential drivers of performance, we analysed the influence of restoration characteristics on each of the vegetation metrics. We found that older restoration had increased cover and density of all vegetation types compared to more recent restoration, while other variables had impacts on restoration results that shifted between metrics and monitoring periods. Compositional similarity with reference sites was higher when restoration occurred on low impact mining activities, when first year rainfall was higher, and when seeding treatments were not applied. Overall, this assessment of long-term monitoring data highlighted where each performance measure was important to understanding overall restoration patterns in semi-arid systems and paves the way for improving future restoration practice.

The experiment was installed in a complete randomized block design with three replicates. The evaluation of the seed bank was performed on soil samples (0-10 and 10-20 cm) in four points of each experimental unit, at 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of cultivation. Bean, corn, and soybean crops were sown in the NTS with different soil cover crops in rotation, as well as in the CTS. The NTS provided a more dense and abundant soil seed bank of the species Gnaphalium spicatum and Oxalis corniculata when corn, soybean, and bean were cultivated. The species Lolium multiflorum showed lower density and less seeds in the soil seed bank when the NTS was adopted. The use of the winter cover crops black oat and cow vetch, cultivated individually or in consortium, resulted in a lower density of weed species, especially of L. multiflorum. The NTS provides a lower density of weed species in the soil seed bank than the CTS.

J	Negro-Ortiz, V				Negron-Ortiz, Vivian			BREEDING SYSTEM, SEED GERMINATION AND RECRUITMENT OF A THREATENED, SOUTHEASTERN US ENDEMIC, RIBES ECHINELLUM (GROSSULARIACEAE)	RHODORA												Reproductive ecology studies of rare species can provide information pertinent to population growth and persistence. One rare species confined to two disjunct localities, one on private land located in Florida and the other one that is composed of two subpopulations on public land in South Carolina, is the federally threatened Miccosukee gooseberry, Ribes echinellum. Studies were carried out in the Florida population to determine change in abundance between 1992 and 2012 and to understand the lack of seedling recruitment in the wild. In Florida, the number of patches increased in the northern part of the study area but decreased in the southern part. Hand pollination experiments indicate Ribes echinellum exhibits a mixed mating system. Although autogamous pollination occurred, it did not result in fruit production. Reduced seed set of selfed flowers and seedling size provided some support for inbreeding depression, yet small sample sizes precluded full evaluation. No asexual seed production was detected. Seeds persisted in the field less than one year, suggesting a transient seed bank. Although germination potential, estimated by staining seeds with tetrazolium, was 60%, in situ seed germination from fruits of manipulated and control flowers was only 25%. Seedling survival was zero, indicating high risk of extirpation. Either low spring precipitation during the years of this study or scarcity of compatible mates could explain the lack of seedling survival. These results are important for developing a conservation strategy for this species.																	0035-4902	1938-3401				APR-JUN	2018	120	982					99	116		10.3119/17-25							WOS:000436620800001

Marandu and pigeon pea	REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL												The objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of the recovery of degraded pastures with the seed bank present in the area, using the maize + pasture + pigeon pea integrated system. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design in a 2x3 factorial scheme composed of the use of pigeon pea and three forage seeding densities (seed bank, 0 kg ha(-1), 2 kg ha(-1) and 4 kg ha(-1)), with 4 replicates. The number of spikes per plant, height of insertion of the first spike, plant height, number of rows per spike, number of grains per row, weight of one hundred grains, maize grain yield, maize fresh mass yield, dry mass yield of maize, Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu, and pigeon pea. The results demonstrate that the seeds present in the seed bank of the degraded areas are viable to recover the pasture through the consortium. The use of pigeon pea increases forage production up to the seeding density of 2 kg ha(-1) of forage. The use of the maize, brachiaria and pigeon pea integrated does not cause damage to the maize crop in relation to its production components.																	2358-6303					APR-JUN	2018	5	2					39	47									WOS:000438156900007

Kruger) E.J. Butler) is considered an emerging disease in the Western Hemisphere and with high potential for damage. It was detected in Cuba in late 2008, which is why phytosanitary surveillance was established on its dispersion and incidence in the sugarcane plantations of the country. The objective of this work was to update the status of this disease in Cuba from the processing of data from research and surveys conducted in the period 2009-2017. Evaluations were carried out in the risk areas through systematic sampling in germplasm banks, varieties gardens, experimental areas and seed banks, including those established from "in vitro" plants. In addition, surveys were carried out in areas of commercial plantations, validation areas of new cultivars and areas of certified seed production, where 10 stems were randomly evaluated in three sampling stations following the diagonal of the field. P kuehnii is found in the 13 provinces producing sugarcane in Cuba. Most infected genotypes were found in areas of experimental stations, mainly in the provinces of Mayabeque, Villa Clara and Camaguey. The distribution of this pathogen in the national territory is classified as low prevalence; however. the number of infected commercial cultivars rises to 30.																	0253-5785	2072-2001				APR-JUN	2018	45	2					61	68									WOS:000436531400009

Rhododendron maximum impacts seed bank composition and richness following Tsuga canadensis loss in riparian forests	ECOSPHERE												Southern Appalachian riparian forests have undergone changes in composition and function from invasive pathogens and pests. Castanea dentata mortality in the 1930s from chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) and Tsuga canadensis mortality in the 2000s from the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) have led to the expansion and increased growth of Rhododendron maximum, an evergreen subcanopy shrub. A better understanding of seed bank characteristics and the various abiotic and biotic factors that affect the seed bank may be useful in determining the restoration potential of forest communities following invasion-related disturbances. We compared the seed bank of two deciduous forest types: hardwood forests with a dense R. maximum subcanopy (hereafter, RR) and hardwood forests without R. maximum (hereafter, HWD). We evaluated numerous microenvironmental variables through principal component analysis (PCA) and correlated the derived PCA axes scores to seed bank density and richness across forest types. We found that seed bank density was comparable between the forests types; however, seed bank richness was much lower in RR than HWD and the species composition was dissimilar between forest types. Twenty-eight of 64 (44%) species in the seed bank of HWD were not found in the seed bank of RR. Species that were represented in both forest types were often found in contrasting densities. Most notably, seed bank densities of several woody species were considerably higher in RR (85%) than HWD (45%), while herbaceous seed bank density was lower in RR (11%) than HWD (50%). Mineral soil pH, soil nutrient availability, and soil moisture were lower, and organic soil (Oi + Oe + Oa) depth and mass were greater in the RR than HWD forest type. PCA correlations revealed that PCA4 (represented by understory density and Oe + Oa phosphorus and carbon/nitrogen ratio) was negatively correlated with total seed bank density. PCA1 (represented by Oe + Oa cations and phosphorus, understory richness, ground-layer cover, and mineral soil pH) and PCA4 were positively correlated with total seed bank richness. These results suggest that the soil seed bank will not be the primary mode of recruitment to establish a diverse and herbaceous-rich community if a RR is present.

J	Wilcox, DA; Buckler, K; Czayka, A				Wilcox, Douglas A.; Buckler, Kathleen; Czayka, Alex			Controlling Cattail Invasion in Sedge/Grass Meadows	WETLANDS												As a result of water-level regulation, cattails have invaded sedge/grass meadow in all wetlands on Lake Ontario. Even with a change in water-level-regulation to a more natural hydrologic regime, restoration requires methods for active cattail management without the ability to manipulate water depths and without imperiling other vegetation. We conducted replicated studies at a wetland site with an active invasion front in zones of nearly mono-dominant cattail and transitional invasion. We tested various combinations of cutting cattail ramets when carbohydrate reserves were minimized, spraying cut stems with herbicide, slicing rhizomes to mimic tilling, and hand-wicking resprouted ramets with herbicide. We also collected companion environmental data. The most effective treatment in both zones was cutting during the period with reduced rhizome carbohydrates followed by hand-wicking resprouted ramets with herbicide in late summer, which allows the herbicide to be absorbed by the rhizomes. Two years of treatment provide the best results, reducing cattail stem counts and cover by more than 50%, but follow-up applications in ensuing years may be warranted to treat surviving cattails. Given the widespread problem of cattail invasion, these treatments may have broad application in wetlands where water levels cannot be manipulated.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2018	38	2					337	347		10.1007/s13157-017-0971-8							WOS:000433580400012

Short-term regeneration dynamics of Wyoming big sagebrush at two sites in northern Utah	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) is a widespread shrub across the western United States, and there is great interest among scientists and land managers in its ecology and conservation, particularly with regard to maintaining structural heterogeneity of sagebrush stands for wildlife habitat and livestock forage. Yet little is known about its short-term regeneration dynamics and the implications of those dynamics for changes in stand structure. We examined changes among sagebrush size classes across 3 years, as well as emergence of sagebrush from seed bank and seed rain samples at 2 sagebrush shrubland sites in northern Utah: a lower-density site (1.4 plants/m(2), SE 0.11) with no recent history of manipulation and a higher-density site (1.9 plants/m(2), SE 0.21) that had recently been treated with herbicide to reduce sagebrush cover. On both sites, numbers of sagebrush plants in the largest size class decreased over the 3-year time period, while dead and medium-sized sagebrush plants increased. At the higher-density herbicide-treated site, this size class shift appeared to be driven by growth of small plants into the medium size class, likely associated with reductions in numbers of (and competition from) large plants. At the lower-density site, it appears that densities of large plants declined because the plants shrank in size, possibly due to herbivory. Sagebrush seed rain did not differ between fall and spring assessments. Forbs had the greatest representation in the seed bank, followed by grasses and then sagebrush, though the number of sagebrush seeds may be sufficient for seedling recruitment. These results illustrate that shifts among sagebrush size classes, especially transitions of small shrubs into the medium size class, may be a primary and immediate pathway of stand recovery, in addition to recruitment from seed. These findings underscore the importance of sagebrush stand structure to plant community health and may aid in anticipating responses to disturbances such as drought or herbivory.

These are usually known as exotic species that proliferate intensely, spread rapidly and persist as dominant in the new community. However, some native species may behave the same way and bring serious ecological and economical losses. Nonetheless these native species may not attract management efforts and specific policies, partially because of the assumption that native species are harmless. We review the concepts of invasive species and show the potential harm of overabundant populations of native species, which we name "super-dominant" species. Based on literature review we demonstrated the lack of information on the Brazilian super-dominant plant species. Considering all kinds of published material and knowledge from our own experience we selected 16 Brazilian native terrestrial plants that most frequently show unexpectedly intense growth and dominance in their original habitats. We discuss the factors that may have triggered atypical dominance, negative impacts of these species on the native biodiversity and ecosystems, and future trends. Anthropogenic disturbances are the main drivers of the explosive population growth of these native species, especially habitat fragmentation, forest gap formation, and wildfires. The absence of legal support to deal with super-dominant native species is probably the main reason for the lack of disclosure of the subject. In the future scenario of climate change we expect the intensification of the phenomenon. Strategies for early detection and control need to be fast developed.

J	Kaljund, K; Leht, M; Jaaska, V				Kaljund, Karin; Leht, Malle; Jaaska, Vello			High genotypic diversity and strong spatial structure in populations of Trifolium alpestre with low seed production	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Studies on clonal plants indicate that the proportion between clonal and sexual reproduction can be variable, depending on local habitat conditions and the biological characteristics of the species. In the present study, we assessed this question in Trifolium alpestre by assaying genetic diversity and spatial genotypic structure of natural populations with the use of allozyme markers. Populations revealed high genetic diversity as well as strong spatial structure of multilocus genotypes. The values of genetic diversity were moderately high. Spatially aggregated, identical genotypes spread up to 15 m along linear transects and across 4-m(2) plots indicate extensive clonal propagation within populations. However, the existence of numerous unique and small-sized clones reflects significant contribution from sexual reproduction. Spatially and temporarily stochastic soil disturbances have evidently opened new opportunities for the successful sexual recruitment from the permanent soil seed bank and thus counteracted losses of genetic and genotypic diversity. Seed production in all populations during the three study years was low, in average up to 1.5-2.4 seeds per shoot. The almost total lack of seed set for 57 bagged flower heads on genotypes grown in a common garden indicates that T. alpestre needs pollinators for seed production.																	0107-055X	1756-1051				APR	2018	36	4							UNSP e01705	10.1111/njb.01705							WOS:000431505900013

The present study investigated the characteristics of the soil seed bank and determined its relationship to the above-ground vegetation in grazed and ungrazed sites in the Hei-wa-wu oxbow wetland of the Yangtze River, China. A total of 3700 seedlings across 59 species germinated from the soil seed bank. Annuals and terrestrial species dominated the soil seed banks of both grazed and ungrazed sites. Grazing had no significant effect on the seed density and species richness, but altered the species composition of soil seed bank. Grazing tended to increase the floristic similarity between the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation. DCA ordination produced a clear separation of the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation. Our results suggest that soil seed bank and its relation to standing vegetation in the Hei-wa-wu oxbow wetland are strongly influenced by livestock grazing.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				APR	2018	17	4					959	967									WOS:000431134900021

Assessment of prescribed fire and cutting as means of controlling the invasion of sub-alpine grasslands by Echinospartum horridum	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Aims: Sub-alpine grassland ecosystems have some of the highest biodiversity in Europe and constitute high-value natural resources. These grasslands are under threat because of the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities and subsequent invasion by woody species. In the Central Pyrenees (Spain) several management techniques have been used to stop expansion of the highly encroaching shrub Echinospartum horridum. However, the ways in which these techniques affect recovery of sub-alpine grasslands are poorly understood. The final goal of this study is to gain information about the effects of E. horridum management practices and provide recommendations for the local stakeholders. Methods: This study evaluated the efficacy of controlled fires and mechanical removal of above-ground vegetation in controlling expansion of E. horridum into sub-alpine grasslands in the Central Pyrenees. E. horridum demography (germination and survival), soil seed bank and soil properties were recorded in two E. horridum stands where vegetation was previously removed by (1) fire (burning treatment) or (2) mechanical removal (cutting treatment) and (3) an undisturbed E. horridum stand (control). Results: The burning treatment increased germination and survival of E.horridum seedlings more than the cutting treatment, relative to the control. Therefore, cutting appeared to be a better option for controlling E. horridum. Soil seed density was higher in the management treatments than in the control, but it did not harbour sub-alpine grasslands species. E. horridum removal favoured recharge of the soil with seeds that arrived by dispersal. The soil seed bank in the burning treatment had higher seed abundance and seed diversity than in the cutting treatment; however, fire promoted a loss of soil nutrients. Conclusions: The soil seed bank composition (low abundance and diversity of native species) coupled with rapid regeneration rate of E. horridum would prevent recovery of the sub-alpine grassland based on the soil seed bank alone. Traditional shepherding has been reported to favour seed dispersal, and here we recommend E. horridum removal with cutting treatment as an additional practice for integrated management and recovery of the sub-alpine grasslands.

Seeding alters plant community trajectory: Impacts of seeding, grazing and trampling on semi-arid re-vegetation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: How do seeding, cattle grazing, and vehicular use impact vegetation establishment and soil movement on a newly reclaimed pipeline right-of-way? Will these factors result in differing plant community trajectories? Location: Southern Arizona (USA). Methods: Within a pipeline disturbance, we randomly selected nine plots to be seeded with an 18 species mix and nine to be left unseeded. Adjacent to the disturbance, we selected nine undisturbed unseeded control plots for a total of 27 plots (30 m x 45 m each). Within each of the 27 plots, we established a grazed-trampled, grazed-untrampled and ungrazed-untrampled subplot. One year after pipeline reclamation, we analysed the impacts of seeding, grazing and trampling on native plant cover, undesirable plant cover, herbaceous biomass, species richness, soil movement and plant community trajectories in comparison to surrounding undisturbed sites. Result: Seeding disturbed sites with a diverse seed mix resulted in greater native plant cover, higher species richness and fewer undesirable species than were found in unseeded disturbed sites. Unseeded disturbed areas were similar to the undisturbed control areas in species richness and had comparable plant community trajectories. The combined impacts of grazing and trampling reduced native plant cover and herbaceous biomass and were associated with increased soil erosion in comparison to subplots protected from grazing and trampling. Conclusions: Natural vegetation recruitment can be a viable option in semi-arid reclamation projects when the soil seed bank is preserved and there are proximal seed sources. While seeding improved quantitative vegetation metrics, using a seed mix comprised of different species than the preexisting vegetation may set the reclaimed vegetation on a different plant community trajectory. The general prescription of protecting new reclamation sites from grazing and trampling is supported.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				APR	2018	21	2					240	249		10.1111/avsc.12340							WOS:000430912500008						
J	Llorens, TM; Ayre, DJ; Whelan, RJ				Llorens, Tanya M.; Ayre, David J.; Whelan, Robert J.			Anthropogenic fragmentation may not alter pre-existing patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation in perennial shrubs	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Many plant species have pollination and seed dispersal systems and evolutionary histories that have produced strong genetic structuring. These genetic patterns may be consistent with expectations following recent anthropogenic fragmentation, making it difficult to detect fragmentation effects if no prefragmentation genetic data are available. We used microsatellite markers to investigate whether severe habitat fragmentation may have affected the structure and diversity of populations of the endangered Australian bird-pollinated shrub Grevillea caleyi R.Br., by comparing current patterns of genetic structure and diversity with those of the closely related G. longifolia R.Br. that has a similar life history but has not experienced anthropogenic fragmentation. Grevillea caleyi and G. longifolia showed similar and substantial population subdivision at all spatial levels (global F-ST = 0.615 and 0.454; S-p = 0.039 and 0.066), marked isolation by distance and large heterozygous deficiencies. These characteristics suggest long-term effects of inbreeding in self-compatible species that have poor seed dispersal, limited connectivity via pollen flow and undergo population bottlenecks because of periodic fires. Highly structured allele size distributions, most notably in G. caleyi, imply historical processes of drift and mutation were important in isolated subpopulations. Genetic diversity did not vary with population size but was lower in more isolated populations for both species. Through this comparison, we reject the hypothesis that anthropogenic fragmentation has impacted substantially on the genetic composition or structure of G. caleyi populations. Our results suggest that highly self-compatible species with limited dispersal may be relatively resilient to the genetic changes predicted to follow habitat fragmentation.

Seed bank dynamics in wetland complexes associated with a lowland river	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The existence of a dormant "bank" of plant seeds plays an important role in maintaining and preserving species and genetic diversity. However, information on the spatial heterogeneity of the pool of dormant seeds among wetland complexes along riverine systems is limited. In this study we collected sediment from 18 wetlands within six wetland complexes along the Murray River, Australia. The germinable, residual and viable seed banks in each wetland complex were assessed by undertaking a germination trial, counting seeds (morphotypes) and viability testing. A diverse and viable seed bank exists within all the complexes however seed bank communities differed among wetland complexes. There was no difference in the viability of seeds within the sediment profile, however more seeds occurred in the surface layers of sediment and communities differed with sediment profile depth. In general, the number of species germinating was fewer than the number of seed morphotypes counted. Management actions need to be targeted not only at preserving the extant plant communities but also to ensure the seed bank is replenished. This may also involve allowing wetlands to dry sufficiently to enable cracking of wetland sediment and seeds to become buried to maximise the longevity of the seed store.

PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WEEDS AS A FUNCTION OF RESIDUAL HERBICIDES APPLIED TO RICE GROWN UNDER SPRINKLER IRRIGATION	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												We aimed to characterize the weed community in sprinkler irrigated rice, previously applied with residual herbicides for two years, as well as to infer about sustainability of the management applied to the fields based on an ecological approach. The experiment was conducted during the cropping seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15, under sprinkler irrigation. Rice was planted in the second-half of October, using the cultivar PUITA INTA CL. Herbicides were applied in pre- and post-emergence (sequential application) of crop and weeds. Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) was planted in winter. In May 2015, soil samples were collected for the soil seed bank study. Phytosociological characterization of weeds emerged from the seed bank was conducted from May 2015 to January 2016, until soil seed bank depletion. Echinochloa crusgalli, Fimbristyllis sp., Cyperus esculentus and Killinga brevifolia were the weeds to which most concern should be directed when growing rice under sprinkler irrigation in lowland areas of Southern Brazil. Their competition strategies are based on density. Herbicides used should be efficient in controlling at least these four weed species. A selecting action of herbicides on weed species was botanically characterized, as the weed species reported after two cropping seasons depended on the herbicide treatment applied.

Seed banks of native forbs, but not exotic grasses, increase during extreme drought	ECOLOGY												Extreme droughts such as the one that affected California in 2012-2015 have been linked to severe ecological consequences in perennial-dominated communities such as forests. In annual communities, drought impacts are difficult to assess because many species persist through facultative multiyear seed dormancy, which leads to the development of seed banks. Impacts of extreme drought on the abundance and composition of the seed banks of whole communities are little known. In 80 heterogeneous grassland plots where cover is dominated by similar to 15 species of exotic annual grasses and diversity is dominated by similar to 70 species of native annual forbs, we grew out seeds from soil cores collected early in the California drought (2012) and later in the multiyear drought (2014), and analyzed drought-associated changes in the seed bank. Over the course of the study we identified more than 22,000 seedlings to species. We found that seeds of exotic annual grasses declined sharply in abundance during the drought while seeds of native annual forbs increased, a pattern that resembled but was even stronger than the changes in aboveground cover of these groups. Consistent with the expectation that low specific leaf area (SLA) is an indicator of drought tolerance, we found that the community-weighted mean SLA of annual forbs declined both in the seed bank and in the aboveground community, as low-SLA forbs increased disproportionately. In this system, seed dormancy reinforces the indirect benefits of extreme drought to the native forb community.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	2018	99	4					896	903		10.1002/ecy.2160							WOS:000428878200014	29494753

The role of Rhytidoponera metallica (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) in facilitating post-fire seed germination of three ant-dispersed legume species	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The fire avoidance hypothesis proposes that a benefit of seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) is to protect seeds from being killed during fire and to facilitate post-fire germination of seeds that require heat shock to break their physical dormancy. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of fire and seed burial by a predominant seed-dispersing ant, Rhytidoponera metallica (subfamily: Ectatomminae) on germination levels of three ant-dispersed legume species (Pultenaea daphnoides, Acacia myrtifolia and Acacia pycnantha). Experimental burial of seeds within aluminium cans at a site prior to being burnt and at an adjacent unburnt site showed that fire increased germination levels, particularly for seeds buried at 1- and 2-cm deep and that overall, germination levels differed among the three plant species. To quantify seed burial depths and post-fire germination levels facilitated by R.metallica ants, seeds were fed to colonies prior to fire at the burnt and unburnt sites. Of the seeds buried within nests that were recovered, between 45% and 75% occurred within the upper 6cm of the soil profile, although unexpectedly, greater percentages of seeds were recovered from the upper 0-2cm of nests in the unburnt site compared with nests in the burnt site. Germination levels of buried seeds associated with R.metallica nests ranged from 21.2% to 29.5% in the burnt site compared with 3.1-14.8% in the unburnt site. While increased seed germination levels were associated with R.metallica nests following fire, most seeds were buried at depths below those where optimal temperatures for breaking seed dormancy occurred during the fire. We suggest that R.metallica ants may provide fire avoidance benefits to myrmecochorous seeds by burying them at a range of depths within a potential germination zone defined by intra- and inter-fire variation in levels of soil heating.

Urban wetland seed bank profiles in south-central New York State	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Wetlands are important habitats in urban landscapes that reduce flooding and improve water quality, yet urban wetland seed banks are rarely studied. Our main objective was to profile urban wetland seed banks in south-central New York. We exposed sediment cores from four wetlands in Broome County, New York, to flooded and drawdown treatments for 16 mo, and recorded community composition and seedling density. We found high spatial variation in species richness and seedling density among the four sites. Species richness ranged from 28 to 56 species, with sample-based extrapolation (S-est), Jackknife1, and Chao1 analyses estimating similar expected species richness values (S-est projected 37.9-77.0 species, Jackknife1 analysis estimated 40.5-77.8 species, and Chao1 projected 32.2-79.1 species). Mean seedling density ranged from 3,367 seedlings/m(2) to 19,132 seedlings/m(2). These seed banks were dominated by obligate wetland species (75.8-93.3%). Invasive species comprised a high percentage of seedlings for three wetlands (40.8-80.9%), but not for the fourth site (4.2%). Lythrum salicaria, Typha sp., and Ludwigia palustris were common species based on relative seedling density for three seed banks, while Leersia oryzoides, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, and Alisma triviale were common species in the fourth site. Similarity indices between the standing vegetation and their respective seed banks, based on presence/absence data, were low (13-34%). Species richness and seedling densities were within the ranges of natural wetland seed bank studies.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				APR	2018	145	2					126	135		10.3159/TORREY-D-17-00034.1							WOS:000427026300003

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Ex situ conservation of plant germplasm, especially seed banking, is a favourable and widely used method for the conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR). The long-term conservation of these resources is fundamental for food security and plant breeding in order to stem the losses in agrobiodiversity and to meet the global challenges that agriculture is facing. The conservation and accessibility of PGR relies on their correct taxonomic labelling and on the building of a searchable database that links ex situ collections together. In the current study, we analysed the impact of taxonomic misnaming in the two major PGR databases (Genesys PGR, EURISCO), listing accessions conserved worldwide. The aim was to understand if taxonomic misnaming issues prevent PGR conservation. We chose as a case-study seed collections of accessions of the genus Citrullus (watermelon genepool), the taxonomy and nomenclature of which have been largely revised in recent times. We observed that taxonomic misnaming greatly limits PGR conservation with only 3% of the accessions listed in the databases correctly named; moreover, 28% were affected by taxonomic errors that prevent the establishment of the accessions' taxonomic identity, with consequences on their conservation and exploitation. The existence of the problem was also confirmed by the experimental propagation of three misnamed accessions. We suggest herein a series of actions that, put in place, could solve the extant misnaming issues in the databases and prevent their reoccurrence, allowing the correct conservation and the usability by the stakeholders of all the accessions.

Against the background of increasing disturbance frequencies due to current changes in climate and land use, the importance of seed banks to maintain ecosystem functioning of grasslands is likely to increase. This makes seed bank ecology a highly relevant topic of studies on ecosystem functioning. One of the main drivers of seed bank composition and density in grasslands is the current management. Although highly intensive grassland management can affect soil seed banks negatively, it is still unclear which component of management - fertilization, mowing or grazing - is the most influential. We studied soil seed banks of 73 mesic grasslands, which were arranged along a gradient of land-use intensity, by two seasonally differing surveys. Grasslands generally exhibited rather poor seed banks with low numbers of species and seedlings. Both were even lower in spring compared to autumn sampling. Grassland management turned out to affect soil seed banks in a complex way, via direct and indirect paths. While intensive mowing and fertilization decreased species richness and seedling density, grazing intensity increased species richness in the seed bank. Thus, land-use intensity, an index calculated as a sum of all three components, had highly ambivalent effects on seed banks. We conclude that the positive effect of grazing on soil seed banks makes pastures more resilient towards mechanic disturbances as compared to meadows.

Kuntze in rice-maize rotation systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												In low-input rice-maize rotation systems in the hills of central Madagascar, farmers deal with erratic rainfall, poor soils, high soil erosion risks and infestation by the parasitic weed Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze. Practices combining zero-tillage with permanent soil cover by intercropped legumes and crop residue mulches - known as Conservation Agriculture (CA)-are proposed as remedy against soil and climatic constraints. Implications of these practices for S. asiatica are unknown. A 4-season factorial experiment compared the current farmer practice of rice - maize rotation, involving seasonal tillage and crop residue removal (CONV), with three rice - maize rotation systems following CA with different cover crops, i.e. Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) and Mucuna pruriens (CACM), Vigna umbellata (ricebean) (CARE), and Srylosanthes guianensis (CAST). Performance of two rice varieties, NERICA-4 and -9, with partial S. asiatica resistance, were compared with the locally popular B22. Parasite emergence time, numbers, and seed bank sizes were recorded. In all CA practices S. asiatica infection was significantly reduced. Best results were obtained with Stylosanthes guianensis (CAST). This species also suppressed ordinary weeds much better than other cover crops. With CAST, average parasite emergence was delayed by 7.5 days (in rice) and 6.3 days (in maize) and infection levels were reduced by 79% (in rice) and 92% (in maize) compared to the conventional farmer practice (CONV). NERICA varieties delayed S. astatica emergence by 5.7 days (NERICA-9) and 9.7 days (NERICA-4) and reduced infection levels by 57% (NERICA-9) and 91% (NERICA-4) compared to B22. In maize the residual effect of resistance of NERICA-4 resulted in a delay of 7.5 days in S. asiatica emergence and a reduction of 60% in parasite numbers. The best combinations delay S. asiatica emergence by 17.8 days (CAST + NERICA-9) and 19.1 days (CARE + NERICA-4) and reduce the parasite infection levels by 96% (CAST + NERICA-9 or -4) to 98% (CARS + NERICA-4) in rice, compared to CONV + B22. After two full rice-maize rotation cycles S. asiatica seed numbers in the soil (0-10 cm) were 76% (CACM), 78% (CAST) and 86% (CARE) lower than under CONV. Even the combination of zero-tillage, crop residue mulching, cover crops and resistant rice varieties does not entirely prevent S. astatica parasitism and seed bank increase. Additional measures, targeted to escaping weeds, would be required for fully effective and long-term control.

J	Qu, H; Wang, CJ; Zhang, ZX				Qu, Hong; Wang, Chun-Jing; Zhang, Zhi-Xiang			Planning priority conservation areas under climate change for six plant species with extremely small populations in China	NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA												The concept of Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) has been employed to guide conservation of threatened plant species in China. Climate change has a high potential to threaten PSESP. As a result, it is necessary to integrate climate change effects on PSESP into conservation planning in China. Here, ecological niche modelling is used to project current and future habitat distributions of six PSESP in China under climate change scenarios and conservation planning software is applied to identify priority conservation areas (PCAs) for these PSESP based on habitat distributions. These results were used to provide proposals for in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures directed at PSESP. It was found that annual precipitation was important for habitat distributions for all six PSESP (with the percentage contribution to habitat distributions ranging from 18.1 % to 74.9 %) and non-climatic variables including soil and altitude have a large effect on habitat suitability of PSESP. Large quantities of PCAs occurred within some provincial regions for these six PSESP (e.g. Sichuan and Jilin for the PSESP Cathaya argyrophylla, Taxus cuspidata, Annamocarya sinensis and Madhuca pasquieri), indicating that these are likely to be appropriate areas for in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures directed at these PSESP. Those nature reserves with large quantities of PCAs were identified as promising sites for in-situ conservation measures of PSESP; such reserves include Yangzie and Dongdongtinghu for C. argyrophylla, Songhuajiangsanhu and Chang-baishan for T. cuspidata and Shiwandashanshuiyuanlian for Tsoongiodendron odorum. These results suggest that existing seed banks and botanical gardens occurring within identified PCAs should allocate more resources and space to ex-situ conservation of PSESP. In addition, there should be additional botanical gardens established for ex-situ conservation of PSESP in PCAs outside existing nature reserves. To address the risk of negative effects of climate change on PSESP, it is necessary to integrate in-situ and ex-situ conservation as well as climate change monitoring in PSESP conservation planning.

Agent Based Modelling (ABM) of eelgrass (Zostera marina) seedbank dynamics in a shallow Danish estuary	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Odense Fjord (Denmark) has suffered from a drastic decline in eelgrass (Zostera marina) coverage during the last decades. In 1983 eelgrass still covered about 25% of the estuary, which in 2005 was reduced to less than 2%. The alarming decline in the past decades initiated preliminary restoration activities, where it was questioned whether the present low eelgrass biomass is able to produce a sustainable seed bank to support natural recovery. Field studies verified that the seed bank was hampered. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine 1) seed dispersion along the sediment surface and in the water column; 2) settling rates of seeds and flowering shoots; 3) critical current speed for seed movement; 4) floating dynamic of flowering shoots and 5) seed dropping dynamics during transport of rafting shoots. These parameters supported the development of an agent based model (ABM) predicting seed movements in estuaries. The model handled two ways of seed dispersal: 1) seeds dropped in eelgrass beds and transport by hydrodynamic forces along the seabed 2) seeds released by rafting shoots. This setup allowed assessment of both eelgrass seed loss and potential connectivity between beds. Seed losses were divided into direct losses, such as seeds lost on land due to desiccation or external boundary, and indirect losses affecting seedling establishment. The model estimates that app. 92% of the seeds would be retained in the Odense fjord, while only 5.0% of the seeds ended up in areas supporting seedling establishment. Eelgrass seeds were also found in areas with insufficient light, high hydrodynamic pressure, excessive sediment reworking by lugworms or poor anchoring capacity. In addition, the model showed potential bed connectivity via rafting shoots, but also with individual seed movement along the bottom, when beds were not separated by deep areas, such as boating channels.

Therefore, there is a need for new alternative methods to reduce weed problems. One way to reduce weed infestation could be to collect or kill weed seeds produced in the growing season. Crop and weeds are harvested simultaneously with the combine harvester, but most of the weed seeds are returned with the chaff to the field creating new problems in future growing seasons. During the harvesting process, the harvester produces heat. Under normal harvest conditions, the exhaust gas temperature measured directly behind the turbocharger of the engine of a combine harvester may reach between 400 degrees C and 480 degrees C depending of the size of the engine. These high temperatures indicate that there is a potential for developing a system which perhaps could be utilized to kill or damage the weeds seeds. We investigate how much heat is needed to damage weed seeds significantly and focuses on the germination patterns over time in response to these treatments. We investigated if heat treatment of weed seeds could kill the seeds or reduce seed vigour or kill the seeds before they are returned to the field. The aim is to avoid harvested viable weed seeds being added to the soil seed bank. During the threshing and cleaning process in the combine harvester, most weed seeds and chaff are separated from the crop grains. After this separation, we imagine that the weed seeds could be exposed to a high temperature before they are returned to the field. Seeds of nine common weed species were treated with temperatures of 50 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 150 degrees C, 200 degrees C, and 250 degrees C for 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 s, respectively. Afterwards, the seeds were germinated for fourteen days. Seeds were differently affected by the heat treatments. We found that 50 degrees C and 100 degrees C was insufficient to harm the seeds of all species significantly at all durations. Heating with a temperature of 50 degrees C and 100 degrees C showed a slight tendency to break the dormancy of Alopecurus myosuroides Huds. and Papaver rhoeas L., but the results were not statistically significant. Seeds treated with 150 degrees C gave varying results depending on the duration and the weed species. The germination of A. myosuroides was significantly repressed when seeds were exposed to 250 degrees C for 5 s. Most species were significantly damaged when they were exposed to 250 degrees C for more than 10 s. Our results showed that there is a potential to explore how the waste heat energy produced by combine harvesters can be exploited to either kill or reduce the vigour of weed seeds before they are returned to the field with the chaff.

Owing to land reclamation, these D. angustifolia wetland ecosystems are rapidly shrinking on the landscape, threatening ecosystem functioning and regional ecological security. Converting farmlands to wetlands serves as an ecological engineering widely used for natural restoration in Sangjiang Plain. Vegetation restoration process of restored D. angustifolia wetlands needs to be fully assessed. However, limited information is available for uncovering the impact of restoration time on ecological vegetative characteristics under natural succession. In this study, vegetation survey and sampling were carried out in six restored D. angustifolia wetlands with a chronosequence (2-, 4-, 8-, 13-, 16-, 20-year restoration), as well as the undisturbed D. angustifolia wetland. Plant community composition changed greatly during the past two decades. In the 2-year and 4-year restored wetlands, farmland weeds Artemisia argyi and Calamagrostis brachytricha were the dominant species. Plant communities were gradually dominated by D. angustifolia and Carex spp. with the increase of restoration time. Species diversity in restored wetlands was higher than that in undisturbed wetland and decreased with restoration time increasing. Plant height and coverage increased with the increase of the restoration time, whereas the plant density generally decreased. The plant communities in restored wetlands were increasingly close to that in the undisturbed wetland. The forb, sedge and grass plants accumulated more biomass in 2-year, 8-year and 20-year restored wetlands, respectively. Regression between the grass biomass and species diversity is significantly negative (p <= 0.05). Results in this study suggest that the vegetation of cultivated D. angustifolia wetland could be restored effectively through natural succession, although there were some functional differences between restored and undisturbed D. angustifolia wetlands. Community composition variance and functional traits based on vital attributes can be used to reliably predict changes in diversity of species in response to natural restoration.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				MAR	2018	112						34	40		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.12.022							WOS:000424938300005

In order to reveal the limitations to natural regeneration of C.mongolicum by asexual and sexual reproduction, following the process of sand dune stabilization, we assessed clonal shoots, seedling emergence, soil seed bank density, and soil physical characteristics in mobile and stabilized sand dunes. Controlled field and pot experiments were also conducted to assess germination and seedling emergence in different dune soil types and seed burial depths. The population density of mature C.mongolicum was significantly different after sand dune stabilization. Juvenile density of C.mongolicm was much lower in stabilized sand dunes than mobile sand dune. There was no significant difference in soil seed bank density at three soil depths between mobile and stabilized sand dunes, while the emergence of seedlings in stabilized dunes was much lower than emergence in mobile dunes. There was no clonal propagation found in stabilized dunes, and very few C.mongolicum seedlings were established on stabilized sand dunes. Soil clay and silt content, air-filled porosity, and soil surface compaction were significantly changed from mobile sand dune to stabilized dunes. Seedling emergence of C.mongolicm was highly dependent on soil physical condition. These results indicated that changes in soil physical condition limited clonal propagation and seedling emergence of C.mongolicum in stabilized sand dunes. Seed bank density was not a limiting factor; however, poor seedling establishment limited C.mongolicum's further natural regeneration in stabilized sand dunes. Therefore, clonal propagation may be the most important mode for population expansion in mobile sand dunes. As a pioneer species C.mongolicum is well adapted to propagate in mobile sand dune conditions, it appears unlikely to survive naturally in stabilized sand dune plantations.																	2045-7758					MAR	2018	8	5					2975	2984		10.1002/ece3.3913							WOS:000426725900050	29531710

Distribution of thermophilic endospores in a temperate estuary indicate that dispersal history structures sediment microbial communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Endospores of thermophilic bacteria are found in cold and temperate sediments where they persist in a dormant state. As inactive endospores that cannot grow at the low ambient temperatures, they are akin to tracer particles in cold sediments, unaffected by factors normally governing microbial biogeography (e.g., selection, drift, mutation). This makes thermophilic endospores ideal model organisms for studying microbial biogeography since their spatial distribution can be directly related to their dispersal history. To assess dispersal histories of estuarine bacteria, thermophilic endospores were enriched from sediments along a freshwater-to-marine transect of the River Tyne in high temperature incubations (50 degrees C). Dispersal histories for 75 different taxa indicated that the majority of estuarine endospores were of terrestrial origin; most closely related to bacteria from warm habitats associated with industrial activity. A subset of the taxa detected were marine derived, with close relatives from hot deep marine biosphere habitats. These patterns are consistent with the sources of sediment in the River Tyne being predominantly terrestrial in origin. The results point to microbial communities in estuarine and marine sediments being structured by bi-directional currents, terrestrial run-off and industrial effluent as vectors of passive dispersal and immigration.

J	Colbach, N; Cordeau, S				Colbach, Nathalie; Cordeau, Stephane			Reduced herbicide use does not increase crop yield loss if it is compensated by alternative preventive and curative measures	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Herbicide use must be reduced because of environmental and health issues. This raises the question of whether weeds and the resulting crop yield loss will increase. Previous studies analysing relationships between herbicide use intensity, weeds and yield loss suffer from methodological shortcomings in terms of weed flora and farm diversity as well as temporal scales. Here, we collected data on 272 arable cropping systems from one Spanish and six French regions, from farm surveys, the Biovigilance-Flore network, expert opinion, cropping system trials, crop advisors and scientists. Each system was simulated over 27 years and with 10 weather repetitions consisting of 28 randomly chosen weather years, using the virtual-field model FloxSys. This process-based model simulates multi-species weed floras and crop canopies as a function of cropping systems and pedoclimate at a daily time-step over the years. Four series of simulations were run, 1) starting with a typical regional weed flora, 2) eliminating all herbicides without any other change in management practices. The two series were run again, but without an initial weed seed bank. Comparing series 1 and 2 to respectively 3 and 4 led to calculating a crop yield loss due to weeds in series 1 and 2. Comparing series 1 and 2 quantified the herbicide impact on weeds, crop production and yield loss. The simulations showed that (1) crop yield loss increased with increasing weed biomass, and that the weed/crop biomass ratio at crop flowering was the best indicator of the year's yield loss, (2) herbicide use intensity was not correlated to either weed variables or yield loss, because herbicide use intensity greatly depended on other management practices; e.g., it decreased with increasing frequency and interannual variation of mechanical weeding and superficial tillage, (3) weed biomass and yield loss increased when herbicides were eliminated without any other change in management practices, (4) effects were more visible at the multi-annual than the annual scales. The systems the most sensitive to herbicide suppression were characterized by monotonous rotations with short crop cover, high herbicide use, no plough or winter ploughing and frequent rolling operations. Finally, a decision tree predicting yield loss as a function of management practices was proposed to support farmers and crop advisors when designing innovative cropping systems reconciling low herbicide use and low yield loss.

Multiple colonist pools shape fiddler crab-associated bacterial communities	ISME JOURNAL												Colonization is a key component of community assembly because it continuously contributes new species that can potentially establish and adds individuals to established populations in local communities. Colonization is determined by the regional species pool, which is typically viewed as stable at ecological time scales. Yet, many natural communities including plants, birds and microbes, are exposed to several distinct and dynamic sources of colonists and how multiple colonist pools interact to shape local communities remains unclear. Using a 16S rRNA amplicon survey, we profiled bacteria within surface, subsurface and burrow sediments and assessed their role as colonist pools for fiddler crab-associated bacteria. We found significant differences in composition among sediment types, driven by halophilic taxa in the surface, and different Desulfobacteraceae taxa in the subsurface and burrow. Bacteria from burrow sediment colonized the crab carapace whereas gut bacterial communities were colonized by burrow and surface sediment bacteria. Despite distinct colonist pools influencing gut bacteria, variation in composition across gut samples did not lead to significant clusters. In contrast, carapace bacterial communities clustered in six distinct groups loosely associated with crab species. Our findings suggest that multiple colonist pools can influence local communities but factors explaining variation in community composition depend on local habitats. Recognizing multiple colonist pools expands our understanding of the interaction between regional and local processes driving community structure and diversity.																	1751-7362	1751-7370				MAR	2018	12	3					825	837		10.1038/s41396-017-0014-8							WOS:000427226100016	29362507					
J	Nsikani, MM; van Wilgen, BW; Gaertner, M				Nsikani, Mlungele M.; van Wilgen, Brian W.; Gaertner, Mirijam			Barriers to ecosystem restoration presented by soil legacy effects of invasive alien N-2-fixing woody species: implications for ecological restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Impacts of invasive alien N-2-fixing woody species and how they can persist as soil legacy effects after invasive species control are well appreciated, but how soil legacy effects can present barriers to restoration is poorly understood. Finding better ways to deal with these barriers to restoration is essential to improving restoration outcomes. In this study, we review 440 studies to identify barriers to restoration and potential management actions for the barriers to restoration, and provide practical application examples of the management actions. Our findings suggest that altered soil microbial communities, depleted native soil seed banks, elevated N status, secondary invasion and weedy native species dominance, and reinvasion are potential barriers to restoration. Furthermore, carbon addition, litter removal, soil microbial treatments, establishing species adapted to low N levels, prescribed burning, classical biological control, grazing, mowing, herbicide or graminicide application, manual weeding, soil N management, soil solarization, weed mats, native species reintroduction, and nurse plants are potential management actions for these barriers to restoration. However, there is little evidence suggesting that several of these barriers to restoration hinder improved restoration outcomes and this could be due to little research on them. More research is needed to assess their relative importance in hindering improved restoration outcomes. Management actions are rarely applied in combination, despite that they often address distinct barriers to restoration. Management actions should be combined into an integrated management effort to improve restoration outcomes.

SEEDS DEVELOPMENT IN THE GERMINATION PROCESS AS A RESULT OF COBALT IRRADIATION	QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS												The radiation from natural sources is a topical issue of our nowdays society. The harmful effects of on long-term radiation are well-knowledged by scientific literature. The question is how big is the impact of radiation exposure on each species, and, in particular, on the seeds of Paulownia. Moreover, the author aims to find out the effects generated by radiation on the process of germination and growth. Paulownia known as the Princess tree, has the highest growth rate in the world, which is about 3m/year. After nineteenth century, it came from China to North America. Later, it also entered Europa where it was acclimatized very well. Due to its fast increase roots, Paulownia is extremely suitable both for a forestation of areas at the risk of erosion and for reforestation of burned forests. The species of Paulownia is a prolific seed producer, but the viability of seed bank and life chances of young plants remain a point of contention. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to find out if Paulownia seeds germination is affected by gamma radiation. Research methodology included the stimulation batches of 100 species of Paulownia seeds. After exposing the Paulownia seeds to gamma irradiation, the batches were germinated, including the control batch, in special Linhardt dishes, in four repetitions. In the experiments presented in this article, the evolution process after irradiation with gamma radiation from a source a Co-60 (Cobalt 60) were tracked. The results highlighted germination evolution. Results obtained from irradiated seeds germination process dex (GI), the speed of germination (SG)), mean germination time (TMG), germination capacity (PFG). Consequewere expressed by five germination indices: germination energy (GE), germination inntly, results of the present study related to Paulownia seeds germination reveled that for environmentalists it is possible to predict the success of a species based on the capacity of their seed harvesting by sprouting spontaneously in the natural.																	1582-2559					MAR	2018	19			1			537	542									WOS:000435493100096

The USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) is a major source for global plant genetic resources (PGR), with accessions representing improved cultivars, breeding lines, landraces, and crop wild relatives (CWR), coupled with passport and trait evaluation data. The goal of this article is to facilitate use of PGR in plant breeding programs. Our specific objectives are (i) to summarize the structure and operation of the NPGS and its consultative and support committees, (ii) to review current use of the system by plant breeders, (iii) to describe constraints to improving the utility of PGR, and (iv) to discuss ways in which the NPGS might evolve to better meet the challenges facing agriculture and society in coming decades. The NPGS will enhance its relevance to plant breeding provided there is (i) ongoing attention to filling the gaps in NPGS collections, especially for CWR; (ii) a major increase in efforts to phenotype and genotype accessions using standardized methods; (iii) enhanced information content of the Genetic Resources Information Network (GRIN)-Global system and improved interoperability with other databases; (iv) increased attention to prebreeding activities; (v) improved training opportunities in practices for incorporating PGR in breeding programs; and (vi) expanded outreach efforts to strengthen public support for the NPGS. We believe these steps will be implemented most effectively through coordinated efforts among USDA-ARS, universities, the private sector, and international partners.

Ultrarare marine microbes contribute to key sulphur-related ecosystem functions	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The description of a rare biosphere within microbial communities has created great interest because microbes play a fundamental role in the functioning of all ecosystems on earth. Despite recent progress in understanding the ecology of the rare biosphere, the concept itself is still discussed, and fundamental questions remain. Here, we target the seed bank compartment of the rare biosphere, assess the level of rarity at which micro-organisms are still able to colonize an ecosystem and investigate whether rare species are functionally redundant. Using an original experimental design where wood in aquaria was inoculated with increasingly diluted coastal seawater, we show that bacteria that represented as few as 0.00000002% of the cells in the environment (or 1 cell in 10L of seawater) were still able to grow and play key roles within the ecosystem. Our experiment further showed that some bacteria can be replaced by others that have the potential to fulfil the same metabolic tasks. This finding suggests some functional redundancy within bacterial species. However, when ultrarare bacteria were progressively removed, productivity was reduced, and below a certain threshold some processes were lost, and the function of the ecosystem was altered. Overall the study shows that bacteria that are not detected by high-throughput sequencing approaches are nevertheless viable and able to colonize new ecosystems, suggesting the need to consider ultrarare microbes in the marine environment.

Germination patterns of the scrublands in response to smoke: The role of functional groups and the effect of smoke treatment method	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Smoke is thought to be one of the most important fire cues stimulating seed germination of species from both fire-prone and fire-free ecosystems. The impact of smoke on seed germination at the community level of certain habitats in Western Asia has not been investigated yet. We aimed to analyze the effects of different smoke treatments on soil seed germination of different plant functional groups in a scrubland habitat. A soil seed bank was used to count seedling emergence following aerosol smoke (15 min or 30 min exposure) or smoke-water (1: 1000 and 1: 500, v/v) treatment. Smoke-induced germination was then separated into five functional groups (i.e. annual grasses, perennial grasses, annual herbs, perennial herbs, and legumes). The results showed that seeds of annuals were stimulated with smoke. In contrast, germination of perennial grasses was reduced by the smoke treatments, whereas perennial forbs and legumes showed no particular response to the smoke treatments. The longer exposure time to the aerosol smoke (30 min) and the higher concentration of smoke-water (1: 500, v/v) were not at detrimental levels and resulted in maximum germination among the functional groups, other than perennial grasses. Our results indicate that smoke-stimulated germination of annuals plays an important role in species establishment after fire in the scrublands of Western Asia. Smoke treatments impacted differently on the different functional groups, and it is useful to determine the smoke response-classifications of these species to understand the effects of fires on the plant communities.

More butenolides from plant-derived smoke with germination inhibitory activity against karrikinolide	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Plant-derived smoke is known to play an important role in promoting germination in the post-fire environment, thereby stimulating regeneration of vegetation from the soil seed bank following a fire. Several compounds with germination promotory activity have been identified in recent years, with one such compound, 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c] pyran-2-one (karrikinolide; KAR1) known to be highly active in promoting germination of many plant species at low concentrations. In contrast, a related compound, (5RS)-3,4,5-trimethylfuran-2(5H)-one, also found in plant-derived smoke, was shown to have an antagonistic effect against KAR1, resulting in lowered germination levels when tested on light-sensitive 'Grand Rapids' lettuce seeds which usually have high germination levels when treated with KAR1. Considering the combination of such types of compounds in smoke, there is the possibility of smoke having a dual regulatory mechanism to control post-fire seedling emergence. Here we report the identification of two structurally related but enolides from plant-derived smoke with germination inhibitory activity, namely 5,5-dimethylfuran-2(5H)-one and (5RS)-5-ethylfuran-2(5H)-one. In the germination test system using light-sensitive 'Grand Rapids' lettuce seeds, the 5,5-dimethylfuran-2(5H)-one showed similar levels of activity against KAR1 as previously observed with the (5RS)-3,4,5-trimethylfuran-2(5H)-one, whereas the (5RS)-5-ethylfuran-2(5H)-one was approximately 100 times less active.

Peter; Holderegger, Rolf			Arable weed seed bank of grassland on former arable fields in mountain regions	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												The changes in agricultural practice during the last century resulted in high-input farming in lowlands and the abandonment of crop fields in marginally profitable mountain regions. In Switzerland abandoned fields were converted into grassland. These fields had a rich historical flora and the few still existing fields still belong to the most species rich. As many arable weeds produce persistent seeds, abandoned fields should have a high potential to promote rare and threatened arable plants if tilled again. To test this hypothesis we collected 21 soil samples down to 20 cm depth in each the centre and the border of 38 abandoned fields. The centre and border samples of each field were each pooled, and afterwards the present seeds washed out. These seeds were then sown in pots and germination monitored in a greenhouse during six months. A total of 119 plant species were identified. Of these, 48 species were typical arable weeds and only one was red listed in Switzerland. The number of arable weeds per former field was lower at higher altitudes. Hence, the surveyed meadows have a small potential to promote threatened arable weeds if tilled again. Likely, some seeds were no longer viable because the fields were not tilled for a too long. If on newly established conservation fields no threatened species grow spontaneously after a few years, the reintroduction of desired plant species should be considered. The source of the seeds should preferably be a nearby species pool.

Structure, composition and regeneration of riparian forest along an altitudinal gradient in northern Iran	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												In order to protect and understand the regeneration of riparian forests, it is important to understand the environmental conditions that lead to their vegetation differentiation. We evaluated the structure, composition, density and regeneration of woody species in forests along the river Safaroud in Ramsar forest in northern Iran in relation to elevation, soil properties and distance from the river. Using 60 transects located perpendicularly to river and 300 quadrats, we examined forests 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 m from the stream along an elevation gradient spanning from 350 to 2,400 m a.s.l. We found that total density, regeneration, diameter and basal area of trees were significantly higher in the interior of the forest whereas shrub density was higher close to the river. The uneven-aged forest structure showed no significant differences among gradient from the river to the forest interior. Hydro-geomorphic processes, flooding, the elevation gradient, distance from the river and soil properties were the most important factors that influenced plant community distribution in relation to the river.

Consequently, the soil seed bank characteristics of these areas have been modified, and its necessary a better understanding of the implications for natural regeneration of forests. In this review, the objective was gathering the current knowledge about the influence of human practices on the remaining soil seed bank of dry environments, in order to highlight the implications of forest resilience and dynamics. Bibliographical survey was carried out, from the following keywords: seed bank, semiarid, and dry forest. In summary, studies show that the soil seed bank is strongly affected by anthropogenic actions. In general, the soil bank of agro pastoral areas suffers species loss, and has a lower seed quantity when compared to areas not disturbed by anthropic action. Therefore, understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of the seed bank in the post-use land is essential to propose strategies for sustainable management, and vegetation conservation, especially considering the predictive scenario of climate change that should increase the severity of droughts and, perhaps, naturally reduce the seed amount that annually replenishes the soil seed stock.				de L.

Soil bacterial community responses to black medic cover crop and fertilizer N under no-till	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												A black medic (Medicago lupulina L.) cover crop produces a persistent seed bank and self-reseeds each year in North America, but its effects on soil microbial communities are not clear. A field trial was established in 2003 with the following experimental treatments: (a) black medic or no medic, (b) a 3-year crop rotation of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-oats (Avena saliva L.)-winter wheat (Sativum aestavum L.), and (c) fertilizer N applied to the rotation crops at three rates: 20, 60 and 100% of the recommended N based on soil testing. In 2011, soil bacterial communities were characterized by pyrosequencing. Black medic increased Shannon and Simpson indices of diversity, and both indices increased linearly with increasing N rate. Sixteen phyla were observed and the most abundant (in bulk soil and rhizosphere, respectively) were: Actinobacteria (39.6 and 37.0%), Proteobacteria (34.0 and 32.9%), Acidobacteria (10.8 and 13.8%) and Bacteroidetes (6.2 and 6.7%). Black medic increased the abundance of Proteobacteria, but decreased the abundances of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes in bulk soil, and Acidobacteria in the rhizosphere. Bacteroidetes increased, but Actinobacteria decreased, with increasing fertilizer N rate in bulk soil. Therefore, the two predominant soil bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, had opposite responses to black medic and fertilizer N, presumably due to differences in their ecological classifications. Soil bacterial community structures were shaped by medic. The bacterial phyla in bulk soil that were most associated with medic treatments included Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and those associated with no-medic treatments included Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes. The rotation crop effects were inconsistent. However, fertilizer N suppressed medic growth, so a black medic cover crop in this semi-arid region would be beneficial only in low-N or organic farming systems.

However, there are limited research findings on the performance of BDM with a large fruited crop such as pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) where the fruit can rest directly on the mulch for an extended period. To investigate whether heavy fruit might cause the mulch to degrade more quickly than expected, thereby, influencing weed control, fruit yield, and fruit quality including mulch adhesion on fruit, we carried out a field experiment in 2015 and 2016 at two locations in the United States with distinctive climates, Mount Vernon, WA and Knoxville, TN. Three plastic mulches marketed as biodegradable (BioAgri, Organix, and Naturecycle), one fully biodegradable paper mulch (WeedGuardPlus), and one experimental plastic BDM consisting of polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates (Exp. PLA/PHA) were evaluated against PE mulch and bare ground where 'Cinnamon Girl' pie pumpkin was the test crop. There was significant weed pressure in the bare ground plots at both locations over both years, indicating viable weed seed banks at the field sites. Even so, weed pressure was minimal across mulch treatments at both locations over both years because the mulches remained sufficiently intact during the growing season. The exceptions were Naturecycle in 2015 at both locations because of the splitting of the mulch and consequently higher percent soil exposure (PSE), and the penetration of all the plastic mulches at Knoxville by nutsedge (Cyperus sp. L.); nutsedge did not penetrate WeedGuardPlus. At Mount Vernon, overall pumpkin yield across both years averaged 18.1 t.ha(-1), and pumpkin yield was the greatest with PE, Exp. PLA/PHA, BioAgri, and Naturecycle (19.9-22.8 t.ha(-1)), intermediate with Organix and WeedGuardPlus (15.3-18.4 t.ha(-1)), and the lowest for bare ground (8.7 t.ha(-1)). At Knoxville, overall pumpkin yield across both years averaged 17.7 t.ha(-1), and pumpkin yield did not differ because of treatment (15.3-20.4 t.ha(-1)). The differences in yield between treatments at Mount Vernon were likely because of differences in the soil temperature. At 10 cm depth, the average soil temperature was 1 degrees C lower for bare ground and WeedGuardPlus as compared with PE mulch and plastic BDMs (20.8 degrees C). In contrast, soil temperatures were generally higher (25.2 to 28.3 degrees C) for all treatments at Knoxville and more favorable to crop yield compared with Mount Vernon. Forty-two percent to 59% of pumpkin fruit had mulch adhesion at harvest at Mount Vernon, whereas only 3% to 12% of fruit had mulch adhesion at Knoxville. This difference was because of the location of fruit set-at Mount Vernon, most of the fruit set was on the mulch whereas at Knoxville, vine growth was more extensive and fruit set was mostly in row alleys. Fruit quality differences among treatments were minimal during storage across both locations and years except for total soluble solids (TSS) in 2016, which was lower for bare ground and WeedGuardPlus compared with all the plastic mulches. Taken overall, these results indicate that pie pumpkin grown with BDM has fruit yield and quality comparable to PE mulch; however, adhesion of some BDMs on fruit could affect marketable yield.

However, the influencing factors and strategies employed for seed germination in desert grasslands under grazing remain unknown. Therefore, in this study, the reproductive allocation, seed density, seed properties, and corresponding seed germination rates of S. breviflora were examined. Possible situations encountered during dispersal were also simulated to determine their effects on seed germination. The results showed that reproductive individual density not subjected to grazing were significantly higher than those subjected to moderate and heavy grazing. For seed density and seed bank in soil, the highest values were observed for the no grazing treatment, followed by the moderate and heavy grazing treatments. The seed density for germination of soil seed banks was nearly one-fourth of seed density during the growing season. In addition, grazing treatments affected the phenotypic characteristics of seeds and reduced the lower limit of the weight of germinable seeds. Awn removal significantly increased germination. The longest germination time was observed for seeds that entered the soil at an angle of 0 degrees. Our research demonstrated that grazing negatively affected the desert grassland edificator. Individual plants adopted different adaptation strategies under different grazing intensities; for example, a fixed proportion of the seed number and seed germination number of S. breviflora in the soil seed bank was maintained by exceeding the minimum weight of a seed for seed germination. During seed dispersion, the awn effectively prevented germination under unfavourable conditions and helped seeds enter the soil at an optimal angle for promoting germination.																	2167-8359					MAR 1	2018	6								e4447	10.7717/peerj.4447							WOS:000426525100005	29507838

Herbarium collection-based phylogenetics of the ragweeds (Ambrosia, Asteraceae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Ambrosia (Asteraceae) is a taxonomically difficult genus of weedy, wind-pollinated plants with an apparent center of diversity in the Sonoran Desert of North America. Determining Ambrosia's evolutionary relationships has been the subject of much interest, with numerous studies using morphological characters, cytology, comparative phytochemistry, and chloroplast restriction site variation to produce conflicting accounts the relationships between Ambrosia species, as well as the classification of their close relatives in Franseria and Hymenoclea. To resolve undetermined intra-generic relationships within Ambrosia, we used DNA extracted from tissues obtained from seed banks and herbarium collections to generate multi-locus genetic data representing nearly all putative species, including four from South America. We performed Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic analyses of six chloroplast-genome and two nuclear-genome markers, enabling us to infer monophyly for the genus, resolve major infra-generic species clusters, as well as to resolve open questions about the evolutionary relationships of several Ambrosia species and former members of Franseria. We also provide molecular data supporting the hypothesis that A. sandersonii formed through the hybridization of A. eriocentra and A. salsola. The topology of our chloroplast DNA phylogeny is almost entirely congruent with the most recent molecular work based on chloroplast restriction site variation of a much more limited sampling of 14 North American species of Ambrosia, although our improved sampling of global Ambrosia diversity enables us to draw additional conclusions. As our study is the first direct DNA sequence-based phylogenetic analyses of Ambrosia, we analyze the data in relation to previous taxonomic studies and discuss several instances of chloroplast/nuclear incongruence that leave the precise geographic center of origin of Ambrosia in question.																	1055-7903	1095-9513				MAR	2018	120						335	341		10.1016/j.ympev.2017.12.023							WOS:000426199700030	29274739

At the community level, wetland structure and succession during and after a seasonal flooding event depends upon the early life-history requirements of species, including germination under flooded and dry conditions. We examined the effects of simulated flood and post-flood scenarios on seedling emergence from a seed bank of seasonally flooded grassland in the Pantanal, Brazil. Field samplings were conducted in both wet and dry seasons, both of which were subject to flood and post-flood conditions. A total of 70 species emerged from the seed bank, dominated by Poaceae and Cyperaceae. Sixteen species were exclusive to the wet and one exclusive to the dry season. The richness of perennial species was higher under flood conditions, while the richness of annuals was greater post-flood. In general, the aquatic and amphibious species exhibited a significant germination response to flooding. Terrestrial species only germinated in post-flood conditions, with higher richness in the dry season. Four species had high seedling abundance in both treatments. The capacity of regeneration by seeds is high in these grasslands and can be increased by seasonal flooding and drawdown. In these seasonally flooded grasslands, we observed three main germination strategies: under flooded conditions, aquatic and amphibious species; post-flood conditions, an explosion of annual amphibious and terrestrial species; and in moist soil, perennial terrestrial species. The differential responses to flooding versus post-flood conditions help to maintain the structure and species richness in the community over time.

Plant species diversity in a Neotropical wetland: patterns of similarity, effects of distance, and altitude	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												The Brazilian Pantanal is an extensive wetland with heterogeneous habitats, primarily due to the river-floodplain system and plants with differential adaptations and reproductive strategies. Factors such as altitude, distance among plant formations, and flood pulse must be considered to better understand its diversity. Aiming to assess the influence of biogeographic patterns in this system, we analyzed the floristic composition of six areas along the Paraguay River, including residual relieves, verifying the pattern of similarity, and effects of distance and altitude. We recorded 356 species in 87 families, mostly perennial (75%), and some annuals (15%) and pluriannuals (5%). Herbaceous plants were the most represented (48%), followed by arboreal (23%), shrubby (15%) and epiphytic (14%) habits, only 12% being endemic to Brazil. The studied areas showed low floristic similarity, but higher resemblance of species between neighboring areas, and no relation with altitude. The upper Paraguay River is diverse, with high spatial variability of species, predominantly perennial. The river-floodplain connectivity may be a determinant factor in species richness and occurrence of endemic species.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a strategy used for functional analysis of genes that combines the classical mutagenesis and a rapid, high-throughput identification of mutations within a gene of interest. TILLING has been initially developed as a discovery platform for functional genomics, but soon it has become a valuable tool in development of desired alleles for crop breeding, alternative to transgenic approach. Here we present the HorTILLUS (Hordeum-TILLING-University of Silesia) population created for spring barley cultivar "Sebastian" after double-treatment of seeds with two chemical mutagens: sodium azide (NaN3) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). The population comprises more than 9,600 M-2 plants from which DNA was isolated, seeds harvested, vacuum-packed, and deposited in seed bank. M progeny of 3,481 M-2 individuals was grown in the field and phenotyped. The screening for mutations was performed for 32 genes related to different aspects of plant growth and development. For each gene fragment, 3,072-6,912 M-2 plants were used for mutation identification using LI-COR sequencer. In total, 382 mutations were found in 182.2Mb screened. The average mutation density in the HorTILLUS, estimated as 1 mutation per 477 kb, is among the highest mutation densities reported for barley. The majority of mutations were G/C to A/T transitions, however about 8% transversions were also detected. Sixty-one percent of mutations found in coding regions were missense, 37.5% silent and 1.1% nonsense. In each gene, the missense mutations with a potential effect on protein function were identified. The HorTILLUS platformis the largest of the TILLING populations reported for barley and best characterized.

Populations in Temperate China	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Seagrasses are important components of global coastal ecosystems, and the eelgrass Zostera marina L. is widely distributed along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts in the temperate northern hemisphere, but limited datum related to the contribution of sexual reproduction to population recruitment have been reported. This study aimed to understand eelgrass sexual reproduction and population recruitment in Swan Lake (SLL), and Huiquan Bay (HQB) was included for comparison. Random sampling, permanent quadrats or cores and laboratory seed germination-based experimental methods were employed. The flowering, seed production, seed banks, seed germination, seedling survival, and seedling growth of eelgrass were investigated from July 2014 to December 2015 to evaluate the contribution of sexual reproduction to population recruitment. Results indicated a dominant role of asexual reproduction in HQB, while sexual reproduction played a relatively important role in SLL. The highest flowering shoot density in SLL was 517.27 +/- 504.29 shoots m(-2) (June) and represented 53.34% of the total shoots at the center site. The potential seed output per reproductive shoot and per unit area in SLL were 103.67 +/- 37.95 seeds shoot(-1) and 53,623.66 +/- 19,628.11 seeds m(-2), respectively. The maximum seed bank density in SLL was 552.21 +/- 204.94 seeds m(-2) (October). Seed germination mainly occurred from the middle of March to the end of May, and the highest seedling density was 296.88 +/- 274.27 seedlings m(-2) in April. The recruitment from seedlings accounted for 41.36% of the Z. marina population recruitment at the center site, while the sexual recruitment contribution at the patch site (50.52%) was greater than that at the center site. Seeds in SLL were acclimated to spring germination, while in HQB, they were acclimated to autumn germination (early October-late November). Seed bank density in HQB was very low, with a value of 254.35 +/- 613.34 seeds m(-2) (early October). However, seeds in HQB were significantly larger and heavier than those in SLL (size: P = 0.004; weight: P < 0.001). The recruitment from seedlings accounted for as low as 2.53% of the Z. marina population recruitment in HQB. Our laboratory seed germination experiment, which was conducted in autumn, showed that the seed germination percent in HQB was significantly greater than in SLL at optimal germination temperatures (10 and 15. C; P < 0.001). A laboratory seed germination test at suitable temperature may be a potential novel approach to identify the ecological differences among different geographic populations. It is suggested that the Z. marina population recruitment may have different strategies and adapt to specific local conditions, such as in SLL and HQB, and the temperature regime may control morphological and phonological variations.

J	Ellegaard, M; Ribeiro, S				Ellegaard, Marianne; Ribeiro, Sofia			The long-term persistence of phytoplankton resting stages in aquatic 'seed banks'	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												In the past decade, research on long-term persistence of phytoplankton resting stages has intensified. Simultaneously, insight into life-cycle variability in the diverse groups of phytoplankton has also increased. Aquatic 'seed banks' have tremendous significance and show many interesting parallels to terrestrial seed beds of vascular plants, but are much less studied. It is therefore timely to review the phenomenon of long-term persistence of aquatic resting stages in sediment seed banks. Herein we compare function, morphology and physiology of phytoplankton resting stages to factors central for persistence of terrestrial seeds. We review the types of resting stages found in different groups of phytoplankton and focus on the groups for which long-term (multi-decadal) persistence has been shown: dinoflagellates, diatoms, green algae and cyanobacteria. We discuss the metabolism of long-term dormancy in phytoplankton resting stages and the ecological, evolutionary and management implications of this important trait. Phytoplankton resting stages exhibiting long-term viability are characterized by thick, often multi-layered walls and accumulation vesicles containing starch, lipids or other materials such as pigments, cyanophycin or unidentified granular materials. They are reported to play central roles in evolutionary resilience and survival of catastrophic events. Promising areas for future research include the role of hormones in mediating dormancy, elucidating the mechanisms behind metabolic shut-down and testing bet-hedging hypotheses.

J	Gioria, M; Pysek, P; Osborne, BA				Gioria, Margherita; Pysek, Petr; Osborne, Bruce A.			Timing is everything: does early and late germination favor invasions by herbaceous alien plants?	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Plant invasions represent a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying community assembly rules and species distribution patterns. While a superior competitive ability has often been proposed as a major driver of successful plant invasions, its significance depends crucially on the timing of any competitive interaction. We assess whether a mismatch in germination phenology can favor the establishment of alien species, allowing them to exploit vacant niches where competition is low. As well as having important effects on the survival, growth and fitness of a species, asymmetric competition and potential soil legacies resulting from early or late germination can also impact on species recruitment. However, early or late germination comes at a cost, increases the risks of exposure to unfavorable conditions and requires an enhanced abiotic resistance if it is to lead to successful establishment. Important Findings While there are several anecdotal accounts of early and late germination for invasive species, there are limited comparative data with resident species growing under natural conditions. Available evidence from grassland communities indicates that a short-term germination advantage or priority (few days/weeks) provides invasive species with a strong competitive advantage over native species and is a critical factor in many invasions. While the exploitation of periods of low competition is a plausible mechanism for the successful establishment of many invasive plants, direct evidence for this strategy is still scarce. This is particularly true with regard to the exploitation of late germination niches. Consequently, long-term comparative monitoring of the germination phenology of invasive and native plants in situ is needed to assess its significance in a range of ecosystems and its impact on community dynamics.

J	Abella, SR; Schetter, TA; Walters, TL				Abella, Scott R.; Schetter, Timothy A.; Walters, Timothy L.			Testing the hypothesis of hierarchical predictability in ecological restoration and succession	OECOLOGIA												To advance predictive ecology, the hypothesis of hierarchical predictability proposes that community measures for which species are interchangeable (e.g., structure and species richness) are more predictable than measures for which species identity matters (e.g., community composition). Predictability is hypothesized to decrease for response measures in order of the following categories: structure, species richness, function, and species composition. We tested this hypothesis using a 14-year, oak savanna-prairie restoration experiment that removed non-native pine plantations at 24 sites in northwestern Ohio, USA. Based on 24 response measures, the data showed minimal support for the hypothesis, because response measures varied in predictability within categories. Half of response measures had over half their variability modeled using fixed (restoration treatment and year) and random plot effects, and these "predictable" measures occurred in all four categories. Pine basal area, environment (e.g., soil texture), and antecedent vegetation accounted for over half the variation in change within the first three post-restoration years for 77% of response measures. Change between the 3rd and 14th years was less predictable, but most restoration measures increased favorably via sites achieving them in unique ways. We propose that variation will not conform with the hypothesis of hierarchical predictability in ecosystems with vegetation dynamics driven by stochastic processes such as seed dispersal, or where vegetation structure and species richness are influenced by species composition. The ability to predict a community measure may be more driven by the number of combinations of casual factors affecting a measure than by the number of values it can have.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				FEB	2018	186	2					541	553		10.1007/s00442-017-4040-z							WOS:000424210100022	29224118					
J	Porto, KCN; Nunes, YRF; Ribeiro, LM				Novais Porto, Keila Cristina; Ferreira Nunes, Yule Roberta; Ribeiro, Leonardo Monteiro			The dynamics of recalcitrant seed banks of Mauritia flexuosa (Arecaceae) reveal adaptations to marsh microenvironments	PLANT ECOLOGY												The Mauritia flexuosa palm tree is widely distributed in South America, and is associated with flooded environments. It dominates the arboreal stratum in the highly threatened marsh ecosystems called "veredas" in the Cerrado biome (neotropical savanna), and its oleaginous fruits are important for the maintenance of the regional fauna and as a source of income for traditional human populations. The seeds of this palm demonstrate an unusual association of recalcitrance and dormancy, and information about its seed bank maintenance in natural environments is scarce. We measured the variations in water content, viability, and germination of seeds maintained over 1 year in four typical vereda microenvironments (edge, near the water, in the water, and at the lower zone of the vereda) and related that information to soil water contents and climatic data. Seed viability was best preserved under constantly flooded conditions (at the lower zone of the vereda), with the potential for maintaining a temporary seed bank in the aquatic environment that would favor dispersal. Although the seeds are intolerant of dehydration, they have a high capacity for maintaining their water contents under partially drained soil conditions, and overcoming dormancy is favored under those conditions. Mauritia flexuosa establishment strategies are driven by sophisticated interactions with climate and with vereda microenvironments, with a tendency for maintaining seed banks and seedling banks in localities with flooded or drained soils, respectively.

J	Lipoma, ML; Funes, G; Diaz, S				Lucrecia Lipoma, M.; Funes, Guillermo; Diaz, Sandra			Fire effects on the soil seed bank and post-fire resilience of a semi-arid shrubland in central Argentina	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Soil seed bank is an important source of resilience of plant communities who suffered disturbances. We analysed the effect of an intense fire in the soil seed bank of a semi-arid shrubland of Cordoba Argentina. We asked if the fire affected seed abundance, floristic and functional composition of the soil seed bank at two different layers (0-5cm and 5-10cm), and if fire could compromise the role of the soil seed bank as a source of resilience for the vegetation. We collected soil samples from a burned site and from a control site that had not burned. Samples were installed in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. During 12months, we recorded all germinated seedlings. We compare soil seed bank with pre-fire vegetation in terms of floristic and functional composition. The high-intensity fire deeply affected the abundance of seeds in the soil, but it did not affect its floristic or functional composition. Floristic and functional composition of soil seed banks - at burned and unburned sites- differed markedly from that of the pre-fire vegetation, although a previous study at the same site indicated high resilience after fire of this plant community. Our results indicate that resilience of this system is not strongly dependent on direct germination from seeds buried in the soil. Other sources of resilience, like colonization from neighbouring vegetation patches and resprouting from underground organs appear to gain relevance after an intense fire.

J	Maikano, GN; Cohn, J; Di Stefano, J				Maikano, Gloria Neo; Cohn, Janet; Di Stefano, Julian			Are germination cues for soil-stored seed banks different in structurally different fire-prone communities?	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Many plant species are dependent on soil-stored seeds for their persistence in fire-prone systems. Seed germination is often stimulated by fire-related cues including heat and smoke, but the way these cues promote germination may differ between structurally distinct plant communities with historically different fire regimes. In this study, we examined the effects of heat, smoke and their interactions on the germination of soil-stored seeds from shrubby woodlands and herbaceous forests in south-east Australia. The effect of these treatments on species richness, diversity and composition, and species richness and density of germinants within life-forms (grass, forb and shrub) were assessed. Soils from each community were subjected to low heat (40 degrees C), low heat with smoke, smoke, high heat (80 degrees C), high heat with smoke and untreated (control) before being placed in a glasshouse, where the germinants were identified and counted. Greater species richness was stimulated by high heat treatments and smoke in both communities, a trend driven by shrubs and forbs, rather than grasses. Greater species diversity was stimulated by high heat with smoke in both communities. Greater densities of grass germinants were stimulated by all treatments, except low heat, in both communities. For forbs and shrubs, the effect of treatment depended on community. Compared to the control, low heat with smoke (forbs) and both low heat and low heat with smoke (shrubs) increased densities in the woodland but not in the forest. There were unique species compositions, different from the control, in all treatments in the forest but not in the woodland, where composition in low heat was not different from the control. These results indicate the importance of high soil temperatures and smoke in both communities. In the absence of wildfires, recurring prescribed burns that heat the soil to low temperatures are likely to reduce plant richness, diversity, and density resulting in a change in understorey species composition and structure.

J	Xie, T; Cui, BS; Bai, JH; Li, SZ; Zhang, SY				Xie, Tian; Cui, Baoshan; Bai, Junhong; Li, Shanze; Zhang, Shuyan			Rethinking the role of edaphic condition in halophyte vegetation degradation on salt marshes due to coastal defense structure	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Determining how human disturbance affects plant community persistence and species conservation is one of the most pressing ecological challenges. The large-scale disturbance form defense structures usually have a long-term and potential effect on phytocommunity in coastal saltmarshes. Coastal defense structures usually remove the effect of tidal wave on tidal salt marshes. As a consequence, edaphic factors such as the salinity and moisture contents are disturbed by tidal action blocking. However, few previous studies have explicitly addressed the response of halophyte species persistence and dynamics to the changing edaphic conditions. The understanding of the response of species composition in seed banks and aboveground vegetation to the stress is important to identify ecological effect of coastal defense structures and provide usefully insight into restoration. Here, we conducted a field study to distinguish the density, species composition and relationships of seed bank with aboveground vegetation between tidal flat wetlands with and without coastal defense structures. We also addressed the role of edaphic condition in vegetation degradation caused by coastal defense structures in combination with field monitor and greenhouse experiments. Our results showed the density of the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in the tidal flat without coastal defense structures was significantly lower than the surrounded flat with coastal defense structures. A total of 14 species were founded in the surrounded flat seed bank and 11 species in the tidal flat, but three species were only recorded in aboveground vegetation of the tidal flat which was much lower than 24 aboveground species in the surrounded flat. The absent of species in aboveground vegetation contributed to low germination rate which depend on the edaphic condition. The germination of seeds in the seed bank were inhabited by high soil salinity in the tidal flat and low soil moisture in the surrounded flat. Our study supported the hypothesis that the change of edaphic condition caused by coastal defense structures was the main reason for the difference of the species composition similarity between aboveground vegetation and the soil seed bank between the tidal and surrounded flats. Therefore, mitigating the hydrological disturbance and maintaining the original state of edaphic factors would be useful implications for reducing the ecological effect of defense structure to vegetation communities in coastal salt marshes.

Persistence as adults and/or seeds across recruitment events allows species to dampen the effects of environmental fluctuations. The evolution of life cycles with overlapping generations should thus permit the colonization of environments with uncertain recruitment. We tested this hypothesis in Leucadendron (Proteaceae), a genus with high functional diversity native to fire-prone habitats in the South African fynbos. We analyzed the joint evolution of life-history traits (adult survival and seed-bank strategies) and ecological niches (climate and fire regime), using comparative methods and accounting for various sources of uncertainty. In the fynbos, species with canopy seed banks that are unable to survive fire as adults display nonoverlapping generations. In contrast, resprouters with an underground seed bank may be less threatened by extreme climatic events and fire intervals, given their iteroparity and long-lasting seed bank. Life cycles with nonoverlapping generations indeed jointly evolved with niches with less exposure to frost but not with those with less exposure to drought. Canopy seed banks jointly evolved with niches with more predictable fire return, compared to underground seed banks. The evolution of extraordinary functional diversity among fynbos plants thus reflects, at least in part, the diversity of both climates and fire regimes in this region.

By coupling 25 years of in situ climate manipulation with experimental seed introductions and both historical and current plant surveys, we identify causal, mechanistic links between climate change and the local extinction of a widespread mountain plant (Androsace septentrionalis). Climate warming causes precipitous declines in population size by reducing fecundity and survival across multiple life stages. Climate warming also purges below ground seed banks, limiting the potential for the future recovery of at-risk populations under ameliorated conditions. Bolstered by previous reports of plant community shifts in this experiment and in other habitats, our findings not only support the hypothesis that climate change can drive local extinction but also foreshadow potentially widespread species losses in subalpine meadows as climate warming continues.

Invasion by Rhododendron ponticum depletes the native seed bank with long-term impacts after its removal	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The soil seed bank plays an important role in determining what plant species emerge following the removal of monodominant invasive species. A depleted seed bank may provide a substantial barrier to site restoration, however, little is known about what changes occur in the seed bank during invasion and following clearance. This study used greenhouse germination trials to quantify and compare the seed bank present in 30 Scottish Atlantic oak woodland sites under three treatments: (1) sites featuring dense stands of the non-native invasive shrub Rhododendron ponticum; (2) sites that had been previously subject to dense R. ponticum stands but which had been cleared; and (3) uninvaded control sites. Seed banks of densely invaded and cleared sites had significantly lower species richness than those of uninvaded control sites with a lower abundance of graminoid, and to a lesser extent forb seeds than the uninvaded controls. The seed bank community composition differed significantly between the three site types. Uninvaded sites featured a wide array of species, densely invaded sites were dominated by R. ponticum seeds and cleared sites were dominated by birch (Betula sp.) seeds. Cleared sites contained very few R. ponticum seeds indicating that once effective clearance had been achieved, re-invasion would be unlikely to occur from the soil seed bank. Our findings revealed that the soil seed bank present in cleared sites was very different from the seed bank of uninvaded control sites, with clear implications for site restoration.

In each study site, 30 samples were collected per soil layers (litter, 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth). The species diversity and abundance of the soil seed bank were estimated after soil samples were brought to germination. We globally observed 297 seedlings of 53 species for the Celtis forest and 222 seedlings of 39 species for the Manilkara forest. The total densities of germinated seeds were 330 seedlings m(-2) and 247 seedlings m(-2), respectively. Herbaceous species dominated with percentages of 41.0 and 45.3%, respectively in the Manilkara forest and the Celtis forest. Both forest types displayed a regeneration potential through the soil seed bank. However, this potential seems higher in the Celtis forest. Pioneer taxa were more abundant in the soil seed bank of the Celtis forest (13 woody pioneer species) than the Manilkara forest (9 woody pioneer species). The values of Sorensen similarity index between the standing tree vegetation and the soil seed bank in each site were relatively low: 11.0% for the Celtis forest and 8.8% for the Manilkara forest. But these similarity values were higher when only the pioneer species were considered: 46.8% in the Celtis forest and 38.9% in the Manilkara forest. The highest species richness were obtained in the first two soil layers (0-10 cm depth) while 21.8% and 21.4% of the species were exclusively found in the deepest layer (10-20 cm) in the Celtis forest and the Manilkara forest, respectively. Among the timber species found in the forest, only three were observed in the soil seed bank of the two sites: Nauclea diderrichii, Erythrophleum suaveolens and Staudtia kamerunensis. N. diderrichii was particularly abundant in the soil seed stock of the two sites (14.4-34.4 seeds m(-2)). Results suggested that to improve regeneration of timber species, planting in open forest habitats with seedlings coming from tree nursery should be more efficient.

We studied Carex meyeriana tussocks to look at their role in creating micro-heterogeneity and supporting biodiversity in northeastern China. We investigated vegetation in paired plots on and between tussocks of C. meyeriana, and measured water depth, soil water content, soil temperature, soil organic carbon, litter depth, soil total N and P on and between tussocks. We found a total of 75 taxa in the sedge meadows. Species richness was higher on rather than between tussocks. Soil temperature, organic carbon, soil total P, and litter depth were higher on tussocks rather than between tussocks. Water depth, soil water content and soil total N were lower on tussocks compared to between tussocks. Species richness on tussocks increased with increasing tussock basal area, height and surface area. Plant composition was mostly related to the environmental variables based on canonical correspondence analysis. The main gradient is determined, from on tussocks to between tussocks, by an increase in water depth, soil water content and total N and a decrease in soil temperature and soil total P. We conclude that tussocks create different microhabitats in sedge meadows that support different species.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2018	38	1					15	23		10.1007/s13157-017-0952-y							WOS:000425634800002

Extent of pollen-mediated gene flow and seed longevity in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.): Implications for biosafety procedures	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												New switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) bioenergy cultivars are being bred through genetic engineering; however, baseline information is urgently needed to establish guidelines for small-scale field trials prior to commercialization. In this study, we documented the pattern of pollen-mediated gene flow and the extent of seed longevity in field experiments. To mimic crop-to-wild, pollen-mediated gene flow, we planted wild recipient switchgrass ramets at various distances away from cultivar donor ramets at two sites in Ohio. Percent hybridization at each distance was estimated from seed set on recipient ramets, which were self-incompatible clones. The pattern of gene flow was best described by negative exponential models, and the minimum isolation distance for a 0.01% gene flow threshold was predicted to be 69 m and 109 m away from the pollen source at the two sites. To investigate seed longevity, we buried seeds of six cultivars and ten wild biotypes in Ohio and Iowa in 2011. A subset of the seeds were exhumed, germinated, and tested for dormancy over three years. Cultivars lost seed viability and dormancy significantly sooner than wild biotypes at both locations in the first year, and most biotypes lost dormancy by the second year. Cultivar seeds buried in the cooler, drier Iowa site had an overall greater longevity than those buried in Ohio. Our findings suggest that substantial amounts of pollen-mediated gene flow could occur in the immediate vicinity of switchgrass pollen sources, and current switchgrass cultivars are unlikely to persist in the seed bank for more than three years.																	0961-9534	1873-2909				FEB	2018	109						114	124		10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.12.016							WOS:000424939200014

The role of genebanks has evolved from primarily serving plant breeders to include long-term biodiversity conservation and distribution to a wider user community. International policy frameworks stress the complementarity of ex situ and in situ conservation and management, but a dichotomy prevails in the public and scholarly agricultural development discourse. Here, we present a study of existing linkages between the two conservation and management approaches, their challenges and future options. First, we show that farmers, farmer organizations, and NGOs now comprise a considerable user group of genebank material, receiving at least 8% of the seed samples distributed from international genebanks in 2015, on par with the proportion distributed to the commercial seed sector. Second, we map and categorize approaches to introduce genebank material into farmers' seed systems. Based on a survey, interviews and a literature review we categorize direct genebank-farmer linkages into six categories: (1) Reintroduction, (2) Emergency Seed Interventions, (3) Community Seed Banks, (4) Participatory Plant Breeding, (5) Variety Introduction, and (6) Integrative Seed System Approaches. We investigate the merits of these approaches as alternative and complementary pathways for enhancing farmers' access to crop diversity. Finally, we discuss challenges related to scale, sustainability and legal frame conditions and point out opportunities to realize synergies to achieve the ultimate goal of the ex situ conservation agenda and the farmers' rights agenda, namely to strengthen farmers' access to suitable seeds.																	1876-4517	1876-4525				FEB	2018	10	1					9	25		10.1007/s12571-017-0751-6							WOS:000425595900001

Deep ocean prokaryotic communities are remarkably malleable when facing long-term starvation	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The bathypelagic ocean is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth and sustains half of the ocean's microbial activity. This microbial activity strongly relies on surface-derived particles, but there is growing evidence that the carbon released through solubilization of these particles may not be sufficient to meet the energy demands of deep ocean prokaryotes. To explore how bathypelagic prokaryotes respond to the absence of external inputs of carbon, we followed the long-term (1 year) dynamics of an enclosed community. Despite the lack of external energy supply, we observed a continuous succession of active prokaryotic phylotypes, which was driven by recruitment of taxa from the seed bank (i.e., initially rare operational taxonomic units [OTUs]). A single OTU belonging to Marine Group I of Thaumarchaeota, which was originally rare, dominated the microbial community for similar to 4 months and played a fundamental role in this succession likely by introducing new organic carbon through chemolithoautotrophy. This carbon presumably produced a priming effect, because after the decline of Thaumarchaeota, the diversity and metabolic potential of the community increased back to the levels present at the start of the experiment. Our study demonstrates the profound versatility of deep microbial communities when facing organic carbon deprivation.

Because F. crenata forests are declining under global warming, the conservation of seed resources is necessary to maintain sustainable regeneration. We examined the capability of seed cryopreservation to achieve semi-permanent preservation of the F. crenata genetic resource. Seeds at 7%-26% moisture content (MC) exhibited greater than 64% viability, with developing radicles growing at 22 degrees C in 16 h photoperiods following chilling at 2 degrees C for 2 months. These seeds were then stored cryogenically at -170 degrees C for 6 months; cryopreservation at 26% MC reduced seed viability to 12%, whereas dry seeds (7%-14% MC) maintained viability and were comparable with seeds that had neither been dried nor cryopreserved. Drying seeds to 6% MC reduced viability to 47%; following cryopreservation, the viability of these seeds with such a low MC was 36%. Using a Bayesian model, we then determined that the optimal range of MC for the cryopreservation of F. crenata seeds was 9%-12%. We conclude that cryopreservation is feasible for the long-term storage of F. crenata seeds, drying of the seeds to the range of optimal MC retains high viability during cryogenic storage.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				FEB	2018	48	2					192	196		10.1139/cjfr-2017-0286							WOS:000424011000008						
J	Salguero-Gomez, R				Salguero-Gomez, Roberto			Implications of clonality for ageing research	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Senescence, an organismal performance decline with age, has historically been considered a universal phenomenon by evolutionary biologists and zoologist. Yet, increasing fertility and survival with age are nothing new to plant ecologists, among whom it is common knowledge that senescence is not universal. Recently, these two realities have come into a confrontation, begging for the rephrasing of the classical question that has led ageing research for decades: "why do we senesce?" to a more practical "what are the mechanisms by which some organisms escape from senescence?" Plants are amenable to examining this question because of their rich repertoire of life history strategies. These include the existence of permanent seed banks, vegetative dormancy and ability to produce clones, among others. Here, I use a large number of high resolution demographic models from 181 species that reflect life history strategies and their trade-offs among herbaceous perennials, succulents and shrubs measured under field conditions worldwide to examine whether senescence rates of ramets from clonal plants differ from those of whole plants reproducing either strictly sexually, or with a combination of sexual and clonal mechanisms. Contrary to the initial expectation from the mutation accumulation theory of senescence, ramets of clonal plants were more likely to exhibit senescence than those species employing sexual reproduction. I discuss why these comparisons between ramets and genets are useful, as well as its implications and future directions for ageing research.

J	Tiebel, K; Huth, F; Wagner, S				Tiebel, Katharina; Huth, Franka; Wagner, Sven			Soil seed banks of pioneer tree species in European temperate forests: a review	IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY												The ability of short-lived tree species such as birch, alder, willow, poplar and rowan to form even a short-term soil seed bank is discussed controversially in the literature. Soil seed banks are an important component of succession and regeneration in ecosystems. Following disturbance, buried viable seeds germinate and the seedlings that establish cover the disturbed, exposed soil surfaces. The objective of this study was to review the literature on soil seed bank research carried out in central and north-west European temperate forests to provide an overview of the ability of pioneer tree species to form a viable seed bank. The review of 33 publications revealed that birch is the only pioneer tree species of temperate forests with longer-lived seeds, persisting in the soil for 1-5 years. Birch seeds remain viable in deeper soil layers (5-10 cm), so birch may be assigned to the short-term persistent soil seed bank type. The seeds of alder, willow and poplar would appear to be short-lived. Maximum seed densities of all tree species were found in the upper soil layers. With increasing soil depth, seed density declined. Viable seeds of rowan were not detected in any of the soil seed bank studies, although seed trees were present. We found that in spite of the capacity for long seed dispersal distances, high densities of birch, alder and willow seeds were only observed in close proximity to seed trees. The higher the numbers of seed trees, the higher the seed densities in soils. Maximum seed densities were recorded during and shortly after seed rains had occurred. Our results reveal that a birch seed bank may compensate for years of low seed production levels. However, as the seed bank is only short-term persistent, it must be supplemented by fresh seeds from surrounding seed trees as often as possible to guarantee a continuous capacity for regeneration.																	1971-7458					FEB	2018	11						48	57		10.3832/ifor2400-011							WOS:000423871600001						
J	Rudi, G; Bailly, JS; Vinatier, F				Rudi, Gabrielle; Bailly, Jean-Stephane; Vinatier, Fabrice			Using geomorphological variables to predict the spatial distribution of plant species in agricultural drainage networks	PLOS ONE												To optimize ecosystem services provided by agricultural drainage networks (ditches) in headwater catchments, we need to manage the spatial distribution of plant species living in these networks. Geomorphological variables have been shown to be important predictors of plant distribution in other ecosystems because they control the water regime, the sediment deposition rates and the sun exposure in the ditches. Whether such variables may be used to predict plant distribution in agricultural drainage networks is unknown. We collected presence and absence data for 10 herbaceous plant species in a subset of a network of drainage ditches (35 km long) within a Mediterranean agricultural catchment. We simulated their spatial distribution with GLM and Maxent model using geomorphological variables and distance to natural lands and roads. Models were validated using k-fold cross-validation. We then compared the mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) values obtained for each model and other metrics issued from the confusion matrices between observed and predicted variables. Based on the results of all metrics, the models were efficient at predicting the distribution of seven species out of ten, confirming the relevance of geomorphological variables and distance to natural lands and roads to explain the occurrence of plant species in this Mediterranean catchment. In particular, the importance of the landscape geomorphological variables, ie the importance of the geomorphological features encompassing a broad environment around the ditch, has been highlighted. This suggests that agro-ecological measures for managing ecosystem services provided by ditch plants should focus on the control of the hydrological and sedimentological connectivity at the catchment scale. For example, the density of the ditch network could be modified or the spatial distribution of vegetative filter strips used for sediment trapping could be optimized. In addition, the vegetative filter strips could constitute new seed bank sources for species that are affected by the distance to natural lands and roads.

Defense Enzyme Responses in Dormant Wild Oat and Wheat Caryopses Challenged with a Seed Decay Pathogen	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Seeds have well-established passive physical and chemical defense mechanisms that protect their food reserves from decay-inducing organisms and herbivores. However, there are few studies evaluating potential biochemical defenses of dormant seeds against pathogens. Caryopsis decay by the pathogenic Fusarium avenaceum strain F.a.1 was relatively rapid in wild oat (Avena fatua L.) isoline "M73," with > 50% decay after 8 days with almost no decay in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) var. RL4137. Thus, this fungal strain has potential for selective decay of wild oat relative to wheat. To study defense enzyme activities, wild oat and wheat caryopses were incubated with F.a.1 for 2-3 days. Whole caryopses were incubated in assay reagents to measure extrinsic defense enzyme activities. Polyphenol oxidase, exochitinase, and peroxidase were induced in whole caryopses, but oxalate oxidase was reduced, in response to F.a.1 in both species. To evaluate whether defense enzyme activities were released from the caryopsis surface, caryopses were washed with buffer and enzyme activity was measured in the leachate. Significant activities of polyphenol oxidase, exochitinase, and peroxidase, but not oxalate oxidase, were leached from caryopses. Defense enzyme responses were qualitatively similar in the wild oat and wheat genotypes evaluated. Although the absolute enzyme activities were generally greater in whole caryopses than in leachates, the relative degree of induction of polyphenol oxidase, exochitinase, and peroxidase by F.a.1 was greater in caryopsis leachates, indicating that a disproportionate quantity of the induced activity was released into the environment from the caryopsis surface, consistent with their assumed role in defense. It is unlikely that the specific defense enzymes studied here play a key role in the differential susceptibility to decay by F.a.1 in these two genotypes since defense enzyme activities were greater in the more susceptible wild oat, compared to wheat. Results are consistent with the hypotheses that (1) dormant seeds are capable of mounting complex responses to pathogens, (2) a diversity of defense enzymes are involved in responses in multiple plant species, and (3) it is possible to identify fungi capable of selective decay of weed seeds without damaging crop seeds, a concept that may be applicable to weed management in the field. While earlier work on seed defenses demonstrated the presence of passive defenses, this work shows that dormant seeds are also quite responsive and capable of activating and releasing defense enzymes in response to a pathogen.																	1664-462X					JAN 23	2018	8								2259	10.3389/fpls.2017.02259							WOS:000423032700001

High resolution time series reveals cohesive but short-lived communities in coastal plankton	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Because microbial plankton in the ocean comprise diverse bacteria, algae, and protists that are subject to environmental forcing on multiple spatial and temporal scales, a fundamental open question is to what extent these organisms form ecologically cohesive communities. Here we show that although all taxa undergo large, near daily fluctuations in abundance, microbial plankton are organized into clearly defined communities whose turnover is rapid and sharp. We analyze a time series of 93 consecutive days of coastal plankton using a technique that allows inference of communities as modular units of interacting taxa by determining positive and negative correlations at different temporal frequencies. This approach shows both coordinated population expansions that demarcate community boundaries and high frequency of positive and negative associations among populations within communities. Our analysis thus highlights that the environmental variability of the coastal ocean is mirrored in sharp transitions of defined but ephemeral communities of organisms.

Hitching a ride: Seed accrual rates on different types of vehicles	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Human activities, from resource extraction to recreation, are increasing global connectivity, especially to less-disturbed and previously inaccessible places. Such activities necessitate road networks and vehicles. Vehicles can transport reproductive plant propagules long distances, thereby increasing the risk of invasive plant species transport and dispersal. Subsequent invasions by less desirable species have significant implications for the future of threatened species and habitats. The goal of this study was to understand vehicle seed accrual by different vehicle types and under different driving conditions, and to evaluate different mitigation strategies. Using studies and experiments at four sites in the western USA we addressed three questions: How many seeds and species accumulate and are transported on vehicles? Does this differ with vehicle type, driving surface, surface conditions, and season? What is our ability to mitigate seed dispersal risk by cleaning vehicles? Our results demonstrated that vehicles accrue plant propagules, and driving surface, surface conditions, and season affect the rate of accrual: on-and off-trail summer seed accrual on all-terrain vehicles was 13 and 3508 seeds km(-1), respectively, and was higher in the fall than in the summer. Early season seed accrual on 4-wheel drive vehicles averaged 7 and 36 seeds km(-1) on paved and unpaved roads respectively, under dry conditions. Furthermore, seed accrual on unpaved roads differed by vehicle type, with tracked vehicles accruing more than small and large 4-wheel drives; and small 4-wheel drives more than large. Rates were dramatically increased under wet surface conditions. Vehicles indiscriminately accrue a wide diversity of seeds (different life histories, forms and seed lengths); total richness, richness of annuals, biennials, forbs and shrubs, and seed length didn't differ among vehicle types, or additional seed bank samples. Our evaluation of portable vehicle wash units showed that approximately 80% of soil and seed was removed from dirty vehicles. This suggests that interception programs to reduce vehicular seed transportation risk are feasible and should be developed for areas of high conservation value, or where the spread of invasive species is of special concern.

However, there is also an important ecological legacy regarding the use of antibiotics and the consequences of increased levels of these compounds in the environment as a consequence of their use and disposal. This legacy was investigated by quantifying two antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) conferring resistance to tetracycline (tet (W)) and sulfonamide (sul 1) in bacterial seed bank DNA in sediments. The industrial introduction of antibiotics caused an abrupt increase in the total abundance of tet (W) and a steady increase in sul 1. The abrupt change in tet (W) corresponded to an increase in relative abundance from ca. 1960 that peaked around 1976. This pattern of accumulation was highly correlated with the abundance of specific members of the seed bank community belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. In contrast, the relative abundance of sul 1 increased after 1976. This correlated with a taxonomically broad spectrum of bacteria, reflecting sul 1 dissemination through horizontal gene transfer. The accumulation patterns of both ARGs correspond broadly to the temporal scale of medical antibiotic use. Our results show that the bacterial seed bank can be used to look back at the historical usage of antibiotics and resistance prevalence.

Here we monitored the plant community of a coastal lomas, a seasonal desert ecosystem, during 1998 and 2001 to analyse its changes during the 1997-98 El Nino and the following La Nina events. We measured species abundance and vegetation cover in 31 plots, and recorded climate variables in Lomas de Lachay, Peru. We found a significant positive correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover, density, alpha diversity (species diversity at the plot level), total richness and abundance of several key species but no correlation with gamma diversity (species diversity at the whole loma level). During the El Nino event, the seasonality, typical of the lomas ecosystem, disappeared, as evidenced by both the similarity of species composition and mean vegetation cover values between most sampling campaigns of 1998 and 1999. Moreover, total richness was lower during the El Nino event than during the humid season of 2000 and 2001 resulting from the dominance of only a few species, such as Nicotiana paniculata and Loasa urens. Temporal-spatial changes in the abundance of the dominant species caused the differences between alpha and gamma diversity, especially during 1999. Within that year, mean alpha diversity showed similar values whilst gamma diversity values were different. The reestablishment of the seasonality of most plant community characteristics and a clear difference between species composition of the humid and the dry season occurred two years after the El Nino event, suggesting a resilient community. This study provides one of the few quantifications of the Peruvian lomas' response to the 1997-98 El Nino event and the following La Nina, one of the most extreme climatic events in the last century.

The germplasm resources in the soil seed bank have their corresponding water germination intervals. The soil seed bank of Tianjin Guangang Forest Park was selected as the research object and different watering gradients were set to test. Through statistical analysis and regression equation model, we could analyse and evaluate the morphological features of arbor species in soil seed bank under different watering gradients and find out the soil moisture interval which was most suitable for the restoration effect of soil seed bank in Tianjin. The study results showed that: (1) the watering gradient was set to 1000 mL, the arbor population in the experimental dish had the highest plant height, the largest canopy cover and the best arbor community; when the water content was less than 1000 mL, it couldn't meet the water demand of plant growth and the number of seed germination was greatly reduced; while above 1000mL, the soil was in flooded state, inhibited the germination of some seeds; (2) under the same watering gradients, the average height and canopy cover of Fraxinus chinensis species showed great advantages compared with Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Koelreuteria paniculate species; (3) the average height and canopy cover of three arbor species were positively correlated by regression analysis, and when the watering gradient was set to 1000mL, its correlation was best.																	1755-1307						2018	199								032101	10.1088/1755-1315/199/3/032101							WOS:000468045100171

As a key factor for plant growth, water directly affects seedling numbers of soil seed bank. A germination experiment was carried out in Tianjin Guangang Forest Park, where the germinated arbor species were Fraxinus chinensis, Koelreuteria paniculata, and Robinia pseudoacacia. This paper aims to study the quantative attributes of soil seed bank under different watering gradients in the case of controlling variables from May to October. The results showed that the number of all kinds of seed bank germination would reach the maximum under 1000ml watering gradient, and the number of Fraxinus chinensis was the largest at 1000ml. The germination of Koelreuteria paniculata performed well under 1000ml or 1500ml water treatment. The total number of Robinia pseudoacacia kept stable at 3 individuals in the case of 500ml and 1000ml. According to the statistical analysis of the mortality rate, the results showed that the mortality rate was lower at 500ml and 1000ml, and the mortality rate was zero in September October under all kinds of the watering gradient. It is helpful to provide a basis for studying of soil seed bank by exploring how watering gradient affect the growth of arbor population.																	1755-1307						2018	199								UNSP 042056	10.1088/1755-1315/199/4/042056							WOS:000468045100230

Increases in dry areas and the occurrence of drought predicted in future scenarios are likely to threaten grassland ecosystems. Calcareous grassland seed banks have proven to be resistant to short-term drought, but their responses to long-term drought are unknown. Here we show that 14 years of summer drought changed calcareous grassland seed bank composition, reducing its size and richness, and that these responses do not simply reflect patterns in the above-ground vegetation. Moreover, the effect of drought was larger on seed banks than on vegetation, and above-ground responses mediated by soil depth were less evident in the seed bank than in the vegetation. These results demonstrate that the severity of drought effects on calcareous grasslands is larger than previously thought, and show that this ecosystem is highly vulnerable and has low resilience to predicted decreases in soil moisture.

A REVIEW OF THE IMPACTS OF MAJOR TERRESTRIAL INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS IN IRELAND	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Invasive alien plants represent a major threat to Ireland's biodiversity and ecosystems, not only in productive or disturbed areas but also in habitats of high conservation value. With a focus on the major terrestrial invasive alien plants occurring in Ireland, we performed a systematic review of current knowledge on a wide range of environmental impacts of plant invasions. These include modifications to native or resident plant communities, alterations in the functioning of native ecosystems and associated ecosystem services, including supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services, as well as any positive effects. Overall, we found that rigorous quantitative assessments of the ecological impacts of these species, including comparative studies, are available for few species only and mainly focus on changes in the standing vegetation, while there is a paucity of data on how or if they contribute to alterations in the services provided by native ecosystems, even in protected areas. We conclude by highlighting the need for information on the long-term impacts of plant invasions in Ireland, including potential local, regional, or national extinctions, and the regeneration potential of native plant communities in invaded areas, which ultimately depend on the reversibility of these impacts.

Brenan	BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES												This study assesses the abundance of Erythrophleum suaveolens seeds in the soil bank of central African moist forests. The work was carried out in two types of forests in northern Congo: the Celtis forest, growing on clay-sandy to sandy-clay soils and the Manilkara forest, growing on sandy soils. E. suaveolens stems (dbh >= 10 cm) were counted in two 400 ha plots, and the diametric structures of the stands were compared. To assess seed abundance in the soil bank, 80 pits (2 x 40 pits per forest type) were then dug at the foot of 20 trees (10 per forest), removing three contiguous layers of 10 cm each, i.e. to a total depth of 30 cm. Dormancy of the seeds collected was tested by germination trials after treatment with H2SO4. Five seeds taken in the Celtis forest down to a depth of 20 cm were used to estimate their age by Accelerator Mass Spectroscopy (AMS). The comparison of diametric structures indicates a higher proportion of small diameter stems in the Celtis forest. While stem densities (dbh >= 10 cm) were similar in the Celtis and Manilkara forests at 0.85 and 1.05 stems/ha respectively, seed densities were significantly higher in the Celtis forest (8.55 seeds/m(2)) than in the Manilkara forest (0.15 seed/m(2)). The maximum percentage of germination obtained was 19.1% for seeds having undergone no treatment. Germination rates in the acid-treated batches were lower. These seeds could remain intact in the soil bank for ten years. The factors that could influence seed density variations are discussed and silvicultural recommendations are formulated.																	0006-579X	1777-5760					2018		338					43	55		10.19182/bft2018.338.a31681							WOS:000465093600006						
J	Tang, Y; Jin, SS				Tang, Y.; Jin, S. S.			Application of the random forest algorithm for predicting the persistence of seed banks in the Horqin Sandy Land, China	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Persistent seed banks have been detected in the Horqin Sandy Land, China using experimental methods. In this study, we used seed traits (i.e. seed mass and seed shape) to predict the persistence of seed banks using the random forest algorithm. The results showed that the mean decrease in accuracy for seed mass and seed shape was 18.26 and 9.90, respectively, suggesting that seed mass was a better predictor than seed shape. With increasing seed mass, the log of P (where P is the ratio of the number of votes selecting existence of a persistent seed bank to the number of votes selecting absence of a persistent seed bank) gradually decreased. It also changed from positive to negative when the seed mass reached 10 mg. This indicates that small-seeded species tend to have a persistent seed bank, and larger-seeded species tend to germinate in the current year. Furthermore, a seed mass of 10 mg was the dividing point for predicting the persistence of seed banks in this region. The log of P decreased as the seed shape decreased in the range from 0.07 to 0.17, indicating that seed shape (0.07-0.17) is negatively related to the existence of a persistent seed bank. It is suggested that the random forest algorithm is a useful tool for predicting the persistence of seed banks.																	1851-5657						2018	87						280	285									WOS:000462077000037

Achene dimorphism and protracted release: a trait syndrome allowing continuous reshaping of the seed-dispersal kernel in the Mediterranean species Pallenis spinosa	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Pallenis spinosa (Asteraceae) produces both winged and wingless achenes. Both achene morphs are non-dormant and show a similar embryo size, rendering dispersal ability as their only apparent functional difference.Aims: We studied morph-specific release and spatial dispersal patterns to ascertain whether the common view of seed dimorphism as a mixed strategy, that is functionally fully differentiated morphs, is appropriate for this system.Methods: For three years, at the onset of achene release, in early autumn, we placed achene traps at different distances from source plants, censusing achene arrival at 3-4day intervals. We constructed morph-specific dispersal kernels and related release intensity to prevailing meteorological conditions in census intervals. Selected kernel models were used to describe dispersal effects of observed changes in the proportion of winged achenes (p(w)) in successive released fractions.Results: Achene release extended up to early-mid winter, peaking in rainy, windy intervals. Throughout the season, p(w) decreased progressively. Unexpectedly, the wingless morph produced the longest dispersal tails and it only showed ability for fat-tailed dispersal. Consequently, maximum dispersal distances steadily increased throughout the season.Conclusions: Achene dimorphism in P. spinosa appears to allow a within-season continuous reshaping of the seed-dispersal kernel instead of representing a mixed strategy.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of coordination strategies for improving the weeding performance of autonomous agricultural robots. We show that, given a sufficient number of agents, the algorithm can successfully weed fields with various initial seed bank densities, even when multiple days are allowed to elapse before weeding commences. Furthermore, the use of coordination between agents is demonstrated to strongly improve system performance as the number of agents increases, enabling the system to eliminate all the weeds in the field, as in the case of full environmental information, when the planner without coordination failed to do so. As a domain to test our algorithms, we have developed an open source simulation environment, Weed World, which allows real-time visualization of coordinated weeding policies, and includes realistic weed generation. In this work, experiments are conducted to determine the required number of agents and their required transit speed, for given initial seed bank densities and varying allowed days before the start of the weeding process.																	2153-0858		978-1-5386-8094-0				2018							7955	7960									WOS:000458872707029

Tree Endophytes: Cryptic Drivers of Tropical Forest Diversity	ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREES: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS, 2ND EDITION	Forestry Sciences											Roots and leaves comprise two of the largest microbial habitats on Earth, particularly in tropical forests where root and leaf surface areas are extremely high and microbes are abundant and diverse. Fungal and bacterial endophytes are primarily acquired via contagious spread from the surrounding environment. The soil is an important reservoir for both fungal and bacterial endophytes; we term this a soil microbial bank and suggest that it functions similarly to a soil seed bank. Because most (similar to 75%) studies have found a strong positive relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial diversity, we predict that as plant diversity increases so will endophyte taxonomic and functional diversity. Once inside plant host tissues, endophytes can act as mutualists and increase plant performance directly by producing plant hormones, or indirectly by decreasing fungal or insect damage by up to 80%. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that there are costs associated with hosting "beneficial" endophytes for tropical trees. This is important because it challenges more traditional dichotomies (e.g., beneficial or deleterious) about endophytes and suggests that there are highly complex and context-dependent trade-offs and costs involved in plant-endophyte interactions. Though they comprise a cryptic component of tropical forests, plant-microbe interactions may typically regulate tree diversity, composition, and forest function at neighborhood and even regional scales. For example, pathogens may maintain tree diversity by reducing the fitness of common species in areas where plant host density is high or where hosts are close to reproductive conspecific adults. Moreover, plant-endophyte interactions, whether pathogenic or mutualistic, may comprise an entirely novel dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species. Overall, tree endophytes in tropical forests are complex, yet critical drivers of forest dynamics and function.																	0924-5480	1875-1334	978-3-319-89833-9; 978-3-319-89832-2				2018	86						63	103		10.1007/978-3-319-89833-9_4	10.1007/978-3-319-89833-9						WOS:000459755500005

The study was carried out between 2012 and 2014 on production fields located in Lublin province, one of the easternmost regions of Poland. The results showed that diversity and abundance of weeds in spring cereals were generally higher in organic farming system than in conventional one. No significant differences between systems were found in 2013, because local flooding of fields in spring made impossible the execution of agricultural weed management treatment for some farmers. Both above-ground and soil seed bank weed communities were the mainstay of valuable weed species, which is confirmed by the presence of the species threatened with extinction, for example, summer pheasant's-eye (Adonis aestivalis), poorman's blue weatherglass (Anagallis foemina) and others in both tested farming systems. Dwarf everlast (Helichrysum arenarium) was the only found species that is subject to partial protection by Polish law. Both organic farms, run under CAP policy and support, and conventional extensive farms of the province of Lublin were the mainstay of biodiversity. Future rural development and CAP should be adapted and implemented regionally. Traditional extensive farms could contribute to the biodiversity and valuable plant species conservation.

(Aizoaceae), a prominent invasive plant in Europe. Carpobrotus species are mat-forming trailing succulent perennial herbs native from South Africa, introduced in Europe for ornamental and soil stabilization purposes since the beginning of the seventeenth century, now widely naturalized on coastal habitats of southern and western Europe. C. acinaciformis and C. edulis are the main species recognized outside South Africa, together with their hybrids and potential hybrid swarms. Identification conflicts both in the native and invaded areas raise doubts on the taxonomy of these taxa, but hybridization processes may boost adaptive changes in the invaded range. The release of Carpobrotus in natural environments and protected areas is prohibited in several European countries, but this taxon is not included in the list of invasive species of Union concern. Carpobrotus is a pioneer of disturbed sites and coastal areas including cliffs and sand dune systems, due to its tolerance to stress factors such as salinity, drought and excess of light. Carpobrotus invasion ultimately affects patterns of native species diversity. Moreover, it has been recognized as a major driver of soil conditions shifts and soil geo-chemical processes disruptions, representing a serious threat for coastal habitats. Management plans for Carpobrotus must consider its high plasticity for morphological and ecophysiological traits, which may probably explain its tolerance to a wide range of ecological conditions. Its flexible mating systems, which represent an optimal strategy to facilitate local adaptation and habitat colonization, include ability to produce apomictic seeds, self- and cross-pollination, and an intense vegetative clonality. In addition, Carpobrotus produces a large seed bank with a moderate short-term persistence, and fruits are effectively dispersed by mammals. The most efficient control methods are physical removal and herbicide application on leaves, whereas integration of biological control with other conventional management methods are likely to be most effective.

J	Zacks, G; Greet, J; Walsh, CJ; Raulings, E				Zacks, Georgina; Greet, Joe; Walsh, Christopher J.; Raulings, Elisa			The flooding tolerance of two critical habitat-forming wetland shrubs, Leptospermum lanigerum and Melaleuca squarrosa, at different life history stages	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Understanding the effect of water regime on the different life history stages of woody wetland plants is essential to managing their persistence. The common and widespread myrtaceous shrub species, Melaleuca squarrosa Donn. ex Sm. and Leptospermum lanigerum (Aiton) Sm., provide habitat for two critically endangered fauna within the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve (south-eastern Australia), but are in decline putatively because of the altered flooding regimes. We, thus, tested the effects of flooding depth and duration on their seed germination and seedling establishment, and seedling growth and survival in two separate glasshouse experiments. We also compared the condition of mature plants of both species at an intermittently flooded (reference) site, and two near permanently flooded (impact) sites. Seeds of both species were able to germinate underwater, but early flooding reduced seedling establishment. Seedling growth of both species was greater in waterlogged than in well drained or inundated conditions, whereas no seedlings of either species survived >8 weeks of submergence. Leptospermum lanigerum seedlings were generally more flood tolerant than were M. squarrosa seedlings. Correspondingly, crown condition of mature M. squarrosa, but not L. lanigerum, was poorer at impact than reference sites. Prolonged flooding in swamp forests is likely to (1) limit woody plant recruitment, because flooding reduces seedling establishment, growth and survival, and (2) be deleterious to the maintenance of less flood-tolerant species (e.g. M. squarrosa). Moist exposed substrate is likely to be best for promoting the recruitment of both study species, and intermittent flooding for maintaining adult M. squarrosa plants.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2018	66	6-7					500	510		10.1071/BT18039							WOS:000453241500005

While species of the genus Pogonomyrmex have been studied in detail as seed predators, their impact on seed abundance in the soil has not yet been explored in sufficient depth. We studied the impact of the harvesting activities of the ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus on seed abundance in the soil of the Zapotitlan valley, Mexico. We found that P. barbatus activity significantly impacts the abundance of seeds in the soil, which is lower in the sites where P. barbatus forages than it is in sites with no recorded foraging. We also found that P. barbatus distributes intact seeds of three tree species, two of which are nurse plants, and could consequently be promoting the establishment of these species. Using tools derived from graph theory, we observed that the ant-seed interactions exhibit a nested pattern; where more depredated seed species seem to be the more spatially abundant in the environment. This study illustrates the complex foraging ecology of the harvester ant P. barbatus and elucidates its effect on the soil seed bank in a semi-arid environment.

Taxonomic affinity, habitat and seed mass strongly predict seed desiccation response: a boosted regression trees analysis based on 17 539 species	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Seed desiccation response plays an important role in plant regeneration ecology, and has significant implications for species conservation. The majority of seed plants produce desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) seeds, whilst comparatively few produce desiccation-sensitive (recalcitrant) seeds that are unable to survive dehydration, and which cannot be conserved in traditional seed banks. This study develops a set of models to predict seed desiccation response in unstudied species. Methods Taxonomy, trait, location and climate data were compiled to form a global data set of 17 539 species. Three boosted regression trees models were then developed to predict species' seed desiccation responses based on habitat and trait information for the species, and the seed desiccation responses of close relatives (either members of the same genus, family or order, depending on the model). Ten-fold cross-validation was used to test model predictive success. The utility of the models was then demonstrated by predicting seed desiccation response for two floras: Ecuador, and Britain and Ireland. Key Results The three models had varying success rates for identifying the desiccation-sensitive species: 89 % for the genus-level model, 79 % for the family-level model and 60 % for the order-level model. The most important predictor variables were the seed desiccation responses of a species' relatives, seed mass and annual precipitation. It is predicted that 10 % of seed plants from Ecuador and 1.2 % of those from Britain and Ireland produce desiccation-sensitive seeds. Due to data availability, prediction accuracy is likely to be higher for the British and Irish flora, where it is estimated that a desiccation-sensitive species had a 96.7 % chance of being correctly identified, compared with 80.8 % in the Ecuador flora. Conclusions These models can utilize existing data to predict species' likely seed desiccation responses, providing a gap-filling tool for global studies of plant traits, as well as critical decision-making support for plant conservation activities.

How does the ditch margin vegetation develop as a function of regular dredging? Is ornithologically oriented management also beneficial for plant biodiversity? LocationRiparian marshes, Eider-Treene-Sorge lowland, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. MethodsWe performed vegetation surveys of drainage ditches along with their water body, slope and margin structures annually for 3years. The data were analysed with respect to date and means of ditch dredging. In addition, we recorded vegetation of the surrounding agricultural grassland, measured nutrient status of the soil and the water body and sampled seed bank of the ditch slopes. We used ANOVA and multivariate methods to describe the development of the ditch vegetation and the persistence of target meadow species. ResultsVegetation re-development of ditch margins proceeds quite rapidly after disturbance from dredging. Dominance of mudbank species was observed only in the first year, followed by an increase of reed species and reduction of phytodiversity. Target species of wet meadow communities reach highest abundance in the second and third year and build a significant seed bank before being suppressed by reeds. ConclusionsIn heavily eutrophicated, intensively used marsh grassland, regularly disturbed ditch margins are important secondary habitats for pioneer and subdominant wetland species, which have nearly disappeared in a larger area. Current management cycles of ditch dredging every 3-4years comply with the successional development, allowing the mudbank and wet meadow species to persist in the vegetation and seed bank. In contrast to the frequency, the form of dredging (ditch profile), which is crucial for bird protection, plays a minor role for plants. We recommend moderate disturbance (mowing of ditch margins) to suppress strong competitors in the years between dredging for additional support to target plant species.

Influence of fire on critically endangered Swartland Shale Renosterveld in the Cape Floristic Region	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsThe degree to which renosterveld shrublands are fire-dependent is currently unclear. To address this issue, the following questions were asked: (1) does smoke stimulate germination of soil-stored seeds in renosterveld; (2) does recently-burned renosterveld display changed composition and higher diversity than unburned vegetation; and (3) how do the species compositions of renosterveld soil seed banks and standing vegetation compare? LocationSwartland, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. MethodsSoil seed bank samples from a north- and south-facing slope were smoke-treated and germinated to test for smoke-stimulated germination. Burned standing vegetation was surveyed 16months post-fire, as was unburned vegetation on the same slopes. Seed bank species richness and density were compared between smoke-treated and untreated samples within and between slopes. Burned and unburned standing vegetation were compared within and between slopes in terms of species richness, abundance and aerial cover. Compositional similarity of the seed banks and standing vegetation was assessed. ResultsSeed banks were dominated by annuals and graminoids. Smoke treatment had no effect, except for driving significantly higher species richness and seedling density in south-facing slope perennial shrubs. Species richness and seedling density were significantly higher in seed banks on the south-facing slope compared to the north-facing slope. Burned standing vegetation exhibited significantly higher diversity than unburned vegetation. Annuals and graminoids displayed significantly higher species richness and aerial cover in burned renosterveld. The north-facing slope contained less than half the number of species/m(2) compared to the south-facing slope. The seed banks and standing vegetation showed low to intermediate similarity (SOrensen=31%-53%), but grouped close together on an NMDS plot, suggesting intermediate similarity overall. ConclusionsElevated germination of perennial shrubs in smoke-treated seed bank samples and increased diversity of post-fire standing vegetation suggest the renosterveld in this study shows elements of a fire-driven system. Certain species only recruited in burned sites, suggesting fire-stimulated germination. Aspect had a major influence on plant community composition, with the mesic south-facing slope being more diverse than the xeric north-facing slope. The similarity between the seed banks and standing vegetation was higher than previously shown for renosterveld, and appears to be higher than for fynbos.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				JAN	2018	21	1					144	155		10.1111/avsc.12348							WOS:000425120600016						
J	Calderon-Hernandez, M; Perez-Martinez, LV				Calderon-Hernandez, Manuela; Victoria Perez-Martinez, Laura			Seed desiccation tolerance and germination of four Puya (Bromeliaceae) high-andean tropical species from Colombia	CALDASIA												Ex-situ seed conservation is one of the most effective tools for biodiversity and genetic diversity protection. In the context of global climate change, ex situ conservation has become an important strategy that must be strengthen and integrated with in situ conservation strategies. The main objective of this study was to document the desiccation tolerance and germination properties of four species from Puya and provide tools that allow the ex situ conservation of this and other closely related species. These species are distributed in Paramo, a threatened ecosystem despite of its value as a water reservoir and supplier for urban population. Seed morphological variables and moisture content (MC) were measured before a test of germination was conducted with three different moisture contents (fresh seeds, 10-12 % and 3-5 %). Germination percentage and the mean germination time were evaluated. The germination was above 80 % in all the species with no significant differences when decreasing MC. There were no significant differences in mean germination time. Seed viability for the four species was high, as compared to other Paramo species. The results indicate that all species are orthodox. Therefore, this genus has great potential to be conserved in seed banks, which will contribute to diversity conservation of native species from tropical Andean highlands, and can be implemented in germination protocols for their propagation and reintroduction in restoration programs.

Samples of soil and soil + litter were removed with iron corer (0.25 mx 0.25 mx 0.05 m), at five different points of the fragment, each 10 m from the bank of Paraiba do Sul river. At each point three soil samples and three samples of soil + litter were collected. The material was made to UENF and arranged in plastic trays (25 cm in diameter and 9 cm tall) in the greenhouse. The treatments were arranged in randomized and compared by F test (5%), with 15 replicates of each treatment, represented by a tray. For four months, 473 individuals distributed among herbaceous, shrub and tree species were recorded. The seed bank is composed mostly of herbaceous species, highlighting the Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Maxon, with 58 seedlings germinated. Among the shrub and tree species, the highlights Piper sp. and Trema micrantha (L.), with 56 and 32 seedlings germinated, respectively. The seed bank in the soil + litter, had a lower number of species, with no difference in the number of seedlings germinated. Both the soil and soil + litter have potential for use in nucleation techniques.

This article analyses the prospects and challenges of community seed banks in climate change contexts. It finds that community seed banks serve as sources of climate-resilient seeds to withstand in local climates and improve community resilience. Community seed banks provide landraces for participatory crop improvement to develop resistant varieties to improve quality and productivity. They also strengthen participatory seed exchange to cope with climate adversity. However, there are challenges with defining specific and common goals, functions, approaches, and governance.

Chemical options for the control of Siam Weed (Chromolaena odorata) in natural ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												The perennial shrub Siam Weed (Chromolaena odorata (L.) R. M. King & H. Rob.), a native of the rainforests of central and southern America, is predicted to invade most countries between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Subsequent to its discovery in northern Queensland. Australia in 1994, it was unsuccessfully targeted for eradication, with early control efforts restricted to manual removal and foliar spraying with triclopyr/picloram. A chemical trial involving five herbicides and three application methods (foliar, basal bark and cut stump) was undertaken in northern Queensland to identify effective chemicals to control this weed. Of the foliar herbicides tested, fluroxypyr (70 g/100 L) provided 99% mortality, triclopyr/picloram (105/35 g/100 L) 95%, while metsulfuron-methyl g/100 L) killed 85% of the treated plants. The herbicides fluroxypyr (300 g/100 L), picloram (43 g/1 kg) and triclopyr/piclorain (400/200 g/100 L) killed greater than 98% of the plants when applied as basal bark or cut stump. The integration of fire into the management strategy either as a primary or secondary control option could have a major role, given that in this study, 99% of the Siam Weed soil seed bank was located on the soil surface.																	1442-7001	1442-8903				JAN	2018	19	1					88	93		10.1111/emr.12287							WOS:000445554600014						
J	Li, YM; Chesson, P				Li, Yue M.; Chesson, Peter			Seed demographic comparisons reveal spatial and temporal niche differentiation between native and invasive species in a community of desert winter annual plants	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: What is the evidence for spatial and temporal niche differentiation to stabilize co-existence between invasive and native species over broad environmental conditions? Hypothesis: Two key elements for stable co-existence via environmental niche differentiation -species-specific responses to the environment and buffered population growth -are present in an invaded plant community when the seed demography of these plants is compared over time and space. Organisms: A community of invasive and native winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. Field site: A complex landscape in the Mohawk Valley in southwestern Arizona. Methods: We surveyed similar to 180 plant neighbourhood clusters and sampled the adjacent seed bank for three years over three types of habitat to obtain data on germination and seed survival. We used the data to determine both species-specific germination responses to the varying environment and buffered population growth through seed banking. We also conducted a growth-chamber experiment to assess the influence of temperature and light availability on species-specific germination responses. Conclusions: The findings supported our hypothesis. Species-specific germination responses were observed for both spatial and temporal environmental variation in the field. Germination responses were differentiated for both temperature and light in growth chambers. The native species and one of the invasive species had persistent seed banks, an outcome of low germination and high seed survival, which strengthened their buffered population growth over time. The other invasive species had a weak seed bank in two habitats but a stronger one in the third habitat, and thus relied on spatial population structure to buffer population growth.

This study was undertaken to define a better and cost-effective weed management strategy. We compared ametryn + trifloxysulfuron-sodium (hereafter referred to as trifloxysulfuron) ready-mixes with single applications of trifloxysulfuron, atrazine and 2,4-D for efficacy, non-target and residual toxicities, yield and profitability in a sugarcane-green gram rotation. Results showed that a density of 100 weeds m(-2) could reduce sugarcane yield by 18.4 t ha(-1). The ready-mix ametryn + trifloxysulfuron (1097.3 + 27.8) g a.i. ha(-1) applied 15days after planting (DAP) caused reductions in weed density by 88.2%, 90.9%, and 90.3%, and weed biomass by 68.0%, 53.8%, and 56.2% compared to unweeded control at 30, 60, and 90 DAP, respectively. Consequently, the sugarcane yield, system productivity, and net returns were increased by 92.1%, 43.5%, and 1515%, respectively due to this ready-mix. It increased system productivity by 23%, 17.2%, and 22.7% compared to trifloxysulfuron, atrazine, and 2,4-D treatments, respectively. This ready-mix may be recommended in sugarcane. This would reduce weed seed bank and herbicide application cost by 50%, and prevent/delay weed shift and resistance.

J	Firn, J; Ladouceur, E; Dorrough, J				Firn, Jennifer; Ladouceur, Emma; Dorrough, Josh			Integrating local knowledge and research to refine the management of an invasive non-native grass in critically endangered grassy woodlands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Globally the prevalence and impact of invasive non-native plant species is increasing rapidly. Experimentally based research aimed at supporting management is limited in its ability to keep up with this pace, partly because of the importance of understanding historical abiotic and biotic conditions. Contrastingly, landholders are in unique positions to witness species turnover in grasslands, adapt management practices in response and learn from successes and failures. 2. This local knowledge could be crucial for identifying feasible solutions to land degradation, and ecological restoration, but local knowledge is rarely explicitly embedded in ecological research. 3. We use a sequential exploratory strategy where we first interview (semi-directive approach) 15 landholders within the Bega region of New South Wales, Australia concerning the changing ecological characteristics of both extensively and intensively managed grassy woodlands and perceived impacts following arrival of the invasive exotic introduced species, African lovegrass (ALG), Eragrostis curvula. 4. Based on the results of these interviews, we then conducted a field study where we tested 7 landholder-generated hypotheses at 57 sites. 5. The field study validated many of the landholder management perceptions including: ALG was negatively correlated with species richness, canopy cover and dominant grasses like Themeda triandra. Mechanical slashing increased exotic ALG abundance. The prevalence of ALG in the soil seed bank was positively correlated with its abundance above-ground. Study observations that contradicted landholder perceptions included: ALG was not more palatable nor did its abundance decline in response to increasing soil fertility. Spot spraying with herbicides was effective at controlling abundance, despite its reputation as ineffective. Landholder observations also highlighted key hypotheses concerning modes of spread that require long-term studies including the roles of drought and overgrazing. 6. Synthesis and applications. Overall, we found local knowledge coupled with scientific methods can act in tandem as a highly effective approach for developing management recommendations. This approach identifies local perceptions that are not substantiated by scientific data to halt potentially harmful practices, and observations that are insightful predictions about the dynamics and impacts of non-native species that need long-term experiments to corroborate scientifically.

We analysed the occurrence of bryophyte species and variation in species richness across 674 plots (0.5 m x 0.5 m) in alvar vegetation (grassland on limestone pavement with thin or no soil) on oland (Sweden) in relation to substrate characteristics and chemistry, inundation frequency, grazing pressure and geographical variables. We found 148 taxa, including 11 nationally red-listed ones. Species richness per plot was significantly associated with substrate type, positively associated with pH and grazing intensity, but negatively associated with soil depth. However, richness of species typical of, or restricted to, alvar habitats responded differently to richness of species more common in other habitats. Typical alvar species were favoured by high pH, shallow soil and low phosphate availability, while generalists preferred relatively low pH, higher phosphate availability and organic or mull soil types. Distance from the alvar margin had only weak effects. Concerning the effects on individual species and community composition, inundation frequency and pH were found to have the largest effects, although other factors (substrate type, soil depth, bare soil, bare stone, phosphate availability and grazing pressure) were more important for some individual species, stressing the importance of microsite variability and variability in management for regional species richness. From a conservation perspective, it is concluded that grazing is generally positive whilst factors increasing phosphate availability may disadvantage the typical alvar species, and proximity to the alvar margin is not a major problem.

J	Graham, LLB; Page, SE				Graham, L. L. B.; Page, S. E.			A limited seed bank in both natural and degraded tropical peat swamp forest: the implications for restoration	MIRES AND PEAT												Carbon-rich tropical peat swamp forests (PSFs) are being degraded at an alarming rate. In response to national and global agendas, landscape-scale PSF restoration is underway, although supporting knowledge of PSF ecosystem restoration ecology remains limited. Seed banks are usually an important source of natural regeneration and crucial in post-degradation forest recovery, even in the humid tropics where reduced seed dormancy leads to typically smaller seed banks than in temperate regions. It has been assumed that PSF degradation reduces the seed bank, limiting natural regeneration, but this has not previously been investigated explicitly. This study of PSF in Central Kalimantan explored seed bank prevalence and regenerative capacity across five forest zones (FZs): degraded, open canopy disturbed, edge, closed canopy disturbed and natural. Numbers and species of seeds and seedlings were recorded from surface peat samples collected from each FZ over one year. Seed density, averaged across FZs, was 41 seeds m(-2); total species number was 11; and seedling density was 16.0-73.6 m(-2) depending on FZ. These values were much lower than for other forests in this region. There was little difference in seed bank size between natural and degraded FZs, and only the forest edge showed higher than expected seed bank regenerative capability. Overall, our results suggest that seed banks are not of high importance in tropical PSF regeneration, either before or after degradation. These findings are discussed from the perspective of successional traits in different species and their relevance to ecosystem restoration.																	1819-754X						2018	22				SI				02	10.19189/MaP.2017.OMB.302							WOS:000452927700003						
J	Nelson, EB				Nelson, Eric B.			The seed microbiome: Origins, interactions, and impacts	PLANT AND SOIL												The development and dispersal of seeds as well as their transition to seedlings represent perhaps the most critical stages of a plant's life cycle. The endophytic and epiphytic microbial interactions that take place in, on, and around seeds during these stages of the plant's life cycle may have profound impacts on plant ecology, health, and productivity. While our understanding of the seed microbiota has lagged far behind that of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, many advances are now being made. This review explores the microbial associations with seeds through various stages of the plant life cycle, beginning with the earliest stages of seed development on the parent plant and continuing through the development and establishment of seedlings in soil. This review represents a broad synthesis of the ecological and agricultural literature focused on seed-microbe interactions as a means of better understanding how these interactions may ultimately influence plant ecology, health, and productivity in both natural and agricultural systems. Our current understanding of seed-microbe associations will be discussed, with an emphasis on recent findings that specifically highlight the emerging contemporary understanding of how seed-microbe associations may ultimately impact plant health and productivity. The diversity and dynamics of seed microbiomes represent the culmination of complex interactions with microbes throughout the plant life cycle. The richness and dynamics of seed microbiomes is revealing exciting new opportunities for research into plant-microbe interactions. Often neglected in plant microbiome studies, the renaissance of inquiry into seed microbiomes is offering exciting new insights into how the diversity and dynamics of the seed microbiome with plant and soil microbiomes as well as the microbiomes of dispersers and pollinators. It is clear that the interactions taking place in and around seeds indeed have significant impacts on plant health and productivity in both agricultural and natural ecosystems.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				JAN	2018	422	1-2			SI		7	34		10.1007/s11104-017-3289-7							WOS:000424260800002

Germination at all storage conditions responded positively to light in herbs and germinated in both light and dark in shrubs and trees. Field storage enhanced light germination in trees, but not in shrubs and herbs. Germination rate index was greater for seeds of herbs and trees compared to those of shrubs. The relationships between seed mass and final germination in both light and dark regimes were positive in herbs but negative in shrubs.Conclusions: Growth form, seed size, storage condition can affect light, but not temperature, requirement of the studied plants.

WEED SEED BANK IN AN AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM WITH EUCALYPTUS IN SUBTROPICAL BRAZIL	PLANTA DANINHA												Trees can modify the weed seed bank composition and distribution in the cropped area of an agroforestry system. This study aimed at analyzing the eucalyptus (Eucalyptus dunnii) effect on spatial distribution, functional traits abundance and weed seed bank botanic composition in an agroforestry system under no-tillage in Subtropical Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with five replications, and five positions between 4.5-year-old eucalyptus double rows [(4x3) x 20 m] as treatments. Soil sampling was performed at 0-20 cm and the method to quantify and identify seeds was the seedling emergence in trays, inside a greenhouse. Weed phytosociological indices (relative density, frequency and importance), functional traits abundance (life cycle, shade tolerance, reproduction, spread and seed form) and seed densities (m(-2)) of families and species were evaluated; 17 weed families and 49 species were found. The indices that contributed to the relative importance of families and species differed among the positions between rows. Eucalyptus grown as an intercrop changed the composition and size of the weed seed bank, in a different way for functional traits, families and species depeding on the distance from trees.																	0100-8358	1806-9681					2018	36								e018162465	10.1590/S0100-83582018360100022							WOS:000433503400001

WEED SEED BANK DYNAMICS: WEED SEED BANK MODULATION THROUGH TILLAGE AND WEED MANAGEMENT	PLANTA DANINHA												A field trial was conducted with the aim of assessing weed seed bank status of soil under maize cultivation. It was worked out by sampling from soil corer at different depths ranging from 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 and 20-25 cm. Weed seed bank was monitored with a cultivator, a rotavator, a mouldboard plough (MB) and a chisel plough in tilled plots under Atrazine 330 EC at 1.00 kg a.i. ha(-1) at 20 DAS, hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS and no weeding. Sixteen weed species were identified in soil samples, four species contributing about 72% of the total weed seed bank. Tillage system was more important determinant of weed seed density than the weed management practices. Movement pattern of weed seeds by all tillage treatments differ significantly over three weeding management practices at 0-5 cm soil core. Horse purslane (28%) and jungle rice (20%) were with high relative abundance. In both years, change in weed seed bank in upper 0-5 cm soil was significant as seeds germinating from this layer were either removed by hand or killed with chemical or left unchecked. Only chisel plough tapped the soil core below 20 cm and caused a small reduction in weed seed density. Mouldbold plough effectively buried weed seeds below 10 cm but not beyond 20 cm and hand hoeing reduced weed seed bank by killing weeds at seedling stage.

WEED EMERGENCE IN A SOIL WITH COVER CROPS IN AN AGROECOLOGICAL NO-TILLAGE SYSTEM	PLANTA DANINHA												The cultivation and deposition of cover crops residues on the soil surface can reduce weed emergence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the emergence of weeds, in a greenhouse, on a soil with cover crops in an agroecological no-tillage system. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with soil samples from an experiment installed in Ituporanga (Santa Catarina state). On April 2010 and 2011, the following field treatments were implemented: weed vegetation (VE), Hordeum vulgare (2010)/Avena strigosa (2011) (CV/AV), Secale cereale (CE), Raphanus sativus (NF), Secale cereale + Raphanus sativus (NF+CE) and Hordeum vulgare/Avena strigosa + Raphanus sativus (NF+AV). After the rotation of the species, the soil samples were collected in July. The identification of the species and the emergence assessment occurred 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 days after the beginning of the experiment. The species with the highest incidence were: Amaranthus lividus, Oxalis spp., Cyperus spp., Stachys arvensis, Cynodon spp. and Rumex obtusifolius. Residues from single species of Secale cereale, Avena strigosa and Hordeum vulgare have shown the greatest ability to suppress weeds during the first 45 evaluation days; this corresponds to the beginning of the critical period in the onion development.																	0100-8358	1806-9681					2018	36								e018163608	10.1590/S0100-8358201836010065							WOS:000443809000001

LONGEVITY OF HORSEWEED SEED BANK DEPENDING ON THE BURIAL DEPTH	PLANTA DANINHA												Horseweed (Convza spp.) is considered as one of the major weeds occurring in the agricultural areas of South America, especially in Brazil. This species stands out from the other weeds due to characteristics such as large seed production, continued seed production, dispersion over long distances and resistance to 5-enolpyruvoylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides, features that increase their management. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the physiological quality and longevity of horseweed seeds over 12 months. The experiment was established under field conditions, using a randomized block design with four replications. Fifty horseweed seeds were distributed into 50 g of dry soil, placed in permeable nylon mesh bags (10 x 10 cm), which were buried at 1, 2, 4 and 8 cm of depth. Each month, for 12 months, samples were collected and washed with water, and the remaining seeds were submitted to germination test. The percentage (%) of remaining seeds, germination, abnormal seedlings, dead seeds, dormancy and viability were evaluated. It was found that the horseweed seed bank was reduced by 59 % over 12 months. Moreover, horseweed seeds develop a secondary dormancy, regardless of the burial depth. In addition, an increased burial depth increases longevity and physiological seed quality.																	0100-8358	1806-9681					2018	36								e0182073	10.1590/S0100-83582018360100050							WOS:000438699500001

TUEXENIA												Changes of the above-ground vegetation and soil the seed bank were studied in a secondary oligotrophic montane grassland after abandonment and gradual colonisation by Norway spruce. The main aim was to compare the responses of the above- and below-ground species composition and richness as well as seed density to successional development. Next aim was to study the relationship of above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank along the spruce colonisation gradient. Simultaneously, we asked whether two types of space-for-time substitution approaches give adequate approximation of trends compared to a plots re-sampling approach with a time lag of 11 years. The sample plots were obtained from a 160 m long transect established in the direction of spruce invasion from a linear source (former plantation). The above-ground vegetation was recorded in 2004 and 2015 on 155 circular permanent plots, 21 of which were also sampled for the soil seed bank. For the substitution approach, time was substituted either by the distance (plots differing in position along the spruce colonisation gradient were interpreted as consecutive successional stages) or by soil depth (the deeper soil layer was supposed to represent an earlier successional stage than the upper one). The composition of the soil seed bank was only weekly related to the above-ground vegetation and their dissimilarity increased with succession. Patterns in species composition and species richness of the above-ground vegetation indicated by distance-for-time substitution were similar to those indicated by re-sampling of plots. This implies that the species turnover and the decline along the colonisation gradient in the above-ground vegetation with time can be successfully predicted from studying the initial spatial patterns. Species composition of the soil seed bank differed among the years but not among the soil depth layers. However, differences in species richness were confirmed for both, among the deeper and upper soil depth layers as well as after 11 years. Space-for-time substitution approaches detected differences in seed bank species richness along the succession gradient neither for distance nor for soil depth. The decrease of the seed density with time was confirmed by all approaches used. Due to generally small numbers of species in the soil seed bank and the additional a strong temporal decrease of seed densities, the use of the seed bank for grassland restoration is limited. Our results also show that the temporal development of the seed bank species richness during secondary succession cannot be reliably predicted from spatial patterns recorded during a single unrepeated sampling. Taking also in to account the huge variance of succession induced outcomes, we conclude that the distance-for-time substitution should be used with caution in studies focusing on the seed bank.

J	Szabo, A; Ruprecht, E				Szabo, Anna; Ruprecht, Eszter			Restoration possibilities of dry grasslands afforested by pine: the role of seed bank and remnant vegetation	TUEXENIA												Stipa-dominated steppe-like dry grasslands represent a great nature conservation priority in Romania and in the whole European Union. In Romania, due to their low productivity, many sites had been afforested by pines or black locust trees at the end of the 1950's in order to raise economic value and to hinder landslides on the steep slopes. Economic expectations did not live up, thus afforested sites will increasingly be targeted for grassland restoration, especially in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network. We analysed seed bank and aboveground vegetation in a 40-year-old black pine plantation site established on a former dry grassland near Viisoara (Transylvanian Lowland), and compared to that of an adjacent intact dry grassland stand. In both stands, eight 5 m x 5 m plots for soil and vegetation analysis were established. Inside each plot, six cylinder-shaped soil cores of 4 cm diameter and 10 cm depths were drilled; soil samples from the same plot were subsequently mixed up. Soil sampling was carried out in early spring, 2008. We analysed seed densities and composition in soil samples using the seedling emergence method. In addition, we recorded percentage cover of plant species in the plots in June. We wanted to find out on what extent we can rely on the soil seed bank and remnant vegetation, if active interventions are planned to restore a grassland stand in the place of a pine plantation. In total, 293 seedlings belonging to 51 species have emerged from soil samples. Seed density in the soil seed bank of the pine plantation was substantially higher (3500 +/- 2059 seeds m(-2), 0-10 cm) than that of the intact grassland (1360 +/- 469 seeds m(-2), 0-10 cm). Our results showed that the seed bank of the plantation site, although not specifically species rich, may still contain a considerable amount of target species. In addition, we found strong populations of grassland species in the understory of the plantation as remnants of the former vegetation, which, together with seeds in the seed bank can ensure a good starting point to a successful natural regeneration after tree removal. Due to the presence of ruderal species in the seed bank and shrubs in the aboveground vegetation, light restoration measures comprising weed and shrub control are necessary following the complete removal of trees. We propose the reintroduction of grazing in order to ensure the spontaneous regeneration by propagule transport to restoration sites.																	0722-494X						2018		38					405	418		10.14471/2018.38.013							WOS:000447356800024

Environmental Correlates with Germinable Weed Seedbanks on Organic Farms across Northern New England	WEED SCIENCE												The northern New England region includes the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine and encompasses a large degree of climate and edaphic variation across a relatively small spatial area, making it ideal for studying climate change impacts on agricultural weed communities. We sampled weed seedbanks and measured soil physical and chemical characteristics on 77 organic farms across the region and analyzed the relationships between weed community parameters and select geographic, climatic, and edaphic variables using multivariate procedures. Temperature-related variables (latitude, longitude, mean maximum and minimum temperature) were the strongest and most consistent correlates with weed seedbank composition. Edaphic variables were, for the most part, relatively weaker and inconsistent correlates with weed seedbanks. Our analyses also indicate that a number of agriculturally important weed species are associated with specific U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones, implying that future changes in climate factors that result in geographic shifts in these zones will likely be accompanied by changes in the composition of weed communities and therefore new management challenges for farmers.

J	Dzwonko, Z; Loster, S; Gawronski, S				Dzwonko, Zbigniew; Loster, Stefania; Gawronski, Stefan			Effects of fire severity on understory community regeneration and early succession after burning of moist pine forest	TUEXENIA												The interaction between fire severity (measured as the degree of organic soil layer consumption) and species regeneration strategy has been suggested to explain early post-fire vegetation dynamics in coniferous forests. To test this hypothesis we analyzed 14 years of succession on permanent plots after a wildfire in moist Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest on muck-peat soil in southern Poland. Plots were established at heavily, partly and slightly burned sites, as well as in unburned forest. In the first three post-fire years, establishment was best for vascular plant invaders (regenerating from seeds transported after the fire) on heavily burned plots, seed bankers on partly burned plots, and vegetatively regenerating sprouters on slightly burned plots. In the third year after the fire, cover of bryophyte species was significantly higher on heavily burned plots than on less burned plots. This initial response of species strongly influenced the composition of understory vegetation in subsequent years. During the 14-year period the changes in vegetation were greatest on heavily burned plots, less on partly burned plots, and least on slightly burned plots. Birch woods developed on all burned sites, but the understory vegetation differed significantly in composition and cover between heavily burned and less burned plots. On the more severely burned plots, strong competition from developing tree invaders hindered understory growth. On slightly burned plots, where herb sprouter cover increased most markedly, bryophytes disappeared over the course of nine years. The results indicate that the spatial variability of fire severity in moist pine forest leads to long-lasting heterogeneity of post-fire forest communities, whose diversity will persist for decades.																	0722-494X						2018		38					197	214		10.14471/2018.38.003							WOS:000447356800011

Gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth.) seed persistence and germination temperature tolerance	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth.) is a highly invasive, naturalised Weed of National Significance in Australia due to its economic, environmental and social impacts. It outcompetes native pastures and fuels intense fires in northern Australian rangelands. To aid management of current infestations and to better understand its potential distribution, this study determined the germination response of gamba grass under a range of constant (138 degrees C-488 degrees C) and alternating (11/78 degrees C-52/428 degrees C) temperature regimes and quantified the potential longevity of soil seed banks. The effect of different soil types, levels of pasture cover and burial depths on seed longevity was investigated in the Dry Tropics of northern Queensland. Germination of gamba grass occurred under a wide range of both constant (178 degrees C-398 degrees C) and alternating day/night temperatures (16/128 degrees C-47/398 degrees C), although the level of germination declined at the lower and higher temperature ranges. At the cooler temperatures, seed viability was not affected, but seeds went into a state of dormancy. The highest level of seed viability was recorded at the lowest constant temperature regime (138 degrees C) and at the two lowest alternating temperatures (11/78 degrees C and 16/128 degrees C). A gradual but variable decline in viability occurred thereafter with increasing temperatures. At the higher temperature range (e.g. constant temperatures of 398 degrees C-438 degrees C and alternating temperatures of 47/398 degrees C) both dormancy and loss of seed viability were occurring, but once alternating and constant temperatures reached above 47/398 degrees C and 438 degrees C all seeds were rendered unviable after 9 and 6 weeks respectively. In the Dry Tropics of northern Queensland, viability of seeds was <1% after 12 months and nil after 24 months, irrespective of soil type or vegetation cover. However, burial depth had a significant effect, with surface located seeds exhibiting a faster rate of decline in germination and viability than seeds buried below ground (i.e. 2.5-10 cm). These findings have implications for the duration of control/eradication programs (i.e. seed persistence) and also suggest that gamba grass has the potential to greatly expand its current distribution into the relatively cooler southern latitude areas of Australia.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2018	40	5					463	472		10.1071/RJ17125							WOS:000447069500002

Spring fire effects on two Aristida/Bothriochloa native pastures in central Queensland, Australia	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Controlled burns are commonly used to suppress woody plant regrowth and to remove accumulated unpalatable pasture from rangelands and occasionally to alter pasture composition in native pastures in central Queensland, Australia. Outcomes can be somewhat unpredictable and short-term, and reliable evidence is needed to confirm the likely long-term efficacy of such fires. We imposed a regime of repeated spring burns on native Aristida/Bothriochloa pastures growing in two contrasting eucalypt woodlands of central Queensland to determine the effects on pasture composition, ground cover, landscape stability and woody plant recruitment, all in the absence of grazing. The sites selected were a silver-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus melanophloia F.Muell.) woodland and a poplar box (E. populnea F.Muell.) woodland. Weather conditions precluded spring burns in 3 years out of 7 at the silver-leaved ironbark site and in 2 years out of 8 at the poplar box site. The burn intensity was variable, and frequent fires produced a marked change in abundance of only a few pasture species. Depending on the site, fires significantly increased the frequency of Enneapogon spp., Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz.) S.T.Blake and Dichanthium sericeum (R.Br.) A. Camus and reduced the frequency of some minor components such as Cymbopogon spp., Panicum effusum R.Br., Cenchrus ciliaris L. and, ephemerally, that of some forbs. Contrary to expectation, only Aristida calycina R.Br. declined in abundance among the many Aristida species present, and the abundance of Heteropogon contortus (L.) P.Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. barely increased under regular spring fires. The total germinable seeds of herbaceous species in the soil each spring was significantly reduced by burning in the previous spring. Repeated spring fires rarely reinforced any initial change induced by burning, and slightly lowered average ground cover as well as various indices of landscape stability and ecosystem functionality. Changes produced were not always consistent across the two communities. Though prescribed burning is often important for maintaining grazing productivity and landscape values, very regular use is not recommended.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2018	40	5					485	500		10.1071/RJ17132							WOS:000447069500004

Effects of temperature and burial on seed germination and persistence of the restricted invasive Stevia ovata in northern Queensland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Stevia ovata Willd. is an invasive weed that has become naturalised in northern Queensland, Australia. To aid management of current infestations, this study evaluated seed germination under a range of constant (13-48 degrees C) and alternating (11/7 to 52/42 degrees C) temperature regimes and quantified the potential longevity of soil seed banks. The effect of different soil types, levels of pasture cover and burial depths on seed longevity was investigated in both the dry- and wet-tropics of North Queensland. Germination of S. ovata occurred under a wide range of both constant (13-39 degrees C) and alternating day/night temperatures (16/12 to 52/42 degrees C), but optimum conditions ranged between 24 and 27 degrees C and 24/20 and 37/31 degrees C respectively. As temperatures declined below the optimum, an increasing proportion of seeds went into a state of enforced dormancy. In contrast, higher than optimum temperatures caused a proportion of seeds to lose viability. Differential responses in seed longevity of S. ovata occurred between the two experimental sites. In the wet-tropics, seed viability was <1% after 12 months and fully expired after 18 months, irrespective of burial depth. In the dry-tropics, seeds persisted for longer (nil viability after 24-42 months) and burial depth had a significant effect. Surface located seeds tended to exhibit a faster rate of decline in viability than seeds buried below ground. These findings have implications for the duration of control/eradication programs and also suggest that S. ovata has the potential to greatly expand its current distribution, particularly into cooler areas of Australia.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2018	66	5					388	397		10.1071/BT18117							WOS:000446454000003

Field work was conducted in Morretes-PR, in an area of evergreen rain forest. In November 2013, seed bank samples were collected from ten points per area (0.30 x 0.30 m) and at three depths (0-3 cm + litter, 3.1 to 6.0 cm and 6.1 to 9.0 cm). We obtained 25.151 seeds m(-2), distributed between 85 species. The predominant life form was herbaceous (98%), with the Cyperaceae family being the most abundant. In the seed banks of the three areas, only a few seeds from a restricted number of woody species were found, which therefore, represents a limited resource for forest restoration purposes.																	2179-8087						2018	25	3							e20150295	10.1590/2179-8087.029515							WOS:000442677700002

Orchid Seed and Pollen: A Toolkit for Long-Term Storage, Viability Assessment and Conservation	ORCHID PROPAGATION: FROM LABORATORIES TO GREENHOUSES-METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Springer Protocols Handbooks											The development of ex situ preservation techniques for seed and pollen provides a vital addition to orchid conservation using in situ and living collection approaches. The ability to both store and later efficiently distribute germplasm for reintroductions and maintenance of genetic diversity provides a powerful tool that can usefully operate beyond the confines of habitat loss and climate change. Currently a wealth of data and experience exists in both professional and amateur fields alike that requires effective global networking and sustainable resourcing to ensure that all practitioners of orchid conservation benefit. In this chapter we have summarised the current state of knowledge concerning the practice of both orchid seed and pollen storage, emphasising some of the problems that may be encountered. We also describe how current research shows that dry seeds, and potentially pollen, of many species have the capacity to survive in storage for a number of decades, if not longer, at low and cryogenic temperatures. Although within the plant kingdom orchid seeds may still be described as being short-lived, we highlight new techniques for storage and assessment of viability and germination that are continually being developed and applied more broadly to a wider range of species, to improve longevity and enhance measurement techniques. We emphasise throughout the need for more comparative data acquisition, information and interpretation of the variation in responses across the family, so as to help inform the global community of how best to handle orchid germplasm.

How long the seed persists depends on its physical and physiological characteristics as well as on biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. In alien species, the ability to develop a persistent seed bank is associated with their ability to naturalize and become invasive. We carried out an experiment to find out how long the seeds of Heracleum mantegazzianum, one of the most invasive monocarpic species in Europe, are able to persist in soil and explore the effect of environmental conditions on seed depletion over a long period of time. The seeds were buried at 10 localities in different regions of the Czech Republic to cover a range of climatic, edaphic and geographic conditions. After seven years of burial, 0.1% of the seed of H. mantegazzianum, averaged across the localities, were viable, and none survived at five localities, at one of which the seed bank was completely depleted after five years and at one already after two years. The highest recorded survival at the end of the burial period was 0.5% of seed. In general, the average seed-bank survival was very low after five years and never exceeded 1%. We found a significant correlation between the percentage seed bank depletion and the content of total carbon and organic carbon; the effects of other soil characteristics, climatic and geographical factors were not significant. High percentages of seed persisted after the first year at localities with a low carbon content but the percentage depletion after seven years was slower at localities with a high carbon content. In addition, low carbon content and high seed survival after the first year was recorded at localities with nutrient poor soils. The course of seed bank depletion in H. mantegazzianum corresponds to its classification as short-term persistent. Therefore, monitoring well beyond the reported period of seed bank persistence is recommended after full eradication of this species from a site.

Agardh	BOTANY LETTERS					7th International Symposium on Extant and Fossil Charophytes	2016	Astana, KAZAKHSTAN					The study addressed the ecology and life cycle of two charophyte species, which are both at risk of extinction and on several Red Lists in Europe. Populations of Nitella opaca and N. gracilis, sometimes occurring together in three wetland ponds, were monitored for several years, and environmental data were also recorded. The pattern and timing of emergence (new shoots) and maturation of the sexual organs (antheridia, oogonia, and ripe oospores) were determined on plant samples collected regularly. The species phenophases were related to the environmental data. The results showed that species distribution can be linked to the water calcium content, a parameter that most differed in the three ponds. N. gracilis developed population only in ponds with very low calcium concentrations, whereas N. opaca had a wider tolerance. Following a pond bed air exposure in previous year, dense populations of N. opaca and N. gracilis were observed. None, or only a few individuals, were found when the waterbodies remained flooded the whole preceding year. Light and temperature affect differently the emergence of sex organs and the maturation of oospores. Both species differed in the timing of their phenophases. N. opaca appeared in March, reproduced and disappeared in July. N. gracilis was generally observed later in spring, and after full reproduction, the plants started a second cycle in late summer, while new oospore germination occurred. N. gracilis was perennial and reproduced all year long. Taking these results into account will help to design conservation plans for N. opaca and N. gracilis.																	2381-8107	2381-8115					2018	165	1					91	102		10.1080/23818107.2017.1365259							WOS:000441028600012						
J	Holzhausen, A; Porsche, C; Schubert, H				Holzhausen, Anja; Porsche, Christian; Schubert, Hendrik			Viability assessment and estimation of the germination potential of charophyte oospores: testing for site and species specificity	BOTANY LETTERS					7th International Symposium on Extant and Fossil Charophytes	2016	Astana, KAZAKHSTAN					Anthropogenic disturbance over several decades has caused aquatic ecosystems to deteriorate, raising concerns about their condition and, consequently, prompting restorative activities. The recovery of submerged vegetation (notably charophytes) is a crucial requirement for the restoration of eutrophic aquatic systems. The success of this action often depends on the availability and germinability of aquatic plant diaspores. To characterize the potential of the diaspore bank for the restoration of charophyte stands, we investigated viability, germination potential and conditions for dormancy breaking of the oospores in three independent studies. The viability of the oospores was determined by means of the triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) test. The germination potential of the diaspore banks from seven locations was estimated for potential irradiance dependency and the impact of factors influencing the dormancy status was assessed. For the latter aspect, the germination experiments were conducted with solitary oospores from plants and diaspore banks, pretreated under different temperature and desiccation regimens. The results showed species-specific differences in dormancy breakage and germination of 10 charophyte species. Five of the species tested, Chara filiformis Hertzsch, Lychnothamnus barbatus (Meyen) Leonh., Tolypella glomerata (Desvaux) Leonh., Nitella mucronata (A. Braun) Miq. in Hall and Nitella flexilis (L.) C. Agardh/Nitella opaca (C. Agardh ex Bruz.) C. Agardh, exhibited light-dependent germination. The irradiances where maximum germination was achieved correspond well to the species' distribution within the vertical irradiance gradient in their habitats.																	2381-8107	2381-8115					2018	165	1					147	158		10.1080/23818107.2017.1393460							WOS:000441028600016

During the last decades, eutrophication has negatively influenced macrophyte communities of the coastal ecosystems, making restoration activities inevitable. This study analysed recent macrophyte vegetation and the reproductive potential through the sediment diaspore reservoir along the German Baltic Sea coastline. Salinity was identified to be the responsible factor for shifts in the macrophyte community with most commonly found species like Stuckenia pectinata or Myriophyllum spicatum. In contrast, the oospores of small charophytes (e. g. Tolypella nidifica) clearly dominated the sediment diaspore bank. The germination rates differed in the recent vegetation composition and the diaspore bank composition with Zannichellia palustris as the dominant species. However, several species not visually detected at the respective sites were represented in the diaspore bank and germinated at a low rate (e. g. Chara contraria and Lamprothamnium papulosum). The maximal germination frequency corresponded to the sediment layer in which diaspore density was the highest (5- 15 cm). In conclusion, the germinable diaspores were observed at all sites. Considering the differences between the diaspore composition, recent vegetation and germination success, we have illustrated the potential of the diaspore banks for the restoration of the macrophyte communities after at least mid- term periods of disturbance.																	2381-8107	2381-8115					2018	165	1					159	173		10.1080/23818107.2017.1400464							WOS:000441028600017						
J	Wotton, DM				Wotton, Debra M.			Seed germination, dormancy and longevity in the endangered shrub Muehlenbeckia astonii (Polygonaceae)	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Muehlenbeckia astonii Petrie (Polygonaceae) is a nationally endangered shrub undergoing widespread recruitment failure in the wild. Seed germination, dormancy and longevity were investigated to determine factors potentially constraining M.astonii regeneration and population persistence. Muehlenbeckia astonii seeds were collected from restoration plants sourced from Kaitorete Spit, Canterbury. Germination percentage of untreated control seeds in a growth room (20 degrees C with 16 hours of light daily) was compared with that of seeds in two treatments: (1) chilled at 4 degrees C for 2 weeks; and (2) chilled for 12 weeks. I also investigated seed longevity by comparing germination of unburied, 6-month old, cold-stratified M.astonii seeds with germination of seeds buried in the field and retrieved after 1-4 years. All seeds were sown in pots outdoors. In the growth room, 24% of untreated M.astonii seeds germinated, while cold-stratification for either 2 or 12 weeks increased germination significantly (to 76%). In the seed longevity experiment, 85.2% of unburied M.astonii seeds sown 6 months after collection germinated. Muehlenbeckia astonii seeds survived burial under the soil in the field for up to 4 years. However, germination declined rapidly to 27.6% after burial for 1 year, and only 2.8% of the seeds germinated after 4 years of burial. The high germination of cold-stratified seeds suggests that low seed viability is not limiting M.astonii regeneration at Kaitorete Spit. Muehlenbeckia astonii has the potential to form a soil seed bank, which may buffer small, isolated populations from local extinction in the short term (<5 years).																	0028-825X	1175-8643					2018	56	3								10.1080/0028825X.2018.1491862							WOS:000440750000008

Different soil tillage systems were investigated in a long-term field experiment conducted during 2003-2012 at Institute of Agriculture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. The experiment was carried out in a cereal-based crop rotation. The experimental design included the following tillage treatments: 1) conventional tillage (CT): mouldboard ploughing at 22-24 cm depth; 2) minimum tillage (MT): stubble cultivation at 10-12 cm depth, non-selective herbicide (glyphosate) spray applied after harvesting; 3) no tillage (NT): direct drilling, non-selective herbicide spray applied after harvesting. This paper presents the data from the 2007-2012 experimental period. To determine weed seed bank, soil samples were taken in 2007 after spring barley harvesting and in 2012 after winter oilseed rape harvesting. Samples of weeds for the determination of fresh and dry mass were collected in 2011 and 2012 in winter wheat and winter oilseed rape crops during the growing period. The weed seed bank in the soil significantly decreased over the five-year period. However, significantly the highest number of seeds in the soil was found in the no tillage plots. Significant differences in the weed species composition between the different tillage systems were recorded: no tillage system promoted infestation of some broadleaf weeds, particularly Capsella bursa-pastoris. The lowest weed mass was determined for the conventional tillage plots, compared to minimum tillage, and especially no tillage plots.

Due to the increased demand for renewable raw materials, A. theophrasti as a fibre plant could be of particular interest to the automotive industry in Germany. The possibilities and potential of cultivation of A.theophrasti in Germany are still under investigation. However, the high production of persistent seeds could be a problem in cultivation. The emergence of the seeds in the following growing season can lead to yield loss in the subsequent crop. In order to investigate and quantify the seed potential in the soil and the dynamics of germination of A. theophrasti, field trials were carried out in 2015 and 2016, where winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were cultivated after A. theophrasti, in 2017 followed by maize (Zea mays). The seed potential in the soil and the number of emergent plants was continuously determined. After harvest of A. theophrasti, a soil seed bank of over 10,000 seeds m(-2) in 2015 and 6,000 seeds m(-2) in 2016 was determined. Within 2 years after the cultivation of A. theophrasti and winter wheat the number of seeds in the soil decreased by 77 to 82%. But 1 year after cultivation of A. theophrasti and subsequent crop still 1,973 to 3,096 seeds m(-2) in the soil were present. The dynamics of germination showed that the majority of the seeds in the soil only emerge before sowing sorghum and after harvest of sorghum or winter wheat. The comparison of A. theophrasti with Camelina sativa as a pre-crop showed that there were no significant differences in yield of sorghum or winter wheat.																	1868-9892		978-3-95547-054-8				2018	458						427	434		10.5073/jka.2018.458.062							WOS:000437997800062						
J	McCune, LM				McCune, Letitia M.			The Protection of Indigenous Peoples' Seed Rights during Ethnobotanical Research	ETHNOBIOLOGY LETTERS												Recognition of the importance of biodiversity for global food security and the community food sustainability movement has helped increase awareness of seed rights. International treaties created to ensure the world's access to seed biodiversity address access to seed banks for breeding purposes. Ethnobotanists are often required to deposit research plant specimens with government seed banks or herbariums. If Indigenous Peoples' plants are then used developing patented varieties, are their rights recognized? These rights depend upon recognition of Indigenous Peoples as plant breeders, prior informed consent (PIC) protocols, access and benefit sharing (ABS) agreements via material transfer agreements, and benefits returned to Indigenous and local communities per the Nagoya Protocol. To ensure such rights to genetic material and associated intellectual property rights, documentation of these agreements and links to the people and communities from which they originated needs to occur at first collection and throughout subsequent research, conservation, and breeding programs.																	2159-8126						2018	9	1			SI		67	75		10.14237/ebl.9.1.2018.1076							WOS:000439054300008						
S	Morimoto, J; Shibata, M		Nakamura, F		Morimoto, Junko; Shibata, Masatoshi			Vegetation Succession on Fallow Land	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION USING UMBRELLA SPECIES: BLAKISTON'S FISH OWL AND THE RED-CROWNED CRANE	Ecological Research Monographs											Wetland ecosystems inherently provide diverse ecosystem services and have been overwhelmingly reclaimed for agricultural land use around the world during the twentieth century. However, the rate of abandonment of agricultural lands began to increase exponentially in the 1950s. Local people are interested to know whether abandoned farmland naturally returns to historical wetland vegetation which is the basis of biodiversity and various ecosystem services. In this chapter, we focus on the succession of vegetation on fallow land in floodplain areas. The principal factors affecting wetland restoration on fallow lands are the supply of propagule of the historical vegetation and the suitable physiochemical conditions for their initial growth. The main propagule supporting the restoration of fallow lands includes soil seed bank and the seeds dispersed from neighbors. The effectiveness of the seed banks formed before agricultural development is largely dependent on the extent of divergence from the original site environment, especially the water environment. When the seed banks have declined, the amount of historical vegetation remaining in the surrounding area and the effectiveness of the natural flood regime are important. Water level and fertility are the most important factors influencing germination and initial growth of dispersed seeds on fallow land. In addition to these factors, the availability of vacant land for new recruitment is crucial. The plant community dominated by Phragmites australis, which is essential for the habitat of the red-crowned crane, has naturally regenerated in fallow lands in eastern Hokkaido. Thus, an increase of abandoned and fallow lands may provide additional suitable habitat for cranes and thereby contribute to increase their population size in the future.																	2191-0707		978-981-10-7203-1; 978-981-10-7202-4				2018							197	206		10.1007/978-981-10-7203-1_14	10.1007/978-981-10-7203-1						WOS:000438249600015

Vegetation and soil seed bank in a 23-year grazing exclusion chronosequence in a Mediterranean dry grassland	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Long-term grazing shaped plant diversity in dry Mediterranean grasslands. Abandonment of grazing affects plant diversity especially in the northern Mediterranean. Considerable efforts are, therefore, under way for grassland conservation and restoration. Yet, we do not know at which temporal scales impacts of grazing abandonment appear and in particular how soil seed banks evolve after longer grazing abandonment. Here, we provide detailed data from one of the very few long-term experiments available. These experiments provide data for up to 23years (1982-2005) of grazing exclusion built in 1982, 1989, 2000 and 2001. Grazing exclusion decreased species richness, modified vegetation structure and changed soil parameters. Decline in species richness appears in communities that experienced 16 and 23years of grazing exclusion. Only four to nine plant species of this Mediterranean grassland built persistent soil seed banks appearing after grazing exclusion, compared to 40-50 species in the established vegetation of grazed plots. Hence, similarity between vegetation and soil seed bank decreased with time of grazing exclusion. Even 23years after abandonment, no woody plants colonised the experiments. We conclude that vegetation will recover fast from grazing abandonment in the short-term. Nevertheless, longer abandonment will impact diversity due to reduced soil seed banks.

Seed dormancy, germination and soil seed bank of Lamiophlomis rotata and Marmoritis complanatum (Labiatae), two endemic species from Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Seed dormancy and germination characteristics are important factors determining plant reproductive success. In this study, we aimed to explore the characteristics of seed dormancy and germination of two endemic Labiatae species (Lamiophlomis rotata and Marmoritis complanatum) in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains. Germination was first tested in the light using freshly matured seeds at 25/15 and 15/5 degrees C, and then again after dry after-ripening. Dried seeds were incubated in the light at a range of constant temperatures (1-35 degrees C). The effects of dark and GA(3) on germination were tested at several different temperatures. Base temperature (T-b) and thermal times for 50% final germination ((50)) were calculated. Seeds were also buried at the collection site to test seed persistence in the soil. Increased final germination after dry after-ripening indicated that the seeds of the two species exhibited non-deep physiological dormancy; however, they exhibited different germination characteristics and soil seed bank types. In L. rotata, GA(3) only promoted germination at 5 degrees C, producing no significant effect at other temperatures. Dark conditions decreased germination significantly at all temperatures. T-b and (50) values were 0.6 and 82.7 degrees C d. The soil seed bank of this species was classified as persistent. In M. complanatum, GA(3) significantly promoted germination at all temperatures except 15 degrees C. Dark conditions depressed germination significantly at warmer temperatures (20 and 25 degrees C) but had no effect at lower temperatures. T-b and (50) values were 0.1 and 92.3 degrees C d. The soil seed bank was classified as transient. Our results suggest that the seed dormancy and germination of the two co-existing species share some commonalities but there are also species-specific adaptations to the harsh alpine environment.																	1126-3504	1724-5575					2018	152	4					642	648		10.1080/11263504.2017.1311959							WOS:000432652900008

The zone of temporary flooding of small rivers as an area of increased floristic diversity	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												During fluctuating water levels in the lower reaches of rivers, large areas of shallow water are exposed, forming a zone of temporary flooding (TFZ). The level regime of the water body determines the conditions for the growth of plants, the period available for vegetation of species and the path of seed migration. The seed bank is an integral part of a riparian biocenosis, experiencing the characteristics of environmental factors which influence its structure. Our study of the vegetation cover was carried out by the method of route survey of ecotopes in the estuaries of the Korozhechna and Ild rivers, tributaries of the Rybinsk Reservoir. Species composition of the flora is given in accordance with APG IV. The cenotic structure is characterized in terms of the Brown-Blanke school. To assess the species composition of the seed bank, a transect was placed along the width of the TFZ, on which cores were selected. Flora of the Korozhechny river is represented by 59 species from 24 families and 45 genera. Most numerous families: Poaceae (12%), Cyperaceae (10%), Polygonaceae (10%), Asteraceae, Ranunculaceae and Brassicaceae (by 7%). Flora of the Ild river is represented by 42 species from 18 families and 29 genera. Most numerous families: Cyperaceae (21%), Ranunculaceae (14%), Poaceae (12%), Plantaginaceae (7%). We found two rare species: Carex bohemica - on the Ild river and Ranunculus reptans - on both rivers. The difference in the species composition is explained by the greater riparian area of the TFZ on the Korozhechna river, characterized by a wide low floodplain. Phytocenosis form multicomponent complexes and are represented by associations Scirpetum lacustris, Phalaroidetum arundinaceae, Caricetum gracilis, Phragmitetum communis - on both rivers, Hippuridetum vulgaris. Batrachietum circinati - in terrestrial form on the Korozhechna river, and Eleocharitetum palustris and Oenantho-Rorippetum on the Ild river. In the seed bank composition of the TFZ of the transition zone of the Korozhechna river receiver 25 species were found, Ild river - 30 species. The ecological structure of the flora of both rivers and the seed bank is dominated by species of waterlogged and humid habitats. Their share (hygrophyte and hygromeso- and mesophyte) accounts for about 50%. With prolonged drying, they can normally develop in the TFZ. In the biomorphological structure, the main part of the flora and seed bank species are perennial grasses, characterized by great environmental plasticity, adapted to extreme conditions of habitat, having wide ecological amplitude with respect to the ground and which can withstand considerable fluctuations in the water level. As a result, our work has confirmed that the seed bank is a hidden component of plant communities and reflects the floristic potential of ecologically unstable territories.

The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of a long-term different intensity soil tillage methods and deep loosening on weed number, weed agrobiological group and soil seed bank changes in till Bathygleyic Dystric Glossic Retisol soil under the climatic conditions of the Western Lithuania (geographical coordinates 55 degrees 4338N, 21 degrees 2743E). The study included different soil tillage methods (conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing and shallow ploughless tillage) and deep loosening. During investigational years, the greatest weed number in crops and the greatest weed seed number in the seed bank were determined in the soil reduced tillage (shallow ploughing and shallow ploughless tillage). The weed number in crops of conventional ploughing soil was 35.8% lover compared to reduced tillage soil. The weed seed number in the seed bank of conventional ploughing was 49.6% lover compared to reduced tillage Decreasing soil tillage intensity resulted in weed seeds concentration in the upper topsoil. A one-time deep loosening had a significant effect during the crop rotation: the weed number in crops and weed seed number in the seed bank were determined to have increased by 26.6% and 51.6% in conventional ploughing soil and by 11.9% and 23.2% shallow ploughless soil respectively. However, after deep loosening, the number of Poa annua in crops decreased 2.9 times in plots of conventional ploughing and 1.7 times - in plots of shallow ploughing soil.

This mostly includes the loss of vegetation cover, the emptying of seed banks and degradation of the top soil. The objective of this study was to assess the spontaneous vegetation regeneration on nine landslide trails approximately 2.5 years after disturbance. A systematic vegetation sampling was conducted using 5 x 5 m quadrats. A total of 1,304 individuals from 72 tree and shrub species were recorded across the landslide trails, with a mean density of 1.09 +/- 0.71 individual m(-2). The woody component of the regeneration was dominated by bird-dispersed species, followed by wind-dispersed species. Ground cover was dominated by two mat-forming ferns Dicranopteris pedata and Blechnum orientale. In order to facilitate the vegetation restoration and to speed up ecological succession on landslides, it is recommended to establish pioneer trees to improve both the top soil stability and soil-building process. The importance of providing bird perches must be emphasized, as it improves seed rain to the disturbed landscapes, thus promoting the regrowth of trees and shrubs.

ASSESSMENT OF THE WEED INCIDENCE AND WEED SEED BANK OF CROPS UNDER DIFFERENT PEDOLOGICAL TRAITS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Weed community variations result from an interaction of different cropping and pedo-climatic aspects. The aim of the study was to investigate changes of the weed incidence in limed and unlimed soils of different texture in the Western Lithuania. Soil acidity decrease from pH 4.2-5.8 to 5.1-6.4 resulted in total weed number decrease: in sandy soils it decreased by 46.7%, in sandy loam soils - by 34.3% and in loam soils - by 24.0%. However, due to better nutrient and growth conditions, the weed mass was 11.1-72.6% greater in limed soil. The annual weeds were spread much more in a sandy soil (94.1% of the total weed number), while the perennial weeds - in a loam soil (51.2%). In sandy soils of all surveyed sites, most weeds were monocotyledonous (on the average 64.8%), while in sandy loam and loam soils dicotyledonous (70.6%). The number of observed weed species was greater in sandy loam and loam soils both in crops and in the soil seed bank. Weed species diversity of the soil seed bank was particularly influenced by crop type and the crop preceding in the rotation. The most frequent weed species sequences in crops and soil seed bank matched by 67%.

Seedling Presence and Growth Pattern of Soil Seed Bank Represents Vegetation Changes after Warming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												The objective of this study is to estimate the response of soil seed bank under four different temperatures, mainly focused on germination and growth. We sampled soils at six locations of an alpine grassland, Mt Soeback and an alpine swamp, Mt Daeam, Korea. The soils were divided quarterly and then are allocated to four chambers with each four different temperatures (day/night; 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 and 35/25 degrees C). The seedlings from soil seed bank were checked out by seedling emergence method. The mean species number per trays, the numbers of germinated seedlings, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass were compared with multivariate analysis of general linear model of SPSS. The dominance of species was determined based on individual number and frequency recorded. All germinated number was 1,414. The mean species number germinated at grassland soils showed significant difference but that of swamp soils did not show significant difference. The mean aboveground biomass of both grassland and swamp soils showed significant differences at 35/25 degrees C. The aboveground biomass of Potentilla fragarioides var. major from soils of an alpine grassland, Mt Soeback was different significantly at all four temperature treatments. The results can show vegetation changes generated from the soil seed bank by warming.																	0972-9984	0973-7308					2018	33	1					28	40									WOS:000429161600003

This study used the human influenza virus A/Yunnan/1/2005Vca(H3N2) (YN/05Vca) as a donor strain. YN/05Vca has a double phenotype of cold adaption (ca) and Vero cell adaption (va). The parental virus strain used was the wild-type A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1) (SI/06wt). The study employed the modified classical reassortment method to generate a new virus strain. After co-infection of Vero cells, some different sub-types of the reassorted viruses were generated randomly. Then, the specific anti-serum (anti-YN/05Vca) could combine with and neutralize the donor virus, and the original parental virus could not grow in Vero cells at a low temperature until it was re-structured with the meaningful gene fragment from the donor virus in Vero cells. According to the plaques and RT-PCR results, a new monoclonal strain of Vero cell cold adaption virus was screened: SI/06Vca. After immunological and biological identification, this new strain virus could be used as a seed bank for LAIV, which has maintained surface antigenicity with SI/06wt. Consequently, this new Vero cell cold adaption virus SI/06Vca could be used for large-scale vaccine production with sufficient safety and efficacy, as confirmed by animal experiments with mice and ferrets.																	2164-5515	2164-554X					2018	14	3			SI		615	622		10.1080/21645515.2017.1380761							WOS:000428053800026	29064728					
J	Ange, O				Ange, Olivia			Interspecies Respect and Potato Conservation in the Peruvian Cradle of Domestication	CONSERVATION & SOCIETY												This paper explores people and tuber affective encounters, as they unfold in a biodiversity conservation programme in the Peruvian Andes. It draws on ethnographic data from the Potato Park, renowned worldwide as one of the most successful in-situ initiatives for the conservation of biocultural diversity. Concerned with interspecies relations, the paper focusses on the circulation of respeto that is both an affect and a normative stance posited locally as necessary for the conservation of the potato. Addressing first expressions of respeto in daily potato practices by highland peasants, the paper then explores its importance within the context of the Park's conservation policy. Agricultural investigations and seed-banking are indeed enmeshed in activities intended to intensify potato-people regard. Throughout the paper, the concept of non-human charisma is used to point out the different kinds of potato appraisals experienced in the Park; as well as how the Park concretely works toward human beings' learning 'how to be affected' by tuber agrobiodiversity. The article finally explains how potato affective agency is extended beyond the Park, to reach the international scene. Exploring the Potato Park from the perspective of respeto, and using charisma as a heuristic tool, it enlightens a mode of conservation initiative; creating flourishing ecologies through affective encounters, that cannot be accounted for with an instrumental approach.																	0972-4923	0975-3133				JAN-MAR	2018	16	1					30	40		10.4103/cs.cs_16_122							WOS:000428253100004

In this study we experimentally reproduced these traditional management practices upon a natural population of the starflower Comanthera elegantula (Ruhland) L.R. Parra & Giul. (Eriocaulacece) using eight distinct treatments consisting of 'fire', "harvest" and the combined absence of these interventions over two years, in order to assess their effects on seedling recruitment. The study was conducted at the central Espinhaco range region, in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Our results show that the extractive management practices interfere with the recruitment dynamics of C. elegantula, with fire significantly reducing the competing herbaceous cover and stimulating seedling recruitment. An intermittent fire regime seem to favor seedling establishment and growth, while sequential fire episodes seem to negatively impact the progression of seedling cohorts and the regrowth of the herbaceous cover. Additional seed input took place at local scale, probably through dispersion from outer sources and/or from seed banks. Seed pool depletion isto be expected under a persistent and efficient inflorescence collection regime and may ultimately contribute to population senescence. (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

As seed banks are often degraded, methods are needed to overcome dispersal limitation of the remnant vegetation. One approach is to vacuum harvest seeds from donor sites. While this is a cost-effective method, individual species' traits describing reproduction methods and dispersal mechanisms may affect the success with which seeds are collected and subsequently germinate. We collected seeds using low-cost vacuum harvesters in species-rich meadows in Poland. We predicted the relative success with which seedlings emerged from this collected material with respect to their percentage cover in the donor sites on the basis of individual species' functional traits. Prolific species that rely on seed as opposed to vegetative reproduction, and those that germinate in late summer/autumn, exhibited the highest level of emergence. To a lesser extent, drought-tolerant or shade-intolerant species were well represented in the collected material. There was also weak evidence that wind-dispersed seeds would have a higher likelihood of being collected by this method. Our results suggest that vacuum harvesting is a valuable method to collect seeds for use in grassland restoration; however, it has limitations. In particular, additional methods may be needed to introduce into grassland restoration sites the propagules of species that vegetatively reproduce or seed early. The overrepresentation of species that produce large numbers of seed may potentially introduce priority effects that could also have unintended long-term implications for the structure of the floral community.

Questioning the reliability of "ancient" woodland indicators: Resilience to interruptions and persistence following deforestation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Indicator species can provide invaluable insights into environmental conditions but robust empirical testing of their effectiveness is essential. Ancient woodland indicators (AWIs) are plant species considered indicative of sites that have been continuously wooded for a long period by virtue of poor dispersal ability and intolerance of non-woodland habitats. Many countries now utilise AWI species lists to classify ancient woodlands. Here we use a metastudy approach to test resilience of AWIs to interruptions and persistence following deforestation and thus the robustness of using AWI lists using a novel approach. We compare current AWI assemblage with woodland history based on pollen evidence at nine sites across the UK with a robustly-dated and spatially-precise palynological profile. Sites were split into: (1) proven continuous woodland; (2) previously interrupted woodland; and (3) previously but not currently wooded. Vegetation history was > 1000 years at most sites. Assessment of ancientness using AWIs agreed with palynologically-proven ancient woodland at two sites, including a species-poor woodland of previously-uncertain age. However, four interrupted woodland sites and three clear-felled sites supported extensive AWI floristic communities. This suggests AWIs are resilient to interruptions, possibly by remaining in the seed bank longer than expected, and persistent following deforestation. Persistence might be due to other species (e.g. heathland plants) acting as pseudo-canopy or because some AWIs are more tolerant of non-woodland locations than previously thought. We conclude that use of floristic AWIs alone in defining ancient woodland should be reviewed, especially where status links to planning policy and conservation prioritisation. We suggest species on AWI lists be reviewed under expert and local guidance and a system of weighting species based on their strict or strong affinity solely with ancient woodland be developed. The use of multi-taxa indicators is recommended to allow stakeholders globally to make informed decisions about ancient woodland status.

Seeds in a Burial Seed Bank	FLORESTA E AMBIENTE												The ability of certain species in keeping the seeds viable for long periods in the soil seed bank is essential for environmental resilience, which is used in forest restoration. This work aimed to study the behavior of a buried seed bank of P. dubium. Burial seed bank was performed in a fragment of Seasonal Semideciduous Forest. One hundred samples consisting of 25 seeds in polyethylene cups were placed under the canopy. Every two months, five samples were taken for determination of water content, viability, emergency (root protrusion and seedling formation) and predation. Seeds of P. dubium may remain buried in the ground for up to 16 months keeping their viability. This result indicates that P. dubium is able to form persistent soil seed bank. The predation was the main factor contributing to the seed bank reduction.

Different scenarios have been suggested; was a permanent water cover needed at all times, or were there episodical water level fluctuations? In this paper, we use aquatic and wetland plants to shed light on layer formation processes of complex anthropogenic stratigraphies of the Neolithic lakeshore settlement Zug-Riedmatt (Central Switzerland). Botanical macroremains from the microarchaeologically investigated occupation layer were analysed and compared to modern analogue data from two lakes. Results suggest that the excavated area of the settlement was in a first phase located in the sublittoral zone (below water), with a massive input of anthropogenic waste material contributing to the layer formation, but then in a second phase, the shoreline shifted so that the excavated part of the settlement was located in the eulittoral zone and in a third phase probably even landwards of a reed belt. In a comparison with two previously investigated Neolithic lakeshore sites, we found that at least in one of these sites, such 'drier' conditions could also be found. This shows how important it is to know which part of the littoral zone is represented in an excavation, as conditions can differ within a settlement, and that there is very likely no universally valid 'Pfahlbau scenario'.

Repeated Drought Alters Resistance of Seed Bank Regeneration in Baldcypress Swamps of North America	ECOSYSTEMS												Recurring drying and wetting events are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in predicted future droughts in the central USA and alter the regeneration potential of species. We explored the resistance of seed banks to successive droughts in 53 sites across the nine locations in baldcypress swamps in the southeastern USA. Along the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley and northern Gulf of Mexico, we investigated the capacity of seed banks to retain viable seeds after successive periods of drying and wetting in a greenhouse study. Mean differences in species richness and seed density were compared to examine the interactions of successive droughts, geographical location and water regime. The results showed that both species richness and total density of germinating seedlings decreased over repeated drought trials. These responses were more pronounced in geographical areas with higher annual mean temperature. In seed banks across the southeastern swamp region, most species were exhausted after Trial 2 or 3, except for semiaquatic species in Illinois and Tennessee, and aquatic species in Texas. Distinct geographical trends in seed bank resistance to drought demonstrate that climate-induced drying of baldcypress swamps could influence the regeneration of species differently across their ranges. Despite the health of adult individuals, lack of regeneration may push ecosystems into a relict status. Seed bank depletion by germination without replenishment may be a major conservation threat in a future with recurring droughts far less severe than megadrought. Nevertheless, the protection of moist refugia might aid conservation.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				JAN	2018	21	1					190	201		10.1007/s10021-017-0143-y							WOS:000425004400015

Geoffroy, 1810) (Mammalia, Chiroptera)	STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT												Bats are responsible for many ecological services, such as seed dispersal of several plant species, contributing to the processes of succession and forest regeneration. A factor that can interfere with this process is the animal digestion, which can affect germination, altering the patterns of seedling distribution. The effects of seed passage through bats' guts varies with the species, leading to some discrepancies in the literature. In this study, we tested the digestion time of one Phyllostomidae bat species, Sturnira lilium, in two Neotropical plants: Solanum paniculatum and Ficus organensis, and the effects on seed germination. The experiment was conducted in captivity and the germination tests were made in laboratory conditions. The results suggested that most seeds ingested by S. lilium are dispersed within 40min for both species and the digestion seems not to significantly affect the germination of F. organensis, despite the slight acceleration of germination. In S. paniculatum, germination occurred only in the control (39%), whereas in the treatments, all the seeds remained dormant during the 25 experimental days. In this case, the digestion of S. lilium possibly contributes to the formation of seed banks, randomizing the temporal distribution of seedlings.

The GRU is a national capability supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The GRU curates germplasm collections of a range of temperate cereal, legume and Brassica crops and their associated wild relatives, as well as precise genetic stocks, near-isogenic lines and mapping populations. With >35,000 accessions, the GRU forms part of the UK's plant conservation contribution to the Multilateral System (MLS) of the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) for wheat, barley, oat and pea. SeedStor is a fully searchable system that allows our various collections to be browsed species by species through to complicated multipart phenotype criteria-driven queries. The results from these searches can be downloaded for later analysis or used to order germplasm via our shopping cart. The user community for SeedStor is the plant science research community, plant breeders, specialist growers, hobby farmers and amateur gardeners, and educationalists. Furthermore, SeedStor is much more than a database; it has been developed to act internally as a Germplasm Information Management System that allows team members to track and process germplasm requests, determine regeneration priorities, handle cost recovery and Material Transfer Agreement paperwork, manage the Seed Store holdings and easily report on a wide range of the aforementioned tasks.																	0032-0781	1471-9053				JAN	2018	59	1								10.1093/pcp/pcx195							WOS:000423660600005

This study was carried out to assess the spatial variability of soil seed bank (SSB) and seed bank composition around cushion plants to estimate the SSB potential for restoration of degraded area. Twenty cushions of Onobrychis cornuta were selected in a mountainous rangelands in northern Alborz in Iran, measuring density, richness and composition of SSB at four locations of each cushion (upslope edge, downslope edge, centre and outside). SSB composition and density were determined by seedling emergence method. The results showed that the locations of cushions had significant effect on density and richness of the SSBs. The highest SSB density and richness were observed in the centre and upslope edge of the cushions, while there was no significant differences of density and richness between downslope edge and outside (bare grassland soil) of the cushions. In addition, the results showed that seed bank composition was highly correlated between the four locations in the same cushion. We concluded that cushion plants can act as seed traps specially trapping seeds dispersed by barochory and hydrochory and therefore play an important role in conservation and recovery of degraded areas.

Seed Bank-Vegetation Dynamics along a Restoration Management Gradient in Pine Flatwoods Ecosystems of the Florida Gulf Coast	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Pine flatwoods ecosystems of the Gulf Coastal Plains of the southeastern United States are known for their species richness, mainly contributed by herbaceous groundcover. However, intensive silvicultural operations and exclusion of fire over a large extent of these ecosystems in the past century has led to a serious depletion of groundcover diversity. Consequently, restoration of these ecosystems has become a high priority for ecological management of forests in the area. The present study was carried out at mesic-hydric flatwoods sites in northwest Florida to examine the effects of restoration activities, including varying intensities of thinning and prescribed burning, on the dynamics of the vegetation and the soil seed bank composition and structure. Three site conditions-degraded, partially restored, and restored-representing a restoration management gradient were sampled for aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank. Vegetation and seed bank composition changed following restoration activities. However, there was little effect on the seed bank structure across the site conditions. A total of 24, 59, and 124 species in the aboveground vegetation, and 26, 39, and 64 species in the seed bank were observed in degraded, partially restored, and restored site conditions, respectively. Most of the species in the seed bank were ruderal, although native. The effect of site conditions on seed density and seed species richness and diversity was not statistically significant. However, these characteristics did vary significantly with the soil depth (main effect) where the soil sample was taken. Higher seed densities were observed in top 0-5 and 5-10 cm than 10-15 cm soil depths across all sites. Seed banks tended to resemble each other more than the vegetation and the vegetation and seed bank across all sites. The presence of mostly ruderal species in seed bank in degraded site indicates that seed bank is not a good source of regeneration of typical flatwoods communities.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JAN	2018	38	1					26	43									WOS:000422864600004

The objective of this study is to evaluate different treatments to guide the selection of future modalities for the eradication (i.e. elimination of all individuals in a population) of Carpobrotus sp. from a strict nature reserve. Two removal methods were tested: (1) living Carpobrotus removal; (2) living Carpobrotus and litter removal. To assess the effectiveness of each treatment, we studied the recolonization of native vegetation, the recolonization of Carpobrotus, and soil erosion and compared these metrics to those taken in native vegetation and in patches of intact Carpobrotus. We also tested the capacity of a 50-cm-wide Carpobrotus strip to retain soil. The removal of Carpobrotus together with its litter led to high rates of soil erosion. The Carpobrotus strips were found to retain the soil rather well. Removing live Carpobrotus while leaving its litter in place reduced soil erosion and led to higher native plant species recolonization. The composition of the vegetation 10 months after applying the treatments was biased in favor of native pioneer species. These are typically the first species to establish (Aetheoriza bulbosa and Arisarum vulgare resprouted, Frankenia hirsuta and Lotus cytisoides germinated, and Sonchus sp. benefited from long-distance dispersal). Few weedy species were recorded (e.g. Sonchus asper asper). Whatever the treatment, the risk of reinvasion from the seed bank or from resprouting stems is nonnegligible, so long-term monitoring is vital to the ultimate success of the eradication program.

Winter cereals, fodder crops, and legumes representative for this region were included in the crop rotation. Th e woodchips were produced from cuttings of the hedgerows on the farm and were applied to the fi eld in rates of 0, 80, and 160 m3 ha-1, respectively (control, WCM80, and WCM160). Weed infestations, including weed density in spring, weed biomass at crop harvest and weed seed bank, were measured in selected years. Crop yields were recorded yearly. Soil temperature and soil mineral N content were measured in selected years. In general, mean weed density was reduced in WCM160 (135 plants m(-2)) compared to WCM80 and the control (150 and 160 plants m(-2), respectively). Th e relative weed density averaged across the two WCM levels was 91% of the control on average and showed no trend over time. Th e grain yield of cereals and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) did not signifi cantly diff er between the mulching treatments.

We investigated the survival and performance (RGR, total biomass and above-to-belowground biomass (A:B)) of three common and often coexisting arid zone floodplain species: Xanthium strumarium, Cyperus gymnocaulos and Ludwigia peploides. Observations suggested the species had different responses to inundation, which was tested in a controlled pond experiment. Plants were held at three elevations (+ 10 cm, - 20 and - 70 cm) and subjected to three hydrological regimes (static 90 cm, 1 and 5 cm day(-1) inundation) for 16 weeks. Xanthium strumarium died when completely inundated for longer than 4 weeks but when partially flooded survived, showed lower growth rates, increased A:B and produced adventitious roots. C. gymnocaulos showed reduced growth rates when partially flooded and senesced to rhizomes when completely inundated for longer than 4 weeks, which re-sprouted after inundation pressure was removed. L. peploides responded positively to flooding with increased A:B and the production of adventitious roots. The species exhibited three contrasting responses to inundation, which do not necessarily fit neatly within existing water regime functional classification frameworks.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				JAN	2018	219	1					57	67		10.1007/s11258-017-0777-z							WOS:000419386300005						
J	Mahaut, L; Fried, G; Gaba, S				Mahaut, Lucie; Fried, Guillaume; Gaba, Sabrina			Patch dynamics and temporal dispersal partly shape annual plant communities in ephemeral habitat patches	OIKOS												Most organisms in ephemeral habitat patches have resting stages which form a local species pool in response to temporal variations in the patch's availability and suitability. Temporal dispersal from the local species pool may, therefore, be an important process shaping the community assembly, particularly soon after patch creation, and possibly interacting with environmental filtering. As the temporal variation of the environmental conditions has a major effect on the composition of the local species pool, we investigated how well contemporary conditions (both patch availability and patch suitability) and temporal dispersal (approximated by environmental temporal variation and temporal distance) explain the changes in community composition in a given locality through successive ephemeral habitat cycles. We used arable weeds in annual crops as models. We calculated temporal weed community dissimilarity indices between weed communities surveyed in cropping seasons at intervals of two to eight years within a given field. The weeds were surveyed twice each cropping season to account for any changes in the relative contributions of temporal dispersal and contemporary conditions during the season. Patch availability explained most of the temporal weed dissimilarity, suggesting that patch dynamics have the greatest effect on weed community assembly. Temporal distance and temporal variation of the environmental conditions had more effect at the start of the cropping season than later, while patch suitability had more effect in the middle of the season. These results suggest that temporal dispersal drives the weed community assembly when ephemeral habitat patches are created. These assemblies are further shaped by environmental filtering. This is consistent with a temporal source sink dynamic mechanism where the seed bank acts as the main weed source. However, a large part of temporal weed dissimilarity remains unexplained, suggesting that other ecological processes such as spatial dispersal and founder effect may also shape the weed community.

Within marine phytoplankton, multidecadal time series of monoclonal strains germinated from resting stages have been established for diatoms (Skeletonema marinoi) and dinoflagellates (Pentapharsodinium dalei), spanning ca. a century. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of these time series have revealed effects of past environmental changes on population genetic structure. Future perspectives include direct comparisons of phenotypes and genotypic data of populations, for example, by genomewide assays that can correlate phenotypic trends with genotypes and allele frequencies in temporally separated strains. Besides their usefulness as historical records, "seed" banks of phytoplankton resting stages also have the potential to provide an inoculum that influences present populations through "dispersal from the past" (the storage effect) and are important for adaptation to future environments through their standing genetic diversity.

Evolution with a seed bank: The population genetic consequences of microbial dormancy	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy that allows organisms to persist through conditions that are suboptimal for growth and reproduction by entering a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. Dormancy allows a population to maintain a reservoir of genetic and phenotypic diversity (i.e., a seed bank) that can contribute to the long-term survival of a population. This strategy can be potentially adaptive and has long been of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. However, comparatively little is known about how dormancy influences the fundamental evolutionary forces of genetic drift, mutation, selection, recombination, and gene flow. Here, we investigate how seed banks affect the processes underpinning evolution by reviewing existing theory, implementing novel simulations, and determining how and when dormancy can influence evolution as a population genetic process. We extend our analysis to examine how seed banks can alter macroevolutionary processes, including rates of speciation and extinction. Through the lens of population genetic theory, we can understand the extent that seed banks influence the evolutionary dynamics of microorganisms as well as other taxa.																	1752-4571					JAN	2018	11	1			SI		60	75		10.1111/eva.12557							WOS:000419064100006	29302272

Understanding the Impacts of Climate Change: an Analysis of Inundation, Marsh Elevation, and Plant Communities in a Tidal Freshwater Marsh	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Tidal freshwater marshes around the world face an uncertain future with increasing water levels, salinity intrusion, and temperature and precipitation shifts associated with climate change. Due to the characteristic abundance of both annual and perennial species in these habitats, even small increases in early growing season water levels may reduce seed germination, seedling establishment, and late-season plant cover, decreasing overall species abundance and productivity. This study looks at the distribution of tidal freshwater marsh plant species at Jug Bay, Patuxent River (Chesapeake Bay, USA), with respect to intertidal elevation, and the relationship between inundation early in the growing season and peak plant cover to better understand the potential impacts and marsh responses to increased inundation. Results show that 62% of marsh plant species are distributed at elevations around mean high water and are characterized by narrow elevation ranges in contrast with species growing at lower elevations. In addition, the frequency and duration of inundation and water depth to which the marsh was exposed to, prior to the growing season (March 15-May 15), negatively affected peak plant cover (measured in end-June to mid-July) after a threshold value was reached. For example, 36 and 55% decreases in peak plant cover were observed after duration of inundation threshold values of 25 and 36% was reached for annual and perennial species, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that plant communities of tidal freshwater marshes are sensitive to even small systematic changes in inundation, which may affect species abundance and richness as well as overall wetland resiliency to climate change.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JAN	2018	41	1					25	35		10.1007/s12237-017-0342-y							WOS:000418591000003

Predicted global warming scenarios impact on the mother plant to alter seed dormancy and germination behaviour in Arabidopsis	PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT												Seed characteristics are key components of plant fitness that are influenced by temperature in their maternal environment, and temperature will change with global warming. To study the effect of such temperature changes, Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown to produce seeds along a uniquely designed polyethylene tunnel having a thermal gradient reflecting local global warming predictions. Plants therefore experienced the same variations in temperature and light conditions but different mean temperatures. A range of seed-related plant fitness estimates were measured. There were dramatic non-linear temperature effects on the germination behaviour in two contrasting ecotypes. Maternal temperatures lower than 15-16 degrees C resulted in significantly greater primary dormancy. In addition, the impact of nitrate in the growing media on dormancy was shown only by seeds produced below 15-16 degrees C. However, there were no consistent effects on seed yield, number, or size. Effects on germination behaviour were shown to be a species characteristic responding to temperature and not time of year. Elevating temperature above this critical value during seed development has the potential to dramatically alter the timing of subsequent seed germination and the proportion entering the soil seed bank. This has potential consequences for the whole plant life cycle and species fitness. We provide direct measurements on the impact of global warming scenarios tothe maternal environment on subsequent seed characteristics related to species fitness. To do this, we employed unique equipment (thermal gradient tunnel) that allowed seminatural simulations of global warming to the mother plants during growth to seed harvest. We show dramatic non-linear seed maturation temperature effects on the depth of dormancy, the characteristic that determines the timing of the crucial transition from seed to seedling in the plant life cycle. This is important because shifts in phenology influence population dynamics and plant diversity, but until now, this trait has been considered as largely neglected in global warming studies.

J	Chenot, J; Jaunatre, R; Buisson, E; Bureau, F; Dutoit, T				Chenot, Julie; Jaunatre, Renaud; Buisson, Elise; Bureau, Fabrice; Dutoit, Thierry			Impact of quarry exploitation and disuse on pedogenesis	CATENA												Quarrying represents one of the oldest and most important human activities; the impacts of which have largely influenced vegetation and landscape. Despite its character as a vital and non-renewable resource, the soil has been poorly studied with regard to either the impact resulting from the exploitation of quarries or its restoration after exploitation. In the plain of La Crau (South-eastern France), numerous dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970s. Their exploitation lasted about ten years and they were then rapidly abandoned. At that time, there was no legal obligation to restore sites after their abandonment. In this context, following various modes of exploitation (e.g. exploitation depth), various rehabilitation options were implemented: no rehabilitation, topsoil transfer, deposits of anthropogenic materials. The absence of legislation consequently resulted in heterogeneous areas after their abandonment. Today, we have the benefit of 35 years of hindsight on the dynamics of these ecosystems resulting from these exploitation modes and rehabilitation options and thus various questions arise: (1) Did the diversity of the modes of exploitation result in heterogeneous soils 30 years after abandon. ment? (2) At what stage of pedogenesis are the soils created in the abandoned quarries? (3) Did the various rehabilitation options have an impact on the traces of biological activity in the soils of the quarries? (4) Is it possible to identify methods of rehabilitation of quarries that would favour the rehabilitation of the soils and the recolonisation of the plant cover in order to improve the techniques in use or to propose alternative methods? The study of soil profiles (with a special focus on biological activity of animals and plants) and soil physicochemical analyses (pH, CaCO3, C, N, C:N ratio, CEC, exchangeable K+, plant available P and fine soil particle contents) made it possible to study these questions. Our results confirm that all the soils resulting from the former exploitation modes and rehabilitation options of the quarries present their own specific characteristics (upper soil layer fertility, soil profile vertical organization) which remain very different, even after 30 years, from the characteristics of the destroyed reference soil ecosystem. Pedogenetic processes are very slow or even blocked by the recurrent action of certain environmental parameters. In terms of ecological rehabilitation, only topsoil transfers undertaken under good conditions (same soil thickness as the reference steppe and no contact with the phreatic zone) have allowed to restore most of the physical and chemical properties recorded close to the reference ecosystem soil.

Existing recommendations, however, can contrast with needs for early post-harvest tillage e.g. for pest control. To specify and to systematically further improve preventive volunteer management through post-harvest tillage of imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape (Clearfield (R); CL OSR), field experiments were set up at two locations in two separate trial periods at each location (2013-2014 and 2014-2015) in south-west Germany. After OSR harvest, and average harvest losses of 1500 M-2 seeds, or artificially broadcasting of 20 000 OSR seeds m(-2), stubble tillage was performed at weekly intervals (immediate (0), 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks) at each of three depths (1-2, 6-8, and 15-17 cm). To depict a worst case scenario in which herbicides were ineffective, no herbicides were applied. There were significantly smaller soil seed banks found in spring the longer the period lasted between seed rain and stubble tillage; 265 vs 145 seeds M-2 referred to 0 week vs. 4 weeks on average. Depth of stubble tillage had no significant effects on the seed number in the soil. In the first spring after seed loss, 0-2.6 CL OSR volunteers m(-2) were found in the winter wheat, and the number decreased with delayed timing depth of stubble tillage. These volunteers mainly emerged in the treatment of shallow stubble tillage (1-2 cm), with 0.7-0.9 flowering volunteer m(-2), while volunteers averaged less than 0.04 plants M-2 in the treatment "15-17 cm". OSR volunteers in winter wheat got ripened only in one out of the four fields, and produced 1.0 seed m(-2) on average. The delay between harvest and stubble tillage can be limited to approximately three weeks if stubble tillage is performed at a depth of about 6-8 cm; further delay did not bring additional advantage. We recommend to retain the stubble for three weeks as further delay does not bring additional advantage, and then to apply stubble tillage deeper than 6 cm. Very superficial or shallow stubble tillage should be avoided. This procedure seems appropriate for avoiding oilseed rape volunteers without use of herbicides.																	0167-1987	1879-3444				JAN	2018	175						187	193		10.1016/j.still.2017.09.005							WOS:000414816800019

Molecular analysis of stomach contents reveals important grass seeds in the winter diet of Baird's and Grasshopper sparrows, two declining grassland bird species	PLOS ONE												We analyzed the diet of Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and Grasshopper Sparrow (A. savannarum) in three different sites and sampling periods across the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. DNA from seeds in regurgitated stomach contents was sequenced using NGS technology and identified with a barcoding approach using the P6 loop of the trnL intron as genetic marker. During each sampling period, we collected random soil samples to estimate seed availability in the soil seed bank. Due to the variability and size of the genetic marker, the resolution was limited to a family level resolution for taxonomic classification of seeds, but in several cases a genus level was achieved. Diets contained a high diversity of seeds but were dominated by a limited number of genera/families. Seeds from Panicoideae (from the genera Panicum, Setaria, Eriochloa, Botriochloa, and Hackelochloa) contributed for the largest part to the diets (53 +/- 19%), followed by Bouteloua (10 +/- 12%). Depending on the site and sampling period, other important seeds in the diets were Eragrostideae, Pleuraphis, Asteraceae, Verbena, and Amaranthus. The most abundant seeds were not always preferred. Aristida and Chloris were common in the soil seed bank but these seeds were avoided by both bird species. Baird's and Grasshopper sparrows did not differ in seed preferences. This work highlights the importance of range management practices that favor seed production of Panicoideae and Bouteloua grasses to enhance winter habitat use and survival of Baird's and Grasshopper sparrows in the Chihuahuan Desert.

It can play an important role in vegetation dynamics, especially in colonization processes through seed input on the vegetation and on the soil seed bank. We investigated the endozoochorous seed input of donkeys and goats on a semi-natural island ecosystem in the Mediterranean. Through germination experiments, we assessed the viable seed content of the dung of these grazing animals to estimate their suitability and efficiency for seed dispersal of the vegetation types of the island. Results: We show different dispersal patterns of donkeys and goats. Goats disperse a high number of diaspores from shrubs while donkeys disperse more diaspores of grasses. In addition, goats disperse plants of greater growth height and donkeys plants of shorter height. These dispersal patterns are in accordance with the vegetation types of which donkeys and goats disperse indicator species. Both, donkeys and goats, feed on and disperse species of the vegetation types, open grassland and temporarily wet grassland. In addition, goats feed on and disperse diagnostic species of the semi-open maquis and preforest formations. Conclusions: Overall, our results show that donkeys and goats are complementing each other in their endozoochorous seed dispersal potential. This emphasizes the importance of both grazing animals for the vegetation dynamics of the semi-natural island ecosystem. Therefore, the adaption of the goat management to a traditional land management based on directed transhumance might maintain and enrich vegetation types.																	1472-6785					DEC 19	2017	17								42	10.1186/s12898-017-0148-6							WOS:000418844900002	29258563

Wetland management strategies lead to tradeoffs in ecological structure and function	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Anthropogenic legacy effects often occur as a consequence of land use change or land management and can leave behind long-lasting changes to ecosystem structure and function. This legacy is described as a memory in the form of ecological structure or ecological interactions that remains at a location from a previous condition. We examined how forested floodplain restoration strategy, based on planting intensity, influenced wetland community structure and soil chemical and physical factors after 15 years. The site was divided into 15 strips, and strips were assigned to one of five restoration treatments: plantings of acorns, 2-year-old seedlings, 5-ft bareroot trees, balled and burlapped trees, and natural seed bank regeneration. Our community composition survey revealed that plots planted with bareroot or balled and burlapped trees developed closed tree canopies with little herbaceous understory, while acorn plantings and natural colonization plots developed into dense stands of the invasive species reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea). Restoration strategy influenced bacterial community composition but to a lesser degree compared to the plant community response, and riverine hydrology and restoration strategy influenced wetland soil conditions. Soil ammonium concentrations and pH were similar across all wetland restoration treatments, while total organic carbon was highest in forest and RCG-dominated plots compared to mixed patches of trees and open areas. The differences in restoration strategy and associated economic investment resulted in ecological tradeoffs. The upfront investment in larger, more mature trees (i.e., bareroot, balled and burlapped) led to floodplain forested communities, while cheaper, more passive planting strategies (i.e., seedlings, seedbank, or acorns) resulted in dense stands of invasive RCG, despite the similar floodplain hydrology across all sites. Therefore, recovery of multiple ecosystem services that encompass plant and microbial-derived functions will need to include additional strategies for the recovery of plants, microbes, environment, and functions.

A Case Study in Catalonia	ECONOMIC BOTANY												Crop genetic resources have been extensively collected in Europe in the last century, creating large, publicly available ex situ collections. While this huge genetic diversity is often underutilized, in recent decades, several initiatives have emerged at the local level to collect germplasm cultivated on farm. Uncoordinated actors often carry out these collecting missions without considering previously collected data. To explore whether new collecting missions are likely to be worthwhile, we studied the crop genetic resources conservation network in Catalonia by analyzing the passport data and geographical distribution of germplasm stored in seed banks. Moreover, to determine whether this germplasm was representative of the diversity cultivated on farm, we performed new collecting missions in four randomly selected areas in the European Union's Natura 2000 network and compared the results with the ex situ databases. Seed banks currently hold a large germplasm collection (2931 accessions), although most materials are conserved in private collections without regulated systems for seed regeneration and are not present as duplicates in the National Inventory. One important shortcoming of the ex situ network is that the germplasm conserved ex situ shows a low geographical coverage, representing only 35.3% of the municipalities in Catalonia. Our new missions allowed us to collect 234 accessions, mostly tomatoes (17.5%) and beans (16.2%). The ecological indicators' richness (both at species (S) and variety (V) levels), total abundance (A), and the Shannon-Weaver diversity index calculated at species (H2, considering the different accessions of each variety as a single population) and variety levels (H3, considering the intra-varietal genetic diversity) were higher in the newly collected germplasm than in the ex situ collections, suggesting that seed banks do not accurately represent the genetic diversity still cultivated on farm. Moreover, some important landraces from each area were absent or underrepresented in the ex situ collections. Thus, it is necessary to continue to devote efforts to collecting germplasm; better organization between actors and targeting specific species/varieties can increase the efficiency of new collecting missions. As a conclusion, we propose different criteria to guide new missions and to improve the network's conservation activities.

Little is known about the effect of different types of artificial grassland establishment (i.e., single- and mixed-sowing grassland establishment with perennial grasses) on soil seed bank in degraded grassland ecosystems. Single-sowing population of a high yield species usually has a great standing biomass causing shading that may inhibit germination of seeds in soil seed bank. Thus, we hypothesized that there is higher species richness and seed density in the soil seed bank of single- sowing than mixed-sowing grasslands. Here, we investigated the soil seed bank in four-year old single-sowing and mixed-sowing and control (degraded) grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We found that the autumn seed bank of mixed-sowing grasslands had lower species richness and seed density than single-sowing grasslands, while the summer soil seed bank (persistent seed bank) showed little differences. There were differences in biomass among the three grasslands (single-sowing > mixed-sowing > control), but there was no differences in species richness of vegetation. In sum, our results of the autumn seed bank support our hypothesis. Greater above-ground biomass in single-sowing grasslands could generally cause low light availability preventing seeds in soil from germinating and support more seed output, which both may indirectly or directly result in the relatively higher species richness and seed density in the soil seed bank. Our results also suggest that artificial grasslands usually returning to native grasslands in terms of production and species composition after several years is likely due to stability of the persistent soil seed bank.

Effects of wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) rooting on seedling emergence in Bialowieza Forest	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The wild boar is an omnivorous animal, and by foraging (rooting) disturbs the top soil layer. In some regions of Poland and Europe seasonal fluctuations in rooting have been observed. Wild boars not only eat plants, but also strongly modify their habitat. In Bialowieza National Park wild boar most frequently visit oak-hornbeam forests on fertile soil. On sites where the forest floor is covered with dense vegetation the germination of seeds is difficult, and wild boar rooting can promote the removal of diaspores from deeper layers of the soil seed bank. Within a 3-year observation on 30 subplots about 10,000 seedlings emerged representing 38 species. Our study revealed that rooted patches are characterised by a very rich and diverse flora of seedlings representing mostly forest species, but their density is low. The dominant species germinating in the disturbed ground vegetation is Urtica dioica, a species forming the persistent soil seed bank. There is a possibility that seedlings of herbaceous plants emerging on permanently rooted patches are of exogenous origin, since the seeds germinating there were in many cases damaged by repeatedly rooting animals and had no chance for further growth and reaching the generative phase. However, the soil seed bank in the rooted area has to be analysed to confirm this theory, that they have exogenous or endogenous origin. Seedling density in a repeatedly rooted oak-hornbeam forest is determined by factors other than those related to rooting. In this context the present study did not demonstrate a negative impact of rooting intensity on seedling emergence.

ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												One of the most tangible outcomes of climate change is change in the frequency of El Nino/La Nina events. They have a large impact on rainfall in the Western hemisphere, but their impact on tropical fauna is largely unknown. A decade long capture-mark-recapture study of the widespread Ecuadorian butterfly Nessaea hewitsoni (Felder & Felder) from an intact forest allowed us to analyze patterns of monthly and seasonal population dynamics before, during, and after an El Nino event. El Nino events did not affect long-term population size, but a 5-month delayed El Nino led to temporary emigration of females, with their subsequent return. Increased rainfall correlated with reduced survival in both sexes, but this effect was twice as strong in females. This investigation is the longest, continuous population study on any Neotropical insect species. Though we sampled on a modest scale, the magnitude of El Nino events suggests that our findings likely reflect insect population responses across a much larger portion of Amazonian forests. This study underscores the importance of analyzing multiple, interacting population parameters beyond local abundance in order to understand the biotic responses to El Nino and climate change in tropical systems. Had our analyses not included temporary emigration, no effect would have been detected because El Nino did not affect local population abundance.

IMPACT OF GRAZING ON PLANT BIODIVERSITY OF DESERT AREA OF DISTRICT KHAIRPUR, SINDH, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES												The effect of grazing on desert plant species from three distinct habitats i.e. Kot Diji sand dune, Ubhan Shah flat dune and Sorah inter-dunal area of District Khairpur was studied by using quadrat method. We analyzed each plant species for cover, total plant cover of grazed, un-grazed and mean % reduction in cover (cm) from pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The results revealed a considerable effect of grazing on plant species; however the impact of grazing varied from plant to plant and season to season, in the studied areas. There was highest grazing intensity of Indigofera species leading to endanger in this area. In all sites, maximum reduction in cover was observed in Indigofera oblongifolia and Indigofera argentea, with 62.8 and 57.2cm, respectively during pre-monsoon, and 61.5 and 52.8cm in post-monsoon. Aristida funiculata also possesses high grazing intensity with 40.3 and 54.2cm in pre and post-monsoon seasons respectively. The species Convolvulus protratus, Cassia italica, Dipterygium glaucum and Digera arvensis showed grazing intensities with 47.8, 57.4, 25.2, 42.7 in pre-monsoon season and 44.3, 35.9, 45.7,53.7 in post monsoon seasons, respectively. The low grazing intensity was observed in dominant plant communities Aerva javanica, Calligonum polygonoides, and Leptadenia pyrotechnica in a pre-monsoon season with 7.8, 17.4, 13.2cm, whereas, it was increased in post-monsoon with 11.5, 25.9, 32 in the reduction of cover (cm), respectively. These plant species were grazed by the animals at that time when ephemerals were not available in the desert during a drought period. It is suggested that partial protection and controlled grazing can be beneficial to get positive results and maintain the desert vegetation in the study area.																	1018-7081					DEC	2017	27	6					1931	1940									WOS:000417866700025

Effects of the allelopathic plant Artemisia herba-alba Asso on the soil seed bank of a semi-arid plant community	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Seed bank strongly influences composition and structure of above-ground vegetation. Little attention has been paid to the role of allelopathy driving soil seed bank dynamics, even though allelochemicals released by allelopathic plants might determine whether a species can or cannot germinate from the soil seed bank and, therefore, to co-exist in the neighborhood of the allelopathic species. Hence, the effects of allelopathic plants on community organization through the effects of allelochemicals on soil seed bank remain largely unknown. In this study, we assessed spatial heterogeneities in soil seed bank caused by the presence of allelopathic plants, and evaluated allelopathic effects on seed bank germination and seedling mortality. Methods We examined the effects of the allelopathic shrub Artemisia herba-alba Asso on the spatial structure (in terms of species richness and seed density) of the soil seed bank of a semi-arid ecosystem in NE Spain. Specifically, we evaluated seed bank richness and density at three microsites: under the canopy of A. herba-alba individuals, under the canopy of Salsola vermiculata L. (a non-allelopathic shrub) individuals, and in bare soil. In addition, we assessed the effects of aqueous extract of A. herba-alba on soil seed bank germination (seedling emergence and emergence timing) and seedling mortality. Important Findings We found that seed bank richness and density were higher under shrub canopy than they were in bare soil. A. herba-alba and S. vermiculata microsites had similar seed bank richness. However, seed bank density was higher under A. herba-alba because of the high abundance of A. herba-alba seeds. Aqueous extract reduced seedling emergence from the seed bank by 50%, and affected mortality of some emerged seedlings. On the other hand, aqueous extract did not influence the emergence timing of seedlings. We conclude that, although the presence of allelopathic plants does not cause relevant changes in seed bank structure relative to similar non-allelopathic shrubs, their presence can actually result in a reduction of seedling emergence from the seed bank, which leads to low plant species richness and density nearby. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of an allelopathic plant on the structure and germination in an entire soil seed bank.

Methods Seeds of three desert plants (Anastatica hierochuntica, Blepharis ciliaris and Scrophularia deserti) that matured in June 2014, were collected from wild plants in June and November 2014, and germinated under two photoperiods (0, 12 hours light) and three thermoperiods (night/day temperatures of 15/25, 20/30 and 25/35 degrees C). Important Findings Seeds of B. ciliaris and S. deserti had significantly higher germination percentages when harvested and stored for five months, compared to being stored in the aerial seed bank. Germination percentages of these two species increased with decreasing temperature and in the presence of light. These results indicate that these species use a combination of aerial and soil seed banks to maintain a percentage of viable seeds through favourable germination periods. Germination percentages of A. hierochuntica were high under all tested circumstances, indicating that this species relies mainly on the aerial seed bank to maintain a percentage of viable seeds through favourable germination periods. This study shows that the population survival strategies of an aerial seed bank are species-specific. These results have practical implications for conservation and habitat restoration for these species, and also for their propagation since early collection of mature fruits and ex situ storage will result in greater germination percentages of some species.

It contrasts the distinctive, future-making practices inherent in the work of ex situ cold seed storage, with the normative, entropic view of the relationship of species diversity with time that arises from the field of biodiversity conservation more generally.

Along with severe negative effects on human and animal health and crop production, it also causes harm to ecosystem functioning by reducing the native plant species biodiversity. However, its impacts on native plant species, especially in pasture communities, are less known. Given parthenium weed causes substantial losses to Australian pastures' productivity, it is crucial to estimate its impact on pasture communities. This study evaluates the impact of parthenium weed upon species diversity in a pasture community at Kilcoy, south east Queensland, Australia. Sub-sites containing three levels of parthenium weed density (i.e. high, low and zero) were chosen to quantify the above- and below-ground plant community structure. Species richness, diversity and evenness were all found to be significantly reduced as the density of parthenium weed increased; an effect was evident even when parthenium weed was present at relatively low densities (i.e. two plants m(-2)). This trend was observed in the summer season as well as in winter season when this annual weed was absent from the above-ground plant community. This demonstrates the strong impact that parthenium weed has upon the community composition and functioning throughout the year. It also shows the long-term impact of parthenium weed on the soil seed bank where it had displaced several native species. So, management options used for parthenium weed should also consider the reduction of parthenium weed seed bank along with controlling its above-ground populations.

We studied the effect of experimental N and phosphorus (P) fertilization (0, 10, 20, and 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 14 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) over the background deposition levels) on plant cover dynamics of a rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) shrubland after 8 years of nutrient addition in a semiarid Mediterranean ecosystem from Central Spain. We specifically aimed at testing whether N deposition has the potential to influence the observed expanding trend of woody vegetation into areas dominated by grassland, biological soil crusts, and bare soil. Our results show that N addition loads above 10 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) reverted the cover dynamics of shrubs. Under N addition conditions, N was no longer a limiting nutrient and other elements, especially P and calcium, determined the seasonal growth of young twigs. Interestingly, N fertilization did not inhibit the growth of young shoots; our estimates point to a reduced rosemary leaf lifespan that is driving individuals to death. This may be triggered by long-term accumulation of N compounds in leaves, suggesting the need to consider the old organs and tissues in long-lived perennial plants, where N toxicity effects could be more mediated by accumulation processes. Shrublands are a widely distributed ecosystem type in biodiverse Mediterranean landscapes, where shrubs play a key role as nurse plants. Therefore, the disappearance of shrublands may accelerate the biodiversity loss associated with other global change drivers, hamper the recruitment of seedlings of woody species, and, as a consequence, accelerate desertification.

J	Assad, R; Reshi, ZA; Jan, S; Rashid, I				Assad, Rezwana; Reshi, Zafar A.; Jan, Snober; Rashid, Irfan			Biology of Amaranths	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Amaranthus, a cosmopolitan genus including endangered species, restricted endemics and widespread weeds, is often difficult to characterize taxonomically and thus has generally been considered by systematists as a "difficult" genus. Species in this genus have high genetic variability, with diversity in growth form, plant height, number of inflorescences, seed colour, protein content, seed yield, resistance to pests and diseases, and adaptation to soil type, pH, climate, rainfall and day-length. The combination of various anatomical characteristics of Amaranthus, such as Kranz anatomy, well developed root system, stomatal conductance, and maintenance of leaf area, results in increased efficiency of using CO2 under a wide range of temperatures, and higher light intensity and moisture stress environments which enables this plant to adapt under diverse geographic and environmental conditions. Buried seeds of Amaranthus constitute an important part of the soil seed bank and position, distribution and dormancy type of these seeds in the soil play an important role in their germination and subsequent emergence, which is further influenced by factors like temperature, soil moisture, and light availability. The current review highlights the positive as well as negative role of the various species of genus Amaranthus. Many species of the genus are medicinally important and bear antiallergic, anticancer, antihypertensive and antioxidant properties, thus being used in the treatment of several aliments. Amaranthus being a rich source of fatty acids, proteins, micronutrients, vitamins and squalene, are used as cereals, dye plants, forages, medicinal plants, ornamentals, and as vegetables. However some of the Amaranthus species are noxious weeds which are known to compete with many economic crops in different parts of the world and cause great yield losses. Thus, further research is warranted to strike a balance between the beneficial and harmful species of this Pseudocereal. Moreover, understanding the weedy behaviour of these plants would provide valuable information for improving our mechanistic models of crop-weed competition and weed population dynamics.

Fruit dispersal dynamics of the cold desert shrub Zygophyllum xanthoxylon	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The pattern of seed dispersal in time and space can affect plant fitness and the soil seed bank, and thus information is needed on this aspect of the seed biology of a species before it is selected for use in habitat restoration projects. Zygophyllum xanthoxylon is a super-xerophilous shrub that is a potential pioneer species for use in revegetating highly disturbed areas of the cold deserts of northwest China. We studied fruit release and soil seed banks of Z. xanthoxylon for 3 years in two cold desert habitats characterized by different degrees of drought and wind velocity. In our study, fruit (a three-winged capsule) release began in summer (June 2010, August 2011, July 2012) and extended for 9-10 months, but plants can be found in the population with previous- and current-year fruits attached to them. More than 50% of the fruits were released in the first 3-4 months after maturity, while the others were released gradually over a 7-8 month period. The temporal pattern of fruit dispersal varied with habitat but not with amount of precipitation during summer. The pattern of fruit deposition on the soil surface was affected by neighbouring plants, wind velocity, wind direction and topography. In both habitats, >90% of the fruits were deposited beside large and small clusters of plants, mainly Ephedra przewalskii. To facilitate plant community development, we suggest that E. przewalskii should be planted (as a wind break) together with Z. xanthoxylon when native pioneer species are used for restoration of cold desert shrublands.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				DEC	2017	27	4					303	310		10.1017/S0960258517000253							WOS:000415851400006

Longevity, dormancy and germination of Cyanus segetum	WEED RESEARCH												Cyanus segetum is an iconic, colourful weed in arable fields that provides ecological and societal services. To understand better both the infestation dynamics of C.segetum as an abundant, harmful weed and maintain sustainable populations where it provides beneficial services, we compared information on seed dormancy, seed longevity and germination conditions in two populations. Persistence of seeds buried in the soil was low, with <10% viable after 3years. Periodic dormancy cycling was observed over the 4years in the soil, with a maximum of dormant seeds in the spring and a minimum in the autumn; however, 20% of the seeds were non-dormant all the time. Seeds of C.segetum were positive photosensitive, but light requirement varied among populations. Base water potential for germination was -1MPa. Base temperature ranged from 1 to 2 degrees C. Optimum temperature for germination was about 10 to 15 degrees C, but the mean thermal time varied greatly between populations, from 80 to 134day degrees C. Photoperiod and temperature combinations had no effect on germination percentage, but both reduced the germination rate. Burial deeper than 2cm greatly reduced germination and seedling emergence strongly decreased at depths >0.5cm. No seeds buried deeper than 8cm emerged. Low seed longevity and a wide range of germination conditions could partly explain the rapid disappearance of C.segetum populations after herbicide application began in western Europe. However, yearly sowing in restoration areas does not seem to be essential.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				DEC	2017	57	6					361	371		10.1111/wre.12267							WOS:000415696400002

Species and functional trait re-assembly of ground beetle communities in restored grasslands	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Ecosystem restoration provides unique opportunities to study community dynamics under succession and can reveal how consumer communities re-assemble and respond to successional changes. Studying community dynamics from both taxonomic and functional trait perspectives also may provide more robust assessments of restoration progress or success and allow cross-system comparisons. We studied ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) communities for three years in a restored grassland chronosequence with sites from 0 to 28 years old. We measured traditional community metrics (abundance, richness, Shannon diversity) and functional trait metrics based on species' body length, wing morphology, activity time, phenology, and diet. Communities had high species richness and abundance in early successional stages, but these declined in later stages to low levels comparable to an adjacent grassland remnant. Species composition also shifted with time, converging with the remnant. Although functional richness, like species richness, declined as succession progressed, functional divergence quickly increased and was maintained over time, suggesting niche differentiation in established communities. Young sites were typified by small, macropterous, phytophagous species, while older sites contained larger species more likely to be flightless and carnivorous. Prescribed burns also affected traits, decreasing prevalence of larger species. This study demonstrates that functionally diverse consumer communities can self-assemble under restoration practices. In a relatively short amount of time both morphological and trophic level diversity are established. However, prescribed fire intended to control non-desirable plants may also shape beetle community functional composition, and restoration managers should consider if plant community benefits of fire outweigh potential declines in consumer function.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				DEC	2017	26	14					3481	3498		10.1007/s10531-017-1417-6							WOS:000415281600014

Plant traits of propagule banks and standing vegetation reveal flooding alleviates impacts of agriculture on wetland restoration	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Restoration of degraded plant communities requires understanding of community assembly processes. Human land use can influence plant community assembly by altering environmental conditions and species' dispersal patterns. Flooding, including from environmental flows, may counteract land use effects on wetland vegetation. We examined the influence of land use history and flood frequency on the functional composition of wetland plant communities along a regulated river. 2. We applied fourth corner modelling to determine species' trait-based responses to flooding and land use by combining data on (i) the occupancy and abundance of species in propagule banks and standing vegetation, (ii) species traits, and (iii) environmental conditions of 22 standing vegetation and 108 soil propagule bank study sites. We used analysis of deviance to test how well each dataset characterised trait-environment interactions, and generalised linear models to identify traits related to species' responses. 3. The occupancy and abundance of native species in the propagule bank and standing vegetation increased with flood frequency and decreased with duration of agricultural land use. Species in standing vegetation with water-borne propagule dispersal (hydrochory) showed similar trends. In contrast, species with higher specific leaf area were associated with longer land use duration. 4. Identifying trait-based differences in the propagule bank and standing vegetation can help disentangle effects of dispersal and environmental filters. The occupancy and abundance of hydrochorous species in standing vegetation were negatively related to land use duration, but hydrochorous species were positively related to land use duration based on their abundance in the propagule bank. This suggests that land use does not limit plant dispersal, but acts as an insitu abiotic filter, limiting species present in standing vegetation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Land use duration and flood frequency have opposite effects on plant community traits in floodplain wetlands of the Macquarie Marshes, Australia. Legacies of agriculture can impede restoration of plant communities. Environmental flows that increase flooding may alleviate these impacts, especially in areas that have been used for agriculture for over 20years, by providing dispersal and environmental filters that favour native wetland species. More flooding will likely be required to restore floodplains with longer histories of agricultural land use compared to floodplains less impacted by agriculture.

J	O'Donnell, K; Sharrock, S				O'Donnell, Katherine; Sharrock, Suzanne			The contribution of botanic gardens to ex situ conservation through seed banking	PLANT DIVERSITY												Target 8 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation calls for 'at least 75 per cent of threatened plant species in ex situ collections, preferably in the country of origin, and at least 20 per cent available for recovery and restoration programmes by 2020'. Botanic gardens make a significant contribution to ex situ conservation of wild species with more than a third of plant species represented in botanic gardens collections. These collections are a combination of living collection and seed banked material. Seed banking can provide an efficient form of conservation for wild plant genetic diversity. Information from Botanic Gardens Conservation International's (BGCI) databases (GardenSearch, PlantSearch, ThreatSearch and GlobalTreeSearch) has been analysed as well as survey data to report on global, regional and national seed banking trends. Information from BGCI's databases indicates that there are at least 350 seed banking botanic gardens in 74 countries. In total 56,987 taxa have been banked including more than 9000 taxa that are threatened with extinction. 6881 tree species are stored in ex situ seed bank collections. More than half (3562) of these tree species are single country endemics and represent species from more than 166 countries. This study suggests that institutions are increasingly conserving plant species via seed banking. However the majority of species in collections that have a conservation assessment are not threatened with extinction. This disjunction between species that are threatened and those conserved in seed banks needs to be addressed. Data from BGCI's databases can be used to enable prioritisation of threatened plant species for collection and conservation in seed banks. Further recommendations for botanic gardens involved in seed conservation are presented. Copyright (C) 2017 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Paniw, M; Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Ojeda, F; Salguero-Gomez, R				Paniw, Maria; Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F.; Ojeda, Fernando; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto			Interacting livestock and fire may both threaten and increase viability of a fire-adapted Mediterranean carnivorous plant	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Quantifying interactive effects of environmental drivers on population dynamics can be critical for a robust analysis of population viability. Fire regimes, among the most widespread disturbances driving population dynamics, are increasingly modified by and interact with human activities. However, viability of fire-adapted species is typically assessed overlooking disturbance interactions, potentially resulting in suboptimal management actions. 2. We investigated whether increasing human disturbances in fire-prone ecosystems may pose a threat or an opportunity to improve population viability, using demographic data of the carnivorous, post-fire recruiting plant Drosophyllum lusitanicum, endemic to heathlands in the southwestern Mediterranean Basin. We built integral projection models and simulated population dynamics under different combinations of two key disturbance types affecting populations: fire and livestock browsing and trampling. We used perturbation analyses to determine potential long-term consequences of maintaining fundamentally different disturbance types. 3. Despite most populations inhabiting browsed habitats, simulations showed a greater extinction risk in populations under high livestock pressure compared with ones under low or moderate pressures. Extinction risk decreased when fire return intervals shortened in populations under low or moderate livestock pressure; however, the opposite pattern emerged in heavily browsed populations, where short intervals between fires increased extinction. 4. Elasticity analyses showed that decreases in viability under frequent disturbance interactions (heavy browsing and frequent fire) may be explained by selection against seed dormancy in populations with frequent browsing and trampling. This may potentially cause populations to collapse when fires kill above-ground plants without populations being able to recover from a seed bank. 5. Synthesis and applications. Incorporating disturbance interactions can result in a different assessment of viability of a fire-adapted species than considering fire regimes alone. In Mediterranean ecosystems, fire management may be more effective when integrating moderate human activities. However, replacing fires by human disturbances, a currently widespread strategy in many fire-prone ecosystems, is not recommended since it may fundamentally alter population dynamics and selection pressures and decrease viability of fire-adapted species.

In situ germination of two tropical recalcitrant seeds and changes in activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Tropical recalcitrant-seeded species, which disperse seeds at different seasons, provide evidence of the role of oxidative metabolism in seed bank dynamics. Our results indicate that CAT may regulate field germination. Oxidative metabolism during viability loss in recalcitrant seeds has been previously documented, but little is known about the role of ROS-scavenging enzymes in soil seed bank dynamics, especially in recalcitrant seeds. To address this, recalcitrant-seeded species were studied, Swartzia langsdorffii and Persea wildenovii. Diaspores were kept on the soil after natural dispersion, to simulate the seed bank, and were assessed for seed water content, viability, germination and changes in catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (PRX) activity throughout the field experiment. These parameters were tested for correlations with climatic data. S. langsdorffii start to germinate after one month in soil, with an increase after two months, when CAT activity decreased and SOD activity increased. SOD was negatively correlated with CAT, and CAT was negatively correlated with germination. However, SOD and CAT were positively correlated for P. wildenovii, whose seeds did not germinate even after four months in the soil and with high activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes throughout the period in the soil. Seeds of these species remained viable during the period in the soil with no or little changes in seed water content. ROS-scavenging enzymes respond to environmental factors, adjusting their activity to maintain seed viability. P. wildenovii seeds did not germinate in the soil due to the timing of dispersal being at the end of rainy season, when additional water supply is limited; ROS-scavenging enzymes probably play a role in seed protection during this dry period. Relationship between CAT regulation and soil seed bank dynamics is discussed.

Response of aquatic vegetation communities and other wetland cover types to floodplain restoration at Emiquon Preserve	HYDROBIOLOGIA												More than half of the natural wetlands in the Illinois River valley (IRV) have been lost through conversion of floodplain wetlands and lakes to drainage and levee districts for agricultural production. During 2007-2013, we monitored the response of wetland vegetation communities to restoration at Emiquon Preserve, a former floodplain that was drained and farmed for more than 80 years. Spatial coverage of wetland vegetation and other cover types rapidly expanded from 252 ha in 2007 to 1,944 ha in 2013 (mean 1,512 +/- 239 ha) with little supplemental planting or hydrological management. Restored vegetation emulated aquatic plant communities that were largely eliminated from the IRV, most importantly floating-leaved and submersed aquatic vegetation. Mean annual wetland cover included aquatic bed (44%), open water (20%), persistent emergent vegetation (10%), hemi-marsh (10%), and nonpersistent emergent vegetation (9%). Average moist-soil seed and tuber density was similar to managed wetlands in the IRV (mean 724 +/- 224 kg/ha). A viable option for restoration of diverse aquatic macrophyte communities within degraded wetlands of large river systems includes passive restoration of hydrology and vegetation behind levees while maintaining infrastructure to facilitate drawdowns when necessary or to mimic historical conditions.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2017	804	1					59	71		10.1007/s10750-016-2893-5							WOS:000414375700004

Gibberellic and kaurenoic hybrid strigolactone mimics for seed germination of parasitic weeds	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUNDParasitic weeds are widespread and cause significant losses in important crops. Their germination requires the detection of crop-derived molecules such as strigolactones. Strigolactone mimics are germination-inducing molecules with the potential to apply a suicidal germination strategy for seed bank control of parasitic weeds. RESULTSThe D-ring, which is instrumental in the germination process of seeds of parasitic weeds, was attached to gibberellin (GA(3)) and kaurenoic acid as the scaffold. It was shown that indeed strigolactone mimics prepared from GA(3) and kaurenoic acid are active as stimulants when a D-ring is present; some of the mimics are as active as GR24. CONCLUSIONSThe starting molecules were plant hormones that had previous growth-regulating activity in other organisms and the products showed enhanced activity towards parasitic weeds. The information generated may contribute to a better understanding of the germination biochemistry of the weed species used. Further research is required in this area but it is clear that the results are promising.

In order to characterize the seed bank in plots invaded by A. dealbata and to understand its implications for management and re-invasion risk, density, germinability, and viability of the seed bank were evaluated in five sites in central Portugal. Soil samples were collected in A. dealbata invaded plots and adjacent areas and screened for seeds, which were then quantified and germinated at 25 A degrees C. A subset of seeds was first exposed to 60 A degrees C to assess the effect of high soil temperature on dormancy breaking. Variables influencing differences between sites were explored with generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution. Inside A. dealbata invaded plots the seed bank averaged 4608 seeds/m(2), reaching up to 62,747 seeds/m(2); in adjacent areas, up to 14 m from the plots, only 9 seeds/m(2) were found. Seed bank densities were mostly influenced by stoniness, number of fires in the last 10 years, and density of trees and roots. Almost 90% of seeds were viable, but only 8.6% germinated without treatment. Nearly 70% of seeds exposed to 60 A degrees C germinated without any physical stimulation, suggesting that high soil temperatures can effectively break seed dormancy. The high density and viability of A. dealbata's seed bank and its ability to disperse seeds far from the parent plants contribute to the species' invasive success. These features combined with heat events that can overcome seed dormancy need to be considered in the management of this species.

Mechanisms of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) invasion and their management implications - A review	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Ecosystems are under increasing stress from environmental change, including invasion by non-native species that can disrupt ecological processes and functions. Chinese tallow [Triadica sebifera (L.) Small] is a highly invasive tree species in southeastern US forests, prairies, and wetlands, and effectively managing this invasive species is a significant challenge for scientists and land managers. In this review, we synthesize the literature on invasion ecology and management of Chinese tallow. Our review suggests that the invaded range of Chinese tallow is currently limited by dispersal in many areas and by low temperatures and low soil moisture, and by high soil salinity and frequent flooding in others, but these barriers may be overcome by increased dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, and/or rapid evolution. Invasions by Chinese tallow are facilitated by both the invasiveness of the species and the invasibility of the recipient communities. Invasiveness of Chinese tallow has been attributed to fast growth, high fecundity, a persistent seed bank, aggressive resprouting, abiotic stress tolerance, and the ability to transform fire maintained ecosystems. Some of these traits may be enhanced in invasive populations. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances, lack of herbivore pressure, and facilitation by soil microbes enhance the intensity of Chinese tallow invasions. Biological control of Chinese tallow is being developed. Treatments such as herbicides, prescribed fire, and mechanical control can effectively control Chinese tallow at the local scale. A combination of these treatments improves results. However, a proactive management approach would simultaneously achieve invasion control and promote subsequent ecological restoration, especially in the context of legacy effects, secondary invasions, and/or variable ecosystem responses to different control treatments. Future research should clarify the roles of species invasiveness and community invasibility, increase our understanding of the effects of Chinese tallow in invaded communities, and develop viable management regimes that are effective in both controlling or reducing the probability of Chinese tallow invasion and restoring desired native communities.

Seed desiccation tolerance and dispersal in tropical dry forests in Colombia: Implications for ecological restoration	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The widely documented loss of tropical dry forests (TDFs) is a consequence of multiple and complex causes. The conservation status of Colombian TDFs is critical; currently, these forests only occupy eight percent of their original cover. Evidence shows that TDFs have a low probability of natural regeneration and may require ecological restoration. Seeds are central to the existence, permanence, and dynamics of plant communities in forests. Seeds exhibit a varied set of traits that exerts control on plant communities by limiting or facilitating plant establishment. According to previous research, in TDFs, most seeds are small, dry, and wind-dispersed, with a high drought tolerance (orthodox storage behavior). In this study, available information on the fruits and seeds of tree species distributed in Colombian TDFs was synthesized. Twelve Colombia TDFs datasets were selected, which included species' individual occurrences and diameters at breast height. For each TDF, the most important species were selected, and the literature was searched for their seed storage behaviors, dispersal syndromes, and general fruit and seed attributes. In contrast to initial expectations, the search results suggested that the most common dispersal syndrome of the most important species was animal dispersal, followed by wind dispersal. Thirty-nine species were found that were not currently naturally established and should be introduced by active restoration. Most of these species had capsule and drupe fruits. The most common dispersal syndrome was animal dispersal, and the most common seed storage behavior was orthodox. Dominance of animal-dispersed species exacerbates fragmentation and habitat loss in TDFs, making available niches difficult to colonize and reducing the ability of seeds to reach degraded sites. Orthodox germination of seeds can facilitate seed storage in ex situ germoplasm banks to overcome low seed availability and/or forest soil seed bank.																	0378-1127	1872-7042				NOV 15	2017	404						289	293		10.1016/j.foreco.2017.08.042							WOS:000413384000028

Seed dormancy and germination of Halophila ovalis mediated by simulated seasonal temperature changes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The seagrass, Halophila ovalis plays an important ecological and sediment stability role in estuarine systems in Australia with the species in decline in many sites. Halophila ovalis is a facultative annual, relying mainly on recruitment from the sediment seed bank for the annual regeneration of meadows. Despite this, there is little understanding of seed dormancy releasing mechanisms and germination cues. Using H. ovalis seed from the warm temperate Swan River Estuary in Western Australia, the germination ecology of H. ovalis was investigated by simulating the natural seasonal variation in water temperatures. The proportion of germinating seeds was found to be significantly different among temperature treatments (p < 0.001). The treatment with the longest period of cold exposure at 15 degrees C followed by an increase in temperature to 20-25 degrees C (i.e. cold stratification) had the highest final mean germination of 32% and the fastest, germination rate. Seeds exposed to constant mean winter temperatures of 15 degrees C had the slowest germination rate with less than two seeds germinating over 118 days. Thus temperature is a key germination cue for H. ovalis seeds and these data infer that cold stratification is an important dormancy releasing mechanism. This finding has implications for recruitment in facultative annual species like H. ovalis under global warming since the trend for increasing water temperatures in the region may limit seed -based recruitment in the future.

J	Heydari, M; Omidipour, R; Abedi, M; Baskin, C				Heydari, Mehdi; Omidipour, Reza; Abedi, Mehdi; Baskin, Carol			Effects of fire disturbance on alpha and beta diversity and on beta diversity components of soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Although an understanding of the effects of fire severity on diversity components of the soil seed bank (SSB) and aboveground vegetation (AGV) is important to inform conservation and restoration practices of biodiversity, the effects of fire severity on alpha- and beta-diversity of SSB and AGV are poorly understood. While beta-diversity is shaped by spatial turnover and nestedness, research on the effects of fire severity on these components of beta-diversity is limited. We aimed to determine the effects of low and high fire severity on species richness and alpha- (within sample) and beta-(among sample) diversity components on the relationship between the SSB and AGV. Since turnover and nestedness are components of beta-diversity, we assessed their patterns of change after different fire intensities in the SSB and AGV. Methods - Soil seed bank samples were collected from the same 180 sample points used for measurement of AGV in semi-arid Quercus persica woodlands. Additive partitioning diversity was used to divide total diversity into a- and beta-diversity of the SSB and the AGV. Total beta-diversity of the SSB and AGV was additively partitioned into spatial turnover and nestedness. Key results - Fire severity had significant effects on alpha- and beta- diversity of both the SSB and AGV. The highest and lowest richness and alpha- and beta-diversity in both the SSB and AGV were found in low and high severity fire sites, respectively. Partitioning beta- diversity of the SSB and the AGV into turnover and nestedness components revealed that spatial turnover was the main contributor to beta-diversity. High fire severity significantly increased similarity between SSB and AGV. Conclusions - Low, but not high, severity fire can increase species diversity in the AGV and SSB, and it has the potential to serve as a tool for management and restoration of semi-arid Mediterranean regions, thereby enhancing plant diversity and structural heterogeneity. However, high severity fire may lead to loss of many species in both the SSB and the AGV resulting in loss of biodiversity.

Assessment of Large Seed Banks Requirement for Drought Risk Management in South Asia	SUSTAINABILITY												Agriculture in South Asia is largely dependent on rainfall, where about two-thirds of the cultivable lands lack irrigation facilities. In recent years, increasing frequency and severity of droughts have had a severe impact on rainfed agriculture and livelihood of millions of farmers in the region. There are numerous drought adaptation and mitigation options available for rainfed agriculture. A seed bank is one of those options that can play an important role in minimizing the effect of droughts on crop production. This paper assesses the need for seed banks in rainfed/partially irrigated areas of South Asia for the purpose of drought risk management. The need for additional seeds of the main crops or suitable alternative crops for re-sowing/planting after drought-induced losses of the main crop was assessed by using long-term gridded rainfall data and crop information. Results show that very limited rainfed areas in South Asia require additional seeds of main or alternative crops for drought risk management once in five to seven years' drought return period. About 90 percent of such areas in South Asia may require additional seeds for drought risk management once in 10 years or more. The timing and severity of droughts during cropping season and cost/benefits of seed bank maintenance play a major role in choosing additional seeds for the main crops and/or alternate crops for maintenance in the large seed banks. This study shows that, despite the large investment requirement, maintenance of large seed banks for drought risks management is economically viable for the limited areas in South Asia.

Precipitation and topsoil attributes determine the species diversity and distribution patterns of crustal communities in desert ecosystems	PLANT AND SOIL												Despite the important role of biological soil crusts in desert ecosystems, the responses of the crustal composition and distribution to changes in both climatic and edaphic factors at different spatial scales are not well understood. The goal of our research was to study the drivers of crustal community diversity at different scales, determine how crustal diversity and distribution patterns are related to abiotic and biotic factors, and identify the characteristics of crustal communities along a precipitation gradient. We investigated the distribution and characteristics of crustal communities based on 457 soil samples that were randomly collected from six desert regions of northern China. These regions represent a precipitation gradient from 450 mm in the east to 80-100 mm in the west. The measured environmental variables included soil moisture, pH, clay and silt content, soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, total P, total K, CaCO3 content, annual and perennial plant cover and crustal variables, including species richness, crustal cover and biomass. An ANOVA analysis, a stepwise regression and a redundancy analysis were used to analyse and interpret the response of biological soil crusts to environmental factors at two spatial scales. Our results showed that the moss distribution and biomass were strongly related to the topsoil moisture content. The highest diversity of cyanobacteria and algae was observed at sites with relatively dry topsoil, and lichen diversity was promoted at sites with fine-textured soils. In addition, the cover and biomass of moss were positively correlated with perennial plant cover and higher topsoil moisture, which was expected because plant cover provides shade for the moss. The cover and biomass of lichens, cyanobacteria and algae were positively correlated with that of annual plants because these plants may create an ideal habitat and provide nutrients. The physiochemical properties of the topsoil greatly influenced the distribution pattern of the crustal communities at the regional scale. The species richness and biomass of the crustal mosses were positively correlated with precipitation, whereas the species richness and biomass of cyanobacteria and algae were negatively correlated with precipitation at the landscape scale. Rainfall largely determined the species richness and cover of the crustal cyanobacteria and mosses, whereas soil properties had a greater impact on the crustal lichens. Future changes to rainfall regimes could result in the conversion of biological soil crusts and further contribute to changes in the structure and functioning of desert ecosystems.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				NOV	2017	420	1-2					163	175		10.1007/s11104-017-3385-8							WOS:000416861200012

The impact of pine plantations on fynbos above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank composition	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Pine plantations and pine invasions have numerous impacts on native ecosystems in the Fynbos biome of South Africa. The severity of these impacts greatly determines the extent of potential ecosystem recovery after the pines are felled. The recovery potential of fynbos after felling of pine plantations of varying longevity and the subsequent application of ecological burns was investigated in the Helderberg Nature Reserve, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Above-ground vegetation, soil seed bank and abiotic variables were sampled across three treatments (reference fynbos and sites that had been under pines for 30 and 50 years respectively) using 1 m(2) quadrats placed along 50 m line transects. The soil seed bank samples were smoke treated and then monitored in a greenhouse to determine the soil seed bank species and growth form composition. Areas previously under 30 year old pine plantations had high native species and growth form density (number of species/growth forms per unit area) and similar plant density (number of individuals per unit area) to the reference fynbos areas. Conversely, areas previously under 50 year old pine plantations had significantly lower native species and growth form density and plant density than the reference fynbos and were dominated by alien species. In addition, areas previously under 50 year old pine plantations had lower species diversity than the reference fynbos areas and areas previously under 30 year old pine plantations which were found to be similar to one another. Felled pine plantations were shown to minimally impact on soil abiotic variables, with only soil temperature and pH showing significant differences. Therefore, areas previously under 30 year old pine plantations have higher recovery potential following pine removal than 50 year old plantations, owing to the depleted native soil seed bank in the latter. Consequently, active restoration may be needed to re-introduce the missing long-lived growth forms and to prevent soil erosion. Pine plantation and invasion management in the Fynbos biome should aim to fell pines before the native seed bank is depleted to maintain the recovery potential of fynbos and prevent the need for active restoration.

Diet switching of seed-eating birds wintering in grazed habitats of the central Monte Desert, Argentina	CONDOR												Although bird population declines associated with land degradation are common, the initial response of organisms to rapid human-induced environmental change is usually behavioral. Reductions in seed availability due to cattle grazing may trigger diet switching in seed-eating birds, but empirical examples of such behavior are lacking. We asked whether cattle grazing changed the composition and reduced the size of seed reserves, and whether seed shortage caused diet shifts in 4 species of seed-eating birds wintering in the central Monte Desert, Argentina. We assessed the soil seed bank composition and the granivorous fraction of each species' diet. Digestive tract or crop contents were obtained by using the flushing method on individuals captured with mist nets, and seeds were sorted and assigned to 1 of 3 functional groups (small grass seeds, large and medium-sized grass seeds, or forb seeds). Cattle grazing reduced the abundance of the preferred large and medium-sized grass seeds by 60-90%. The grass-seed specialists Many colored Chaco Finch (Saltatricula multicolor) and Ringed Warbling-Finch (Microspingus torquatus) did not change their diets in grazed areas, but the expanding specialists Common Diuca-Finch (Diuca diuca) and Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) incorporated increased proportions of small grass seeds as well as forb seeds into their diets. These results were correctly predicted from species-specific differences in feeding flexibility previously established in cafeteria experiments. Based on species-specific diet composition, the energy reward of seeds by unit mass consumed decreased moderately (5-21%) in the grazed sites for S. multicolor, M. torquatus, and D. diuca. Starch content was similar between grazing conditions for all 3 birds. Although such deficits might be compensated for by a slight increase in absolute mass of seeds or alternative food items consumed in degraded lands, substantial reduction in the availability of grass seeds may reduce the capacity of degraded lands to support specialist granivorous birds.																	0010-5422	1938-5129				NOV	2017	119	4					673	682		10.1650/CONDOR-17-61.1							WOS:000415752200003

Climatic control of seed longevity of Silene during the post-zygotic phase: do seeds from warm, dry climates possess higher maturity and desiccation tolerance than seeds from cold, wet climates?	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Seed longevity derived from artificial ageing experiments has been shown to be related to the macroclimate at the sampling site and with individual seed traits. Nevertheless, the ecological interpretation of artificial seed longevity remains to be clarified. In this article, the ecological significance of seed longevity expressed by the p(50) index was explored using 16 closely related populations of the genus Silene L. Seeds were subjected to an artificial ageing treatment at 45 degrees C, 60% relative humidity and regularly tested for germination. The decline of viability to 50% (p(50) index) was calculated using probit analysis. Its relationship with known ecological predictors of seed longevity was assessed by multiple regression analysis. Values of p(50) ranged from 3.7 to 68.3 days. Seed lots which normally experience drought during the post-zygotic phase in a dry, warm environment, were long-lived. Consistently, precipitation during the driest months of the reproductive period was the strongest predictor of p(50) variability (partial regression, R-2 = 0.424). We could not find any relationship between ex situ seed longevity and soil seed bank formation or seed size. Our results indicate that ex situ seed longevity has an ecological significance related to long-term climatic differences at population site. Increased longevity presumably reflects resistance to desiccation stress attained by seeds through local adaptation to warm, dry climates. We cannot exclude that seed tolerance to ageing could also represent phenotypic plasticity mediated by a drier maturation environment. The vulnerability of seeds from wet, cool climates and the adaptive response of seed longevity to different environments may have implications for ex situ conservation in the face of climate warming.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2017	32	6					983	994		10.1007/s11284-017-1508-6							WOS:000415248500023

The results showed the soil seed banks were composed of 44, 43, and 50 herbaceous species, and an average seed density of 9418.79 +/- 804.92, 4283.44 +/- 427.89, 6539.28 +/- 432.22 seeds/m(2), respectively. The soil seed bank was mainly composed of annual and perennial herbaceous plants. Most of the dominant species of soil seed banks came from introduced species. Reverse seasonal flooding induced the spatial variation of species diversity and seed density of the soil seed bank. The species diversity in the upper part of the draw-down zone was higher than that in the middle and lower parts. The highest seed density occurred in the middle upper parts of the draw-down zone, followed by the lower part. The similarity coefficient between the soil seed bank and the extant vegetation community was 0.495, 0.526, and 0.550 at Zigui, Wanzhou, and Zhongxian restoration sites, respectively.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2017	32	6					1011	1021		10.1007/s11284-017-1518-4							WOS:000415248500026						
J	Morimoto, J; Shibata, M; Shida, Y; Nakamura, F				Morimoto, Junko; Shibata, Masatoshi; Shida, Yuichiro; Nakamura, Futoshi			Wetland restoration by natural succession in abandoned pastures with a degraded soil seed bank	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Natural restoration of historical wetland plant communities in fallow fields with a degraded seed bank has been assumed to be possible only if source populations of the target species are present adjacent to the abandoned fields and a high density of suitable microsites is available. However, few studies have monitored both factors simultaneously and verified this assumption. We hypothesized that plant communities that are similar to historical wetlands, including back marshes, back swamps, and bogs, will reestablish in abandoned pasturelands in cases when (1) gaps for new recruitment emerge, followed by the decline of pastures; and (2) seeds with longevity are supplied from the surrounding remnant plant communities of wetlands. We conducted a survey of vegetation and microsites in pastures, abandoned pastures, and reference wetlands followed by structural equation modeling to verify our hypothesis for the natural restoration of Phragmites australis-Phalaris arundinacea and Alnus japonica-Spiraea salicifolia communities. These communities represent historical back marshes and back swamps along a river. However, our hypothesis was not verified for the natural restoration of Vaccinium oxycoccos-Sphagnum spp. communities, which represent plant communities in historical bogs grown on acidic peat that are maintained by rainfall and fog. Our findings partly support our hypothesis that decline in pastures creates gaps and that cumulative seed dispersal from nearby remnant wetlands allows the original wetland plant communities to regenerate. Further case studies are needed to determine how the natural restoration of bog plant communities occurs.

Will the same ex situ protocols give similar results for closely related species?	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Conservation of imperiled plant species often requires ex situ (offsite) living collections. Protocols for developing these collections most often emphasize sampling depth, but little is known about the genetics of such collections. This study compares how well a single collecting protocol can capture the diversity in wild populations of two closely related species. We selected two exemplar species, bay rush (Zamia lucayana) and sinkhole cycad (Zamia decumbens), based on similarities and differences that allow for rigorous comparison, including geographic isolation and reproductive factors. For each species, we compared in situ plants to ex situ plants via the same panel of 10 microsatellite markers. Genetic distance analysis shows high fidelity of the ex situ collections to their in situ source populations and sub-populations. Structured resampling of allele capture from the in situ populations by the ex situ collections shows that allele capture increases as number of ex situ plants maintained increases, but with a diminishing rate of increase. Difference in the rate of allele capture between the two species was significant at the alpha = 0.1 level, (p = 0.097) but not at the alpha = 0.05 level. At larger collection sizes, the difference in rate of allele capture showed a high practical significance (d = 5.41). These data illustrate that a unified collecting protocol can achieve similar allele capture among related species, but also that geographic and reproductive factors can influence the rate of allele capture.

J	Jabot, F; Pottier, J				Jabot, Franck; Pottier, Julien			Macroecology of seed banks: The role of biogeography, environmental stochasticity and sampling	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: The study of seed banks has been mainly conducted at local scales, thereby hampering our general understanding of the assembly processes of these biodiversity reservoirs. Here, we aim to document worldwide macroecological patterns of seed bank diversity and of their similarity with aboveground vegetation. Our second aim is to investigate the likely drivers of these macroecological patterns and to lay the foundation of a metacommunity theory of seed banks. Location: Worldwide. Time period: 1989-2005. Major taxa: studied Plants. Methods: We compiled a worldwide dataset of 130 seed banks located in grasslands. We assessed the likely drivers of seed bank diversity and similarity with aboveground vegetation, using structural equation modelling. We then developed a time-averaged neutral model of coupled seed bank-vegetation (S-V) dynamics that includes the effect of environmental stochasticity, and we compared its predictions with empirical findings. Results: We found evidence for two weak latitudinal gradients in seed bank diversity and S-V similarity, with larger species richness and smaller similarity closer to the tropics. We then showed that seed bank richness and S-V similarity are correlated with the following four distinct drivers: local environmental variability, plant regional diversity, seed bank density and sampling area. Finally, we showed that the predictions of the time-averaged neutral model are remarkably in accord with empirical observations. Main conclusions: Our results lay the foundations of a metacommunity theory for seed banks. They challenge the standard view that seed banks are principally structured by environmental variability, by highlighting the additional key roles of dispersal and stochastic sampling on seed bank diversity patterns.

J	Luo, YQ; Zhao, XY; Li, YQ; Wang, T				Luo, Yongqing; Zhao, Xueyong; Li, Yuqiang; Wang, Tao			Effects of foliage litter of a pioneer shrub (Artemisia halodendron) on germination from the soil seedbank in a semi-arid sandy grassland in China	JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH												Vegetation recovery during succession is an important process for ecological restoration of the soil, especially in degraded sandy land. However, the driving mechanisms, such as how a pioneer species competes with other species, is uncertain. In China's Horqin Sandy Land, Artemisia halodendron is an important shrub that is common on semi-fixed dunes, where it replaces Agriophyllum squarrosum during succession, and is an important indicator species of the second stage of dune stabilization. However, how it outcompetes other species is still unclear. In this study, we conducted a seed bank germination experiment using soil from the native habitats of A. halodendron on semi-fixed dunes. We covered the soil with foliage litter of A. halodendron at a range of concentrations. Seed germination and seedling growth were strongly affected by the foliage litter. Seed germination and seedling growth were not harmed by a low concentration (ae50 g m(-2)) of the foliage litter but severely inhibited by high concentrations (ae100 g m(-2)). Strong allelopathy, indicated by decreased germination, increased seedling loss, and decreased plant biomass, appeared during the later stages of germination (after about 20 days of incubation). Our results suggest that as a pioneer shrub during the vegetation succession that occurs during dune stabilization, A. halodendron outcompeted other species through the allelopathic effect of its foliage litter. This helps to explain the patchy distribution and heterogeneity of vegetation communities in the Horqin Sandy Land.

Ecological longevity of Polaskia chende (Cactaceae) seeds in the soil seed bank, seedling emergence and survival	PLANT BIOLOGY												Soil seed banks are essential elements of plant population dynamics, enabling species to maintain genetic variability, withstand periods of adversity and persist over time, including for cactus species. However knowledge of the soil seed bank in cacti is scanty. In this study, over a 5-year period we studied the seed bank dynamics, seedling emergence and nurse plant facilitation of Polaskia chende, an endemic columnar cactus of central Mexico.P.chende seeds were collected for a wild population in Puebla, Mexico. Freshly collected seeds were sown at 25 degrees C and 12-h photoperiod under white light, far-red light and darkness. The collected seeds were divided in two lots, the first was stored in the laboratory and the second was use to bury seeds in open areas and beneath a shrub canopy. Seeds were exhumed periodically over 5years. At the same time seeds were sown in open areas and beneath shrub canopies; seedling emergence and survival were recorded over different periods of time for 5years. The species forms long-term persistent soil seed banks. The timing of seedling emergence via germination in the field was regulated by interaction between light, temperature and soil moisture. Seeds entered secondary dormancy at specific times according to the expression of environmental factors, demonstrating irregular dormancy cycling. Seedling survival of P.chende was improved under Acacia constricta nurse plants. Finally, plant facilitation affected the soil seed bank dynamics as it promoted the formation of a soil seed bank, but not its persistence.																	1435-8603	1438-8677				NOV	2017	19	6					973	982		10.1111/plb.12611							WOS:000413524000014	28787550

Interplay of water quality and vegetation in restored wetland plant assemblages from an agricultural landscape	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality degradation from excessive fertilizer use and runoff is a worldwide problem. While this degradation impacts wetlands, these systems can also be a vehicle for water quality improvement. Restoration of wetlands in agricultural landscapes has recently increased, but little work has evaluated the relationship of plant assemblages and water quality parameters in restored, non-treatment wetlands. This study examines the impact of self-designed wetland plant assemblages on nitrogen and sediment dynamics. Thirty mesocosms were seeded with soil from restored wetlands and allowed to develop from the seed bank to emergent assemblages. During the 2015 growing season (seven to nine months after establishment), these assemblages were exposed to treatment loads of nitrogen and sediment, common stressors to wetlands in agricultural landscapes. Water samples were taken up to five days post-treatment in July and September to quantify interactions between the stressors and plant assemblages. Analyses showed plant assemblage identify was not structured by treatment, but by the site of soil origin. Treatment removal rates were influenced by total amount of the stressor present, with nitrogen removal rates being higher, in relative terms, in low nitrogen amended treatments. Additionally, plant quality, not quantity, was linked to nitrogen and sediment loss rates, and over time, elevated nitrogen and sediment loads were associated with decreased plant assemblage quality. This study demonstrates the ability of plants from restored wetlands to affect nutrient and sediment dynamics, with three significantly differing plant assemblages all exhibiting substantial nutrient and sediment reduction capacity. Nevertheless, we also found that in a relatively short time (seven to nine months) common stressors in agricultural settings can significantly impact wetland plant assemblage quality, and that this may be linked to a reduced capacity for nutrient and sediment removal.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				255	262		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.034							WOS:000412127500030

These weeds can host harmful crop pests, among which parasitic plants such as branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa). This holoparasite is responsible for large yield losses in French crops such as oilseed rape. To date, there are no herbicides available to control it. To evaluate ex ante the impact of crop management practices on weed mediated parasite infection of crops, we developed an indicator calculated from outputs of the weed dynamics model FLORSYS. It consists of three components assessing weed impact on (1) stimulation of parasite germination during the whole cropping season, i.e. the potential risk reduction for future crops via a reduction of the parasite seed bank, (2) the stimulation of parasite germination in host crops, i.e. the potential risk increase for the current crop, (3) parasite reproduction on weed plants, i.e. the potential risk increase for future crops. This indicator was then used to predict weed-mediated broomrape risk in cropping systems from six regions from France and one from Spain. Antagonisms and synergies with other indicators of weed-harmfulness for crop production and weed contribution to plant and functional biodiversity were investigated with Pearson correlation analyses. For instance, cropping systems with a high parasite risk also had a high functional biodiversity (e.g. weed-based food offer for bees). Effects of crop management practices on the weed-mediated parasite risk indicator were identified with linear models; regression trees were used to identify the combinations of management practices that maximised or minimised weed-mediated broomrape risk. Parasite risk depended on crop rotation, sowing and harvest dates, tillage, herbicides and mechanical weeding. The lowest risk was observed in fields that were last tilled less than 21 days before sowing, with more than 0.6 herbicides per year (i.e. 3 applications in 5 years) with multiple entry modes into the weeds (e.g. leaves and roots) and the last herbicide sprayed no later than 127 days before harvest. RLQ analyses were used to identify correlations between weed species traits (Q matrix) and simulated parasite risk (R matrix), via simulated weed densities (L matrix). Early summer-emerging weed species increased parasite risk. No other notable correlations were found, indicating that parasite risk results from a weed community of interacting species, and not simply from individual weed species. An advice table was built to summarize and explain the effects of crop management practices on weed-mediated parasite risk.

J	Blossey, B; Nuzzo, V; Davalos, A				Blossey, Bernd; Nuzzo, Victoria; Davalos, Andrea			Climate and rapid local adaptation as drivers of germination and seed bank dynamics of Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) in North America	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Local differences in climate conditions may facilitate rapid evolutionary changes in introduced plants to optimize timing of germination or ability to survive in seed banks, which may constitute beneficial demographic adaptations during range expansions. Understanding differences in germination requirements and emergence patterns across a species' range is critical for demographic modelling and potential invasive species control efforts. 2. We assessed germination responses of Alliaria petiolata using seeds collected from 10 populations spanning much of the North American distribution of the species. We compared germination responses under different stratification regimes in a growth chamber over 25 years, and evaluated seedling emergence in a common garden in Ithaca, New York over 13 years. We further evaluated how climate overlap between Ithaca and original collection sites influenced emergence patterns. 3. In the laboratory, germination of all populations was similar and highest at 4 degrees C stratification. Seeds exposed to sub-zero temperatures delayed germination and population responses were variable. In the common garden, seedlings from most populations emerged over 13 years, and emergence patterns were strongly influenced by population. Annual emergence was positively correlated with spring temperature and inversely correlated with number of spring days with minimum temperature below freezing. Climate overlap between the common garden and original collection location enhanced germination, but common garden climate conditions over the course of the 13-year experiment and population identity had greater explanatory power. 4. Synthesis. Laboratory germination tests did not reflect seedling emergence under field conditions. After 150 years of residence time in North America, Alliaria petiolata populations have developed striking differences in their responses to local climates and stratification requirements suggesting that a complex interplay of pre-adaptation, rapid evolutionary changes, and phenotypic plasticity result in locally adapted populations.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				NOV	2017	105	6			SI		1485	1495		10.1111/1365-2745.12854							WOS:000413341700004

The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with a factorial (3 x 2 x 2) + 2 layout. Treatments consisted of combinations of topsoil origins (forest at early or middle regeneration stages), topsoil thicknesses (10, 20, or 30-cm superficial soil layer), and presence or absence of 70% shading; with two additional control treatments. Surveys on topsoil physical-chemical attributes and flora and soil coverage were conducted. Good correlation was observed between bulk density and total porosity. Vegetation comprised a total of 2,932 individuals of herbaceous, shrub and subshrub plants; 33 species in 11 families and 1 morphospecies were identified. A floristic survey of the tree stratum revealed 235 individuals belonging to 21 species and 14 families, as well as 2 unidentified species. The best natural regeneration index is observed in the 20-cm topsoil layer, where shading exerts a positive influence on the humidity and natural regeneration of the seed bank. Topsoil from middle-stage forest is the most suitable for restoration of degraded pasture areas.

Elizabeth			Soilborne fungi have host affinity and host-specific effects on seed germination and survival in a lowland tropical forest	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for explaining the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. Its central tenet-that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics and at high densities-assumes a degree of host specialization in interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1-12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical forests.

Although reproductive strategy is an important factor in achieving population persistence, changes in the reproductive strategy of Z. japonica under anthropogenic disturbances and tidal stresses are largely unknown. Thus, the duration and frequency of flowering, reproductive effort, potential seed production, and seed density in sediments were measured at three study stations (undisturbed upper, undisturbed lower, and disturbed stations), which were classified based on the levels of inundation stress and clamming activity, in monospecific meadows of Z. japonica on the southern coast of Korea. The flowering duration was approximately six months in the disturbed station, with disturbance due to clam harvesting, whereas the duration was about five months in the undisturbed lower station, and only three months in the undisturbed upper station. The maximum flowering frequency was 25.5% in the disturbed station, which was approximately 4- and 2-fold higher than in the undisturbed upper (6.1%) and lower (12.3%) stations, respectively. A similar trend in reproductive effort was also found among the three study stations. Potential seed production was 7850, 6220, and 1560 seeds m(-2) in the disturbed, undisturbed lower, and undisturbed upper stations, respectively. The annual maximum seed density in sediments was also higher in the disturbed and undisturbed lower stations than in the undisturbed upper station, but the densities were relatively low (ranging from 71 to 254 seeds m-2) at all three study stations. It was found that the allocation to sexual reproduction was highest in the disturbed station, followed by the undisturbed, lower station, and lowest in the undisturbed upper station, suggesting that sexual reproduction in Z. japonica tends to be enhanced under disturbed and inundated environmental conditions for population persistence.

All life stages in these habitats are exposed to varying tidal cycles. It is necessary to investigate all life stages as to how they respond to varying tidal regimes. We examine three wetlands containing populations of an endangered halophyte species, each subjected to different tidal regimes: (1). wetlands completely closed to tidal cycles; (2). wetlands directly exposed to tidal cycles (3). wetlands exposed to a partially closed tidal regime. Our results showed that the most threatened stage varied between wetlands subjected to these varying tidal regimes. We hypothesis that populations of this species have adapted to these different tidal regimes. Such information is useful in developing management options for coastal wetlands and modifying future barriers restricting tidal flushing.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				OCT 15	2017	123	1-2					113	121		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.09.017							WOS:000415776600025	28918005					
J	Ma, MJ; Dalling, JW; Ma, Z; Zhou, XH				Ma, Miaojun; Dalling, James W.; Ma, Zhen; Zhou, Xianhui			Soil environmental factors drive seed density across vegetation types on the Tibetan Plateau	PLANT AND SOIL												Soil seed banks are an important source of seedling recruits in grassland ecosystems, particularly following large-scale disturbance. Nonetheless, the relative importance of above-ground plant communities versus below-ground processes in maintaining these seed banks is poorly understood. Here we collected 1026 soil seed bank samples and sampled 171 aboveground vegetation quadrats in 57 sites representing six distinct grass-dominated vegetation types present at high elevation on the Tibetan Plateau, China. To understand processes affecting seed banks at these sites we examined the associations of soil environmental variables with community composition, density and species richness. We found significant differences in species composition between the seed bank and standing vegetation in each of the vegetation types, whereas soil seed banks were much more similar to each other. Nonetheless, seed bank composition was significantly associated with soil moisture, pH, and available nitrogen (all p < 0.05). Seed density was significantly negatively correlated with soil pH and positively correlated with soil moisture and soil organic matter. Multiple regression analysis showed that for seed bank density a model including pH alone had the lowest AIC value. Soil conditions influence not only seed inputs but also potentially seed survival in the soil, this study present a framework which supply a plausible explanation on effect of soil environment factors (chemical and physical factors) in the formation of species composition of soil seed bank. Future work should isolate the direct and indirect effects of soil chemistry on seed persistence using seed burial experiments.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				OCT	2017	419	1-2					349	361		10.1007/s11104-017-3348-0							WOS:000415350500025

The species composition and density of the soil seed bank were measured, as well as the species composition and amount of vegetation. The native grassland had a significantly higher soil seed density and species richness than the other land use types. Moreover, the common species both in the soil seed bank and vegetation between the native grassland and other land use types gradually decreased as disturbance intensity increased. The abandoned artificial grassland and artificial grassland still had abundant soil seed banks according to their seed density (28.2% of the native grassland) and species richness (70.0% of the native grassland) to restore the vegetation. Conversely, it was hard to restore the vegetation on the farmland due to its low soil seed density (10.0% of the native grassland) and species richness (40.0% of the native grassland). In conclusion, human disturbance would generate significant negative effects on the soil seed bank in desertified regions in a semi-arid climate; however, the soil seed bank in land use types with light/moderate disturbance are more adapted to vegetation restoration compared with land use types with severe disturbance in a semi-arid region.

Seed size showed a positive relationship with time required for seed germination, and seeds exposed to high light intensity required more time to germinate. Seed size did not affect germination percentage, but seeds sown under high light intensity had a lower germination percentage than seeds sown under low light intensity and darkness. Seedling shoot mass showed a positive relationship with seeds mass, and seedlings grown in high light intensity had greater shoot mass than seedling growth in low light intensity and darkness. Thus, seed germinability of C. oblongifolia was higher in darkness while seedlings exhibited greater development under light. Looking to explain the ability of C. oblongifolia to colonize open/disturbed sites, it seems possible that plowing soil can bury seeds, thereby stimulating the germination of seeds present in the seed bank.

Thus, large-scale afforestation has continued during the past decades in order to control soil erosion. Afforestation can dramatically alter nutrient cycles, affect soil-carbon storage, and change hydrology. However, it is unknown how afforestation influences species diversity of the soil seed bank and understory vegetation compared with spontaneous restoration of abandoned land. Forest land with trees planted 30 years ago, abandoned slope land restored spontaneously for 30 years, and the corresponding slopes with remnant natural vegetation were selected as sampling sites. The species richness both in the soil seed bank and vegetation was significantly higher on the afforested slope compared to the spontaneously restored abandoned land. The species similarity between the afforested slope and the remnant slope land was high both in the soil seed bank and standing vegetation compared to the abandoned land. The soil seed bank density varied from 1778 +/- 187 to 3896 +/- 221 seeds/m(2), and more than half of it was constituted by annual and biennial species, with no significant difference among sampling habitats. However, the afforested slope had higher seed density of grass and shrub/subshrubs compared to the abandoned slope. The present study indicates that in the study region, characterized by serious soil erosion, afforestation can better facilitate vegetation succession compared to spontaneously restoration of abandoned slope land.																	1660-4601					OCT	2017	14	10							1285	10.3390/ijerph14101285							WOS:000414763200193	29064405

Optimal prescribed burn frequency to manage foundation California perennial grass species and enhance native flora	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Grasslands can be diverse assemblages of grasses and forbs but not much is known how perennial grass species management affects native plant diversity except in a few instances. We studied the use of late-spring prescribed burns over a span of 11 years where the perennial grass Poa secunda was the foundation species, with four additional years of measurements after the final burn. We evaluated burn effects on P. secunda, the rare native annual forb Amsinckia grandiflora and local native and exotic species. Annual burning maintained P. secunda number, resulted in significant expansion, the lowest thatch and exotic grass cover, the highest percentage of bare ground, but also the lowest native forb and highest exotic forb cover. Burning approximately every 3 years maintained a lower number of P. secunda plants, allowed for expansion, and resulted in the highest native forb cover with a low exotic grass cover. Burning approximately every 5 years and the control (burned once from a wildfire) resulted in a decline in P. secunda number, the highest exotic grass and thatch cover and the lowest percentage of bare ground. P. secunda numbers were maintained up to 4 years after the final burn. While local native forbs benefited from burning approximately every 3 years, planted A. grandiflora performed best in the control treatment. A. grandiflora did not occur naturally at the site; therefore, no seed bank was present to provide across-year protection from the effects of the burns. Thus,perennial grass species management must also consider other native species life history and phenology to enhance native flora diversity.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				OCT	2017	26	11					2627	2656		10.1007/s10531-017-1376-y							WOS:000412139000006

Semi-natural grasslands are target habitats for ecological restoration in temperate Europe. Restoration of abandoned semi-natural grasslands often relies on spontaneous colonisation of plant species from the soil seed bank or the surrounding landscape. Although many studies show that the regional species pool is important for upholding local diversity, its effect on restoration outcome in semi-natural grasslands is poorly known. In this multi landscape study, we examined grassland specialist species occurring in restored grasslands and the effect of specialist species pool, landscape composition and local temporal factors. We found that specialist richness and frequency was positively affected by specialist richness and frequency in the surrounding landscape. Specialist richness in the restored grasslands also increased with time since restoration. Moreover, specialist frequency in the restored grassland increased with the proportion of semi-natural and remnant grassland habitats in the landscape. We also found a positive relationship between the proportion of species occurring in both the restored grassland and its surrounding landscape and time since restoration, in landscapes with high proportions of semi natural grasslands. This suggests that both temporal factors, as well as the landscape composition and species pool, affect plant recolonisation in restored semi-natural grasslands.

Vegetation restoration projects have been carried out. However, the influences of water quality and hydrology on vegetation restoration from seed banks have been rarely investigated. This experiment aimed to identify the effect of water level and nitrogen loading (ammonium and nitrate) on seedling emergence and recruitment from the riparian seed bank of the river in this basin. Most of the species in the seed bank germinated under moist conditions. Under flooding conditions, however, the growth of aquatic species, especially Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, was inhibited when the nitrogen concentration increased. At 0.37 mg/L NH4+-N in the water column, the growth of V. natans was inhibited. The results suggested that flooding was a primary limiting factor of seedling emergence. The inhibitory effect of high nitrogen loading on the growth of aquatic species was one of the main driving mechanisms of macrophyte degradation under flooding conditions; nevertheless, competitive advantage might determine the community pattern in moist habitats. Therefore, water level control and water quality improvement should be the key aspects of vegetation restoration in degraded rivers or lakes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	28					22688	22697		10.1007/s11356-017-9926-0							WOS:000412452200055	28815432

For disturbance specialist plant populations, the frequency and intensity of environmental stochasticity (via disturbances) can drive the qualitative nature of their population dynamics. In this article, we extended our earlier model to explore the effect of temporally autocorrelated disturbances on population persistence. In our earlier work, we only assumed disturbances were independent and identically distributed in time. We proved that the plant seed bank population converges in distribution, and we showed that the mean and variance in seed bank population size were both increasing functions of the autocorrelation coefficient for all parameter values considered, but the interplay between increasing population size and increasing variability caused interesting relationships between quasi-extinction probability and autocorrelation. For example, for populations with low seed survival, fecundity, and disturbance frequency, increasingly positive autocorrelated disturbances decreased quasi-extinction probability. Higher disturbance frequency coupled with low seed survival and fecundity caused a nonmontone relationship between autocorrelation and quasi-extinction, where increasingly positive autocorrelations eventually caused an increase in quasi-extinction probability. For higher seed survival, fecundity, and/or disturbance frequency, quasi-extinction probability was generally a monotonically increasing function of the autocorrelation coefficient.																	0003-0147	1537-5323				OCT	2017	190	4					570	583		10.1086/692911							WOS:000411478000012	28937813

Roadsides: an opportunity for biodiversity conservation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsHow do roadsides interact with patches of natural vegetation in shaping perennial plant communities in fragmented agricultural areas? Are the observed differences due to the type of roadside (i.e. roadcuts, embankments or road verges) or are there other factors driving community structure and composition? LocationStretch of motorway A3 and its surrounding area, central Spain. MethodsWe analysed the variation in perennial plant species composition and diversity among 92 plots (400m(2)). The plots were located in five different environmental scenarios, three of them in a fragmented landscape (patches of natural vegetation, embankments and roadcuts) and two in an unfragmented landscape (natural vegetation and road verges). In each plot, the cover of each perennial plant species and eight soil variables were assessed. We used phi coefficient of correlation to determine the scenario preferences of each species, Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare the soil variables between landscape scenarios and eight descriptive variables of the community, and RDA and partial RDA to evaluate the relative importance of the type of environmental scenario on the floristic community. ResultsWe identified 130 species, with only 16 species never appearing on roadsides. Perennial total cover, species richness, inverse Simpson's index and number of protected species showed no significant differences between the five scenarios considered. In contrast, the number of nutrient-demanding species and restricted-range diversity had lower values in natural vegetation plots. Soil variables and the type of scenario together explained 28.5% of the species composition variation. Of this percentage, 6.8% was explained by soil variables, 12.1% by the type of scenario and 10.0% of the variation was shared between the two data sets. ConclusionsOur results show that almost all perennial species occurring in natural vegetation patches were also able to reach and settle in roadsides. However, soil conditions and other specific roadside variables generate different plant communities. In spite of the differences found between the perennial plant community of roadsides and their surrounding area, roadsides are excellent reservoirs of biodiversity.

LocationBiaowiea Primaeval Forest, NE Poland. MethodsSeveral dozen feeding stations, each composed of one to several haystacks, are used in Biaowiea Forest for supplementary winter feeding of European bison (Bison bonasus). We checked the species composition and availability of seeds in hay in 15 haystacks of the eight oldest feeding stations, which could be a potential source of seeds. Vegetation and soil seed bank were sampled on the overlapping 10mx10m plots distributed along 500-m long transects running south and north of the studied feeding stations. Seed content in the soil samples was studied by the seedling emergence method in an unheated greenhouse. ResultsWe revealed high dissimilarity of species composition of the hayseed, soil seed bank and standing vegetation. The dissimilarity between soil seed banks and standing vegetation increased with the distance from the haystack. The species richness of the standing vegetation was not affected by distance to the haystack, while seed bank species richness showed a significant negative correlation with distance. The mean weighted ecological indicator values of pH, light and soil fertility were negatively correlated with the distance from the haystack for the seed bank and the standing vegetation. The percentage of damaged bushes and juvenile trees was positively correlated with their density and decreased with the distance from the haystack. ConclusionsWe revealed distinct but local (25-50m off the haystack) effect of supplementary feeding on the vegetation and soil seed banks of forest ecosystems. Taking into account the ecosystem approach to nature conservation, the winter feeding in forest ecosystems should be concentrated in few places to avoid the expansion of non-native plant species in forest ecosystems. To prevent potential plant invasions, the origin of the hay used as supplementary winter fodder should be carefully selected, with a preference for local origin and making of hay of native plant species in the forest's meadows or in its surroundings.

Disentangling the role of seed bank and dispersal in plant metapopulation dynamics using patch occupancy surveys	ECOLOGY												In plants, the presence of a seed bank challenges the application of classical metapopulation models to aboveground presence surveys; ignoring seed bank leads to overestimated extinction and colonization rates. In this article, we explore the possibility to detect seed bank using hidden Markov models in the analysis of aboveground patch occupancy surveys of an annual plant with limited dispersal. Patch occupancy data were generated by simulation under two metapopulation sizes (N = 200 and N = 1,000 patches) and different metapopulation scenarios, each scenario being a combination of the presence/absence of a 1-yr seed bank and the presence/absence of limited dispersal in a circular 1-dimension configuration of patches. In addition, because local conditions often vary among patches in natural metapopulations, we simulated patch occupancy data with heterogeneous germination rate and patch disturbance. Seed bank is not observable from aboveground patch occupancy surveys, hence hidden Markov models were designed to account for uncertainty in patch occupancy. We explored their ability to retrieve the correct scenario. For 10 yr surveys and metapopulation sizes of N = 200 or 1,000 patches, the correct metapopulation scenario was detected at a rate close to 100%, whatever the underlying scenario considered. For smaller, more realistic, survey duration, the length for a reliable detection of the correct scenario depends on the metapopulation size: 3 yr for N = 1,000 and 6 yr for N = 200 are enough. Our method remained powerful to disentangle seed bank from dispersal in the presence of patch heterogeneity affecting either seed germination or patch extinction. Our work shows that seed bank and limited dispersal generate different signatures on aboveground patch occupancy surveys. Therefore, our method provides a powerful tool to infer metapopulation dynamics in a wide range of species with an undetectable life form.

Although soil seed banks in different habitats have been reported, how soil seed banks vary with elevational gradients in different climatic zones is still unknown. This paper investigates seed density, species composition and nonconstituent species of forest soil seed banks in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Similarity between the soil seed bank and standing vegetation was also examined. We collected soil samples from sites spanning 12 elevations in tropical rain forests, subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests and subalpine coniferous forests, and transported them to a glasshouse for germination trials for species identification. The soil seed banks of tropical and subtropical forests had much higher seed densities and species richness than those of subalpine forests. Seeds of woody species dominated the soil seed banks of tropical and subtropical forests, while herbs dominated those of subalpine forests. The nonconstituent species in the soil seed banks were all herbs and were most abundant in tropical forests, followed by subtropical forests but were completely absent from subalpine forests.

Reducing tillage intensity affects the cumulative emergence dynamics of annual grass weeds in winter cereals	WEED RESEARCH												Annual grass weeds such as Apera spica-venti and Vulpia myuros are promoted in non-inversion tillage systems and winter cereal-based crop rotations. Unsatisfactory weed control in these conditions is often associated with a poor understanding of the emergence pattern of these weed species. The aim of this study was to investigate, understand and model the cumulative emergence patterns of A.spica-venti, V.myuros and Poa annua in winter cereals grown in three primary tillage regimes: (i) mouldboard ploughing, (ii) pre-sowing tine cultivation to 8-10cm soil depth and (iii) direct drilling. Direct drilling delayed the cumulative emergence of A.spica-venti and V.myuros (counted together) in contrast with ploughing, while the emergence pattern of P.annua was unaffected by the type of tillage system. The total density of emerged weed seedlings varied between the tillage systems and years with a higher total emergence seen under direct drilling, followed by pre-sowing tine cultivation and ploughing. The emergence patterns of all species were differently influenced by the tillage systems, suggesting that under direct drilling, in which these species occur simultaneously, management interventions should first and foremost consider that A.spica-venti and V.myuros emerge over a longer period to avoid control failures.

Role of indehiscent pericarp in formation of soil seed bank in five cold desert Brassicaceae species	PLANT ECOLOGY												The dispersal and germination unit of some Brassicaceae species is the fruit, and we hypothesized that it could affect germination phenology and promote formation of a soil seed bank. We determined the effects of the indehiscent pericarp on germination and longevity of buried seeds of five Brassicaceae species native to cold deserts of central Asia. Germination phenology (seedling emergence) was monitored for intact dispersal units and isolated seeds of Chorispora sibirica, Goldbachia laevigata, Spirorrhynchus sabulosus, Tauscheria lasiocarpa (annuals), and Sterigmostemum fuhaiense (perennial) at natural temperatures in watered and non-watered (natural precipitation) soil. Intact dispersal units and isolated seeds were buried under natural conditions and exhumed at regular intervals for 35 months to monitor germination, viability and moisture content of isolated seeds, seeds in dispersal units, and seeds removed from dispersal units after burial. Isolated seeds of Goldbachia, Spirorrhynchus, and Tauscheria germinated only the first autumn and those of Chorispora and Sterigmostemum the first autumn and first spring, with higher germination percentages in all species in watered than in non-watered soil. A high percentage of seeds in buried dispersal units of Chorispora, Goldbachia, and Sterigmostemum was viable after 35 months, and seeds exhibited a 6-month dormancy cycle, being non-dormant only in autumn and spring. Seeds in buried dispersal units of Spirorrhynchus and Tauscheria germinated when exhumed in the first spring, but all non-germinated seeds were dead after 1 year. Thus, the presence of the pericarp allows Chorispora, Goldbachia, and Sterigmostemum to form a persistent seed bank but not Spirorrhynchus and Tauscheria.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				OCT	2017	218	10					1187	1200		10.1007/s11258-017-0760-8							WOS:000410258800005

Indaziflam: a new cellulose-biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide provides long-term control of invasive winter annual grasses	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: Indaziflam is a cellulose-biosynthesis-inhibiting (CBI) herbicide that is a unique mode of action for resistance management and has broad spectrum activity at low application rates. This research further explores indaziflam's activity on monocotyledons and dicotyledons and evaluates indaziflam's potential for restoring non-crop sites infested with invasive winter annual grasses. RESULTS: Treated Arabidopsis, downy brome, feral rye and kochia were all susceptible to indaziflam in a dose-dependent manner. We confirmed that indaziflam has increased activity on monocots (average GR(50) = 231pm and 0.38g AI ha(-1)) at reduced concentrations compared with dicots (average GR(50) = 512pm and 0.87g AI ha(-1)). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed common CBI symptomologies following indaziflam treatments, as well as aberrant root and cell morphology. Across five application timings, indaziflam treatments resulted in superior invasive winter annual grass control 2 years after treatment (from 845.1% to 99 +/- 0.5%) compared with imazapic (36% +/- 1.2%). Indaziflam treatments significantly increased biomass and species richness of co-occurring species 2 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Indaziflam's increased activity on monocots could provide a new alternative management strategy for long-term control of multiple invasive winter annual grasses that invade >23 million ha of US rangeland. Indaziflam could potentially be used to eliminate the soil seed bank of these invasive grasses, reduce fine fuel accumulation and ultimately increase the competitiveness of perennial co-occuring species.

J	Reisman, E				Reisman, Emily			Troubling Tradition, Community, and Self-Reliance: Reframing Expectations for Village Seed Banks	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												Heralded by both food sovereignty activists and mainstream development practitioners, village seed banks are a rural development phenomenon rapidly gaining attention for their potential to support resilient agricultural systems. This paper presents a case study for examining the power of prevailing narratives of decentralized development to shape and ultimately constrain the operations of village seed banks in Telangana, India. This case demonstrates how visions of tradition, community, and self-reliance can serve to discount the materiality of seeds, the social complexity of village institutions, and even the voices of farmers. The goal of this research is not to criticize village seed banks, as they hold great potential, nor to vilify the narratives in question, but rather to encourage critical reflection on how the assumptions embedded in these narratives shape mechanisms for agricultural development. I argue for a shift away from framing tradition, community, and self-reliance as development solutions and propose an interrogative approach that turns these narratives into questions for engaging more effectively with rural livelihoods.

Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, and the establishment of community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i.e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture.

High-throughput sequencing shows that the microbial community in beach sediments is characterized by the enrichment of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including Alcanivorax, Dietzia, and Marinobacter. Accompanying the periodic floating-oil input, dynamic successions of microbial communities and corresponding fluctuations in functional genes (alkB and RDH) are clearly indicated in a time sequence, which keeps pace with the ongoing biodegradation of the spilled oil. The microbial succession that accompanies tidal action could benefit from the enhanced exchange of oxygen and nutrients; however, regular inputs of floating oil can be a trigger to stimulate an in situ "seed bank"of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. This leads to the continued blooming of hydrocarbon-degrading consortia in beach ecosystems. The results provide new insights into the beach microbial community structure and function in response to oil spills.

Understanding the colonization dynamics of aquatic invasive plant species is of high importance for preservation of native biodiversity. Many aquatic invasive plants rely on clonal reproduction to spread, but mixed reproductive modes are common. Under future climate changes, these species may favor a sexual reproductive mode. The aim of this study was to test the germination capacity and the seedling growth of two water primrose species, Ludwigia hexapetala and Ludwigia peploides, both invasive in Europe and in the United States. We performed a reciprocal transplant of seeds of L. hexapetala and L. peploides from two invasive ranges into experimental gardens characterized by Oceanic and Mediterranean-type climates. Our results showed that higher temperatures increased or maintained germination percentages and velocity, decreased survivorship of germinants, but increased their production of biomass. The origin of the seeds had low impact on L. hexapetala responses to temperature, but greatly influenced those of L. peploides. The invasiveness of water primroses in ranges with Oceanic climates might increase with temperature. The recruitment from seed banks by these species should be considered by managers to improve the conservation of native aquatic and wetland plant species.

Tools for the ex situ conservation of the threatened species, Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Ex situ conservation is critical for hedging against the loss of plant diversity. For those species (exceptional species) that cannot be conserved long-term in standard seed banks, alternative methods are required, often involving in vitro culture and cryopreservation, or storage in liquid nitrogen. Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii is a federally threatened perennial native to Utah and Arizona. It is classified as an exceptional species, because it produces few seeds, and, thus, in vitro propagation and cryopreservation were investigated as tools for its propagation and preservation. Shoot-propagating cultures were established from both seedling and wild-collected shoots, but cultures from both sources displayed an extreme form of the physiological disorder, hyperhydricity. This phenotype could be at least partially normalized by the use of vented closures, as well as by using agar, rather than gellan gum, in the medium. The hyperhydric (HH) phenotype had a lower dry weight, more branching, minimal leaf development and more poorly developed vascular tissue than the more normal (MN) phenotype. Only more normalized shoots could be rooted and the resulting plants acclimatized. Both HH and MN shoots also provided shoot tips capable of surviving cryopreservation using the droplet vitrification method. These in vitro and cryopreservation methods provide tools that can be used for propagating plants of C. humilis var. jonesii for research and restoration, as well as for supplying shoot tips for the ex situ conservation of this species. The two distinct phenotypes also provide a useful system for studying factors involved in the HH response of this dryland species in vitro.																	2051-1434					SEP 23	2017	5								cox053	10.1093/conphys/cox053							WOS:000412197400001	28959449

S. salsa can produce dimorphic seeds. Brown seeds are more salt tolerant, can germinate quickly and maintain the fitness of the species under high saline conditions. Black seeds are less salt tolerant, may become part of the seed bank and germinate when soil salinity is reduced. Previous reports have mainly focused on the ecophysiological traits of seed germination and production under saline conditions in this species. However, there is no information available on the molecular characteristics of S. salsa dimorphic seeds. Results: In the present study, a total of 5825 differentially expressed genes were obtained; and 4648 differentially expressed genes were annotated based on a sequence similarity search, utilizing five public databases by transcriptome analysis. The different expression of these genes may be associated with embryo development, fatty acid, osmotic regulation substances and plant hormones in brown and black seeds. Compared to black seeds, most genes may relate to embryo development, and various genes that encode fatty acid desaturase and are involved in osmotic regulation substance synthesis or transport are upregulated in brown seeds. A large number of differentially expressed genes related to plant hormones were found in brown and black seeds, and their possible roles in regulating seed dormancy/germination were discussed. Conclusions: Upregulated genes involved in seed development and osmotic regulation substance accumulation may relate to bigger seed size and rapid seed germination in brown seeds, compared to black seeds. Differentially expressed genes of hormones may relate to seed dormancy/germination and the development of brown and black seeds. The transcriptome dataset will serve as a valuable resource to further understand gene expression and functional genomics in S. salsa dimorphic seeds.																	1471-2164					SEP 13	2017	18								727	10.1186/s12864-017-4104-9							WOS:000410587900001	28903734

On March 11, 2011, the Great Tohoku Earthquake in Japan caused a massive tsunami that resulted in substantial alteration of community compositions. Populations of a near-threatened tidal marsh Carex rugulosa inhabiting brackish sandbars was also affected. We found four out of six remnant C. rugulosa populations along the Pacific Ocean had become completely extinct. Newly emergent post-tsunami populations, however, had higher allelic numbers than pre-tsunami populations, indicating higher genetic diversity after the tsunami. In addition, genetic differentiation (Fst) between post-tsunami populations was significantly lower than that of pre-tsunami populations. We therefore conclude that the tsunami enhanced gene flow. Seeds of many Carex species persist for long periods in soil, which suggests that seed banks are important genetic resources for post-disturbance recovery of genetic diversity. When its brackish sandbar habitat is no longer subject to disturbance and changes to the land, C. rugulosa is outcompeted by terrestrial plant competitors and eliminated. Disturbance is a driving force for the recovery and maintenance of populations of species such as C. rugulosa-even after near-complete eradication.

J	Wang, GD; Wang, M; Lu, XG; Jiang, M				Wang, Guodong; Wang, Ming; Lu, Xianguo; Jiang, Ming			Duration of farming is an indicator of natural restoration potential of sedge meadows	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Soil seed banks can be important components of ecological restoration, particularly if the species remain viable in the soil for long periods of time. A germination experiment was conducted in the greenhouse to determine seed bank viability based on length of time farmed. Soils from sedge meadows farmed between 0 and 50 years were collected in Sanjiang Plain, China. Most dominant sedges (e.g., Carex schmidtii, C. lasiocarpa) and grasses (e.g. Calamagrostis angustifolia) survived as seeds if farmed for less than 5 years, therefore fields farmed for short periods of time are the best candidates for wetland restoration. Certain important structural components (tussock-forming Carex spp.) are not retained in seed banks when farmed for 6-15 years, but the seed banks still contained viable seeds of other important sedge meadow species, which could contribute to the restoration of wetland communities. However, most sedge meadow species were missing in fields farmed for more than 16 years, which make these fields difficult to restore via natural recolonization. We conclude that the duration of farming can be used as a general indicator of the potential of natural restoration for sedge meadows. This information could be used to determine which wetlands might be targeted for restoration.																	2045-2322					SEP 6	2017	7								10692	10.1038/s41598-017-11429-0							WOS:000409439900110	28878345

Clear-Cuts Are Not Clean Slates: Residual Vegetation Impediments to Savanna Restoration	CASTANEA												In response to widespread losses of savanna ecosystems worldwide, many restoration efforts are underway. For savannas degraded by fire suppression and hardwood invasion, a first step towards restoration typically involves removal of unwanted trees and shrubs, but after invasive nonnative woody plants are top-killed, savanna restoration is often impeded by their resprouts. To evaluate patterns of vegetative recovery following clear-cuts and to explore their implications for ecosystem restoration, we determined the origins of the vegetation that develops after a clear-cut in hardwood-invaded sites being restored to pine savanna in Florida. We excavated stumps and other sprout sources, characterized the soil seed bank, and estimated seed production by early-to-mature species during the first growing season after treatment. In twenty 100-m(2) plots, there was approximately one source of woody plant sprouts per square meter. Root sprouts were more abundant than sprouted stumps, and most of the stumps that did sprout were small (<10 cm diameter). Plants that emerged from seeds were only abundant in a previously disturbed area where Vitis rotundifolia Michx. seedlings were common. The soil seed bank was dominated by herbaceous ruderal species. During the first year after the hardwood clear-cut, seed production was dominated by the ruderal Phytolacca americana L. and the short-lived shrub Callicarpa americana L. Hardwood removal is a reasonable first step towards savanna restoration, but managers should be aware that the removal of invasive nonnative woody species will not shift the restoration sites toward savanna if needle-shedding pines and ground layer species that carry fire are not abundant.

We compared variation and plasticity in traits related to fitness and growth of plants germinating from the soil seed bank and established plants from river and secondary anthropogenic habitats. Plants from sites at rivers, fishponds and fish storage ponds were cultivated and selfed to get homogenous seed material for a germination and an environmental manipulation experiment involving three different water regimes. Differences in traits and their plasticities were evaluated by means of linear mixed models. Cyperus fuscus followed a low-oxygen escape strategy when flooded. Seeds of plants derived from the soil seed bank germinated faster than seeds of plants derived from established plants suggesting that short-term selection of genotypes is mediated by the particular conditions on the site during germination. The experiment revealed significant differences between river and secondary habitats as well as between the soil seed bank and established plants. For example, plants from river habitats produced the highest number of culms with inflorescences. The difference was most evident under partial submergence. Plants from fish storage ponds rapidly reached the reproductive phase, but produced less culms with inflorescences. This seemingly allows them to cope with numerous and irregular disturbances and intensive substrate moisture changes. Our results suggest that populations have adapted to conditions at secondary habitats provided by fish farming during the last centuries. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

There was no statistically significant difference in the population density and diversity of the species of soil seed bank between the two types of forests. A similarity in the species composition between the standing vegetation and the soil seed bank was found and was higher in the shrub layer than in the canopy and understory layers. The species characteristics of the soil seed bank, such as the species composition and the species diversity, seemed to be more relevant for the herbaceous plants in the shrub layer than for the dominant tree species in the canopy layer. The number of plant species and the population density of the species of the soil seed bank were considered to be affected by the organic content in the surface soil of the forests.																	0023-6152					SEP	2017	62	2					323	328									WOS:000415393300002

Comparing germination stimuli of two alien invasive species and a native analogue: Towards sustainable management of invasives	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Invasive alien plants that have seeds with innate dormancy, and thus large, persistent soil-stored seed banks, are particularly difficult to manage. Dormant seeds typically require specific stimuli as cues for germination, resulting in mass recruitment. Sound understanding of germination stimuli may provide options to aid the management of invasives. We investigated the response of two invasive trees, Acacia mearnsii and A. melanoxylon, and an indigenous ecological analogue, Virgilia divaricata, to different germination stimuli (chipped (manually), hot water exposure, dry heat pulse, smoke, and no treatment) at two temperature regimes (winter similar to 12 degrees C and summer similar to 20 degrees C) to explore how their germination requirements may be used to favour V. divaricata in areas cleared of the invasives. Chipped and hot water exposure resulted in the highest germination in all three species. Virgilia divaricata responded marginally better than the invasives to the dry heat pulse, particularly at 20 degrees C. However, the three species mostly responded comparably to the stimulus-temperature combinations, suggesting that manipulation of stimuli is not a feasible option for management of the invasives at a large scale. In the absence of any stimulus (similar to akin to conditions associated with above ground clearing of alien vegetation cover), germination was poorer in V. divaricata than in the invasive species especially at 20 degrees C, providing motivation for focusing Acacia management operations in cooler seasons in areas where V. divaricata seed banks occur. Another option is to sow V.divaricata seeds that have been chipped or exposed to hot water in areas cleared of the invasives of which the seeds would not have received stimuli. (C) 2017 SAAB.

J	Capon, SJ; Balcombe, SR; McBroom, J				Capon, Samantha J.; Balcombe, Stephen R.; McBroom, James			Environmental watering for vegetation diversity outcomes must account for local canopy conditions	ECOHYDROLOGY												Hydrology is widely considered to be the dominant driver of understorey vegetation dynamics in arid and semiarid riparian ecosystems. Consequently, environmental watering is often a key approach to restoring and promoting riparian vegetation diversity. Few studies however have considered the role of local factors, for example, shading or litter accumulation, on vegetation responses to flow and how these may influence the outcomes of watering actions. Knowledge concerning modifying effects of local canopy factors on vegetation responses to watering is needed to guide environmental water planning (e.g., setting objectives and targets) and delivery (e.g., timing and duration of managed flows). We conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the effects of shade and litter, and their interaction, on plant communities establishing from riparian soil seed banks, collected from the northern Murray-Darling Basin, under a range of hydrological conditions. We found that shade had a positive influence on the abundance, diversity, and reproduction of establishing plant communities under dry conditions but a negative, or null effect, under wet conditions. Litter exerted strong negative effects on plant community metrics under all hydrological conditions. Some understorey species emerged as hardy generalists capable of establishment under a range of conditions whereas others had more specific requirements. Our results highlight the importance of canopy structure for riparian understorey vegetation diversity and dynamics at both local and landscape scales. Land and water management practices seeking to protect or restore vegetation diversity in these systems must therefore take such local factors into account when planning and evaluating interventions.

Does the seed bank contribute to the build-up of a genetic extinction debt in the grassland perennial Campanula rotundifolia?	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Habitat fragmentation threatens global biodiversity. Many plant species persist in habitat fragments via persistent life cycle stages such as seed banks, generating a species extinction debt. Here, seed banks are hypothesized to cause a temporal delay in the expected loss of genetic variation, which can be referred to as a genetic extinction debt, as a possible mechanism behind species extinction debts. Methods Fragmented grassland populations of Campanula rotundifolia were examined for evidence of a genetic extinction debt, investigating if the seed bank contributed to the extinction debt build-up. The genetic make-up of 15 above-and below-ground populations was analysed in relation to historical and current levels of habitat fragmentation, both separately and combined. Key Results Genetic diversity was highest in above-ground populations, though below-ground populations contained 8 % of unique alleles that were absent above-ground. Above-ground genetic diversity and composition were related to historical patch size and connectivity, but not current patch characteristics, suggesting the presence of a genetic extinction debt in the above-ground populations. No such relationships were found for the belowground populations. Genetic diversity measures still showed a response to historical but not present landscape characteristics when combining genetic diversity of the above-and below-ground populations. Conclusions The fragmented C. rotundifolia populations exhibited a genetic extinction debt. However, the role of the seed banks in the build-up of this extinction debt is probably small, since the limited, unique genetic diversity of the seed bank alone seems unable to counter the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation on the population genetic structure of C. rotundifolia.

Nutrient reduction (via carbon addition) and seed bank depletion are two approaches to reduce competition from exotic annuals but to be effective these treatments must allow establishment of species such as native grasses. This experiment was conducted in two degraded Austrostipa understoreys in the box gum woodlands of south-east Australia. It compares the effects of carbon addition (sugar), seed depletion (spring burning or spring grazing) and combinations of carbon addition and seed depletion treatments on the establishment of C3 and C4 native grasses, and measured the effects of their establishment on soil nitrate concentration and exotic annuals. Treatments that reduced exotic annual abundance did not increase initial germination of the C4 native grasses, Bothriochloa or Themeda. However, sugar increased seedling survival of Themeda and Bothriochloa and grazing increased seedling survival of Bothriochloa, presumably by reducing effects of exotic annuals. Poa and Rytidosperma (C3 native grasses) failed to establish. Although we were unable to detect any reduction in soil nitrate concentration, swards with successful recruitment of C4 grasses suppressed exotic annuals more than the Austrostipa-only swards at one site (the other was affected by wildfire). Further, Austrostipa-Themeda swards were more effective than Austrostipa-Bothriochloa for suppressing exotics, pointing to a role for both functional and species identity in the degree of resistance conferred.

J	Dyer, AR				Dyer, Andrew R.			The seed ecology of Aegilops triuncialis: linking trait variation to growing conditions	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Adaptive plastic responses in invasive species allow for establishment and persistence despite the lack of genetic matching to new environments. The capacity of annual species to invade habitats to which they are not adapted is likely to be predicated on post-invasion seed trait variation correlated with conditions in the new habitat. To test this, I compared variation in seed traits and germination patterns of Aegilops triuncialis, an invasive annual grass, from 69 sample populations from 24 sites in California (USA) across 13 years. Seed mass, germination fractions, seed viability, and strength of induced dormancy between dimorphic seed pairs were used to investigate plastic variation within and among populations, across two general soil types, and among two widespread maternal genotypes. I found that seed mass variation was constrained although both seed types showed a 3-fold range among populations, 20-25% variation within populations between years, and was positively correlated with longer growing seasons. However, induced seed dormancy in the small seed type was correlated with large seed mass and to late-season precipitation, suggesting that longer growing seasons influence the strength of maternal and sibling chemical signals that induce dormancy in the small seeds. Thus variation in small seed germination fractions varies with the growing conditions experienced by the maternal plant. The greater longevity of the small seed type suggests that plasticity in germination in this species may contribute to seed bank formation, which is atypical of invasive annual grasses in California, and this may contribute to the persistence and spread of A. triuncialis in invaded ranges.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				SEP	2017	27	3					183	198		10.1017/S0960258517000174							WOS:000408323200003

Seed longevity and physical dormancy break of two endemic species of Dimorphandra from Brazilian biodiversity hotspots	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed longevity is dependent on seed traits and storage conditions. This study evaluated the seed longevity and physical dormancy (PY)-break of two species of Dimorphandra endemic to Brazilian biodiversity hotspots. Longevity was tested in situ, by burying seeds in their natural habitats (12 months), and ex situ, by storage in a cold chamber (5 degrees C; 24 months). Seeds were taken at regular intervals to assess germinability at 30 degrees C (12 h photoperiod) using intact and scarified seeds. Intact seeds (freshly collected, and after 12 months storage) were analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The germinability of freshly collected seeds of both species reached approximately 10% for intact seeds and >85% for scarified seeds. Cold storage maintained seed viability in both species, and broke dormancy for 35% of D. wilsonii seeds. After 12 months, only 55% (for D. exaltata) and 41% (for D. wilsonii) of the buried seeds were recovered; more than 90% of which remained viable in both species. Seeds gradually overcame PY during burial, with a higher germination increase for D. wilsonii (71%) than D. exaltata (32%). Dimorphandra exaltata seeds did not show clear structural changes after cold storage although D. wilsonii seeds evidently experience an increase in the depth of fracture lines. Burial promoted deep seed coat changes in both species, more intense in D. wilsonii, indicating that temperature and humidity variations throughout the year are among the main factors releasing Dimorphandra seeds from PY. The seeds of both studied species overcame PY during burial and are able to form small persistent soil seed banks.

J	Batlla, D; Agostinelli, AM				Batlla, Diego; Mateo Agostinelli, Andres			Thermal regulation of secondary dormancy induction in Polygonum aviculare seeds: a quantitative analysis using the hydrotime model	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												For seed banks showing seasonal changes in their dormancy level, the possibility of predicting temporal patterns of emergence depends on establishing a robust relationship between temperature and the rate of dormancy loss and induction. However, although the effect of temperature on dormancy loss has been extensively studied, less work has been advocated to the quantification of temperature effects on dormancy induction. In the present work, we quantified temperature regulation of dormancy induction in Polygonum aviculare seeds using the hydrotime model. To study induction into secondary dormancy, seeds previously released from primary dormancy through stratification at 5 degrees C were stored at dormancy-inductive temperatures of 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C for different periods. During storage, seeds were germinated at different temperatures and water potentials, and hydrotime model parameters were derived. Changes in hydrotime model parameters (mean base water potential for germination and its standard deviation, and the hydrotime required for germination) during dormancy induction were described by adjusting exponential equations. Obtained results indicated a minimum temperature for dormancy induction of 8.7 degrees C and the existence of a bi-linear relationship between rate of induction into secondary dormancy and storage temperature, in which storage temperatures around 25 degrees C showed a higher dormancy induction rate than those below 20 degrees C. Developed model equations were then used to predict changes in germination behaviour during dormancy induction at different temperatures, showing a good agreement between simulated and observed values.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				SEP	2017	27	3					231	242		10.1017/S0960258517000198							WOS:000408323200007

Here, we formalize a hypothesis of rebounding diversity, where species richness initially declines in response to warming, but subsequently recovers through a combination of colonization (via dispersal and seed banks) and competitive release (via shifts in the dominant species). We compared long-term changes in species diversity and abundance between control and experimentally warmed (1-2 degrees C) plots, sampled over an 18-year period, in alpine meadow communities of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. While there was an initial decline in species diversity by c. 40% (11-19 species) over the first four years, 18 years later, diversity had rebounded to initial levels, on a par with control plots. The composition of the experimentally warmed communities, however, was significantly altered. Our study suggests that short-term experiments may be insufficient to capture the temporal variability in community diversity and composition in response to climate change. Rather, the long-term impacts of continued global warming are predicted to result in highly dynamic processes of community reassembly and turnover that do not necessarily lead to a net decline in local diversity, but do lead to the formation of novel communities.

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of high soil compaction and low soil moisture content on inhibition of the germination of understory seeds in Eucalyptus forests and thus would result in the scarcity of understory vegetation. The soil water content above the depth of 1 m of six major understory vegetation types was analyzed to determine if there was a correlation between soil water content and understory vegetation. The effects of soil treatment (soil-loosening vs. no soil-loosening) and water supply amount (2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 500, 250, or 0 ml of water per day) on the seed germination rate of Stylosanthes sp. were explored using an artificial climate chamber experiment. Influence of soil source (five Eucalyptus forest soils vs. two non-Eucalyptus forest soils) and water supply (0, 50, 150, 200, or 400 ml of water every day) on the germination rate of five types of seed were assessed using a three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Soil-loosening and water supply significantly (P < 0.05) increased seed germination rate with the contribution rates of 26.14 and 42.93 %, respectively. Analysis of variance for three-factor experiments revealed a significant (P < 0.05) effect of water supply and vegetation seed type on the germination rate of plant seeds. No significant effect of soil type was observed on germination rate, indicating that germination rate was not affected by soils in Eucalyptus forest. The conservation of soil characteristics, such as water content and compaction, during the development of a Eucalyptus forest plantation may be an effective strategy for encouraging the growth of understory vegetation. This study highlights the importance that in dry areas or areas prone to long-term drought, it would be preferable to retain native vegetation.

(Rubiaceae) is an endangered tree species that is native to China. The wild populations of E. henryi have declined rapidly because of its poor natural regeneration, but the actual regeneration processes are not yet understood. In field tracking surveys and experiments in the Wuyishan Nature Reserve in Southeast China to determine the most important stage that affects the regeneration process, seed bank characteristics, seed germination, and seedling growth dynamics were studied in the typical habitats of E. henryi, Phyllostachys pubescens and broad-leaved forests. Results showed that in both P. pubescens and broad-leaved forests, more than 70% of the E. henryi seeds were distributed in moss and litter layers, and few were found in the soil beneath them. However, seed germination in the soil layer was significantly higher than in the moss and litter layers. Seed density, overall seed quality, and germination rate in the broad-leaved forest were significantly higher than in P. pubescens forest. Seed germination was highest in the microsites around the edge of the crown projection area of E. henryi mother trees. The order of survival rate of the seedlings on different ground surfaces was soil > moss > litter. In both habitats, the average seed density was 24.9 seeds m(-2), and the total germination rate was less than 3.5 parts per thousand. However, seedlings developed from only 1% of the germinated seeds, indicating that the seed germination is the most important stage in the natural regeneration of E. henryi.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				SEP	2017	28	5					943	952		10.1007/s11676-017-0376-9							WOS:000408011700009

Exotic and invasive species compromise the seed bank and seed rain dynamics in forests undergoing restoration at urban regions	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												The control of exotic and invasive species in areas undergoing recovery is a challenge for ecological restoration and this problem may be even greater in urbanized areas. This study evaluated the seed bank and seed rain of a 5-year-old riparian forest located at the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte in southeast Brazil, and verified changes over time in the abundance and species richness and whether planted species already were providing propagules to the site. At the forest, fifteen parcels of 100 m(2) were distributed randomly and soil samples were collected thrice (October 2011, March 2012 and July 2012) to evaluate the seed bank. Seed traps were installed in nine parcels to collect propagules over 1 year. Propagules were segregated and germinate at greenhouse. Species richness and abundance were estimated, and variance and similarity were quantified. In total, 86 species were recorded in the seed banks, 41.9% natives and 33.7% exotics, with the predominance of herbs (87.2%) and only 7% of trees. Species classified as weeds amounted to 52.3%. In the seed rain 642 seedlings germinated but they belonged to only 10 species, half of them were exotics. Regarding life forms, half of the species were arboreal and dominated the samples, highlighting the exotic species Melia azedarach. The species richness of the seed bank did not differ by season, unlike the seed rain which varied significantly by month. Seed bank and seed rain species had a very low floristic similarity with the list of planted species, suggesting that few planted trees had dispersed or were stocking propagules. Many non-planted species were recorded, mostly exotics and/or invasive that were probably derived from the surrounding urban matrix. These might interrupt the successional dynamics of the restoration forest and compromise the restoration process in the medium and long-terms. Our results highlight: (1) the importance of monitoring areas undergoing restoration; (2) that restoration methods and management actions directed to control exotic and invasive species are particularly important for sites in urban regions; and (3) the relevance of conserving forest fragments as sources of propagules for nearby areas.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Serratula tinctoria L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway. It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States, and from the lowland Mediterranean zone. 3. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded. 4. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a hormone that regulates insect development. 5. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year(-1). The species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient availability and lack of management. 6. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and, conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland, heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				SEP	2017	105	5					1438	1458		10.1111/1365-2745.12824							WOS:000407838200026

Multi-scale methods predict invasion speeds in variable landscapes Case study: Phragmites australis	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY												Spread rates of invasive plant species depend heavily on variable seed/seedling survivorships over various habitat types as well as on variability in seed dispersal induced by rapid transport of propagules in open areas and slow transport in vegetated areas. The ability to capture spatial variability in seed survivorship and dispersal is crucial to accurately predict the rate of spread of plants in real world landscapes. However, current analytic methods for predicting spread rates are not suited for arbitrary, spatially heterogeneous systems. Here, we analyze invasion rates of the invasive plant Phragmites australis (common reed) over variable wetland landscapes. Phragmites is one of the most pervasive perennial grasses, outcompeting native vegetation, providing poor wildlife habitat, and proving difficult to eradicate across its invasive range in North America. Phragmites spreads sexually via seeds and asexually via underground (rhizomes) and aboveground (stolons) stems. We construct a structured integrodifference equation model of the Phragmites life cycle capturing variable seed survivorship in a seed bank, sexual and asexual recruitment into a juvenile age class, and differential competition among all classes with adults. The demographic model is coupled with a homogenized ecological diffusion/settling seed dispersal model that allows for seed deposition that varies with habitat type. The dispersal kernel we develop does not require local normalization and can be implemented efficiently using standard computational techniques. The model generates a traveling wave of isolated patches, establishing only in suitable habitats. We use the method of multiple scales to predict invasion speed as a solvability condition at large scales and test the predictions numerically. Accurate predictions are generated for a wide range of landscape parameters, indicating that invasion speeds can be understood in landscapes of arbitrary structure using this approach.

Identifying the core seed bank of a complex boreal bacterial metacommunity	ISME JOURNAL												Seed banks are believed to contribute to compositional changes within and across microbial assemblages, but the application of this concept to natural communities remains challenging. Here we describe the core seed bank of a bacterial metacommunity from a boreal watershed, using the spatial distribution of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across 223 heterogeneous terrestrial, aquatic and phyllosphere bacterial assemblages. Taxa were considered potential seeds if they transitioned from rare to abundant somewhere within the metacommunity and if they were ubiquitous and able to persist under unfavorable conditions, the latter assessed by checking their presence in three deeply sequenced samples (one soil, one river and one lake, 2.2-3 million reads per sample). We show that only a small fraction (13%) of all detected OTUs constitute a metacommunity seed bank that is shared between all terrestrial and aquatic communities, but not by phyllosphere assemblages, which seem to recruit from a different taxa pool. Our results suggest directional recruitment driven by the flow of water in the landscape, since most aquatic sequences were associated to OTUs found in a single deeply-sequenced soil sample, but only 45% of terrestrial sequences belonged to OTUs found in the two deeply-sequenced aquatic communities. Finally, we hypothesize that extreme rarity, and its interplay with water residence time and growth rates, may further constrain the size of the potential seed bank.

Recent advances and perspectives about Acacia invasion in Mediterranean areas	ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE												Key message The above- and belowground impacts due to Acacia invasions have been described in detail over the last 25 years. Future research should focus on the early detection and prevention of new Acacia introductions and on a cost-effective and sustainable management of the novel ecosystems resulting from invasions. Context Invasive alien plants (IAPs) strongly alter ecosystems reducing biodiversity, modifying ecosystem services and increasing negative impacts at social and economic level. Among invasive taxa, Acacia is a highly problematic genus worldwide. In fact, almost 500 papers have been published on several aspects of Acacia invasions for the last 25 years. Aims We aim at reviewing the current knowledge on the consequences of the invasion by Acacia genus in Mediterranean ecosystems. We also collect and propose different approaches for the management and recovery of invaded areas and suggest future perspectives on Acacia research. Methods We compile, summarise and discuss recent findings on physicochemical, ecological, microbiological and socioeconomic aspects of invasion related to Australian acacias (Acacia dealbata, Acacia longifolia, Acacia mearnsii, Acacia saligna and Acacia melanoxylon) focusing on Mediterranean areas. Results Acacia invasion generally entails soil physicochemical alterations and changes in microbial function and structure. Consequences such as the decreased biodiversity, altered ecosystem structure, larger seed banks dominated by invasive species, new biotrophic relationships or alterations in water availability and fire regimes suggest that acacias are locally creating novel ecosystems. Conclusions Forecasting invasions, modelling and managing ecosystems dominated by acacias are challenging tasks that should be addressed in the future, since climatic conditions and intensification in land uses are increasing the likelihood of Acacia invasions in Mediterranean areas. Unsuccessful management actions suggest that restoration should be meticulously monitored, but the magnitude of invasion or the inconsistency of economic investment indicate that eradication is often unfeasible. Alternatively, novel integrative and cost-effective solutions including the collaboration of society, politicians and stakeholders are necessary to prevent new introductions and achieve sustainable control of acacias. There is a growing interest in applied research on the valorisation or novel uses for acacias and their residues that result in economic benefits.

Dormancy cycles in buried seeds of three perennial Xyris (Xyridaceae) species from the Brazilian campo rupestre	PLANT BIOLOGY												Dormancy cycles are an important mechanism for avoiding seed germination under unfavourable periods for seedling establishment. This mechanism has been scarcely studied in tropical species. Here, we studied three tropical and perennial species of Xyris, X. asperula, X. subsetigera and X. trachyphylla, to investigate in situ longevity and the existence of seasonal seed dormancy cycles. Seeds of three species of Xyris were buried in their natural habitat, with samples exhumed bimonthly for 18 months. Germination of exhumed seeds was assessed under a 12-h photoperiod over a broad range of temperatures. Seeds of X. trachyphylla were also subjected to treatments to overcome secondary dormancy. Seeds of all species are able to form a persistent seed bank and exhibit seasonal changes in germinability. Secondary dormancy was acquired during the rainy summer and was overcome during the subsequent dry season (autumn/winter). Desiccation partially overcomes secondary dormancy in X. trachyphylla seeds. Soil seed bank persistence and synchronisation of seed germination under favourable conditions for seedling establishment contribute to the persistence and regeneration of X. asperula, X. subsetigera and X. trachyphylla in their natural environment.																	1435-8603	1438-8677				SEP	2017	19	5					818	823		10.1111/plb.12597							WOS:000407024500017	28646622

Consequences of anthropogenic disturbances on soil seed bank diversity and nurse shrub effect in a semiarid rangeland	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												What is the effect of common land use histories on the diversity, richness, spatial distribution and abundance of the soil seed bank (SSB)? Does the effect change between different microsites under shrub canopy? To address these questions we selected seven sites with different grazing and fire histories in the Patagonian Monte desert. We took soil samples in seven microsites at different distances of the trunk along a windward/leeward transect through shrub patches to estimate the SSB of perennial grasses, shrubs and annuals. Shrubs SSB was scarce. The nurse shrub effect on perennial grass SSB was evident at sites with a low disturbance intensity (as sites without continuous grazing), and higher on the leeward side under the shrub canopy. High disturbance intensity (such as permanent grazing) promoted a decrease in perennial grass SSB and an increase in annuals SBB (especially non-native). Land use histories related to fire showed a moderated disturbance response (medium values for both groups). Differences between land use histories varied depending on the windward/leeward microsite from which the SSB was analysed. Our results suggest a nurse effect of the shrub patches on the spatial distribution and abundance of the SSB, but this effect decrease under continuous grazing. Fire seems to have a positive effect on perennial grass SSB. Nevertheless, fire characteristics must be controlled. Moreover, perennial grass SSB was almost depleted under continuous grazing, driving the grazed system towards a vulnerable state; and annual non-native species take advantage of this disturbance and dominate the SSB.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				SEP	2017	26	10					2327	2346		10.1007/s10531-017-1358-0							WOS:000406637700004						
J	Ma, MJ; Baskin, CC; Yu, KL; Ma, Z; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Baskin, Carol C.; Yu, Kailiang; Ma, Zhen; Du, Guozhen			Wetland drying indirectly influences plant community and seed bank diversity through soil pH	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												High altitude wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau have been shrinking due to anthropogenic disturbances and global climate change. However, the few studies that have been conducted on wetlands are inconclusive about the effect of soil moisture on seed banks and potential of seed banks in wetlands with different levels of soil moisture for regeneration of dried wetlands. We investigated seed banks and plant communities along a soil moisture gradient. A structural equation model was used to analyze the direct and indirect effects of soil moisture on seed banks, as well as the relationship between plant communities and seed banks. Although soil moisture had no direct effects on seed bank richness and density and indirect effects on seed banks through plant community, it had indirect effects on the seed bank through soil pH. Soil moisture also did not have direct effects on plant community richness, but it had indirect effects through soil pH. Plant community composition changed with soil moisture, but aboveground plant abundance and seed banks composition did not change. Low similarity exists between plant community and seed banks for all wetlands, and similarity decreased along the moisture gradient. The key factor determining plant community diversity was soil pH, while seed bank diversity was mainly affected by soil pH and plant community diversity with wetland drying. Although potential for regenerating the plant community from the seed bank decreased with an increase in soil moisture, drained wetlands still have enough residual seeds for successful restoration of species-rich alpine meadows.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2017	80						186	195		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.027							WOS:000406436100019						
J	Wassens, S; Ning, N; Hardwick, L; Bino, G; Maguire, J				Wassens, Skye; Ning, Nathan; Hardwick, Lorraine; Bino, Gilad; Maguire, James			Long-term changes in freshwater aquatic plant communities following extreme drought	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Prolonged periods of floodplain drying are becoming increasingly common due to severe drought events and the effects of river regulation. Using long-term monitoring, we assessed changes in freshwater plant community structure and composition before (2000-2002) and after (2010-2013) an extended drying period that resulted in two formerly persistent and three seasonally inundated wetlands in south-eastern Australia remaining continuously dry for durations ranging from 4.7 to 9.4 years. Plant community composition and structure changed significantly between pre- and post-dry stages in all wetlands. These changes were characterised by significant reductions in the percentage cover of aquatic species and the loss of formerly dominant aquatic species-in particular, the herbaceous perennial species, Eleocharis acuta R.Br. and E. sphacelata R.Br., and the aquatic grass, Pseudoraphis spinescens (R.Br.) Vickery. Small areas of E. acuta began to re-establish in the second and third years of wetland refilling, whereas E. sphacelata and P. spinescens did not re-establish and the percentage cover of aquatic species overall remained significantly below 2000-2002 levels throughout the 2010-2013 period. These results lend empirical support to our understanding of floodplain dynamics and resilience, and in particular, the loss of dominant perennial aquatic species and establishment of opportunistic annual species following extended wetland drying.

J	Chen, T; Christensen, M; Nan, ZBA; Hou, FJ				Chen, Tao; Christensen, Michael; Nan, Zhibiao; Hou, Fujiang			Effects of grazing intensity on seed size, germination and fungal colonization of Lespedeza davurica in a semi-arid grassland of northwest China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Lespedeza davurica, a major semi-shrub leguminous plant of the vast semi-arid grasslands in northwest China, has decreased greatly in abundance due to overgrazing. Seed characteristics and fungal pathogens affect seedling recruitment from soil seed banks. However, little is known about how grazing affects seed characteristics and fungal colonization on seeds. Seeds of L. davurica were obtained both from plants and from soil from plots where four intensities of grazing (0, 2.7, 5.3 and 8.7 sheep/ha) had been applied for 13 years. The morphological and germination characteristics and colonization of seed by fungi were examined. Seed size showed a hump-shaped trend with increasing grazing intensity. With freshly harvested seed, the intensity of 8.7 sheep/ha significantly enhanced germination and extended the time over which germination occurred. The occurrence of pathogenic Fusarium species on seeds decreased with increasing grazing intensity. Our study strongly suggests that the intensity of grazing can alter seed morphological and germination characteristics, as well as the colonization of fungi on seeds. Additional studies involving more members of the plant community are needed to determine whether the intensity of grazing results in a compensatory mechanism that serves to enhance the possibility of plant recruitment from seeds under field conditions.

We asked whether the passage of Cecropia pachystachya (Urticaceae) seeds through guts of bats influences their germination behavior, specifically the proportion of germinated seeds and onset and speed of germination. We collected seed sets from bat feces and directly from ripe fruits monthly for a total of 6 months, in the urban area of Campo Grande, Central Brazil. Seeds were stored in glycerol until the germination experiment. During the experiment, for 45 days we maintained seed sets in a germinator and recorded daily seed development. Through redundancy correlation analysis, the interaction between seed source (fruits or bat feces) and time of storage explained 78% of variation in the germination parameters-the onset and speed of germination and the percentage of germinated seeds. Through data generated from random resamples, seed sets defecated by bats presented slower germination speed than seeds from ripe fruits, but onset of germination and proportion of germinated seeds did not differ between seeds passed or not passed through Artibeus lituratus and Artibeus planirostris. Overall, our results support that fruit bats are safe dispersers of C. pachystachya and promote asynchrony of germination among seeds, which may favor parental fitness in less predictable environments.

Metagenomic analyses of hyper-arid and extreme hyperarid soils in this desert revealed a remarkable degree of actinobacterial 'dark matter', evidenced by a detected increase of 34% in families against those that are validly published. Rank-abundance analyses indicated that these soils were high-diversity habitats and that the great majority of designated 'rare' genera (up to 60% of all phylotypes) were always rare. These studies have enabled a core actinobacterial microbiome common to both habitats to be defined. The great majority of detected taxa have not been recovered by culture dependent methods, neither, with very few exceptions, has their functional ecology been explored. A microbial seed bank of this magnitude has significance not just for Atacama soil ecosystem resilience but represents an enormous untapped resource for biotechnology discovery programmes in an era where resistance to existing antibiotics is rapidly becoming a major threat to global health.

Invasive Australian Acacia seed banks: Size and relationship with stem diameter in the presence of gall-forming biological control agents	PLOS ONE												Australian Acacia are invasive in many parts of the world. Despite significant mechanical and biological efforts to control their invasion and spread, soil-stored seed banks prevent their effective and sustained removal. In response South Africa has had a strong focus on employing seed reducing biological control agents to deal with Australian Acacia invasion, a programme that is considered as being successful. To provide a predictive understanding for their management, seed banks of four invasive Australian acacia species (Acacia longifolia, A. mearnsii, A. pycnantha and A. saligna) were studied in the Western Cape of South Africa. Across six to seven sites for each species, seed bank sizes were estimated from dense, monospecific stands by collecting 30 litter and soil samples. Average estimated seed bank size was large (1017 to 17261 seed m(-2)) as was annual input into the seed bank, suggesting that these seed banks are not residual but are replenished in size annually. A clear relationship between seed bank size and stem diameter was established indicating that mechanical clearing should be conducted shortly after fire-stimulated recruitment events or within old populations when seed banks are small. In dense, monospecific stands seed-feeding biological control agents are not effective in reducing seed bank size.

During early succession, the arrival and establishment of those propagules that can pass the environmental filters operating at a given site should be among the dominant processes leading to an initial increase in species richness. With ongoing succession, environmental filtering should decrease in relative importance compared to competitive interactions, which then should decrease species richness. Thereby, the phylogenetic structure of communities should change from random or clustered patterns during early succession to overdispersion. Disturbance is supposed to act as an additional filter, causing communities to be phylogenetically clustered. By analysing the species richness and phylogenetic structure of secondary succession in two different regions in Germany with three different disturbance levels each, we tested this general model. Although in one of the regions (Gimritz) we found the expected trajectory of species richness, phylogenetic structure did not follow the expected trend from random or clustered towards overdispersed communities. In the other region (Bayreuth), species richness did not follow the expected trajectory and phylogenetic structure remained clustered over the course of succession. A preliminary analysis of autecological characteristics of the species involved (Ellenberg indicator values) nevertheless showed clear contrasting trends. The idiosyncrasies of successional trajectories across sites might be due to the environmental context, the regional species pool as well as the legacy of former land use reflected in the seed bank.

These seeds display a large viability and their germination is stimulated by heat. To control the populations, it is necessary to remove adults and young individuals, and to prevent seedling establishment after fire occupying the space with rapid growth and high competitive native species. Context Acacia melanoxylon displays a widespread distribution in South West Europe, and an improved knowledge of its reproductive characteristics is required in order to control its expansion. Aims This experiment was designed to provide useful indicators for an efficient management of A. melanoxylon populations based on its biological cycle in relation to fire. Methods We explored the reproductive biology of A. melanoxylon, from seed dissemination-quantifying seed rain over a year, their germination with and without fire-the seedling and sapling banks and the structure of the adult population. We analysed the effects of fire, seed maturation and scarification on the viability of seeds and the stimulation of seed germination in the aerial seed bank and in the different strata of the soil seed bank. Results Our results indicate that A. melanoxylon produced millions of seeds per ha and per year, half of which germinated and the other half went to the soil seed bank, maintaining the viability many years. The germination was the most critical step in the population dynamics of this species, and fire stimulates germination up to 90%. Conclusion A. melanoxylon adults and seedlings removal, followed by colonization of rapid growth and high competitive native species that cover the ground very quickly would be a good control action.

Legacy of historic ozone exposure on plant community and food web structure	PLOS ONE												Information on whole community responses is needed to predict direction and magnitude of changes in plant and animal abundance under global changes. This study quantifies the effect of past ozone exposure on a weed community structure and arthropod colonization. We used the soil seed bank resulting from a long-term ozone exposure to reestablish the plant community under a new low-pollution environment. Two separate experiments using the same original soil seed bank were conducted. Plant and arthropod richness and species abundance was assessed during two years. We predicted that exposure to episodic high concentrations of ozone during a series of growing cycles would result in plant assemblies with lower diversity (lower species richness and higher dominance), due to an increase in dominance of the stress tolerant species and the elimination of the ozone-sensitive species. As a consequence, arthropod-plant interactions would also be changed. Species richness of the recruited plant communities from different exposure histories was similar (approximate to 15). However, the relative abundance of the dominant species varied according to history of exposure, with two annual species dominating ozone enriched plots (90 ppb: Spergula arvensis, and 120 ppb: Calandrinia ciliata). Being consistent both years, the proportion of carnivore species was significantly higher in plots with history of higher ozone concentration (approximate to 3.4 and approximate to 7.7 fold higher in 90 ppb and 120 ppb plots, respectively). Our study provides evidence that, past history of pollution might be as relevant as management practices in structuring agroecosystems, since we show that an increase in tropospheric ozone may influence biotic communities even years after the exposure.

In this study, we investigated the bacterial communities that developed at the initial stage of deglaciation using space-for-time substitution in the foreland of an ice sheet in Larsemann Hills. A series of soil samples across the glacial foreland were deeply sequenced with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine the bacterial community, including both abundant bacteria, which contribute more to geobiochemistry, and rare bacteria, which serve as a seed bank for diversity. Our results show that abundant bacterial communities were more sensitive to changing conditions in the early stages of deglaciation than rare community members. Moreover, among the environmental parameters tested, which included total organic carbon, pH, and moisture of the soils, ice thickness was the most influential factor affecting the community structure of abundant bacteria. These results show the different effects of abundant and rare bacteria on community shifts and highlight ice thickness as the primary factor affecting the bacterial community in the early stages of deglaciation. The response of microbial community to climate change can be predicted with more certainty in this polar region.																	1664-302X					AUG 10	2017	8								1534	10.3389/fmicb.2017.01534							WOS:000407434000001	28848537

Front propagation and effect of memory in stochastic desertification models with an absorbing state	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT												Desertification in dryland ecosystems is considered to be a major environmental threat that may lead to devastating consequences. The concern increases when the system admits two alternative steady states and the transition is abrupt and irreversible (catastrophic shift). However, recent studies show that the inherent stochasticity of the birth-death process, when superimposed on the presence of an absorbing state, may lead to a continuous (second order) transition even if the deterministic dynamics supports a catastrophic transition. Following these works we present here a numerical study of a one-dimensional stochastic desertification model, where the deterministic predictions are confronted with the observed dynamics. Our results suggest that a stochastic spatial system allows for a propagating front only when its active phase invades the inactive (desert) one. In the extinction phase one observes transient front propagation followed by a global collapse. In the presence of a seed bank the vegetation state is shown to be more robust against demographic stochasticity, but the transition in that case still belongs to the directed percolation equivalence class.																	1742-5468					AUG	2017									083404	10.1088/1742-5468/aa82c5							WOS:000425275400002						
J	Farzam, M; Ejtehadi, H				Farzam, Mohammad; Ejtehadi, Hamid			Effects of drought and slope aspect on canopy facilitation in a mountainous rangeland	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Species composition and diversity of the mountainous rangelands are results of interactions between environmental severities, heterogeneous topography and facilitative effects by nurse plants. This research was aimed to compare relative effects of these three environmental variables on the natural vegetation of a mountainous rangeland. For a more detailed understanding, effects of four different nurse species were separately compared on the various plant growth forms and on two community plant responses (diversity and abundance). Methods A mountainous semiarid rangeland was selected in Baharkish, Quchan, Northeast of Iran. Density and canopy cover of all plant species were recorded under the canopy of four different shrubs and in open areas, in north and south-facing aspects, and in a normal and a drought year. Shannon diversity, total abundance (% cover) and the abundance of different growth forms were used as criteria for assessing effects of the environmental variables. Data were arranged in a factorial combination and analyzed by three-way analysis of variance using a GLM analysis. Important Findings (i) Drought, aspect and canopy created niche differentiation: annual forbs and shrubs were more affected by drought, whereas geophytes and grasses were more responsive to slope aspects. Effects of drought and slope aspect were more profound on species diversity, whereas that of canopy facilitation was stronger on plant abundance. (ii) Canopy facilitation was dependent on severity of the abiotic factors and life history of interacting species. Canopy facilitation allowed for the persistence of only annual forbs, but it was disadvantaged during the drought year. Plant community responses to abiotic factors (slope and drought) were more dependent on the plant growth form, while responses to canopy facilitation were more dependent on the morphology and/or ecology of nurse shrubs. (iii) Effect of shrubs was dependent on their morphology and ecology: shrubs with larger canopy area and nitrogen fixation capability increased, but those with allelopathic effects or a dense canopy structure decreased the diversity of the understory species.

In fragments formed by human activities, this change generates increased richness and abundance, as well as changes in the structure of the forest species of soil seed bank in the border region. This study demonstrates that in natural fragments of cloud forests, the abundance and richness positively influence the linear relation from the edge to interior, mainly by distances of 120 and 180 meters from the edge. This effect can be a result of new plant growth, or 'pioneer' occupation in gaps in the forests generated by large fallen trees.

These methods depend primarily on cryopreservation methods, such as shoot tip cryopreservation, but there are few datasets with information on the long-term survival of shoot tips stored in liquid nitrogen. In this study, survival and genetic stability of shoot tips of the endangered species, Hedeoma todsenii, banked over multiple years were examined. In vitro cultures cryopreserved with both the encapsulation dehydration and the encapsulation vitrification methods showed good average survival after up to 13 yr of storage in liquid nitrogen. The application of droplet vitrification to this species increased survival significantly, with an average of 72%, compared with 24-45% survival obtained with other methods. As measured with microsatellite and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers, the genetic stability of the same genotypes stored over different periods of time typically did not change. However, there was an average of 10.4% band loss between replicate samples that did indicate a potential change in DNA composition. These results demonstrate the use of shoot tip cryopreservation as an effective ex situ conservation tool for this species, but genetic stability of the cryopreserved tissues should be closely monitored.

J	Bird, EJ; Choi, YD				Bird, Eric J.; Choi, Young D.			Response of native plants to elevated soil nitrogen in the sand dunes of Lake Michigan, USA	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) has been reported to reduce the diversity of plant species in N-limited soil. The sand dunes along the southern shore of Lake Michigan have been N-limited historically but receive substantial amount of N from the atmosphere currently. We investigated the effect of N-addition to soil on seed germination rates and species composition of nine native plants. In the greenhouse, the ambient addition (15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) enhanced the germination of Elymus canadensis and Echinacea purpurea, while the 9x ambient N addition reduced seed germination of Dalea purpurea and Elymus. However, regardless the results from greenhouse, these species exhibited no or poor emergence in the field plots. Panicum virgatum was the only species whose germination was promoted significantly by the ambient addition in the greenhouse and also emerged in the field plots in the early years (2010 2012), but its dominance diminished during 2013-2014. The decline of Panicum suggests a failure of establishment and reproduction after germination. Such failure has likely led to reduction or exhaustion of viable seeds in soil. Meanwhile, the species that showed relatively low germination rates (< 20%) in the greenhouse, such as Lupinus perennis, Monarda punctata and Schizachyrium scoparium, established substantially in the field plots. Also in the field plots, soil with elevated-N (3x, 5x and 9x ambient) appeared to favor grass over forb species. Dominance of grass over forb species has led to a reduction in species diversity and divergence of species composition between the ambient and elevated-N plots.(C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				AUG	2017	212		B		SI		398	405		10.1016/j.biocon.2016.12.001							WOS:000408782700003

IMPLEMENTING ACCESS AND BENEFIT SHARING FOR SEED BANKING	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN					Workshop of the Global Partnership for Plant Conservation (GPPC) on Plant Conservation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS)	JUN 28-30, 2016	St Louis, MO					A global study has shown that Australian crop wild relatives (Mills) are a priority for ex situ conservation and future use. The majority of target species occur across various land tenures in northern Australia, including Indigenous Protected Areas. Work undertaken on Indigenous lands needs careful consideration, and until recently the planning of wild crop collections has taken a Western scientific approach. Awareness of potential cultural issues associated with access and use of traditional knowledge is increasing, and Indigenous community expectations associated with use of their knowledge can vary between individual traditional owners and within communities. The Council of Heads of Australian Botanic Gardens Incorporated, through its Australian Seed Bank Partnership, is collaborating with the University of New England to define clear processes and develop protocols for traditional knowledge stewardship, helping to minimize the risk of compromising the cultural integrity of data, while being practical for implementation by the nation's leading botanic gardens. This paper examines how scientific paradigms within botanic garden policy are being transformed in the context of working with Indigenous traditional owners. It will highlight how the Partnership is creating possibilities "on country" (i.e., on traditional lands) within its projects and consider benefits that Indigenous communities may receive from working with this alliance.

Restoring and conserving rare native ecosystems: A 14-year plantation removal experiment	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Forest plantations occupy 2% of Earth's land surface and are increasingly important in biological conservation both through their establishment and removal. To restore conservation-priority oak savannas and prairies in the Midwestern United States, we began a conifer plantation removal experiment in northwestern Ohio in 2002 and measured plant community response, including nectar plants for conservation-priority invertebrates, during a 14-year period. Oak (Quercus) trees, crucial to restoring savanna structure, only became established on plots where conifers were cut. In the understory, native species richness/0.05 ha was 34-50% higher on plots where conifers were cut than on control plots in uncut plantations. By year 14, cut plots accrued 13 species with high coefficients of conservatism (specialist species typifying high-quality natural habitats) and 10 state-listed rare species; uncut plantations did not contain any such species. With 71 wetland species detected during the experiment (out of 370 total plant species), only cut plots developed a wetland-upland biophysical gradient diagnostic of diverse Midwestern savanna-prairie landscapes. Between year 1 and 14 after plantation cutting, cover of nectar plants utilized by federally endangered Karner blue butterflies (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) doubled, while cover of these plants remained negligible in uncut plantations. Similarly, cover of plants utilized by bees increased by 24 x after plantation cutting. Cutting plantations rapidly and persistently benefited native species for at least 14 years, with minimal increase in non-native plants.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				AUG	2017	212		A				265	273		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.034							WOS:000407186000029

Disentangling the Effects of Tillage Timing and Weather on Weed Community Assembly	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												The effect of tillage timing on weed community assembly was assessed at four locations in the Northeastern United States by tilling the soil every two weeks from April to September and quantifying the emerged weed community six weeks after each tillage event. Variance partitioning analysis was used to test the relative importance of tillage timing and weather on weed community assembly (106 weed species). At a regional scale, site (75.5% of the explained inertia)-and to a lesser extent, timing-of tillage (18.3%), along with weather (18.1%), shaped weed communities. At a local scale, the timing of tillage explained approximately 50% of the weed community variability. The effect of tillage timing, after partitioning out the effect of weather variables, remained significant at all locations. Weather conditions, mainly growing degree days, but also precipitation occurring before tillage, were important factors and could improve our ability to predict the impact of tillage timing on weed community assemblages. Our findings illustrate the role of disturbance timing on weed communities, and can be used to improve the timing of weed control practices and to maximize their efficacy.

However, all is not lost as we reveal that the propagules of some aquatic species could survive burial under agricultural fields in the sediments of 'ghost ponds' - ponds in-filled during agricultural land consolidation. Our experiments showed at least eight aquatic macrophyte species to germinate from seeds and oospores, following 50-150 years of dormancy in the sediments of ghost ponds. This represents a significant proportion of the expected macrophyte diversity for local farmland ponds, which typically support between 6 and 14 macrophyte species. The rapid ( < 6 months) re-colonisation of resurrected ghost ponds by a diverse aquatic vegetation similarly suggests a strong seed-bank influence. Ghost ponds represent abundant, dormant time capsules for aquatic species in agricultural landscapes around the globe, affording opportunities for enhancing landscape-scale aquatic biodiversity and connectivity. While reports of biodiversity loss through agricultural intensification dominate conservation narratives, our study offers a rare positive message, demonstrating that aquatic organisms survive prolonged burial under intensively managed agricultural fields. We urge conservationists and policy makers to consider utilizing and restoring these valuable resources in biodiversity conservation schemes and in agri-environmental approaches and policies.

Seed bank dynamics of blowout penstemon in relation to local patterns of sand movement on the Ferris Dunes, south-central Wyoming	BOTANY												Plants restricted to active sand dunes possess traits that enable both survival in a harsh environment and local migration in response to a shifting habitat mosaic. We examined seed bank dynamics of Penstemon haydenii S. Watson (blowout penstemon) in relation to local sand movement. We measured within-year sand movement along a 400 m transect and examined plant density, seed production, and seed density in relation to this movement. Plant densities were highest in areas of moderate sand movement. Annual seed rain averaged 13 seeds.m(-2), whereas persistent seed bank density (0-10 cm depth) averaged only 0.1 seeds.m(-2). A laboratory burial experiment with nondormant (chilled) seeds showed that most deeply buried seeds (>6 cm) were held in enforced dormancy under spring conditions, while seeds at intermediate depths (4-6 cm) were induced into secondary dormancy that was broken by subsequent drying and re-chilling, thus promoting seed carryover until the following spring. Most near-surface seeds produced seedlings. Enforced and secondary dormancy provide mechanisms for maintaining a persistent seed bank of more deeply buried seeds that could become part of the active seed bank as sand movement re-exposes them near the surface.

Ellery; Dixon, Kingsley			Overcoming topsoil deficits in restoration of semiarid lands: Designing hydrologically favourable soil covers for seedling emergence	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Topsoil replacement is a standard procedure in restoration of mined landscapes as it provides a source of propagules via the soil seed bank, as well as provides favourable physical, chemical and microbiological properties for plant establishment. With the availability of topsoil frequently limited in mining, soil cover designs that maximise the use of this resource across the newly-created surfaces after mining should be considered. In this paper, we examine the use of different soil covers and their influence on seedling recruitment for restoration of a Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) with limited topsoil. The properties of a standard topsoil and topsoil diluted with waste-rock to optimise spread were compared between two topsoil sources with different textures and a fine-textured waste material that is a mining by-product. We studied the physicochemical and hydrological traits of five soil covers (unblended TEC topsoil; TEC topsoil mixed with waste rock; fines; fines mixed with waste rock, and waste rock) with two TEC topsoil sources (plateau and hillslope). Soil characterisation included texture, gravel content, soil surface crust strength, soil moisture and temperature, and surface infiltration. Finally, we quantified seedling emergence for four key taxa sown (Acacia acuminata, Allocasuarina acutivalvis, Melaleuca nematophylla, Waitzia nitida) and the seedling community arising from the topsoil seedbank and naturally dispersed seeds, and related this emergence with the soil properties. The standard topsoil cover promoted the greatest seedling emergence showing marked differences between the two topsoil provenances. Importantly, the addition of waste rock to topsoil did not compromise the ability of topsoil to support seedling emergence and is therefore a useful strategy to maximise this resource. Overall, our results show the importance of hydrological properties of soil covers for seedling recruitment and highlight the importance of topsoil selection in restoration success.

Species identity influences secondary removal of seeds of Neotropical pioneer tree species	PLANT ECOLOGY												Primary dispersal agents move seeds from the maternal plant to the soil surface where they are often moved again by secondary dispersal agents. However, the extent to which different species in the same location experience secondary dispersal is often unknown despite the importance of this mechanism for determining recruitment opportunities and consequently community structure. Here we examine the secondary removal rates of 12 Neotropical pioneer species placed either on or 2 cm below the soil surface at five locations in lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We investigated whether species identity, primary dispersal mode (animal or wind), dormancy type, seed mass, and capacity to persist in the seed bank were correlated with removal rate. We also investigated whether season (dry or wet) influences removal from the soil surface. In general, both superficial and buried seeds were highly mobile. We found an effect of primary dispersal mode and dormancy type on removal rates both on (12 species) and beneath the soil surface (six species). However, this pattern was largely driven by species identity. Season had no influence on seed removal rates from the soil surface. The dispersal of small-seeded pioneer species is highly species dependent, indicating that generalizations made using broader categories, such as primary dispersal mode or dormancy type, do not accurately describe the observed patterns hindering our understanding of community assembly within even a single functional group of plants.

A total of 204 wild species useful for local communities of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley were collected and stored in seed banks in country for long term conservation, and 66 % (i.e., 134) duplicated in the U.K., as an effective means of ex situ conservation. Of the 204 species, 147 (122 of which also duplicated in the U.K.) were previously listed as useful plants in the ethnofloristic inventory of the Valley. Based on literature surveys, we found that one of the major impediments to the use of stored seeds of wild species is the lack of knowledge of how to germinate the seed. In detailed studies, we found that seeds of 18 useful plant species from 10 different families germinated readily and could be propagated. In contrast, four species (Actinocheita filicina, Bursera submoniliformis, Karwinskia mollis and Lippia graveolens) produced dormant seeds and therefore further studies are needed before their use can be maximised in large scale propagation programmes in support of conservation and livelihoods. Overall, this large-scale study on useful wild plant species in Mexico confirms that conventional seed banking can effectively support sustainable development and livelihood programmes.

Maintenance costs of serotiny in a variably serotinous pine: The role of water supply	PLOS ONE												Serotiny is an important adaptation for plants in fire-prone environments. However, different mechanisms also induce the opening of serotinous cones in the absence of fire in variably serotinous species. Xeriscence-cone opening driven by dry and hot conditions- is considered to be mediated only by the external environment, but endogenous factors could also play a significant role. Using the variably serotinous Pinus halepensis as our model species, we determined the effects of cone age and scales density in cone opening, and using in-situ and ex-situ manipulative experiments we investigated the role of water availability in the opening of serotinous cones. We hypothesized that loss of connection between the cones and the branch through the peduncles or the absence of water supply could induce a faster cone opening. Results showed that older cones lost more water and opened at lower temperatures, with no influence of scales density. Both field and chamber manipulative experiments ( using paired cones of the same whorl) confirmed that water intake through the peduncles affected significantly the pace of cone opening, such that lack of water supply speeded up cone dehiscence. However, this was true for weakly serotinous provenances - more common in this species -, while highly serotinous provenances were indifferent to this effect in the field test. All our results support that cone serotiny in P. halepensis involves the allocation of water to the cones, which is highly consistent with the previously observed environmental effects. Importantly, the existence of maintenance costs of serotinous cones has strong implications on the effects of climate change in the resilience of natural populations, via modifications of the canopy seed banks and recruitment after stand-replacing fires. Moreover, evolutionary models for serotiny in P. halepensis must take into account the significant contribution of maintenance costs to the complex interaction between genotype and the environment.

J	Schubert, N; Demes, K				Schubert, Nadine; Demes, Kyle			Phenotypic plasticity in the marine angiosperm Halophila decipiens (Hydrocharitaceae, Streptophyta)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Light availability is a central determinant of seagrass physiology and therefore distributional patterns. While climax species usually inhabit areas with favorable light conditions, poor competitors like Halophila decipiens Ostenf. are often marginalized into areas of low and high light levels. Thus, their ecological success relies on the ability to withstand and quickly acclimate to contrasting light conditions. Here we determined the acclimation of H. decipiens to different light availabilities and its capacity to rapidly adjust to changing light environments. Morphological and physiological traits differed among depths, with deeper plants having longer, wider leaves and higher photosynthetic performance. This agreed with the reported shade-adapted nature of this species and suggests that the wide tolerance to different light environments of H. decipiens is accompanied by costs resulting in an optimal phenotype for high-light environments, but occasioning a decrease in fitness, most likely related to higher investments in photoprotection and photodamage repair. This species exhibits efficient photoprotective mechanisms, related to energy dissipation, but we also detected chloroplast movement in response to light intensity, which most likely protects the photosynthetic apparatus under high-light stress through minimizing light absorption. H. decipiens also showed high plasticity through quick morphological and physiological adjustments upon transplantation, within days exhibiting characteristics consistent with plants that had originated from the transplant site. This rapidly responding plasticity, in addition to the high sexual reproduction of this species and the formation of extensive seed banks, is likely one of the key features to understanding this species' broad distribution and persistence when outcompeted to the distributional limits of dominant climax species.

J	Benvenuti, S; Pardossi, A				Benvenuti, Stefano; Pardossi, Alberto			Weed seedbank dynamics in Mediterranean organic horticulture	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												Managing weeds in organic cropping systems is notoriously difficult. We analyzed the seed bank dynamics in vegetable crop rotations carried out in both the typical Mediterranean scenarios of the open field and greenhouse. The lower seed bank detected in the greenhouse (about 53,000 seeds m(-2)) showed a higher emergence rate than the seed bank found in the open field, which was almost twice the size. This higher emergence rate was due both to: i) the more favorable temperature in the greenhouse, and ii) the less depth mediated soil-imposed dormancy, due to the seed bank being at a lower depth as a result of minimum tillage. A strong infestation of Cyperus rotundus was found in the greenhouse again, due to the tuber arrangement in the shallowest soil layer (0-10 cm). The ubiquitous and abundant Amaranthus retroflexus, taken as a model to investigate the dormancy-status of exhumed seeds showed that the lower emergence rate in the open field, was not due to dormancy but exclusively to depth-mediated soil inhibition. In addition, the calculation of various indexes of the weed seed bank botanical composition highlighted that the more quantitatively abundant greenhouse weed community was formed by more graminoid species (poaceae and cyperaceae), perennial species, C-4 photosynthetic pathway species and by lower biodiversity. Lastly agronomic strategies are proposed which could improve the weed control sustainability in organic cropping systems.																	0304-4238	1879-1018				JUL 14	2017	221						53	61		10.1016/j.scienta.2017.04.011							WOS:000405883400007

This work was carried out to investigate the viability of propagules present in the topsoil under campos de altitude vegetation, stockpiled for up to 12 months after the stripping of areas to be mined. In the south of Minas Gerais, Brazil, between November 2011 and November 2012, four collections of the seed bank were carried out, considering three depths (0 to 10, 90 to 100, and 190 to 200 cm) of the plot of stockpiled topsoil. Using the multivariate analysis, it was verified that the depth factor does not statistically affect the abundance of emerged individuals, while the factor time of stockpiling negatively affects the viability of the seeds. Some species were affected by the stockpiling conditions, only emerging in some collections, while others (Achyrocline satureioides, Ageratum fastigiatum, Baccharis dracunculifolia, Borreria capitata, Echinolaena inflexa and Melinis minutiflora) had individuals emerged in all collection periods. This study points out the need for the return of the topsoil until the fourth month of stocking, under the risk of monodominance, with a prevalence of species more adapted to predominant conditions of campos de altitude.

BOTANY												Protocols for the conservation of threatened plants are often constrained by the absence of data on germination ecology. However, seed bank managers periodically monitor the viability of stored seed collections using germination tests. Here, we argue that data from those tests can and should be used to provide information on germination requirements of threatened species. Twelve taxa endemic to Portugal were used as a test case to determine the effect of incubation temperature and pretreatments upon germination and to identify major factors eliciting germination and releasing dormancy. We achieved maximum germination percentages >95% for nine taxa. Temperature significantly affected the final germination and mean germination time in most taxa. Maximum and faster germination at cool temperatures (15 degrees C or alternate 20/10 degrees C) was the prevailing trend. Cold stratification improved germination in one species, suggesting physiological dormancy. Scarification increased the germination percentage of one species among those expected to exhibit physical dormancy. Seed bank data provided valuable information on germination ecology, which can be used in in-situ conservation and as a baseline for further germination studies. Given the increasing threats to plant diversity, accessibility to seed bank data are paramount.

Zonation of emergent freshwater macrophytes: Responses to small-scale variation in water depth	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Plant responses to hydrology are central to understanding the structure of wetland plant communities and to informing restoration efforts. The objectives of this study were to examine ecological responses of emergent plant species to water depth in a freshwater wetland in south-central New York (USA) and to test growth responses and associated nutrient relations for emergent species exposed to controlled water depths without interspecific competition in a greenhouse experiment. Field observations quantified the distribution of wetland plants in relation to water depth at Harpur Pond in the Binghamton University Nature Preserve. Presence or absence of plant species was noted in 0.25-m(2) quadrats, along 11 transects extending from the upland limit of emergents to their greatest depth in the pond. Ten of the 12 most frequent taxa showed significantly nonrandom distributions (P < 0.05). For example, Boehmeria cylindrica and Persicaria sagittata were more frequent > 0.2 m above the median water level, whereas Sparganium americanum and Leersia oryzoides were more frequent near it. In contrast, Eleocharis palustris was evenly distributed across the approximately 0.6-m elevational range. Species richness decreased significantly from the upper and middle ends to the lower end of the hydrological gradient, and plant community composition at the highest elevation was 80% dissimilar to that below the median water level. The greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effects of small-scale differences in water depth (-11 cm, -8 cm, -2 cm, and +3 cm in relation to the soil surface) on the growth and nutrient concentrations of transplanted ramets of five common wetland plant species: Juncus effusus, Scirpus cyperinus, L. oryzoides, Glyceria grandis, and S. americanum. After 45 days of growth, S. americanum had accumulated 96% greater biomass at 3 cm below the water level than at 11 cm above (P = 0.03 from one-way ANOVA), showing that minor differences in water depth can be important to plant success. Water depth did not significantly affect growth for the other four species. Greater biomass was correlated with lower tissue nitrogen concentration for S. americanum, L. oryzoides, and G. grandis and with lower phosphorus concentration for L. oryzoides and G. grandis, indicating that growth may result in nutrient dilution within tissues.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL	2017	144	3					254	266		10.3159/TORREY-D-16-00017.1							WOS:000406723200002

Timing of Tillage as a Driver of Weed Communities	WEED SCIENCE												Tillage is a foundational management practice in many cropping systems. Although effective at reducing weed populations and preparing a crop seedbed, tillage and cultivation can also dramatically alter weed community composition. We examined the impact of soil tillage timing on weed community structure at four sites across the northeastern United States. Soil was tilled every 2 wk throughout the growing season (late April to late September 2013), and weed seedling density was quantified by species 6 wk after each tillage event. We used a randomized complete block design with four replicates for each tillage-timing treatment; a total of 196 plots were sampled. The timing of tillage was an important factor in shaping weed community composition and structure at all sites. We identified three main periods of tillage timing that resulted in similar communities. Across all sites, total weed density tended to be greatest and weed evenness tended to be lowest when soils were tilled early in the growing season. From the earliest to latest group of timings, total abundance decreased on average from 428 +/- 393 to 159 +/- 189 plants m(-2), and evenness increased from 0.53 +/- 0.25 to 0.72 +/- 0.20. The effect of tillage timing on weed species richness varied by site. Our results show that tillage timing affects weed community structure, suggesting that farmers can manage weed communities and the potential for weed interference by adjusting the timing of their tillage and cropping practices.

This study investigated the spatial patterns of microfaunal and aquatic plant propagule bank communities within a wetland complex on the forested floodplain of a temperate Australian river system that had recently been completely inundated and dried again. Microfaunal emergence and aquatic plant germination were examined at the wetland complex spatial scale by incubating sediment samples collected from ten sites, randomly distributed within a 30 km(2) area of floodplain. Spatial (northing, easting and elevation) and environmental variables [commence-to-flow (CTF), % clay, % silt and % moisture] were also examined at each site to assist in describing the spatial patterns of the propagule banks across the floodplain. It was predicted that the microfaunal and aquatic plant propagule bank communities would be homogeneously distributed at the wetland complex scale in response to the recent widespread flooding. In contrast to our prediction, microfaunal and plant propagule bank communities varied among most sites, with this variation best explained by location (northing) and elevation (which was related to site CTF). This suggests that microfaunal and plant propagule bank communities are heterogeneously distributed in forested floodplain systems, even following widespread flooding events.

Soil seed bank resilience is, however, poorly understood, especially in regularly disturbed habitats like riparian zones. Two questions were asked: (1) what are the changes in species diversity experienced by riparian soil seed banks along successional trajectories, and (2) to what extent do riparian soil seed banks promote vegetation resilience during secondary succession? Location: Southeast Quebec, Canada. Methods: Soils were collected along five rivers in field edges and riverbanks of post-agricultural riparian zones with three contrasting successional stages (un-planted, planted with trees 15-17 yr prior to sampling, natural riparian forests), and their seed bank composition determined with the seedling emergence method. Species richness in seed banks was assessed along successional trajectories for distinct ecological groups, using LMM. The compositions of soil seed banks and standing vegetation (from botanical surveys) were compared based on NMDS and indicator species analysis. Results: Seed bank species richness decreased along successional trajectories. Tree-planted riparian zones were generally closer to unplanted riparian zones than to natural riparian forests, the latter being more species-rich for natives, trees, shrubs and zoochores, and species-poor for exotics, forbs and stress-tolerators. Likewise, seed bank species composition of unplanted and tree-planted riparian zones was similar but differed from that of natural riparian forests. Conversely, standing vegetation of tree-planted riparian zones was intermediate between early and late successional stages, at least at field edges. For the three successional stages, seed bank composition clearly differed from standing vegetation. Conclusions: The high resilience of riparian plant communities appeared poorly related to the dynamics of their soil seed banks. This species shift between seed banks and standing vegetation during secondary succession is likely due to periodic flooding, leading to the regular turnover of seeds. The resilience of riparian communities might thus be more influenced by spatial dispersal along rivers and across landscapes than by in situ temporal dispersal in soils.

In many crops, their utilization is hampered because they represent heterogeneous populations of heterozygous genotypes, which harbor a high genetic load. We show, with high-density genotyping in five landraces of maize, that libraries of doubled-haploid (DH) lines capture the allelic diversity of genetic resources in an unbiased way. By comparing allelic differentiation between heterozygous plants from the original landraces and 266 derived DH lines, we find conclusive evidence that, in the DH production process, sampling of alleles is random across the entire allele frequency spectrum, and purging of landraces from their genetic load does not act on specific genomic regions. Based on overall process efficiency, we show that generating DH lines is feasible for genetic material that has never been selected for inbreeding tolerance. We conclude that libraries of DH lines will make genetic resources accessible to crop improvement by linking molecular inventories of seed banks with meaningful phenotypes.

Mapping and exploring variation in post-fire vegetation recovery following mixed severity wildfire using airborne LiDAR	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There is a public perception that large high-severity wildfires decrease biodiversity and increase fire hazard by homogenizing vegetation composition and increasing the cover of mid-story vegetation. But a growing literature suggests that vegetation responses are nuanced. LiDAR technology provides a promising remote sensing tool to test hypotheses about post-fire vegetation regrowth because vegetation cover can be quantified within different height strata at fine scales over large areas. We assess the usefulness of airborne LiDAR data for measuring post-fire mid-story vegetation regrowth over a range of spatial resolutions (10 x 10 m, 30 x 30 m, 50 x 50 m, 100 x 100 m cell size) and investigate the effect of fire severity on regrowth amount and spatial pattern following a mixed severity wildfire in Warrumbungle National Park, Australia. We predicted that recovery would be more vigorous in areas of high fire severity, because park managers observed dense post-fire regrowth in these areas. Moderate to strong positive associations were observed between LiDAR and field surveys of mid-story vegetation cover between 0.5-3.0 m. Thus our LiDAR survey was an apt representation of on-ground vegetation cover. LiDAR-derived mid-story vegetation cover was 22-40% lower in areas of low and moderate than high fire severity. Linear mixed-effects models showed that fire severity was among the strongest biophysical predictors of mid-story vegetation cover irrespective of spatial resolution. However much of the variance associated with these models was unexplained, presumably because soil seed banks varied at finer scales than our LiDAR maps. Dense patches of mid-story vegetation regrowth were small (median size 0.01 ha) and evenly distributed between areas of low, moderate and high fire severity, demonstrating that high-severity fires do not homogenize vegetation cover. Our results are relevant for ecosystem conservation and fire management because they: indicate that native vegetation are responsive and resilient to high-severity fire, and show the usefulness of remote sensing tools such as LiDAR to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery over large areas in situ.

Understory vascular plant community assembly in relation to time-since-fire and environmental variables in a Chinese boreal forest	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Understanding the response of understory vegetation to fire disturbance is vital to biodiversity conservation and management of boreal forests. We surveyed understory vascular plant richness and composition, and measured related environmental variables along a toposequence within three successional stages, initial (3 years post-fire), early (13 years post-fire) and late (> 100 years post-fire) successional stages. Using permutation multivariate ANOVA and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, we analyzed how understory species richness and composition change as time-since-fire proceeds, and their correlative relationships with environmental variables. Species richness and composition showed significant differences among the three successional stages. Understory species richness and abundance were significantly associated with time-since-fire, topographic position, elevation and organic layer depth. Among these variables, time-since-fire had the strongest effect and topographic position was the second major factor on affecting understory community assembly. In addition, time-since-fire overwhelmed the effects of soil pH in the initial successional stage and gravimetric soil moisture in early and late successional stages on understory species composition.

Effects of anthropogenic disturbances on natural regeneration and population structure of gum arabic tree (Acacia senegal) in the woodlands of Lake Baringo ecosystem, Kenya	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Despite the ecological and economic importance of Acacia senegal, little is known about the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on its natural regeneration patterns and population structure. We investigated the effects of these factors within the Lake Baringo woodland ecosystem. Data was collected from 60 plots of 20 m x 20 m systematically distributed in four A. senegal-dominated populations within the Lake Baringo woodland. Sample populations spanned a degradation gradient measured by a population disturbance index (PDI). Trees were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH) and categorized by growth stages: seedling, sapling and adult tree. Higher seedling and sapling densities were recorded in lightly than heavily disturbed populations, but only sapling density was significantly different between the two disturbance levels (P = 0.02). Lightly disturbed populations revealed a reversed J-shape size-class distribution (SCD) indicative of stable structure unlike the heavily disturbed populations. The quotient and permutation indices indicated unstable populations with episodic recruitment and mortality. Our study reveals that natural regeneration and population structure of A. senegal were affected majorly by selective harvesting and heavy browsing. Suitable management strategies to control livestock grazing and illegal tree harvesting within the woodland is required to promote conservation of the species genetic resources.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				JUL	2017	28	4					775	785		10.1007/s11676-016-0349-4							WOS:000404234900014

Factors affecting soil seed banks of riparian communities in an agricultural ecosystem: potential for conservation of native plant diversity	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsDo agricultural land use and nitrogen (N) enrichment have negative effects on riparian soil seed banks? What is the potential of the soil seed bank for the conservation and restoration of native riparian plant diversity? Are non-native dominant grass species affected by agriculture and do they affect species richness? LocationSouth Nation River watershed (an agricultural watershed), Ontario, Canada. MethodsWe examined the riparian above-ground vegetation at 24 sites located across a large (similar to 4000km(2)) North American watershed and identified the corresponding soil seed bank composition from soil cores using the seedling emergence method. The above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank species compositions were compared in terms of species richness, percentage of non-native species and a floristic quality index. Factors affecting these descriptors of plants communities (concentration of in-stream nitrate and percentages of surrounding natural habitat and annual crop land) were assessed. The effects of agriculture on two dominant non-native grasses species and their effects on species richness were also assessed. ResultsIn total, 274 plant taxa were identified, including 181 taxa in the soil seed bank and 231 taxa in the vegetation. Overall species richness was high in both the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation and was unaffected by measures of agricultural intensity (surrounding annual crop land and N enrichment). Above-ground vegetation species richness was strongly negatively affected by the widespread and dominant non-native grasses, Phalaris arundinacea and Bromus inermis, whereas soil seed bank species richness was unaffected. The community compositions of both the soil seed bank and vegetation were negatively affected by the loss of natural habitat and by N enrichment. In fact, an increase in the percentage of non-native species and a decrease in floristic quality were observed along a gradient of agricultural intensity. ConclusionsSpecies richness of the soil seed bank demonstrated resilience to invasions by P.arundinacea and B. inermis, and the soil seed bank showed good potential for conservation of taxonomic diversity. However, the loss of natural habitat and N enrichment had negative effects on the soil seed bank community composition that may lead to an eventual decline in above-ground species richness.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				JUL	2017	20	3					446	458		10.1111/avsc.12313							WOS:000403676000013

Frequent inundation helps counteract land use impacts on wetland propagule banks	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionHow do contrasting influences of inundation and historical land uses affect restoration of soil propagule bank composition in floodplain wetlands? LocationNorthern Nature Reserve (large ephemeral floodplain), Macquarie Marshes, New South Wales, Australia. MethodsWe conducted germination assays on soil samples collected from fields with different land-use histories, stratified along an inundation gradient. We used GLM to determine whether native and exotic species richness and abundance varied along gradients of inundation and land use. ResultsSpecies richness and plant abundance in soil propagule banks were positively related to inundation and negatively related to intense historic land use. The abundance of native species was significantly higher in more frequently inundated areas. Abundances of exotic and ruderal species were higher in areas of intense prior land use. Overall species richness was generally similar across land-use histories. ConclusionsLand-use legacies compromised the ability of propagule banks to rejuvenate native vegetation in this floodplain wetland, especially in less frequently flooded parts of the floodplain, which harboured more ruderal and exotic species. Negative effects of prior land use may be alleviated by increased inundation. Native soil propagule banks were remarkably intact, providing a reservoir for restoration of wetland vegetation, even in soils highly disturbed by up to 20yr of agricultural cropping. With appropriate inundation, soil propagule banks in less degraded areas of the Macquarie Marshes can provide diverse mixtures of desired species in high abundance but, in highly degraded areas, full restoration may be delayed.

George			Seed Bank Depletion: The Key to Long-Term Downy Brome (Bromus tectorum L.) Management	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Invasive winter annual grasses such as downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) are a threat to native ecosystems throughout the United States. Downy brome is able to exploit moisture and nutrients throughout the fall and early spring before native plants break dormancy. This results in decreased native species abundance and development of monotypic downy brome stands. Short-term downy brome management has been shown to be effective; however, the soil seed reserve has often been overlooked, although it's the mechanism responsible for rapid reestablishment. This field study was conducted at two sites in Colorado to evaluate the longevity of the downy brome soil seed reserve and its implications on long-term downy brome control. Glyphosate plus adjuvant applications were made for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive years. Downy brome and perennial grass biomass harvests were conducted yearly to determine changes in species composition. In addition, soil cores were collected to evaluate the yearly variation and depletion of the downy brome soil seed bank in response to consecutive glyphosate applications. We found that 1-3 yr of consecutive glyphosate treatments were insufficient to deplete the downy brome soil seed bank. Downy brome biomass and the soil seed bank recovered within 1-2 yr after glyphosate treatments were terminated; however, 4 and 5 consecutive yr of glyphosate applications were sufficient to control downy brome through depletion of the soil seed bank. Managing downy brome for 4-5 consecutive yr resulted in a 4- to 9-fold increase in perennial grass biomass. These data suggest that long-term management of downy brome is dependent on eliminating the soil seed bank using a multiyear approach. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management.

Mass development of monospecific submerged macrophyte vegetation after the restoration of shallow lakes: Roles of light, sediment nutrient levels, and propagule density	AQUATIC BOTANY												After restoration, eutrophicated shallow freshwaters may show mass development of only one or two submerged macrophyte species, lowering biodiversity and hampering recreation. It is unclear which environmental factors govern this high percentage of the volume inhabited (PVI2) by submerged macrophytes, and whether the development of a more diverse, low canopy vegetation is likely to occur if dominant species decline in abundance. We hypothesized that (1) adequate light and high sediment nutrient availability leads to massive development of submerged macrophytes, and (2) that macrophyte species richness is low at high PVI, but that this is not caused by a lack of viable propagules of non-dominant species (especially charophytes). To test these hypotheses, fifteen shallow waters in the Netherlands were studied with respect to submerged vegetation (including propagules), water, and sediment characteristics. The probability of high submerged macrophyte PVI is highest in shallow waters where light availability in the water layer and phosphorus availability in the sediment are abundant. These conditions typically occur upon restoration of eutrophic waterbodies by reducing water nutrient loading or applying biomanipulation. Other factors, as top-down control, can additionally influence realised PVI. Viable propagules of species other than the dominant ones, including charophytes, were found in most of the sediments, indicating that once the dominant species declines, there is local potential for a diverse submerged vegetation to develop. Results can be used to predict when mass development occurs and to tackle the factors causing mass development.				van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Lamers, Leon P.M./A-8718-2012; Bakker, Elisabeth S/B-7185-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Lamers, Leon P.M./0000-0003-3769-2154; Bakker, Elisabeth S/0000-0002-5900-9136; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X												0304-3770	1879-1522				JUL	2017	141						29	38		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.04.004							WOS:000404320800005

However, the length of time for cultivated peatland to be restored to natural climax level in terms of vegetation remained unknown. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the characteristics of hydrology, plant community, and soil in abandoned 0-, 2-, 15-, and 30-year-old paddy lands and a natural peatland. The results showed a long-term rise in water level after restoration. Similarity indexes between restored sites and natural peatland also increased with the extension of restoration time. During the first three years after abandonment, weeds grew vigorously and almost overtook the entire experimental site. However, the plant community was dominated by a Carex schmidtii-Phragmites australis-Thelypteris palustris community, where similarity increased to 64% and vegetation succession approached a natural climax community after 15 years of restoration. Compared with the paddy field, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic matter (TOM) in the soil at 0-30 cm depth and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm showed no significant change after 2 years of restoration. In the 15-year restoration site, however, TN and TOM at 0-30 cm increased by 108% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.01), and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm decreased by 40% compared with the paddy field (P < 0.05), and the values were already similar to the 30-year site and the natural peatland. Those findings indicate that the cultivated peatland could be restored effectively through natural succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wyse, SV; Dickie, JB				Wyse, Sarah V.; Dickie, John B.			Predicting the global incidence of seed desiccation sensitivity	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. The ability of seeds to tolerate desiccation plays an important role in plant regeneration ecology. Globally, the majority of species produce desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) seeds, while comparatively few produce desiccation- sensitive (recalcitrant) seeds that are unable to survive dehydration. The trait has important implications for species conservation, as desiccation-sensitive species cannot be conserved using traditional seed banking techniques. In addition, these species may be less resilient to the increases in droughts predicted for some regions under climate change scenarios. 2. The best available resource on seed desiccation tolerance is the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew's Seed Information Database. This database contains seed desiccation-sensitivity data for over 18 000 taxa, approximately 3% of which have desiccation-sensitive seeds. However, this database is likely biased towards desiccation-tolerant species. Previous attempts to estimate the proportion of seed plants with desiccation-sensitive seeds have ranged from 7% to 50%. Here, we aimed to overcome sampling bias to derive a best estimate for the proportion of seed plants with desiccation-sensitive seeds, based on current data. 3. We used a recently developed method, based on taxonomic relatedness, to account for sampling bias and estimate the proportion of seed plants with desiccation-sensitive seeds. As a comparison, given that seed desiccation sensitivity is strongly related to habitat, we repeated our analyses using habitat as a basis. 4. The predictions from our taxonomy-based models ranged between estimates of 7.5% and 19.6% of the world's seed-plant species with desiccation-sensitive seeds, depending on model type, while the habitat-based models suggested a value of approximately 8%. Our evidence suggests that, based on current data, the best estimate of the proportion of species with desiccation-sensitive seeds is likely to be approximately 8%. Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests had the highest incidence of seed desiccation sensitivity, where an estimated 18.5% of the seed-plant flora possessed the trait. 5. Synthesis. Alongside our estimation of the numbers of species with desiccation-sensitive seeds, we provide data on taxa and habitats where this trait may be most prevalent. These findings can be used to support conservation planning, particularly with respect to providing decision support for in and ex situ conservation techniques.

A framework for the practical science necessary to restore sustainable, resilient, and biodiverse ecosystems	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Demand for restoration of resilient, self-sustaining, and biodiverse natural ecosystems as a conservation measure is increasing globally; however, restoration efforts frequently fail to meet standards appropriate for this objective. Achieving these standards requires management underpinned by input from diverse scientific disciplines including ecology, biotechnology, engineering, soil science, ecophysiology, and genetics. Despite increasing restoration research activity, a gap between the immediate needs of restoration practitioners and the outputs of restoration science often limits the effectiveness of restoration programs. Regrettably, studies often fail to identify the practical issues most critical for restoration success. We propose that part of this oversight may result from the absence of a considered statement of the necessary practical restoration science questions. Here we develop a comprehensive framework of the research required to bridge this gap and guide effective restoration. We structure questions in five themes: (1) setting targets and planning for success, (2) sourcing biological material, (3) optimizing establishment, (4) facilitating growth and survival, and (5) restoring resilience, sustainability, and landscape integration. This framework will assist restoration practitioners and scientists to identify knowledge gaps and develop strategic research focused on applied outcomes. The breadth of questions highlights the importance of cross-discipline collaboration among restoration scientists, and while the program is broad, successful restoration projects have typically invested in many or most of these themes. Achieving restoration ecology's goal of averting biodiversity losses is a vast challenge: investment in appropriate science is urgently needed for ecological restoration to fulfill its potential and meet demand as a conservation tool.

In this study, we combined field data of dispersal behavior of birds and GIS information of patch attributes to estimate how frugivorous birds could affect the effective dispersal pattern of Chinese yew (Taxus chinensis) in a fragmented and disturbed forest. Nine bird species were observed to visit T. chinensis trees, with Urocissa erythrorhyncha, Zoothera dauma and Picus canus being the most common dispersers. After foraging, six disperser species exhibited different perching patterns. Three specialist species, P. canus, Turdus hortulorum, and Z. dauma stayed in the source patch, while three generalist species, U. erythrorhyncha, Hypsipetes mcclellandii, and H. castanonotus, could perch in bamboo patches and varied in movement ability due to body size. As a consequence of perching, dispersers significantly contributed to the seed bank, but indirectly affected seedling recruitment. Moreover, the recruitment of T. chinensis was also affected by patch attributes in a fragmented forest (distances to source patch, patch type, size). Our results highlighted the ability of unique source population regeneration of T. chinensis in a fragmented forest, with high dependence on both frugivorous birds and patch attributes, which should be considered in future planning for forest management and conservation.

The seed bank of P. aegyptiaca rapidly develops and spreads in the field. Knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of such weeds is required in advance of emergence, as they emerge late in their life cycle when they have already caused major crop damage. The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of two major internal infestation sources: crop rotation and infestation history; and one external source: proximity to infested tomato fields; on infestation of P. aegyptiaca in processing tomatoes. Ecoinformatics, spatial analysis and geostatistics were used to examine these effects. A regional survey was conducted to collect data on field history from 238 tomato fields between 2000 and 2012, in a major tomato-growing region in Israel. Multivariate logistic regression in the framework of generalized linear models (GLM) has demonstrated the importance of all three variables in predicting infestation in tomato fields. The parameters of the overall model indicated a high specificity between tomatoes and P. aegyptiaca, which is potentially responsible for aggravating infestation. In addition, P. aegyptiaca infestation levels were intensively mapped in 43 of the 238 tomato fields in the years 2010-2012. Geostatistical measures showed that 40% of the fields had clustered infestation spatial patterns with infestation clusters located along the fields' borders. Strong linear and negative relationships were found between infestation level and distance from a neighboring infested field, strengthening the role of infested tomato fields in P. aegyptiaca spread. An experiment specifically designed for this study showed that during harvest, P. aegyptiaca seeds are blown from an infested field to a distance of at least 90 m, and may initiate infestation in neighboring fields. Integrating current knowledge about the role of agricultural practices on the spread of P. aegyptiaca with the results of this study enabled us to propose a mechanism for the spread of P. aegyptiaca. Given the major effect of agricultural practices on infestation levels, it is assumed that the spread of this weed can be suppressed by implementing sanitation and using decision support tools for herbicide application.

Emerald ash borer biocontrol in ash saplings: The potential for early stage recovery of North American ash trees	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In many parts of North America, ash (Fraxinus) stands have been reduced by the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) invasion to a few surviving mature trees, saplings, basal sprouts, and seedlings. Without a soil seed bank for Fraxinus spp., tree recovery will require survival and maturation of these younger cohorts to reproductive age.

At these sites, the outbreak population of the pest collapsed during the study, and a biocontrol agent introduced from China, the larval parasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi, became widely established and increased in rates of parasitism. To assess the potential for ash recovery in these stands, we also quantified the abundance and crown condition of the ash saplings and surviving ash trees at the study sites. We found that T. planipennisi was the dominant biotic mortality factor in saplings, killing 36-85% of the late instar borer larvae. Neither woodpecker predation nor native parasitoids caused more than minor levels (<20%) of borer mortality in saplings. Life table analyses of these data further showed that the net population growth rate of the pest in saplings was near or under replacement levels, and that the introduced biocontrol agent reduced the pest's net population growth rate in saplings at our study sites by over 50%. In addition, stand inventories found that healthy ash saplings (4-16 per 100 m(2)) and smaller (pole size) trees (2-9 per 100 m(2)) remained in the six study sites, despite an early high density population of the pest at the sites. These findings indicate that the introduced biocontrol agent T. planipennisi is providing significant biocontrol services, enhancing ash survival and promoting recovery of the ash in southern Michigan.

Contrasting influences of inundation and land use on the rate of floodplain restoration	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												This study examined the assisted natural restoration of native vegetation in an Australian floodplain wetland where flows were reinstated and the river was reconnected to the floodplain, following cessation of agricultural cultivation. Extant vegetation was surveyed three times during an inundation event at plots with different land-use histories. Restoration rate was more influenced by past land use than long-term inundation frequency and success decreased with antecedent land-use intensity. Prolonged land-use history (>3years cultivation) restricted restoration success. Sites with longer cultivation histories tended to have fewer aquatic species, more terrestrial species and exotic species. For example, amphibious responders with floating leaves were found only in reference plots and less frequently in farmed treatment plots. In this scenario, increased persistence of exotics and dryland species suggested alternative trajectories. Fields with a short land-use history (1-3years of clearing and cultivation) resembled undisturbed floodplain communities, consistent with a field of dreams' hypothesis. Although river-floodplain reconnections can restore wetlands, legacy effects of past land use may limit the pace and outcomes of restoration.

Shallow top soil removal (TSR) up to 40 cm was applied to remove the upper degraded peat layer in order to eliminate accumulated nutrients and unwanted seed banks as well as generating material for infilling drain ditchesand building dams. This measure has well known positive effects on species development, but very little was known about the phosphorus (P) status in the newly exposed peat soils and porewater. Therefore, we investigated (i) the P mobilisation potential of surface peat soils, (ii) net P release rates in intact soil cores with different degree of peat decomposition, and (iii) P concentrations in porewater of rewetted fen areas with TSR compared to areas without removal and refilled drain ditches. We highlighted that TSR strongly reduced the P mobilisation potential and thereby also the concentration of dissolved P in the porewater at the peat surface. Furthermore, we found low net P release rates close to 0 mg P m(-2) d(-1)( median, n = 9) in the cut-over areas with less degraded peat similar to those documented for natural fens. Despite of high P concentrations up to 2.6 mg L-1 in rewetted areas without TSR (about 50% of total peatland area) there was no evidence of elevated P export to other low-nutrient areas of the fen or in aclose-by lake due to high P retention capacity of the iron-rich degraded peat (molar Fe: P ratios >10). It can be concluded that TSR is a suitable measure to recover nutrient poor conditions in rewetted fens in a relatively short time frame instead of decades to centuries compared to rewetting measures without TSR. This measure is highly recommended if degraded peatlands are characterised by a low P retention capacity or low molar Fe/P ratios in degraded peat (<10) respectively and above all if downstream areas include nutrient-poor systems highly sensitive regarding slightly increased P inputs.

Recently, glyphosate-resistant Italian ryegrass was found on paddy levees in central Japan, thereby making control of the grass by using glyphosate less effective. In this study, physical control methods were tested that combined the timing and frequency of mowing in order to more effectively control glyphosate-resistant Italian ryegrass on rice paddy levees. A 3 year field experiment was conducted from 2012 to 2014 in a western region of Shizuoka Prefecture, where glyphosate-resistant Italian ryegrass has become dominant. Five treatments were tested: (i) mowing once before the flowering of the grass (i.e. conventional mowing measure); (ii) mowing once during flowering; (iii) mowing twice during flowering; (iv) glyphosate application before flowering (i.e. one of the conventional mowing measures); and (v) no treatment. The above-ground biomass, seed production, soil seed bank and seedling occurrence of Italian ryegrass were measured to determine the effectiveness of these treatments. Mowing during the flowering period resulted in reduced above-ground biomass, seed production and soil seed bank when compared with the other treatments. Additionally, mowing twice during the flowering period resulted in a lower seedling density than mowing once. The results suggest that, in this region, physical control by mowing during the flowering period would be more effective than conventional measures for controlling glyphosate-resistant Italian ryegrass.

J	den Hollander, F; Pederzani, G				den Hollander, Frank; Pederzani, Giulia			Multi-colony Wright-Fisher with seed-bank	INDAGATIONES MATHEMATICAE-NEW SERIES												We consider a multi-colony version of the Wright Fisher model with seed-bank that was recently introduced by Blath et al. Individuals live in colonies and change type via resampling and mutation. Each colony contains a seed-bank that acts as a genetic reservoir. Individuals can enter the seed-bank and become dormant or can exit the seed-bank and become active. In each colony at each generation a fixed fraction of individuals swap state, drawn randomly from the active and the dormant population. While dormant, individuals suspend their resampling. While active, individuals resample from their own colony, but also from different colonies according to a random walk transition kernel representing migration. Both active and dormant individuals mutate. We are interested in the probability that two individuals drawn randomly from two given colonies are identical by descent, i.e., share a common ancestor. This probability, which depends on the locations of the two colonies, is a measure for the inbreeding coefficient of the population. We derive a formula for this probability that is valid when the colonies form a discrete torus. We consider the special case of a symmetric slow seed-bank, for which in each colony half of the individuals are in the seed-bank and at each generation the fraction of individuals that swap state is small. This leads to a simpler formula, from which we are able to deduce how the probability to be identical by descent depends on the distance between the two colonies and various relevant parameters. Through an analysis of random walk Green functions, we are able to derive explicit scaling expressions when mutation is slower than migration. We also compute the spatial second moment of the probability to be identical by descent for all parameters when the torus becomes large. For the special case of a symmetric slow seed-bank, we again obtain explicit scaling expressions. (C) 2017 Royal Dutch Mathematical Society (KWG). Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Ferreira, MC; Vieira, DLM				Ferreira, Maxmiller Cardoso; Mascia Vieira, Daniel Luis			Topsoil for restoration: Resprouting of root fragments and germination of pioneers trigger tropical dry forest regeneration	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Tropsoil translocation has been effective for the restoration of plant communities, but until recently this method had not been used for tropical dry forest restoration. We tested different methods of topsoil deposition for restoring a dry forest on an abandoned limestone quarry. We also tested the effects of irrigation during the first dry season after topsoil deposition. The study was conducted in the Federal District of Brazil. A 2.1-ha area was cleared of vegetation, and the topsoil from that site was deposited on an exotic pasture field 1.4 km away. First, a secondary forest was clear-cut, and the first 30 cm of topsoil were removed and translocated. The soil was transported in dump trucks to the deposition site, which had been scarified in advance, and deposited by either forming 1.25-m-tall mounds or by leveling the soil into a 40-cm or 20-cm deep layer using a hydraulic excavator. The seed bank and the availability of root and stem fragments in the soil were both surveyed. The origin of the regenerants was categorized as either from seed or resprouting. We estimated vegetation cover for each life form, and measured all trees and lianas. After six months, 74% of the tree individuals and 60% of the liana individuals came from resprouting. Ruderal herbs and shrubs germinated from seeds. After 28 months, there were 51 species of trees, 8 species of lianas, 12 species of shrubs, and 34 species of herbs in the deposition treatments. The three deposition treatments were thickly covered with herbaceous/shrubby species, and had nine times the number of species (44 vs. 5) and five times the tree density (1.17 ind./m(2) vs. 0.25 ind./m(2)) as the non deposition control. Tree survival was relatively high in both the non-irrigated and irrigated treatments. The total cost of topsoil translocation was 9604 USD, and the output was 0.43 ha deposited/ha excavated when forming mounds of soil, 5951 USD and output of 0.75 when leveling to a 40-cm layer, and 3551 USD and 1.5 for a 20-cm layer of deposited material. However, deposition and transportation costs are fixed costs of establishing a new quarry that can be deducted from the total cost of restoration. Topsoil translocation was effective in kick-starting the succession process of a tropical dry forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We studied the Wanzhou draw-down zones in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region via field investigations and soil seed bank (SSB) germination experiments. The composition and spatial distribution of the SSB in the planted and natural restored sites revealed the effects of restoration modes on seed bank development and demonstrated responses of SSB composition and structure to water fluctuation. The SSB of planted sites contained 43 species of plants, with a mean seed bank density of 9418.79 seeds/m(2), where annual herb species accounted for 57.34%. The SSB at natural restored sites had 38 species of plants, with a mean seed bank density of 6090.09 seeds/m(2), where annual herb species accounted for 52.57% of the species. Species diversity was low and annual plants dominated the two restoration sites. SSB species diversity was the highest in mid to upper levels of the draw-down zones. Plantation has increased co-occurrence species of SSB and standing vegetation, and increased their similarity. The number of co-occurrence dominant species of SSB and standing vegetation in planted areas was greater than in natural restored areas. However, the stability of plant communities naturally restored was greater than artificial plant communities as there was a higher proportion of perennials in the SSB with more dominant species similar to standing plant communities. In conclusion, the reverse water-level fluctuation simplified the species composition and shaped the spatial distribution of the SSB at the two restoration sites, and plantation promotes the development both of SSB and vegetation. However, plant communities of the two restoration areas, influenced by water-level fluctuations, will be mainly grasslands dominated by annual plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Curry, HA				Curry, Helen Anne			From working collections to the World Germplasm Project: agricultural modernization and genetic conservation at the Rockefeller Foundation	HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES												This paper charts the history of the Rockefeller Foundation's participation in the collection and long-term preservation of genetic diversity in crop plants from the 1940s through the 1970s. In the decades following the launch of its agricultural program in Mexico in 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation figured prominently in the creation of world collections of key economic crops. Through the efforts of its administrators and staff, the foundation subsequently parlayed this experience into a leadership role in international efforts to conserve so-called plant genetic resources. Previous accounts of the Rockefeller Foundation's interventions in international agricultural development have focused on the outcomes prioritized by foundation staff and administrators as they launched assistance programs and especially their characterization of the peoples and "problems'' they encountered abroad. This paper highlights instead how foundation administrators and staff responded to a newly emergent international agricultural concern-the loss of crop genetic diversity. Charting the foundation's responses to this concern, which developed only after agricultural modernization had begun and was understood to be produced by the successes of the foundation's own agricultural assistance programs, allows for greater interrogation of how the foundation understood and projected its central position in international agricultural research activities by the 1970s.																	0391-9714	1742-6316				JUN	2017	39	2							UNSP 5	10.1007/s40656-017-0131-8							WOS:000402883100001	28321799					
J	Paniw, M; Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Ojeda, F; Salguero-Gomez, R				Paniw, Maria; Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F.; Ojeda, Fernando; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto			Accounting for uncertainty in dormant life stages in stochastic demographic models	OIKOS												Dormant life stages are often critical for population viability in stochastic environments, but accurate field data characterizing them are difficult to collect. Such limitations may translate into uncertainties in demographic parameters describing these stages, which then may propagate errors in the examination of population-level responses to environmental variation. Expanding on current methods, we 1) apply data-driven approaches to estimate parameter uncertainty in vital rates of dormant life stages and 2) test whether such estimates provide more robust inferences about population dynamics. We built integral projection models (IPMs) for a fire-adapted, carnivorous plant species using a Bayesian framework to estimate uncertainty in parameters of three vital rates of dormant seeds - seed-bank ingression, stasis and egression. We used stochastic population projections and elasticity analyses to quantify the relative sensitivity of the stochastic population growth rate (log s) to changes in these vital rates at different fire return intervals. We then ran stochastic projections of log s for 1000 posterior samples of the three seed-bank vital rates and assessed how strongly their parameter uncertainty propagated into uncertainty in estimates of log s and the probability of quasi-extinction, P-q(t). Elasticity analyses indicated that changes in seed-bank stasis and egression had large effects on log s across fire return intervals. In turn, uncertainty in the estimates of these two vital rates explained > 50% of the variation in log s estimates at several fire-return intervals. Inferences about population viability became less certain as the time between fires widened, with estimates of P-q(t) potentially > 20% higher when considering parameter uncertainty. Our results suggest that, for species with dormant stages, where data is often limited, failing to account for parameter uncertainty in population models may result in incorrect interpretations of population viability.

O.; Fidelis, Alessandra			A field perspective on effects of fire and temperature fluctuation on Cerrado legume seeds	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Information from a field perspective on temperature thresholds related to physical dormancy (PY) alleviation and seed resistance to high temperatures of fire is crucial to disentangle fire- and non-fire-related germination cues. We investigated seed germination and survival of four leguminous species from a frequently burned open Neotropical savanna in Central Brazil. Three field experiments were conducted according to seed location in/on the soil: (1) fire effects on exposed seeds; (2) fire effects on buried seeds; and (3) effects of temperature fluctuations on exposed seeds in gaps and shaded microsites in vegetation. After field treatments, seeds were tested for germination in the laboratory, together with the control (non-treated seeds). Fire effects on exposed seeds decreased viability in all species. However, germination of buried Mimosa leiocephala seeds was enhanced by fire in an increased fuel load treatment, in which we doubled the amount of above-ground biomass. Germination of two species (M. leiocephala and Harpalyce brasiliana) was enhanced with temperature fluctuation in gaps, but this condition also decreased seed viability. Our main conclusions are: (1) most seeds died when exposed directly to fire; (2) PY could be alleviated during hotter fires when seeds were buried in the soil; and (3) daily temperature fluctuations in gaps also broke PY of seeds on the soil surface, so many seeds could be recruited or die before being incorporated into the soil seed banks. Thus seed dormancy-break and germination of legumes from Cerrado open savannas seem to be driven by both fire and temperature fluctuations.

However, seed size also increases independently in dry habitats, and since seed size is in a trade-off with seed number, size of seed banks is expected to increase in moister habitats. Therefore, we wanted to test if seed abundance in soil increases in wet habitats, if seed size increases in dry habitats, and if spread of seeds along the gradient is higher for plants of intermediate habitats in local moisture gradients. We studied 15 temporary pools in three biogeographically separated wetlands in Southern France. For each pool we studied five different moisture levels, totalling 75 local plant communities. We quantified soil seed bank by the seedling emergence method, seed size and an index of spatial spread of seeds in the soil for every species. We also quantified water levels for each plot. We found increasing abundance of seeds in the soil with increasing water levels but lower seed size and higher spread at intermediate water levels. When we controlled for niche position, we found no trade-off between seed size, spread and abundance in the soil seed bank. Type and importance of risk reduction strategies thus appeared to be strongly driven by the plant species moisture niche and the spatial arrangement of water levels.

Cryoprotectants: A review of the actions and applications of cryoprotective solutes that modulate cell recovery from ultra-low temperatures	CRYOBIOLOGY												Cryopreservation has become a central technology in many areas of clinical medicine, biotechnology, and species conservation within both plant and animal biology. Cryoprotective agents (CPAs) invariably play key roles in allowing cells to be processed for storage at deep cryogenic temperatures and to be recovered with high levels of appropriate functionality. As such, these CPA solutes possess a wide range of metabolic and biophysical effects that are both necessary for their modes of action, and potentially complicating for cell biological function. Early successes with cryopreservation were achieved by empirical methodology for choosing and applying CPAs. In recent decades, it has been possible to assemble objective information about CPA modes of action and to optimize their application to living systems, but there still remain significant gaps in our understanding. This review sets out the current status on the biological and chemical knowledge surrounding CPAs, and the conflicting effects of protection versus toxicity resulting from the use of these solutes, which are often required in molar concentrations, far exceeding levels found in normal metabolism. The biophysical properties of CPAs that allow them to facilitate different approaches to cryogenic storage, including vitrification, are highlighted. The topics are discussed with reference to the historical background of applying CPAs, and the relevance of cryoprotective solutes in natural freeze tolerant organisms. Improved cryopreservation success will be an essential step in many future areas such as regenerative medicine, seed banking, or stem cell technology. To achieve this, we will need to further improve our understanding of cryobiology, where better and safer CPAs will be key requirements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Mummey, DL; Ramsey, PW				Mummey, Daniel L.; Ramsey, Philip W.			Can Sainfoin Improve Conditions for Establishment of Native Forbs in Crested Wheatgrass Stands?	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Concerns about wildlife habitat quality in western North America has stimulated interest in diversifying Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass) stands. Four main obstacles make it difficult to establish native forbs in stands of A. cristatum. First, adult A. cristatum plants are fierce competitors with native seedlings. Second, A. cristatum seedlings emerging from a long-lived seedbank can crowd out native species. Third, A. cristatum control may facilitate secondary invaders rather than the desired native species. Fourth, potential soil modification by A. cristatum may impede establishment of diverse native plant species. A "bridge species" that is compatible with A. cristatum control and improves conditions for native species establishment could facilitate A. cristatum stand diversification. We compared native forb growth in soils of former A. cristatum stands preconditioned by A. cristatum, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), and Onobrychis viciifolia (sainfoin), a glyphosate-tolerant legume. Soils preconditioned by O. viciifolia had the greatest P and K availability. Although total plant biomass was similar among treatments, native forbs had greater root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, less root colonization by non-AM fungal, and lower root-shoot ratios when grown in O. viciifolia-conditioned soils, suggesting improved soil microbe and nutrient conditions for native forb establishment. We conclude that O. viciifolia may be a useful bridge species for improving soil conditions while allowing for weed control during restoration of A. cristatum stands.																	1543-4060	1543-4079				JUN	2017	35	2					127	137		10.3368/er.35.2.127							WOS:000456498000007						
J	Clements, H; Bierzychudek, P				Clements, Hannah; Bierzychudek, Paulette			Can the Persistent Seed Bank Contribute to the Passive Restoration of Urban Forest Fragments After Invasive Species Removal?	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Urban forest fragments are vulnerable to invasion by non-native species, and invaded forests are increasingly targeted for invasive species removals. Our goal was to determine the extent to which persistent seed banks can contribute to the recruitment of native forest species into urban forest fragments from which invasive plant species have been removed. In a greenhouse, we germinated seeds from soil samples from three forest fragments in Portland, Oregon, US. All sites had been invaded by Hedera hibernica (Irish ivy) and H. helix (English ivy), Clematis vitalba (virgin's bower), Ilex aquifolium (English holly), and Prunus laurocerasus (English laurel). At one site, these species had been removed three years prior to our study. Emergents represented 53 taxa, classified as: native forest species, native non-forest species, and non-native species. We observed few native forest species (5-12/site); 29-83% of samples contained these species, at median densities of 0-2 seeds/sample/site. Non-native species were more diverse (12-17/site), more frequent (75-89% of samples), and denser (median = 2-5 seeds/sample/site). Clematis vitalba seeds were especially abundant. Invasive removal had little effect on the persistent seed bank; however, the least-invaded site had the highest richness, frequency, and density of native forest species. The low richness and abundance of native forest species is not necessarily a concern, because many forest species do not form persistent seed banks. The annual seed rain can regenerate native species whose density has been diminished by invasive plant species and their removal. However, managers wishing to restore absent species should plan to follow removal efforts with active revegetation.																	1543-4060	1543-4079				JUN	2017	35	2					156	166		10.3368/er.35.2.156							WOS:000456498000010

Extended autumn drought, but not nitrogen deposition, affects the diversity and productivity of a Mediterranean grassland	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Global change is affecting ecosystems worldwide. Nitrogen (N) deposition is increasing globally and climate change scenarios forecast an increase of prolonged autumn droughts particularly in the Mediterranean regions. Mediterranean grasslands occupy 1.3 million km(2) of the terrestrial surface, host high biodiversity values and generate important ecosystem services. Understanding the effects of N deposition and prolonged autumn drought on the productivity and dynamics of Mediterranean grasslands is crucial to support the conservation of these ecosystems in a global change context. We assessed the effects of extended autumn drought and N deposition on the productivity, species diversity, and phenology of a Mediterranean grassland through a manipulative, greenhouse, experiment. We simulated three levels of extended drought: no drought, 50 days and 100 days of drought and two levels of N deposition: no N and N addition, through a factorial design experiment. Severe drought (100 days) affected negatively grassland productivity, through a reduction of the growing season duration and accumulated growing degree days. Moderate drought (50 days) affected productivity negatively but productivity values recovered to levels similar to those of the non-drought treatment. Severe and moderate drought delayed plant phenology decreasing significantly the number of individuals with mature flowers and with fruits or seeds. Plant functional groups responded differently to drought with productivity of forbs, but not productivity of graminoids and legumes, being negatively affected by moderate and severe drought. N addition did not affect grassland productivity, diversity or phenology. Our results anticipate effects of climate change on the productivity and species composition of Mediterranean grasslands.

The effect of forest fragmentation on the soil seed bank of Central Amazonia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Deforestation of tropical forests has contributed to the formation of fragmented landscapes, surrounded mainly by a matrix of secondary forests, pastures and agriculture. In this study we evaluated the fragment-area effects on the density, diversity and composition of the soil seed bank. Fragments of primary forest of different sizes (1,10 and 100 ha) and continuous primary forests were sampled in a region of terra firme forest in Central Amazonia. We collected 180 soil samples (45 samples per treatment), and monitored seedling emergence from the soil seed bank in a greenhouse for seven months. Density of emerged seedlings, floristic composition, richness and diversity of species were compared among treatments with Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test, Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's Alpha diversity index and Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Seedling density was inversely proportional to the size of the fragment, being higher in fragments of 1 ha, 10 ha, and lower in the primary forest and fragments of 100 ha. Diversity was higher in the fragments when compared to the primary forests. Melastomataceae was the most abundant family in all treatments. Species composition changed along the disturbance gradient, and is dominated, in the smaller fragments by species that are indicators of degraded environments. Results suggested that the area of the forest fragments affects the size and composition of the soil seed bank, and can significantly influence the potential resilience and regeneration of these sites in the event of natural or anthropic disturbance.

Although climate warming is projected to continue into the future, studies examining long-term resilience of semiarid forests against climate change are limited. In this study, long-term forest resilience was defined as the capacity of forest recruitment to compensate for losses from mortality. We observed an obvious change in long-term forest resilience along a local aridity gradient by reconstructing tree growth trend and disturbance history and investigating postdisturbance regeneration in semiarid forests in southern Siberia. In our study, with increased severity of local aridity, forests became vulnerable to drought stress, and regeneration first accelerated and then ceased. Radial growth of trees during 1900-2012 was also relatively stable on the moderately arid site. Furthermore, we found that smaller forest patches always have relatively weaker resilience under the same climatic conditions. Our results imply a relatively higher resilience in arid timberline forest patches than in continuous forests; however, further climate warming and increased drought could possibly cause the disappearance of small forest patches around the arid tree line. This study sheds light on climate change adaptation and provides insight into managing vulnerable semiarid forests.

Asch in the Czech Republic, Central Europe: does burial depth and sediment type influence seed germination?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Littorella uniflora (Plantaginaceae) is a scarce and declining aquatic plant in Europe. Its population has been strongly reduced by changes in fishpond management (eutrophication) in the Czech Republic since the 1950s. We studied its seed bank in both recent (n = 8) and historical localities (the last found from 1972 to 2000; n = 10) and tested the effects of sediment type and burial depth on seed germination using extracted seeds from two recent populations. The seeds were found in 60% of the historical localities, mostly in low densities (ae6 seeds per 3.75 l of sediment), and also in 100% of the recent localities in various densities (8-1390 seeds per 3.75 l of sediment); however, low germination rates (0-13.3%) were estimated. The seeds germinated best on wet filter paper, followed by nutrient-rich fishpond sediment, but poorly on sand mixed with different substrates. Burial depth significantly affected seed germination. The seeds germinated only on the soil surface and at the depth of 1 cm but no seed germinated at the depth of 3 and 5 cm. Besides low water transparency, both high rate of sediment accumulation and the absence of summer drainage may endanger L. uniflora populations in fishponds.

They also provide key opportunities to investigate ecological resilience and to probe biological limits in the face of prolonged stressors. The underground coal mine fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania has been burning since 1962 and severely alters the overlying surface soils by elevating temperatures and depositing coal combustion pollutants. As the fire burns along the coal seams to disturb new soils, previously disturbed soils return to ambient temperatures, resulting in a chronosequence of fire impact. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine bacterial and archaeal soil community responses along two active fire fronts in Centralia, and investigated the influences of assembly processes (selection, dispersal and drift) on community outcomes. The hottest soils harbored the most variable and divergent communities, despite their reduced diversity. Recovered soils converged toward similar community structures, demonstrating resilience within 10-20 years and exhibiting near-complete return to reference communities. Measured soil properties (selection), local dispersal, and neutral community assembly models could not explain the divergences of communities observed at temperature extremes, yet beta-null modeling suggested that communities at temperature extremes follow niche-based processes rather than null. We hypothesize that priority effects from responsive seed bank transitions may be key in explaining the multiple equilibria observed among communities at extreme temperatures. These results suggest that soils generally have an intrinsic capacity for robustness to varied disturbances, even to press disturbances considered to be 'extreme', compounded, or incongruent with natural conditions.

In this study, we conducted a survey investigation in the field and a seed germination experiment in the laboratory to explore the characteristics of soil seed banks at various geomorphic positions of longitudinal sand dunes in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China. Totally, 17 plant species belonging to 17 genera and 9 families were identified in soil seed banks, and 35 plant species belonging to 34 genera and 17 families were identified in aboveground vegetation. Plant species richness in soil seed banks decreased with increasing soil depth. The highest species richness was presented in the upper slope of the windward slope and the lowest species richness was presented in the base of the windward slope. There was no significant difference in seed density of soil seed banks among the examined seven geomorphic positions. The highest seed density occurred in the lower slope of the leeward slope while the lowest occurred in the crest. Moreover, seed density decreased with increasing soil depth, being the highest in the upper soil layer (0-2 cm). For both soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation, there was no significant difference in Simpson's diversity index among the seven geomorphic positions; however, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index showed significant differences among the seven geomorphic positions. Those results showed that although there was no significant difference in seed density of soil seed banks among the seven geomorphic positions, the geomorphic positions significantly affected the species richness, diversity and distribution of soil seed banks. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of soil seed banks at different geomorphic positions of sand dunes is essential to vegetation restoration or reestablishment. Furthermore, the Jaccard's similarity coefficients of plant species between soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation at the seven geomorphic positions were low, suggesting that vegetation restoration or reestablishment processes should be promoted through adding seeds to surface layers.																	1674-6767	2194-7783				JUN	2017	9	3					355	367		10.1007/s40333-017-0055-x							WOS:000401445300004						
J	Hong, MG; Nam, BE; Kim, JG				Hong, Mun Gi; Nam, Bo Eun; Kim, Jae Geun			Effects of Soil Fertility on Early Development of Wetland Vegetation from Soil Seed Bank: Focusing on Biomass Production and Plant Species Diversity	JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY												To examine the effects of soil fertility on biomass production, plant species diversity, and early vegetation development, we performed a mesocosm experiment using soil seed bank under three soil fertility levels (ombrotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic). Biomass production linearly increased (P < 0.01), whereas plant species diversity significantly decreased (P < 0.001) as soil fertility increased. Soil fertility seemed to play a role as an environmental sieve in early vegetation development, in turn, lead the patterns of biomass production and plant species diversity. Several Poaceae species which are forming tall and dense canopy, such as Phalaris arundinacea, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, and Zizania latifolia, showed higher importance values under fertilized condition, whereas relatively small macrophytes of Eleocharis acicularis, Carex dickinsii, and Isachne globosa mainly survived under ombrotrophic condition. Although plant species richness decreased as soil fertility increased, the percentages of perennials and exotics increased rather than annuals and natives. Predominance of perennials and exotics under eutrophic condition in early vegetation development seemed to lead a continuous decrease in plant species diversity as a result of competitive effect. A significant negative relationship between plant species diversity and biomass production (P < 0.0001) was obtained when all experimental plots are included in correlation analysis.

J	Yang, J; Yan, PB; He, RX; Song, XQ				Yang, Jun; Yan, Pengbo; He, Rongxiao; Song, Xiqiang			Exploring land-use legacy effects on taxonomic and functional diversity of woody plants in a rapidly urbanizing landscape	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban vegetation is influenced by prior land use due to the dynamic nature of urban landscape. However, limited information is available on how strongly the land-use legacy impacts the diversity of urban vegetation, especially in areas of rapid urbanization. This study quantified the land-use legacy effect on taxonomic and functional diversity of woody plants in Haikou, China. We collected data on land use, percentages of woody vegetation cover, and abundance of woody plants from 461 randomly distributed sample plots. The influence of land-use legacy was examined by analyzing the land-use history of sample plots and taxonomic and functional alpha- and beta-diversity of woody plants. The relative importance of the land use and the percentage of woody vegetation cover on the diversity of woody plants were analyzed using the boosted regression tree model. The result showed that the land-use legacy effect caused significant divergence in taxonomic and functional diversity of woody plants and the effect was most obvious in sites where the lands were currently used as residential areas. Remnant trees, shrubs, and possibly shrubs growing from seed banks and roots contributed to this legacy effect. We also found that taxonomic and functional a-diversities of trees in a site were influenced by how frequent the land use of the place was changed and what type of land use that the place ended up with. Based on our findings, we recommend conservation programs in rapidly urbanizing regions give more attention to vegetation in residential areas and particularly species with low utilitarian value.

However, many species produce nondormant seeds, particularly in wet tropical forests, a biogeographic pattern that is not well accounted for in current models. We hypothesized that the global distribution of dormant seeds derives from their adaptive value in predictably fluctuating (i.e. seasonal) environments. However, the advantage conferred by dormancy might ultimately depend on other seed attributes, particularly size. This general model was tested within a phylogenetically informed framework using a data set comprising > 216 000 world-wide observations of Fabaceae, spanning three orders of magnitude in seed size and including both dormant and nondormant seeds. Our results confirmed our hypothesis: nondormant seeds can only evolve in climates with long growing seasons and/or in lineages that produce larger seeds. Conversely, dormancy should be evolutionarily stable in temperate lineages with small seeds. When the favorable season is fleeting, seed dormancy is the only adaptive strategy. Based on these results, we predict that, within a given lineage, taxa producing larger, nondormant seeds will necessarily predominate in aseasonal environments, while plants bearing small, dormant seeds will be dominant under short growing seasons.				de Casas, Rafael Rubio/AAA-6912-2019; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013	de Casas, Rafael Rubio/0000-0003-4276-4968; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630												0028-646X	1469-8137				JUN	2017	214	4					1527	1536		10.1111/nph.14498							WOS:000402412500014	28262955

Various factors may affect the development of sediment seed bank. We conducted a microcosm experiment to test the effects of burrowing and feeding activities of Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum on the burial of Zostera marina seeds in sediments. The effects of lasting time (3-hour, 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, 14-day and 28-day), clam density (0, 2, 4 and 8 clams with shell length of 3 cm in each microcosm) and clam size (shell length of 2, 3 and 4 cm at 4-clam density) on seed burial were examined in plastic microcosm cores (30 cm high x 10 in inner diameter) in a 28-day period. Results showed that the seed burial depth significantly increased with time, the density and the size of clams. No seeds were buried in the sediment in the cores without clams during the whole experiment period. For the 3-cm clams, about 91.61% of the seeds were buried in the sediment at the end of the experiment in the high-density treatment (8 clams at each core); while in the medium and low-density treatments (4 and 2 clams in each core, respectively), about 76.93% and 60.61% of the seeds were buried in the sediment, respectively. For the size treatments, large (4 cm) clams buried 89.56% of the seeds at the end of the experiment, much more than those of medium (3 cm, 76.93%) and small (2 cm, 61.50%) size clams. During the whole experiment period, nearly all of the buried seeds were at a depth of from 0 cm to 5 cm. These results suggested that Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum may play an important positive role in seagrass seed bank dynamics in the field.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2017	52	2					221	229		10.1007/s12601-017-0016-5							WOS:000404650600005

The role of seed traits as segregation factors of hybrids in wild populations of Cistus (Cistaceae)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Hybridization has been postulated as a main speciation mechanism in Cistus, a hard-seeded group of plants widely distributed in fire-prone Mediterranean shrublands. However, ecological evidence about how the segregation of hybrids from parents might occur is nonexistent. The presence of two hybrid populations in Morocco and Spain from Cistus albidus and Cistus heterophyllus led us to investigate their seed trait differences (seed size, mass and coat thickness) with the parentals and their seed germinability. A sowing experiment to compare the seedling emergence ability and seedling fitness of hybrids and their parentals was also carried out. Hybrid seeds germinated in a similar proportion to those of the parents. The hybrid seeds were significantly lighter, smaller and had thinner seed coats in both populations. However, these seed trait differences did not affect the seedling fitness of hybrids. These results were interpreted as a successful shift in the regeneration niche of the hybrids due to a greater proportion of soft-coated seeds, able to emerge from the soil seed bank in absence of fire. Smaller seeds also would favour further and deeper seed dispersal to escape from a fire. Monitoring of the seed yield of the Spanish population showed a competitive ability of hybrids.

Photoinhibition of seed germination: occurrence, ecology and phylogeny	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Light conditions provide important information about the best time and place for seedling establishment. Photoinhibition of seed germination (PISG), defined as the partial or complete suppression of germination under white light, has been interpreted as a physiological adaptation to avoid germination at or near the soil surface. This review is the first report of an all-inclusive, fully quantitative analysis of PISG in seed plants. Pertinent data available from the published literature for 301 taxa from 59 families and 27 orders were assessed. The association of PISG with several plant and seed traits allowed us to consider the adaptive significance of PISG in relation to plant life histories and the natural environments. As no gymnosperm has been found to be truly photoinhibited, it seems that PISG is apomorphic to flowering plants (especially monocots). Seeds of most taxa with PISG have a dark colour and intermediate mass, mostly in the range 1 to 27 mg. PISG is absent from humid tropical regions and from cold climates, but it is strongly associated with open, disturbed and dry habitats. An intriguing implication of PISG is the formation of a soil-surface seed bank. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that PISG is a physiological adaptation to avoid germination on the soil surface, where conditions are not suitable for seedling establishment. PISG is probably much more frequent in seed plants than previously thought. Thus, laboratory experiments should be conducted under well-characterized light and dark conditions.

Seed bank is taken into account to introduce dynamics into the model. We present a numerical example of controlling Sheathed Monochoria (Monochoria Vaginalis) in Korean rice paddy fields. Our results show that producers benefit from dynamic decision rules; higher income and more control of weed density can be obtained with the same amount of herbicide. In order to illustrate the magnitude of differences between static and dynamic models, a numerical example is presented using a data set from Korean rice production. When it comes to controlling weed density, Korean rice farmers are found to be better off under the dynamic model, and the magnitude of advantages are found to be more sensitive to herbicide efficacy and less sensitive to initial seed banks and germination rates in terms of weed density.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							956	10.3390/su9060956							WOS:000404133200087						
J	Manninen, OH; Tolvanen, A				Manninen, Outi H.; Tolvanen, Anne			Sexual reproduction of clonal dwarf shrubs in a forest-tundra ecotone	PLANT ECOLOGY												Successful sexual reproduction may be more important for regeneration of clonal species in high-latitude and -altitude areas than has been previously suggested. We investigated the potential of Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea and Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum (E. hermaphroditum) for sexual reproduction at three sites in the forest-tundra ecotone in Finnish Lapland. We studied whether the potential differs between plant communities, whether disturbance enhances germination, and whether seedling emergence is limited by seed availability. We established a field experiment with disturbance and sowing treatments, and monitored seed and seedling numbers and survival rates for two years. The number of mature seeds of V. myrtillus was higher in plants from the tundra heath than in those from the coniferous and mountain birch forests. The number of mature seeds and seedlings emerging from the seed bank of E. hermaphroditum tended also to be higher in the tundra heath. Disturbance marginally increased the seedling emergence of V. myrtillus and E. hermaphroditum, whereas sowing generally increased the seedling numbers. The seedling number of V. myrtillus was lower in the tundra heath and that of E. hermaphroditum was lower in the coniferous forest than at the other sites. Seedling survival was equal for all plant species at all sites. We conclude that the capacity for sexual reproduction varies among plant communities, and seed availability is a stronger constraint than microsite availability for the studied species. Once the crucial early phase of seedling establishment is overcome, seedling survival enables successful recruitment of V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea and E. hermaphroditum in the subarctic area.

Changes in sediment seed-bank composition of invaded macrophyte communities in a thermal river	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Thermal waters, characterised by high water temperatures throughout the year, harbour a special flora atypical of temperate climatic conditions that are adapted to the combination of high water temperatures and low oxygen and carbonate contents. However, these ecosystems are susceptible to the invasion of tropical macrophytes because conditions in thermal waters are similar to those of in warmer latitudes. We studied the vegetation and viable seed bank in an alien-dominated upstream section of a thermal river in Hungary, and a native-dominated downstream section of the same river where temperature was cooler and less stable. Our hypotheses were as follows: (1) alien and native plant species are clearly separated along the river, and this separation is driven by environmental factors (water temperature, conductivity and sediment characteristics); and (2) the species composition of seed banks reflects that of the established macrophytes, and thus, the seed-bank composition would differ in the up- and downstream reaches. We defined 20 sampling units in two sections of the Heviz River in West Hungary. The vegetation was surveyed in every sampling unit, and environmental variables (sediment and water) were recorded. Five sediment cores were taken from each sampling unit and incubated in a greenhouse under waterlogged conditions. The mean seed-bank density was lower than any of the previously published values for aquatic plant communities. In total, fewer species germinated from the seed bank than the number of species observed in the vegetation. Moreover, the SOrensen similarity index, comparing the vegetation and seed-bank species composition, was extremely low. The lowest seed-bank density and diversity were detected in the alien-dominated upstream river section, where significantly fewer native species were present in the seed bank. Despite favourable conditions for alien macrophytes to establish in this thermal river, they did not build up considerable persistent seed banks. We conclude that the dominance of aliens modified the species composition of both the vegetation and the seed bank, mainly by depleting the seed bank of native species. Therefore, future efforts to restore native vegetation from the seed bank may require a number of different strategies.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					1024	1035		10.1111/fwb.12922							WOS:000400571200006						
J	Mars, MM; Schau, HJ				Mars, Matthew M.; Schau, Hope Jensen			Institutional entrepreneurship and the negotiation and blending of multiple logics in the Southern Arizona local food system	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES												In this paper, we explore the entrepreneurial leadership strategies and routine work of actors located across a diverse array of organizational settings (i.e., farmers' markets, community farms, community-supported agriculture programs, food and seed banks, local food print media) that combine to shape and sustain the Southern Arizona (AZ) local food system (LFS). We use the theoretical principles of institutional entrepreneurship and logic multiplicity to show how the strategies and routine work of local food actors at the organizational level combine to negotiate system-level meaning and structure within and across the Southern AZ LFS, which is an otherwise seemingly fragmented and contentious social space. We illustrate how the entrepreneurial work performed within multiple organizations and organizational types converge to form a hybrid (or blended) local food logic. Implications are discussed and recommendations for practice are proposed.																	0889-048X	1572-8366				JUN	2017	34	2					407	422		10.1007/s10460-016-9722-3							WOS:000400093200011

The seed bank density of the weed population and frequency of dominant or recessive alleles are taken as state variables of the growing cycle. The control variable is taken as the dose-response function. The goal is to reduce herbicide usage, maximize profit in a pre-determined period of time and minimize the environmental impacts caused by excessive use of herbicides. The dynamic optimization model takes into account the decreased herbicide efficacy over time due to weed resistance evolution caused by selective pressure. The dynamic optimization problem involves discrete variables modeled as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem which was solved by an active set algorithm (ASA) for box-constrained optimization. Numerical simulations for a case study illustrate the management of the Bidens subalternans in a corn crop by selecting a sequence of only one type of herbicide. The results on optimal control discussed here will give support to make decision on the herbicide usage in regions where weed resistance was reported by field observations.

Potential for persistence of blue ash in the presence of emerald ash borer in southeastern Michigan	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Since the introduction of the invasive bark beetle emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, EAB) to southeastern Michigan, most native ash (Fraxinus spp.) species such as white ash (F. americana L.), black ash (F. nigra Marsh.), and green ash (F. pensylvanica Marsh.) have suffered mortality rates exceeding 99% after infestation in mixed stands. EAB-caused mortality has reduced or eliminated ash seed sources, resulting in a depleted seed bank and a reduced potential for regeneration that has led many researchers to predict a grim future for ash in North America. Blue ash (F. quadrangulata Michx.) is thought to be the most EAB-resistant of all North American ash species with observed mortality rates between 30% and 40%, but few data exist describing blue ash regeneration dynamics in the presence of EAB. We sampled blue ash-dominated stands at six different sites in southeastern Michigan, nearest the EAB introduction point. White ash stands at the same six sites were also sampled as the reference condition for ash in the presence of established EAB. Overstory mortality for blue ash ranged between 7 and 32% and was significantly lower than white ash across all sites. Post-EAB overstory blue ash was on average significantly older and larger than white ash across all sites and maintained a higher frequency of healthier crowns. Blue ash regeneration densities were found to be abundant at all sizes within all stands. New seedlings (<3 yrs old) were significantly more abundant for blue ash than white ash across all sites, suggesting that blue ash has not experienced the same seed bank depletion as white ash. Blue ash seedling growth rates were greater than or equal to associated non-ash tree species at all size classes and at all sites, and equal to white ash seedling growth rates at the majority of sites and size classes. Our results suggest that blue ash is currently maintaining a relatively healthy and dominant position in the canopy of several forests in southeastern Michigan, and that blue ash is still regenerating in a capacity that shows a high probability of canopy self-replacement and thus persistence in the presence of EAB.

Lutz; Ludewig, Kristin; Otte, Annette; Harvolk-Schoening, Sarah			Flooding tolerance of four floodplain meadow species depends on age	PLOS ONE												Numerous restoration campaigns focused on re-establishing species-rich floodplain meadows of Central Europe, whose species composition is essentially controlled by regular flooding. Climate change predictions expect strong alterations on the discharge regime of Europe's large rivers with little-known consequences on floodplain meadow plants. In this study, we aim to determine the effects of flooding on seedlings of different ages of four typical flood meadow species. To this end, we flooded seedlings of two familial pairs of flood meadow species of wetter and dryer microhabitats for 2 weeks each, starting 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after seedling germination, respectively. We show that a 2-week-flooding treatment had a negative effect on performance of seedlings younger than 6 weeks. Summer floods with high floodwater temperatures may have especially detrimental effects on seedlings, which is corroborated by previous findings. As expected, the plants from wet floodplain meadow microhabitats coped better with the flooding treatment than those from dryer microhabitats. In conclusion, our results suggest that restoration measures may perform more successfully if seedlings of restored species are older than the critical age of about 6 weeks before a spring flooding begins. Seasonal flow patterns may influence vegetation dynamics of floodplain meadows and should, therefore, be taken into account when timing future restoration campaigns.

J	Rusterholz, HP; Kung, J; Baur, B				Rusterholz, Hans-Peter; Kung, Jonas; Baur, Bruno			Experimental evidence for a delayed response of the above-ground vegetation and the seed bank to the invasion of an annual exotic plant in deciduous forests	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Invasions by alien plants significantly affect native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We conducted a 5-year field experiment to investigate potential effects of the annual invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on both the native above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank in a deciduous forest in Switzerland. Eight years after the establishment of I. glandulifera, we set up plots in patches invaded by the alien plant, in plots from which the invasive plant had been manually removed and in plots which were not yet colonized by the invasive plant. We examined plant species richness, diversity and plant species composition in the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank in all plots one year and five years after the initiation of the experiment. The 36 plots (3 plot types x 6 replicates x 2 sites) were equally distributed over two forest sites. Neither the native above-ground vegetation nor the soil seed bank was influenced by the presence of I. glandulifera one year after the start of the field experiment. After five years, however, plant species richness of both the above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank was reduced by 25% and 30%, respectively, in plots invaded by the alien plant compared to plots from which I. glandulifera had been removed or uninvaded plots. Furthermore, plots invaded by the alien plant had a lower total seedling density (reduction by 60%) and an altered plant species composition in the soil seed bank compared to control plots. Our field experiment indicates that negative effects of the annual invasive plant on the native above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank of deciduous forests become visible with a delay of several years.																	1439-1791	1618-0089				MAY	2017	20						19	30		10.1016/j.baae.2017.02.004							WOS:000404560900003

The objective of this study was to elucidate genetic diversity and population structure of barley landraces across the landscape of Tunisia. Populations from 11 geographic zones were genotyped using 21 nuclear microsatellites. A high level of genetic polymorphism with 170 detected alleles was recorded among the studied genotypes. The average allelic richness was 8.095 alleles per locus. The index of genetic diversity (H-e) showed an average of 0.741. Genetic diversity was very high within populations, whereas differences among populations were difficult to detect. Only 0.15% of the DNA variation was apportioned among landraces (P < 0.001), whereas 99.85% of the DNA variation was maintained within these landraces. A high gene flow (Nm) was revealed among the investigated populations, which has been facilitated by exchange of barley seeds between Tunisian cereal farmers of different regions. Genetic diversity within Tunisian barley landrace germplasms may help to maintain adaptation to a broad range of environmental conditions and provide genetically diverse resources for barley breeders. Both ex situ (seed banks) and in situ (on-farm) conservation strategies may be required to maintain barley landrace genetic resources.

J	Benvenuti, S; Bretzel, F				Benvenuti, Stefano; Bretzel, Francesca			Agro-biodiversity restoration using wildflowers: What is the appropriate weed management for their long-term sustainability?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wildflowers Wildflowers have an important environmental impact on rural biodiversity. Their chromatic and shape evolution, to attract pollinators, is the key to their dual benefit in terms of aesthetics and environmental functionality. Their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agro-ecosystems have led them to be considered as necessary for the restoration of the agro-environment. We compared the dynamics of wildflower-only and wildflower-weed communities, in outdoor boxes, in order to study the floristic evolution over the course of a three-year experiment. Four agronomic treatments were applied: seeding time, late winter cutting, summer harrowing, summer cutting after senescence. Our hypothesis was that the sustainability of the wildflower community was vulnerable to strong weed interference and that agronomic management is necessary for the long-term survival of wildflowers. The indicators used were: biomass, number of seeds in the seed bank, diversity indexes. Our results showed that the growth of the wildflowers was affected by the weeds, in terms of the biomass and seed bank accumulated. However, various agronomic disturbances, such as cutting and, to a greater extent, harrowing, maintained the balance of the floristic complexity in the wildflower-weed community. The plant equilibrium was confirmed by the Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes. We found that long-term wildflower sustainability is closely linked to the agronomic management. Further studies are needed to optimize the anthropic-dependent survival of such wildflower buffer areas, given the "greening" measures encouraged by the new European agricultural policy aimed at biodiversity conservation.

Life history and population dynamics of a tree species in tropical semi-arid climate: A case study with Cordia oncocalyx	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												In semi-arid climates, plant population dynamics are strongly influenced by the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall. We monitored a population of the tree species Cordia oncocalyx (Boraginaceae) for 24months in the dry thorny woodland of semi-arid northeastern Brazil, to investigate which life-history traits allow this tree to be locally dominant. We used horizontal life tables and a Lefkovitch matrix and tested for relationships among demographic parameters of seedling, infant, juvenile, immature, virginile and reproductive ontogenetic stages with rainfall and canopy openness. Germination and recruitment occurred in the rainy months, and dry-season mortality occurred only in seedlings (76% and 100%, first and second years, respectively) and infants (3% and 6%). Juveniles showed greater height growth under more open canopies (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.24), suggesting that light availability influences growth. The population growth rate was =1.0336, and the highest sensitivity occurred in the infant-juvenile transition. Our results show light as a restrictive growth factor for plants in the juvenile stage and confirm the strong influence of rainfall on the dynamics of trees in a seasonally dry environment. The formation of a persistent seed bank with germination concentrated at the rainfall onset but spreading over the rainy season are strategies that hedge bets before establishment. The formation of a bank of infants, which can resume growth as soon as there is water, hedges bets after establishment. We attribute the positive population growth rate of Cordia oncocalyx to survival strategies allowing bet-hedging both before and after establishment.

J	Mueller, NG				Mueller, Natalie G.			Documenting domestication in a lost crop (Polygonum erectum L.): evolutionary bet-hedgers under cultivation	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												This study uses morphometrics and digital image analysis to document domestication syndrome in an annual seed crop, Polygonum erectum L. (erect knotweed), which was cultivated by Native Americans for c. 2,500 years in eastern North America. This plant is one of several seed crops referred to as the Eastern Agricultural Complex, a pre-maize agricultural system that supported societies in a core area centred on the central Mississippi valley for millennia. The extinct domesticated subspecies P. erectum ssp. watsoniae N. G. Muell. described here, exhibits some classic markers of domestication, including larger fruits and reduced germination inhibitors in comparison to its wild progenitor. Domesticated P. erectum also exhibits greatly reduced germination heteromorphism. Germination heteromorphism is the classic example of evolutionary bet-hedging in plants: wild P. erectum sacrifices maximum fitness per generation for a reduction in fitness variance over many generations. It does so by producing two different types of fruits: ones that germinate immediately in the spring after they are produced (smooth morphs), and ones that remain in the soil seed bank for one or more growing seasons before germinating (tubercled morphs). Tubercled morphs allow populations to recover after adverse events. Under cultivation, the selective pressures that maintained this strategy were relaxed as humans saved seeds and created predictable microenvironments for seedlings, resulting in homogenous harvests and reliable germination for ancient farmers.																	0939-6314	1617-6278				MAY	2017	26	3					313	327		10.1007/s00334-016-0592-9							WOS:000398929000004

Based on research experiences from various countries, this article argues that community seed banks can enhance the resilience of farmers, in particular of communities and households most affected by climate change. Community seed banks can secure improved access to, and availability of, diverse, locally adapted crops and varieties, and enhance related indigenous knowledge and skills in plant management, including seed selection, treatment, storage, multiplication, and distribution. Bien que les initiatives de conservation des semences au niveau des communautes aient existe depuis environ trente ans, jusqu'a recemment ils ont fait l'objet de peu d'attention de la part de la litterature scientifique sur l'adaptation au changement climatique et les ressources phytogenetiques. Se basant sur les recherches conduites dans plusieurs pays, cet article avance que les banques de semences communautaires peuvent renforcer la resilience des agriculteurs, en particulier ceux vivant dans les communautes et les foyers les plus affectes par le changement climatique. Les banques de semences communautaires peuvent garantir l'amelioration de l'acces a/la disponibilite des cultures et des varietes adaptees au plan local, et renforcer les connaissances et les competences indigenes en gestion des plantations, y compris la selection, le traitement, le stockage, la multiplication et la distribution des semences. Aunque las iniciativas comunitarias para conservar semillas existen desde hace casi 30 anos, hasta hace poco tiempo dichas iniciativas habian recibido poca atencion en investigaciones cientificas sobre la adaptacion al cambio climatico y a los recursos fitogeneticos. Tomando como base investigaciones realizadas en varios paises, el presente articulo sostiene que los bancos comunitarios de semillas pueden acentuar la resiliencia de los campesinos, particularmente la de aquellos hogares y comunidades mas afectados por el cambio climatico. Los bancos comunitarios de semillas pueden mejorar el acceso a cultivos adaptados a ambientes locales y a variedades diversas, asi como su disponibilidad. A la vez, enriquecen los conocimientos indigenas, fortaleciendo sus habilidades en la gestion de plantas, lo cual abarca la seleccion, el tratamiento, el almacenamiento, la multiplicacion y la distribucion de semillas.

J	Song, XY; Hogan, JA; Brown, C; Cao, M; Yang, J				Song, Xiaoyang; Hogan, James Aaron; Brown, Calum; Cao, Min; Yang, Jie			Snow damage to the canopy facilitates alien weed invasion in a subtropical montane primary forest in southwestern China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Climate-mediated disturbance often promotes the invasion of non-native species, which impact local ecosystems by altering community structure and composition. In subtropical forests, the formation of canopy gaps, which allow for rapid regeneration in the understorey, strongly affects successional dynamics. However, the role of canopy gaps in promoting invasive species into forest interiors has not been extensively studied. We examined the relationship between canopy disturbance and the germination of Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae), a non-native branched herb species, using seedling population data from a 20-Ha forest dynamics plot in southwest China. The species was first recorded in 2015, after extensive snow-damage to the forest canopy. Our hypothesis was that canopy gaps increase light availability on the forest floor, thereby facilitating the germination and subsequent invasion by the non-native branched herb into the forest interior. Field measurements of the Leaf Area Index before and after the snow damage was combined with measurements of canopy gaps and associated light conditions. Biotic factors (tree seedling species richness, herb species richness and herb coverage), abiotic factors (elevation, slope, convexity and soil moisture), and the density and spatial distribution of A. adenophora were also measured ten months after the snow damage. Seedling germination experiments were conducted in the lab to test the relationship between light availability and the germination of the invasive branched herb, showing the branched herb to be light demanding. Using spatial statistical methods, we found significant relationships between densities of recruiting A. adenophora and canopy gaps, with high densities of the invasive branched herb recruiting into gap areas. We conclude that light availability shapes the distribution of A. Adenophora in the understorey in this subtropical evergreen montane forest. Our results illustrate that disturbances leading to canopy damage can promote the establishment and proliferation of invasive understorey species in forest interiors, providing a rapid route to colonization.

The soil seed bank acts as a propagule source for revegetation to affiliate the restoration of degraded wetlands. However, the effects of this approach are controversial and depend on the traits of the seed bank and its interactions with the environment. The seed bank in an alpine fen meadow was studied to determine its exact role in revegetation. The surveyed shore of a Tibetan lake, Gahai Lake, was divided into three sites under different levels of grazing pressure. Each site was separated into six transects along a water-depth gradient to collect soil cores to determine the pattern of biodiversity through a germination experiment in a greenhouse. After an analysis of heterogeneity-related diversity, partitioning of 58 discovered species indicated that 39.5 could be contributed to beta-diversity, which was mainly contributed to water depth. Overgrazing (0.607 sheep unit/acre, NovemberMarch) decreased seed bank diversity in many respects, especially through decreasing spatial heterogeneity and homogenizing biota. A lightly grazed, well-protected site had not only the highest beta-diversity and species abundance but also the highest inter-site species turnover rate compared with other sites under moderate grazing intensity. Despite the lack of target species, the seed bank serves as (i) a species-rich pool; (ii) an extant legacy seed source for sustaining heterogeneity and floristic diversity; and (iii) an ecological indicator, and its effect can be reinforced by appropriate grazing practices (multiple intensity) and hydrological modifications.

Theoretically, fitness costs can be reduced through a parental environmental effect when the environment is partly predictable. We tested whether populations from environments that differ in predictability diverged in parental effects on seed dormancy. Common garden-produced seeds of the two annual plant species Biscutella didyma and Bromus fasciculatus collected along an aridity gradient were grown under 12 irrigation treatments. Offspring germination was evaluated and related to environmental correlations between generations and their fitness consequences at the four study sites. One species exhibited strong seed dormancy that increased with unpredictability in seasonal precipitation. The parental effect on seed dormancy also increased proportionally with the environmental correlation between precipitation in the parental season and seedling density in the following season; this correlation increased from mesic to arid environments. Because fitness was negatively related to density, this parental effect may be adaptive. However, the lack of dormancy in the second species indicates that bet-hedging is not the only strategy for annual plants in arid environments. Our results provide the first evidence for clinal variation in the relative strength of parental effects along environmental gradients.

Although the roles of environmental heterogeneity and geographical distance in structuring soil microbial communities have been studied intensively, the effects of environmental and spatial variation on the species richness estimation have not been examined. To this end, we have explored their effects on estimating the belowground soil bacterial species richness within a 50 ha forest dynamic plot (FDP) using a published massive sequencing dataset with intensive sampling scheme. Our resampling analyses showed that, for a given sequencing depth, increasing the sample size could significantly enhance the detection of rare species by capturing more of the environmental and spatial variation, thus obtaining higher observed and estimated species richness. Additionally, the estimates of bacterial species richness were significantly and positively correlated with environmental variation among samples, indicating that environmental filtering was the main mechanism driving the processes of community assembly for belowground soil bacterial communities in the plot. Moreover, this effect of environmental variation could be markedly alleviated when the sample size was higher than 450, and thus we predicted that there were at least 42,866 soil bacterial species based on 8,296,878 sequences from 550 samples in the whole 50 ha FDP. Furthermore, we built a power law environmental heterogeneity equation (EHE) as a decision-tool to determine an approximate sample size for comprehensively capturing the environmental gradient within a given habitat.

Surveying the Maize community for their diversity and pedigree visualization needs to prioritize tool development and curation	DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION												The Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB) team prepared a survey to identify breeders' needs for visualizing pedigrees, diversity data and haplotypes in order to prioritize tool development and curation efforts at MaizeGDB. The survey was distributed to the maize research community on behalf of the Maize Genetics Executive Committee in Summer 2015. The survey garnered 48 responses from maize researchers, of which more than half were self-identified as breeders. The survey showed that the maize researchers considered their top priorities for visualization as: (i) displaying single nucleotide polymorphisms in a given region for a given list of lines, (ii) showing haplotypes for a given list of lines and (iii) presenting pedigree relationships visually. Thensive genotyping of the USA national maize inbred seed bank. Genome Biol, 2013; 14: R55) and (ii) e survey also asked which populations would be most useful to display. The following two populations were on top of the list: (i) 3000 publicly available maize inbred lines used in Romay et al. (Comprehmaize lines with expired Plant Variety Protection Act (ex-PVP) certificates. Driven by this strong stakeholder input, MaizeGDB staff are currently working in four areas to improve its interface and web-based tools: (i) presenting immediate progenies of currently available stocks at the MaizeGDB Stock pages, (ii) displaying the most recent ex-PVP lines described in the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) on the MaizeGDB Stock pages, (iii) developing network views of pedigree relationships and (iv) visualizing genotypes from SNP-based diversity datasets. These survey results can help other biological databases to direct their efforts according to user preferences as they serve similar types of data sets for their communities.

J	Pavlidis, P; Alachiotis, N				Pavlidis, Pavlos; Alachiotis, Nikolaos			A survey of methods and tools to detect recent and strong positive selection	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH-THESSALONIKI												Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e., SFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or just subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, Sweep-Finder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on LD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null hypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is used instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of detecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In terms of execution time, LD-based methods are typically faster than SFS-based methods, due to the nature of required arithmetic.																	1790-045X	2241-5793				APR 8	2017	24								7	10.1186/s40709-017-0064-0							WOS:000405144000001	28405579

LONG TERM-STORAGE EFFECT ON VIABILITY AND FATTY ACIDS PROFILE OF Encyclia adenocarpa (Lex.) Schltr SEEDS	REVISTA FITOTECNIA MEXICANA					1st National Meet on Arid Zones	NOV 23-24, 2015	UNAM, FES Iztacala, Tlalnepantla de Baz, MEXICO		UNAM, FES Iztacala			Mexico has 6 % of the Orchidaceae diversity, one of the most diverse botanic families; however, the habitat loss and the species overexploitation have diminished their populations. Seed banks could be a great option for storing ex situ Mexican orchids germplasm; in this kind of storing, seeds viability and biochemical profile should be evaluated periodically. Encyclia adenocarpa seeds collected in 2007 and 2014, preserved in UNAM FES Iztacala seed bank were aged for 0, 6, 12 and 18 d under 45 degrees C and 45 % RH conditions. Seeds were germinated in Knudson C (KC) and Phytamax (PH) media (at 25 +/- 1 degrees C with photoperiod light 12 h/dark 12 h). Viability was analyzed using tetrazolium chloride assay, and the lipid acid profile was assessed. Scanning electron microscopy and optic microscopy were used for examining seed morphology. Six days aged seeds grown in Knudson C media showed 95 % of germination while wild seeds collected in 2007 did not germinated at all. Accelerated and natural ageing of seeds of E. adenocarpa reduced unsaturated fatty acid concentration modified their anatomy and embryonic structure. These damages caused loss of seed viability.																	0187-7380					APR-JUN	2017	40	2					151	160									WOS:000406354900007						
J	Sershen; Mdamba, B; Ramdhani, S				Sershen; Mdamba, Bongani; Ramdhani, Syd			Propagule and seedling responses of three species naturalised in subtropical South Africa to elevated temperatures	FLORA												The predicted 2-5 degrees C increase in global temperatures by the end of this century could enhance the invasive potential of some alien plant species. It is unclear whether aliens that originate from and/or are naturalised in warm areas are predisposed to respond positively to this increase. This study assessed the propagule and seedling responses of three alien plant species (viz. Oenothera biennis, Syncarpia glomulifera and Petiveria alliacea) naturalised in a subtropical region in South Africa to elevated temperatures. The species were characterised in terms of propagule (seed/achene) traits related to invasiveness before these were sown at ambient (daily maximum: 26.2 + 0.3 degrees C; daily minimum: 17.9 + 0.2 degrees C) and elevated (daily maximum: 30.6 + 0.5 degrees C; daily minimum: 21.2 + 0.3 degrees C) temperatures to assess germination capacity and rate. Seedlings subsequently produced were grown at these temperatures to assess growth and performance. Propagules of all species possess traits that facilitate persistent seed banks but their small size may not favour seedling survival under harsh conditions. Only 0. biennis and P. alliacea exhibited high seed viability but elevated temperatures enhanced germination capacity and rate in all species. Seedlings of both 0. biennis and S. glomulifera exhibited signs of stress at elevated temperatures (e.g. reduced biomass) though. However, while seedling production and survival were reduced at elevated temperatures in 0. biennis, these parameters were enhanced at elevated temperatures in S. glomulifera (possibly due to increased shoot emergence rate). Elevated temperatures did not affect seedling production in P. alliacea but did enhance seedling survival, possibly by inducing biomass allocation patterns that enhance productivity. The ability of naturalised species to become invasive in a changing climate may be more dependent on phenotypic plasticity than the possession of a syndrome of invasive traits. Species that originate from, and are naturalised in, warmer climates may not be predisposed to respond positively to elevated temperatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Hulik, J; Douda, J				Hulik, Josef; Douda, Jan			Germination strategies of two dominant Carex species in a swamp alder forest: implications for restoration	BIOLOGIA												Germination strategy is an essential mechanism that determines plant survival in previously established populations or newly colonised sites. Carex is a group of species that has shown difficulties to germinate experimentally and also many of them failed in order to use in restoration projects. Our aim was to determine whether Carex elata and C. elongata that dominate in vegetation of Central European swamps differ in their germination strategy. We conducted germination experiments with stratified and unstratified seeds of both species to determine: 1) if they are able to germinate fresh, 2) if they exhibit a cyclic dormancy pattern, and 3) if they will germinate from a seed bank. We demonstrate fresh seed germination and no evidence of cyclic dormancy in either species. Stratification did not enhance final germination but it did accelerate germination. Seed bank seeds of both species germinate sparsely. We demonstrate that these coexisting Carex species differ with respect to final germination. The higher germination percentages of the fresh seeds compared to buried and seed bank seeds of both species probably reflect adaptation to fluctuating water-level conditions. In summary, these findings support a strategy of fresh germination in a highly-variable environment. Our study indicates that both C. elata and C. elongata are suitable for restoration projects. Successful establishment and revegetation with C. elongata may result simply from sowing fresh seeds. In contrast, seed sowing, combined with vegetatively produced seedling transplants is essential for the successful restoration of C. elata.

BELOWGROUND BUD BANK RESPONSES TO GRAZING INTENSITY IN THE INNER-MONGOLIA STEPPE, CHINA	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Despite the predominant role of bud banks in population regeneration and community dynamics, they have received far less attention than deserved. In particular, it remains unexplored how bud bank size and composition respond to different grazing intensities in grasslands. We investigated the size and composition of bud banks under different grazing intensities and regimes on a typical steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results showed that (i) the total bud density in the traditional grazing regime (grazing and haymaking within the same year in the same paddock; 2,444 +/- 141 buds m(-2)) was 30 +/- 11% higher (mean +/- standard error; p < 0.05) than that in the mixed grazing regime (grazing and haymaking alternate annually in the same paddock; 1,872 +/- 109 buds m(-2)), but they did not change with increasing grazing intensity, (ii) rhizome buds and bulb buds decreased sharply (p < 0.05) because of grazing in the mixed grazing regime, (iii) bud banks of rhizomatous grasses showed species-specific responses to the increasing grazing intensity: decreasing in Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel., increasing in Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. and unresponsive in Carex duriuscula C. A. Mey. Data indicated that (i) the studied grazing intensities had no significant effects on the total bud bank, suggesting that belowground bud bank seems to be tolerant of grazing and (ii) the responses of bud bank to grazing differed with the bud bank type and species, indicating that bud banks could be used for explaining and predicting the dynamics of a natural grassland plant community.

J	Lawrence, B; Bicksler, AJ; Duncan, K				Lawrence, Brian; Bicksler, Abram J.; Duncan, Kimberly			Local treatments and vacuum sealing as novel control strategies for stored seed pests in the tropics	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Prevention of pests while maintaining viable seed during storage is often challenging for smallholder farmers in the tropics and subtropics. Investment in costly technologies or storage equipment is often unavailable or economically unreasonable, and alternative methods of seed storage can play a role in ensuring regional and global food security. This research evaluates whether or not vacuum sealing and locally available seed storage treatments are effective techniques to control cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus). This research also assesses the effects of such techniques on the viability of stored Lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) seed in the humid tropics. Tested treatments included vegetable oil, pulverized bamboo charcoal, galangal powder, powdered detergent, a bleach solution, and carbaryl. Infested seed samples stored in northern Thailand under local treatment options and vacuum sealing were evaluated between May 2011 and May 2012 for bruchid presence, seed viability, and seed vigor. After 1 year of vacuum storage, seed viability was 77.6% compared with 66.5% under non-vacuum conditions. Over that period, vacuum storage successfully prevented bruchid population growth (4.9 compared with 123.3 insects per 50 seeds under non-vacuum conditions; F = 22.59, P < 0.001). By contrast, the oil treatment greatly reduced seed viability (1.3%), although it restrained bruchid population growth (3.5 compared to 97.0 insects per 50 seeds). Other local treatments (galangal powder, carbaryl, and bamboo charcoal) limited bruchid population growth (F = 8.37, P < 0.05) compared with the control, while maintaining seed viability. Seed germination duration was not affected by vacuum sealing and seed treatments but was rather influenced by changing environmental conditions throughout the trial. These seasonal changes also influenced overall insect lifecycle and seed metabolism. These results demonstrate that vacuum sealing and several locally available treatments provide novel, low-cost, appropriate seed storage options for local seed banks and smallholder farmers in the developing world, thus avoiding the use of locally rare or expensive chemicals, low temperature, or low moisture conditions.																	1774-0746	1773-0155				APR	2017	37	2							6	10.1007/s13593-017-0415-0							WOS:000400385100001						
J	Henning, K; von Oheimb, G; Hardtle, W; Fichtner, A; Tischew, S				Henning, Katrin; von Oheimb, Goddert; Haerdtle, Werner; Fichtner, Andreas; Tischew, Sabine			The reproductive potential and importance of key management aspects for successful Calluna vulgaris rejuvenation on abandoned Continental heaths	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The abandonment of traditional pastoralism as well as the use of heath areas for military purposes has had a major impact on dry heaths in the Continental biogeographical region of Europe, causing severe degradation of its key species Calluna vulgaris (L.) HULL. The reproductive potential of this species in a Continental climate is assumed to be low, although there is yet no observational or experimental evidence for this. More knowledge is also needed about cost-effective and sustainable measures to restore abandoned dry heaths in this biogeographical region, because traditional management options are often too expensive (e.g., sod-cutting) or restricted due to environmental laws and the danger of unexploded ammunition (e.g., burning). Using as an example an 800 ha Continental heathland in Germany that has been abandoned for about two decades, we studied the reproductive potential (seed production, soil seed bank, and germination ability) of degenerate C. vulgaris stands. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive field experiment to test the effects of low-intensity, year-round grazing by Heck cattle and Konik horses as well as one-time mowing and patchy exposure of bare soil on the generative rejuvenation (i.e., recruitment and survival) of degenerate C. vulgaris stands over 3 years. We used generalized linear mixed models for statistical analyses. Seed production of degenerate C. vulgaris stands was high as well as the germination ability of their seeds, being similar to Atlantic heathlands. However, soil seed-bank densities were lower than those found in managed or abandoned Atlantic heaths. Overall seedling recruitment in the field was considerably lower in comparison with Atlantic heaths. Low-intensity grazing or one-time mowing did not induce a substantial increase in C. vulgaris recruitment, whereas an additional one-time creation of bare soil patches or the one-time creation of bare soil without subsequent management significantly facilitated seedling recruitment and survival in the first year. However, from the second year on, the positive effect of the creation of bare soil without subsequent management was no longer present. In the third year, survival of juveniles was significantly supported by low-intensity grazing in combination with shallow soil disturbances as well as in combination with one-time mowing and shallow soil disturbances, whereas mowing alone resulted in marginally significant lower survival. The extremely low seedling recruitment requires a careful choice of suitable management measures to promote the survival of sufficient numbers of Calluna individuals. Therefore, we recommend low-intensity grazing with free-ranging robust breeds and the combination of this with one-time mowing as an effective means of supporting generative rejuvenation of C. vulgaris in degraded heaths. However, at the beginning of the restoration process, the creation of bare soil patches for seedling recruitment is crucial. For implementation into practice, we present different strategies to enhance the proportion of bare soil after long-term abandonment of heaths when traditional management options are no longer feasible.				von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015	von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Fichtner, Andreas/0000-0003-0499-4893												2045-7758					APR	2017	7	7					2091	2100		10.1002/ece3.2816							WOS:000399738700008	28405275

J	Deng, HJ; Jim, CY				Deng, Huijuan; Jim, C. Y.			Spontaneous plant colonization and bird visits of tropical extensive green roof	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Green roofs can contribute to enrichment and conservation of urban ecology. An experimental green roof was established in humid-tropical Hong Kong to monitor over two years its spontaneous colonization by plants and bird visits. Some 94 voluntary vascular plant species from 26 families and 76 genera were established, with propagules brought mainly by birds and wind and secondarily inherited from soil seed bank. Plant species composition changed dynamically during the study period. They fall into three groups, namely dominant ruderal (herbaceous and sub-shrub) as surrogate of early-stage local grassland ecosystem succession, arboreal (trees and shrubs), and hygrophilous herb. Progressive increase in vegetation cover was accompanied by changes in species diversity and evenness. In addition, 16 bird species from 8 families and 14 genera were recorded. Ten species were residents and the six migrant species were winter visitors. Their food preference was mainly omnivore and insectivore. Winter and the second year encountered higher species richness, diversity, and evenness. Most vegetation parameters correlated positively with avian community indexes, signifying provision of sustenance by green-roof ecosystem to birds. Vegetation coverage correlated negatively with avian abundance, due to shunning by the abundant ground-foraging Tree Sparrow. Both local common ruderal plant species and common urban bird species can successfully establish and reproduce on the extensive green roof, confirming potentials for urban ecology and biodiversity enhancement and conservation even in densely-developed urban areas. The successful nurturing of naturalistic green roof offers new opportunities for green roof design that deviates from the predominant cultivated-horticultural approach.

J	Huang, L				Huang, Lei			Spatial distribution of Agriophyllum squarrosum Moq.

Specifically, detailed analyses on the spatial distribution of A. squarrosum and the related soil properties were carried out at a small scale in the straw checkerboards. A. squarrosum is an excellent pioneer plant for revegetation in desert areas. However, the distribution pattern of A. squarrosum and the influencing factors have not been sufficiently delineated. The results showed that the species richness and the abundance of A. squarrosum were decreased exponentially from the border to the center of the straw checkerboards. At the micro-geomorphological scale, the soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), and soil infiltration rate in the topsoil tended to increase from the center to the border within a straw checkerboard, while soil moisture presented an opposite tendency. The soil seed bank of A. squarrosum, soil bulk density, electrical conductivity, sand content, CaCO3 accumulation, and pH showed no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the border and the center of the straw checkerboards. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the abundance of A. squarrosum was mainly determined by the concentrations of SOM, nitrogen, and the infiltration rate, implying that nutrient acclimation was the optimal competitive strategy of A. squarrosum for surviving in a barren natural environment of an arid desert region.																	1674-6767	2194-7783				APR	2017	9	2					176	187		10.1007/s40333-017-0010-x							WOS:000396210500002						
J	Nascimento, JPB; Meiado, MV				Bispo Nascimento, Joana Paula; Meiado, Marcos Vinicius			In situ or ex situ seed conservation: which is the more effective way to maintain seed longevity of an endangered cactus?	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												With restricted populations and a small number of individuals, Discocactus bahiensisBritton & Rose (Cactaceae) is an endangered species in Brazil and its capacity for the formation of seed banks in the soil and the maintenance of seed viability remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the most efficient way to maintain viability during storage of seeds of D. bahiensis. Seeds were stored in paper bags and either kept in a cold chamber (7 +/- 2 degrees C) in the dark (ex situ conservation) or buried in the soil to a depth of 5 cm in an area of natural occurrence of the species (in situ conservation). Germinability of the seed banks was evaluated monthly for 20 months. During the first 10 months of storage, germinability of the seeds conserved in situ and ex situ was similar to that of recently collected seeds. After this period, a 70% reduction in germinability was found for the seeds maintained in situ and there was nearly complete loss of viability after 12 months of storage in the field (germinability < 10% in the last 8 months of the experiment), indicating the ability to form persistent soil seed banks. In contrast, the seeds stored in the cold chamber maintained greater than 70% germinability throughout the entire analysis period, demonstrating that ex situ conservation is the most efficient way to maintain the viability of the seeds of this endangered species.																	0913-557X	1442-1984				APR	2017	32	2					115	120		10.1111/1442-1984.12131							WOS:000398567300002

PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												Ex situ seed banks provide an effective conservation and utilization system for crops and their wild relatives. Efforts are made to reduce genetic drift in conservation, where regeneration is a critical step. In the present study, we examined eight wild populations of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) according to 13 morphological and phenological traits. Samples of original collected seed were grown and compared with plants from first and second ex situ generation, with commercial cultivars and landraces being included for purposes of comparison. Variance analysis and Tukey multiple comparisons of means showed that the commercial cultivars and landraces were clearly distinct from the wild populations and were excluded from the further analysis. Despite the fact that the wild accessions were collected from a geographically delimited region in Norway, they exhibited significant differences in several of the measured traits. The main phenotypic patterns remain after ex situ regenerations. However, the mean values for four of the examined traits (across accessions) did change significantly from one generation to the next. Two of the eight accessions had significantly changed from one generation to the next, a tendency was observed across all the studied traits. The results were discussed in terms of regeneration circumstances. Observed changes appeared to be directional, going from populations with predominantly wild morphological types towards plants more closely resembling the commercial cultivars. Such a directional change implies that selection or gene flow has been acting on the accessions during regeneration, rather than random changes owing to genetic drift.

J	Koopmann, B; Muller, J; Tellier, A; Zivkovic, D				Koopmann, Bendix; Mueller, Johannes; Tellier, Aurelien; Zivkovic, Daniel			Fisher-Wright model with deterministic seed bank and selection	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												Seed banks are common characteristics to many plant species, which allow storage of genetic diversity in the soil as dormant seeds for various periods of time. We investigate an above-ground population following a Fisher-Wright model with selection coupled with a deterministic seed bank assuming the length of the seed bank is kept constant and the number of seeds is large. To assess the combined impact of seed banks and selection on genetic diversity, we derive a general diffusion model. The applied techniques outline a path of approximating a stochastic delay differential equation by an appropriately rescaled stochastic differential equation. We compute the equilibrium solution of the site-frequency spectrum and derive the times to fixation of an allele with and without selection. Finally, it is demonstrated that seed banks enhance the effect of selection onto the site-frequency spectrum while slowing down the time until the mutation-selection equilibrium is reached.

Recurrent fires can drive plant adaptation and reduce genetic diversity; however, the underlying population genetic processes have not been studied in detail. In this study, the neutral and adaptive evolutionary effects of contrasting fire regimes were examined in the keystone tree species Pinus halepensis Mill. (Aleppo pine), a fire-adapted conifer. The genetic diversity, demographic history and spatial genetic structure were assessed at local (within-population) and regional scales for populations exposed to different crown fire frequencies. Methods Eight natural P. halepensis stands were sampled in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, five of them in a region exposed to frequent crown fires (HiFi) and three of them in an adjacent region with a low frequency of crown fires (LoFi). Samples were genotyped at nine neutral simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and at 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from coding regions, some of them potentially important for fire adaptation. Key Results Fire regime had no effects on genetic diversity or demographic history. Three high-differentiation outlier SNPs were identified between HiFi and LoFi stands, suggesting fire-related selection at the regional scale. At the local scale, fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) was overall weak as expected for a wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed tree species. HiFi stands displayed a stronger SGS than LoFi stands at SNPs, which probably reflected the simultaneous post-fire recruitment of co-dispersed related seeds. SNPs with exceptionally strong SGS, a proxy for microenvironmental selection, were only reliably identified under the HiFi regime. Conclusions An increasing fire frequency as predicted due to global change can promote increased SGS with stronger family structures and alter natural selection in P. halepensis and in plants with similar life history traits.

J	Gioria, M; Pysek, P				Gioria, Margherita; Pysek, Petr			Early bird catches the worm: germination as a critical step in plant invasion	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The germination behavior of a plant influences its fitness, persistence, and evolutionary potential, as well as its biotic environment. This can have major effects on the invasive potential of a species. We review the findings of four types of experimental studies comparing basic germination characteristics of invasive versus non-invasive congeners, in their non-native or native distribution range; invasive alien versus native species; and invasive species in their native versus non-native distribution range. Early and/or rapid germination is typical of invasive species rather than their noninvasive congeners, and represents a pre-adaptation from which many invasive and naturalized species benefit. It also occurs more often in invasive than native species, suggesting that competition mitigation or avoidance in the early stages of a plant's life, via the exploitation of vacant germination niches, might be more useful than a superior competitive ability in novel environments. This is further supported by a tendency of invasive species to germinate earlier and/or faster and have broader germination cues in their non-native than in their native range. It is also supported by broader germination requirements being reported for invasive species than their non-invasive or native congeners. In contrast, high percentage germination is not a consistent predictor of invasiveness, suggesting that the incorporation of a larger fraction of seed production into the soil seed bank rather than high germination is a better (or safer) strategy in novel environments. These patterns indicate that differences in the germination behavior of alien and native species contribute to the invasiveness of many species, although evidence under natural conditions is needed. The role of such differences in the establishment and spread of invasive species in novel environments and their long-term impact on community dynamics requires further study.

I. Effects on weeds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops such as those tolerant to glyphosate simplify weed management and make it more efficient, at least at short-term. Overreliance on the same herbicide though leads to the spread of resistant weeds. Here, the objective was to evaluate, with simulations, the impact on the advent of glyphosate resistance in weeds of modifications in agricultural practises resulting from introducing HT maize into cropping systems. First, we included a single-gene herbicide resistance submodel in the existing multispecific FlorSys model. Then, we (1) simulated current conventional and probable HT cropping systems in two European regions, Aquitaine and Catalonia, (2) compared these systems in terms of glyphosate resistance, (3) identified pertinent cultural practises influencing glyphosate resistance, and (4) investigated correlations between cultural practises and species traits, using RLQ analyses. The simulation study showed that, during the analysed 28 years, (1) glyphosate spraying only results in glyphosate resistance in weeds when combined with other cultural factors favouring weed infestation, particularly no till; (2) pre-sowing glyphosate applications select more for herbicide resistance than post-sowing applications on HT crops; and (3) glyphosate spraying selects more for species traits avoiding exposure to the herbicide (e.g. delayed early growth, small leaf area) or compensating for fitness costs (e.g. high harvest index) than for actual resistance to glyphosate, (4) actual resistance is most frequent in species that do not avoid glyphosate, either via plant size or timing, and/or in less competitive species, (5) in case of efficient weed control measures, actual resistance proliferates best in outcrossing species. An advice table was built, with the quantitative, synthetic ranking of the crop management effects in terms of glyphosate-resistance management, identifying the optimal choices for each management technique.

Djibril; Bognounou, Fidele; Thiombiano, Adjima			Relationships between soil seed banks and above-ground vegetation along a disturbance gradient in the W National Park trans-boundary biosphere reserve, West Africa	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Vegetation succession depends on the availability of suitable propagules in the soils, thus knowledge of soil seed banks is essential for formulating effective strategies for restoring the vegetation of degraded sites. The W National Park, the only trans-boundary biosphere reserve in West Africa, is being extensively fragmented and degraded in recent decades. The aims of this study were to assess the reserve's soil seed banks, their relationships with standing vegetation and bundle of disturbances and their potential significance for vegetation restoration. Methods The size and composition of the above-ground species vegetation were assessed in nine plots of 1 ha each representing a range of habitats with differing disturbance severity (low, intermediate and high). A total of 702 soil samples were taken from three layers (0-3, 3-6 and 6-9 cm) and soil seed bank was analyzed using the seedling emergence technique. Important Findings Generally, seeds of non-woody taxa dominated in samples from all soil depths and habitats of all disturbance severities. The mean soil seed density was 17.8, 24.4 and 26.3 seeds/dm(3) in samples from the least, intermediate and most disturbed sites, respectively, and highest in the upper soil layers in all cases. The results indicate that there is limited potential for restoring woody vegetation solely from soil seed banks, and that woody species in the region rely more on recently shed seeds trapped in the standing dead biomass and litter on the ground than soil seed banks for regeneration. Thus, human intervention is needed to accelerate forest recovery, mainly through alleviating anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem (for instance, avoiding destruction of new seeds by intense fire), and site manipulation to improve environmental conditions for seedling establishment and growth. Other ways of restoring forests than through the soil seed bank (e.g. sowing seeds collected elsewhere, and planting tree seedlings) could also be relevant.																	1752-9921	1752-993X				APR	2017	10	2					349	363		10.1093/jpe/rtw025							WOS:000402091500010

A rigid ryegrass biotype from an olive grove in Jaen province (Andalusia, southern Spain), potentially resistant to glyphosate (RG), was tested for its resistance level through dose-response assays using a susceptible biotype (SG). To test the hypothesis of a non-target-site-based resistance, as point mutations are far less common mechanisms of glyphosate resistance, studies were also conducted to elucidate whether resistance was associated with biochemical, metabolism, molecular and/or physiological mechanisms. Alternative herbicide-based control options, including single-herbicide or herbicide mixtures with glyphosate, applied at seedling, tillering or full heading stages, were tested in field experiments for 2 years for their efficacy against rigid ryegrass plants and their effects on the soil seed bank. Resistance levels of the RG biotype were 23-(LD50) and 7-fold (GR(50)) higher compared to the SG biotype. The SG biotype exhibited a significantly greater shikimic acid accumulation than the RG one. At 96 HAT, 58 and 89% of applied C-14-glyphosate was up taken by leaves of RG and SG biotype plants, respectively, and, at this time, a significantly higher proportion of the glyphosate taken up by the treated leaf remained in its tissue in RG plants compared to the SG ones. The RG biotype did not reveal any point mutation in the glyphosate target site EPSP synthase. Overall, results confirmed reduced glyphosate uptake and translocation as being the mechanism involved in glyphosate resistance in the RG biotype. RG biotype responses to the alternative treatments tested in situ indicated that herbicide applications at the later growth stage tended to be less effective in terms of immediate effects on population size than earlier applications, and that only in some cases, the removal of at least 85% of the RG biotype was achieved. However, with few exceptions, the alternative treatments tested appeared to be highly effective in reducing the seed bank irrespective of the growth stage. The frequency of the resistant phenotype in the progeny of surviving plants of the RG biotype was dependent on treatment. Results suggest that a potential exists for effective management of glyphosate-resistant rigid ryegrass in olive groves in southern Spain.

Temporally Robust Models for Predicting Seed Yield of Moist-Soil Plants	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Rapid assessment of food production and subsequent availability is fundamental to evaluating wetland management practices and general habitat quality for waterfowl. Traditional methods of estimating food biomass (e.g., plot and core sampling) require considerable time, expertise, and cost. Rapid assessment models using plant measurements or scanned seed-head area have recently been adapted to predict seed production in moist-soil wetlands. We evaluated existing models of seed production and estimated benthic seed density with data collected during autumn 2011 in western Tennessee, USA, to improve prediction capability of seed availability for waterfowl. Generally, all models explained significant variation (r(2) = 0.85-0.98) and accurately predicted seed production in moist-soil plants (r(2) = 0.84-0.97). Belowground proportions of seed biomass and duck energy days differed across species relative to previously reported biomass estimates in moist-soil wetlands ((x) over bar = 0.4-9.1%); thus, production estimates from models should be adjusted on a species-specific basis and the effect of belowground seeds on overall energetic carrying capacity estimates will vary with species composition of wetlands. We recommend use of updated most-soil rapid-assessment models incorporating seed bank estimates to predict waterfowl food availability and evaluate management practices.

Prioritizing conservation seed banking locations for imperiled hemlock species using multi-attribute frontier mapping	NEW FORESTS												Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA) is an invasive forest insect sweeping across the native range of eastern (Tsuga canadensis [L.] Carr.) and Carolina (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) hemlocks, threatening to severely reduce eastern hemlock extent and to push Carolina hemlock to extirpation. HWA poses a significant threat to these eastern US natives, now infesting hemlocks across 19 states and more than 400 counties. For the long-term preservation of the species, ex situ genetic resource conservation efforts such as seed collection, storage, and adelgid-resistant hemlock breeding may all be necessary. To ensure the efficient and effective application of these efforts, it will be necessary to prioritize locations within the native ranges, because it is logistically impossible to apply these efforts to all populations. To build upon 12 years of seed banking for eastern and Carolina hemlock, we applied a novel approach for incorporating multiple dissimilar data sets into a geographic prioritization of areas for the most effective and efficient conservation of genetic diversity. The approach involves integration of geographic information systems with the multi-attribute frontier mapping technique to identify locations across the ranges of these two imperiled species most in need of conservation actions. Specifically, our assessment incorporated four genetic diversity parameters, a climate component, a measure of population disjunctiveness, a measure of local hemlock abundance, and seed collection density to prioritize areas of eastern and Carolina hemlock occurrence for ex situ gene conservation. For each species, the result was a mapped index of locations prioritized by the combined significance of these factors. For eastern hemlock, this assessment assigned the highest priority to disjunct populations and to some areas within the main-body range. With Carolina hemlock, disjunct northern populations and central main-body locations received the highest prioritization. Our prioritization approach could be applied similarly to other species facing pressure from invasive pests or other environmental threats.

The analyzed species were Colobanthus quitensis of West Antarctic (King George Island, South Shetlands Islands) as well as Cerastium alpinum and Silene involucrata of the Arctic (Spitsbergen, Svalbard). In all evaluated species, flowering responses were adapted to the short Arctic and Australian summer, and adaptations to autogamy and anemogamy were also observed. The microsporangia of the analyzed plants produced small numbers of microspore mother cells that were differentiated into a dozen or dozens of trinucleate pollen grains. The majority of mature pollen grains remained inside microsporangia and germinated in the thecae. The monosporous Polygonum type (the most common type in angiosperms) of embryo sac development was observed in the studied species. The egg apparatus had an egg cell and two synergids with typical polarization. A well-developed filiform apparatus was differentiated in the micropylar end of the synergids. In mature diaspores of the analyzed plants of the family Caryophyllaceae, a large and peripherally located embryo was, in most part, adjacent to perisperm cells filled with reserve substances, whereas the radicle was surrounded by micropylar endosperm composed of a single layer of cells with thick, intensely stained cytoplasm, organelles and reserve substances. The testae of the analyzed plants were characterized by species-specific primary and secondary sculpture, and they contained large amounts of osmophilic material with varied density. Seeds of C. quitensis, C. alpinum and S. involucrata are very small, light and compact shaped.

However, scarce information is available on how thinning may influence fire severity and vegetation regeneration in case a new fire occurs. We investigated the relationship between thinning and fire severity in P. halepensis thickets, and the effects on the establishment of pine seedlings and resprouting vigour in resprouter species the year after the fire. Our results show a positive relationship between forest basal area and fire severity, and thus reserved pines in thinned stands suffered less fire damage than those in un-thinned sites (respectively, 2.02 +/- 0.13 vs. 2.93 +/- 0.15 in a scale from 0 to 4). Ultimately, differences in fire severity influenced post-fire regeneration. Resprouting vigour varied depending on the species and the size of individuals but it was consistently higher in thinned stands. Concerning P. halepensis, the proportion of cones surviving the fire decreased with fire severity. However, this could not compensate the much lower pine density in thinned stands and thus the overall seed crop was higher in un-thinned areas. Establishment of pine seedlings was negatively affected by the slope and positively driven by the number of cones and thus it was higher in un-thinned than in thinned stands (respectively, 2581 +/- 649 vs. 898 +/- 325 seedlings center dot ha(-1)). Thinning decreases fire intensity, and thus it may facilitate fire suppression tasks, but retaining a higher density of pines would be necessary to ensure P. halepensis regeneration after a new fire event.

The knowledge of the regenerative potential of mining disturbed areas provides valuable information for their ecological restoration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of age of abandonment of mines and their distance from the adjacent forest, on the formation of soil seed bank in abandoned mines in the San Juan, Choco, Colombia. To do this, we determined the abundance and species composition of the soil seed bank, and the dynamics of seed rain in mines of different cessation period of mining activity (6 and 15 years), and at different distances from the adjacent forest matrix (50 and 100 m). Seed rain was composed by five species of plants with anemocorous dispersion, and was more abundant in the mine of 6 years than in the mine of 15 years. There were no significant differences in the number of seeds collected at 50 m and 100 m from the adjacent forest. The soil seed bank was represented by eight species: two with anemocorous dispersion (common among the seed rain species) and the rest with zoochorous dispersion. The abundance of seeds in the soil did not vary with the age of the mine, but was higher at close distances to the forest edge than far away. During the early revegetation, the formation of the soil seed bank in the mines seems to be related to their proximity to other disturbed areas, rather than their proximity to the adjacent forest or the cessation activity period of mines. Therefore, the establishment of artificial perches or the maintenance of isolated trees in the abandoned mines could favour the arrival of bird-dispersed seeds at mines of high-rainfall environments in the Choco region.

We sampled C. pachystachya seeds lodged in palm stems and recorded the seed rain to low stems, high stems and to the ground below and away from palms. We also tested seed germination on soil and stem substrates and measured the chemical composition of both substrates. Compared to freestanding conspecifics, hemiepiphytes of C. pachystachya were rare and displayed wider trunks but similar height. All hemiepiphytes were fixed on low stems by aerial roots encircling the palms and coalesced branches rooted into the ground. Most palm stems contained C. pachystachya seeds but a few concentrated seeds massively. Dispersal of seeds was 15 times greater to lower than higher portions of stems, and seven times higher below palms than elsewhere. Germination rates of C. pachystachya seeds did not differ between soil and stem substrates. The clayey stem substrate presented more Zn, K, P, Ca, Mg and Al than the sandy soil, which in turn presented more Fe and Cu. The exceptional occurrence of C. pachystachya as a facultative hemiepiphyte in the "Pantanal" wetland results from massive seed rain to lower regions of palm stems, where germination, mechanical stability and access to nutrients are conducive to establishment and subsequent growth. However, the rarity of hemiepiphytism in C. pachystachya indicates that opportunities for successful establishment rely on a combination of uncertain spatiotemporal conditions.

Methodological bias in the seed bank flora holds significant implications for understanding seed bank community functions	PLANT BIOLOGY												Persistent seed banks are a key plant regeneration strategy, buffering environmental variation to allow population and species persistence. Understanding seed bank functioning within herb layer dynamics is therefore important. However, rather than assessing emergence from the seed bank in herb layer gaps, most studies evaluate the seed bank functioning via a greenhouse census. We hypothesise that greenhouse data may not reflect seed bank-driven emergence in disturbance gaps due to methodological differences. Failure in detecting (specialist) species may then introduce methodological bias into the ecological interpretation of seed bank functions using greenhouse data. The persistent seed bank was surveyed in 40 semi-natural grassland plots across a fragmented landscape, quantifying seedling emergence in both the greenhouse and in disturbance gaps. Given the suspected interpretational bias, we tested whether each census uncovers similar seed bank responses to fragmentation. Seed bank characteristics were similar between censuses. Census type affected seed bank composition, with >25% of species retrieved better by either census type, dependent on functional traits including seed longevity, production and size. Habitat specialists emerged more in disturbance gaps than in the greenhouse, while the opposite was true for ruderal species. Both censuses uncovered fragmentation-induced seed bank patterns. Low surface area sampling, larger depth of sampling and germination conditions cause underrepresentation of the habitat-specialised part of the persistent seed bank flora during greenhouse censuses. Methodological bias introduced in the recorded seed bank data may consequently have significant implications for the ecological interpretation of seed bank community functions based on greenhouse data.

J	Ren, L; Bai, YG				Ren, Lei; Bai, Yuguang			Burning Modifies Composition of Emergent Seedlings in Fescue Prairie	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Fire plays a crucial role in mediating species composition in Fescue Prairie. However, previous studies focused on responses of plant community to burning without disentangling the effects of burning on seedling emergence in Fescue Prairie. In this study, seedlings emerging in the field and from soil seed banks incubated in a greenhouse were examined after burning in the spring of 2012 and 2013 near Saskatoon, Canada. Soil seed bank samples were taken from the top 5 cm of the soil profile, separated into litter, 0- to 1-cm soil, and 1 - to 5-cm soil layers. In the 2-yr field study, 11 plant families with 1 graminoid and 22 nongraminoids were identified among emerged seedlings. Burning significantly increased the number of 3 native and 1 non-native seedlings emerging, as well as total seedlings emerging from the field in both years (P < 0.05). Species richness and diversity of seedlings emerging from the field were increased by burning. Species composition of emerged seedlings from the field was significantly altered by burning in 2012 (P = 0.03) and 2013 (P < 0.01). In the 2-yr soil seed bank study, 19 plant families with 10 graminoids and 56 nongraminoids emerged. Burning had more prominent effects on seedling density of native species and forbs, rather than non-native species and graminoids. Species composition was altered by burning in all studied soil layers (P < 0.05). Fire appears to stimulate recruitment of some species, especially early seral species, contributing to potential changes in species composition of the Fescue Prairie.

J	Liyanage, GS; Ooi, MKJ				Liyanage, Ganesha S.; Ooi, Mark K. J.			Do dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds change as seeds age in the soil seed bank?	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												In fire-prone ecosystems, many species regenerate after fire from persistent soil seed banks. Species with physically dormant (PY) seeds have dormancy broken by fire-related heat. The magnitude of post-fire recruitment, to predict response to varying fire severity, is commonly estimated by testing dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds of fresh PY seeds. However, seeds spend years in the soil during the inter-fire period, and determining whether dormancy-breaking thresholds change over time is essential to accurately predict population persistence. Germination of four south-eastern Australian PY species from the Fabaceae family (Acacia linifolia, Aotus ericoides, Bossiaea heterophylla and Viminaria juncea) were studied. Dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds vary inter-specifically and the species represented either high or low dormancy-breaking threshold classes. Freshly collected seeds, and seeds that had been buried in the field or stored in dry laboratory conditions for 6 and 18 months were subjected to a fire-related range of heat treatments (40-100 degrees C). Seed ageing increased germination response to heat treatments, effectively lowering the dormancy-breaking thresholds of three species. The fourth species, A. linifolia, initially had a relatively large non-dormant fraction which was lost as seeds aged, with older seeds then displaying PY broadly similar to the other study species. Patterns of threshold decay were species-specific, with the thresholds and viability of low-threshold species declining more rapidly than high-threshold species. The non-dormant fraction did not increase over time for any of our study species. Instead of increasing their non-dormant fraction, as is common in other vegetation types, these fire-prone PY species displayed a change of dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds. This is an important distinction, as maintaining dormancy during the inter-fire period is essential for population persistence. While changes in sensitivity to dormancy-breaking treatments have previously been reported as seeds age, our study provides the first test of changes to temperature thresholds, which increases the range of germination response from the seed bank under varying fire severity.

Secondary dormancy induction and release in Bromus tectorum seeds: the role of temperature, water potential and hydrothermal time	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seeds of the winter annual Bromus tectorum lose primary dormancy in summer and are poised to germinate rapidly in the autumn. If rainfall is inadequate, seeds remain ungerminated and may enter secondary dormancy under winter conditions. We quantified conditions under which seeds enter secondary dormancy in the laboratory and field and also examined whether contrasting B. tectorum genotypes responded differently to dormancy induction cues. The study also extends previous hydrothermal time models for primary dormancy loss and germination timing in B. tectorum by using similar models to account for induction and loss of secondary dormancy. Maximum secondary dormancy was achieved in the laboratory after 4 weeks at -1.0 MPa and 5 degrees C. Seeds in the field became increasingly dormant through exposure to temperatures and water potentials in this range, confirming laboratory results. They were released from dormancy through secondary after-ripening the following summer. Different genotypes showed contrasting responses to dormancy induction cues in both laboratory and field. To examine secondary dormancy induction and release in the field in terms of hydrothermal time parameters, we first created a model that allowed mean base water potential (Psi(b)(50)) to vary while holding other hydrothermal time parameters constant, as in models for primary dormancy loss under dry conditions. The second model allowed all three model parameters to vary through time, to account for changes (e.g. hydrothermal time accumulation) that could occur simultaneously with dormancy induction in imbibed seeds. Shifts in Psi(b)(50) could explain most changes in dormancy status for seeds retrieved from the field, except during the short period prior to dormancy induction, when hydrothermal time was accumulating. This study illustrates that hydrothermal modelling, and specifically changes in Psi(b)(50), can be used to characterize secondary dormancy induction and loss in B. tectorum.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				MAR	2017	27	1					12	25		10.1017/S0960258516000258							WOS:000395510300002

Therefore, various fire-related cues can be expected to stimulate germination in post-fire annuals. Germination patterns of the rare annual Chaenorhinum rubrifolium (Plantaginaceae) were examined in response to mechanical scarification, heat shock, aqueous smoke, nitrogenous compounds, gibberellic acid, karrikinolide (KAR(1)), and mandelonitrile (a cyanohydrin analogue, MAN) under dark and photoperiod conditions in the laboratory. Combinations of these treatments were also included in the experiment. Strong physiological dormancy in the seeds of C. rubrifolium was partially broken by several fire-related germination cues, including smoke and nitrate, under light conditions. KAR(1) and MAN also stimulated germination, and the highest improvement in germination was achieved in the KAR(1) treatment in the presence of light. Heat shock + smoke and KAR(1) + MAN combinations had positive synergetic and additive effects on germination under light conditions, respectively. The light played a crucial role in the promotion of germination. The results suggest that multiple fire-related cues operate to stimulate germination in C. rubrifolium, an annual species from the Mediterranean Basin. However, the species may have a broader germination niche than a fire-restricted one.

J	Schwab, A; Kiehl, K				Schwab, Andre; Kiehl, Kathrin			Analysis of soil seed bank patterns in an oxbow system of a disconnected floodplain	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Soil seed banks have a high potential for vegetation re-establishment in restoration projects. We studied the soil seed bank in an oxbow system of a disconnected floodplain of the Danube River in Southern Germany. The aim of the study was to analyze if floodplain target species were still present in the seed bank after more than 150 years of embankment and disconnection from fluvial dynamics. In this context we investigated seed density, seed bank species richness and species composition in four broad habitat types with and without water-level fluctuations during the time of embankment (permanent water, fluctuating water, reed bed, hardwood floodplain forest). In addition, the similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation in these habitat types was studied in order to predict the success of future restoration measures. In total, 124 vascular plant species were determined in the seed bank samples. More than 50 % (66 species) were target species typical for floodplain habitats and 26 of these target species were lost or very rare in the above-ground vegetation. The four habitat types differed significantly in mean seed density and mean species richness. Mean species richness and the number of target species in the seed bank as well as the mean seed density were greatest in the habitats with fluctuating water level whereas mean seed density was much lower in the parts with more or less stable conditions like permanently standing water and hardwood floodplain forest Sorensen similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation was very low in habitats with more or less stable water levels and desirable floodplain target species were very rare or completely absent. Our results indicate that the soil seed bank can be an important seed reservoir for the ecological restoration of floodplain plant communities especially for habitats with unstable environmental conditions during the period of disconnection. Restoration of water level dynamics is important to maintain the seed bank of populations of floodplain target species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yannelli, FA; Hughes, P; Kollmann, J				Yannelli, Florencia A.; Hughes, Phillip; Kollmann, Johannes			Preventing plant invasions at early stages of revegetation: The role of limiting similarity in seed size and seed density	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Revegetation of roadsides is an opportunity for grassland restoration, yet these habitats are prone to be colonised by invasive alien plant species (IAS). Therefore, the selection of seed mixtures for revegetation should consider potential competition with IAS present in the soil seed bank or arriving by traffic-related seed rain. We investigated whether the limiting similarity hypothesis, in terms of plant seed-size-output strategy, could be used to design native grassland communities resistant to IAS. In a greenhouse experiment, a small- or a large-seeded IAS was sown into factorial combinations of two native communities with small or large seed-size-output strategies at two sowing densities. Height and aboveground biomass of the IAS were measured after four and eight weeks, respectively. Small-seeded native communities at high density were highly effective in suppressing the small- and large-seeded IAS, mostly controlled by a density effect. Thus, limiting similarity in seed-size-output strategy only partly explained resistance to IAS, while density-driven suppression was more effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Novel allelic variation is needed to break the yield plateau, particularly in the face of climate change and rapidly evolving pests and pathogens. Landraces preserved in seed banks likely harbour valuable sources of untapped genetic diversity because they were cultivated for thousands of years under diverse eco-geographical conditions prior to modern breeding. We performed the first genetic characterisation of bread wheat accessions sourced from the N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) in St Petersburg, Russia. A panel comprising 295 accessions, including landraces, breeding lines and cultivars was subject to single seed descent (SSD) and genotyped using the genotyping-by-sequencing Diversity Arrays Technology platform (DArT-seq); returning a total of 34,311 polymorphic markers (14,228 mapped and 20,083 unmapped). Cluster analysis identified two distinct groups; one comprising mostly breeding lines and cultivars, and the other comprising landraces. Diversity was benchmarked in comparison to a set of standards, which revealed a high degree of genetic similarity among breeding material from Australia and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Further, 11,025 markers (1888 mapped and 9137 unmapped) were polymorphic in the diversity panel only, thus representing allelic diversity potentially not present in Australian or CIMMYT germplasm. Open-access to DArT-seq markers and seed for SSD lines will empower researchers, pre-breeders and breeders to rediscover genetic diversity in the VIR collection and accelerate utilisation of novel alleles to improve wheat.

Gaps in seed banking are compromising the GSPC's Target 8 in a megadiverse country	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Ex situ seed conservation is an effective strategy to help safeguarding plants from extinction. The updated Global Strategy for Plant Conservation's (GSPC) Target 8 aims to include 75% of threatened plant species in ex situ collections by 2020, preferably in the country of origin. Halfway through the updated GSPC program, we evaluate the current state of knowledge and practice of ex situ seed conservation of threatened species from megadiverse Brazilian flora, contributing to this Target. We identify knowledge gaps and costs to achieve Target 8 through seed banking in Brazil within the time constraints of the GSPC and in a scenario of recent science budget funding cuts. Knowledge on seed storage behavior is available only for 24 Brazilian species (1.3%). Seed desiccation tolerance was concluded for 175 of 228 species, feasibly allowing safe storage of most Brazilian species at sub-zero temperatures. However, only 26 species (1.3%) are effectively banked in research institutions. Surprisingly, the percentage of banked threatened species hardly increased in the first 5 years since the update of the Target (0.55%, 2011-2015), and Brazil now faces the challenge of banking almost 1500 species during 2016-2020. Despite a major lack of commitment of Brazilian institutions and of knowledge to achieve the Target, the costs for banking the remaining species were estimated to be only US$3.9 million. We call for a nationwide coordinated effort of government agencies, policy makers and research institutions to include ex situ seed conservation in the environmental agenda to pursue achievement of the Target by 2020.

O.			Where does the community start, and where does it end? Including the seed bank to reassess forest herb layer responses to the environment	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionBelow-ground processes are key determinants of above-ground plant population and community dynamics. Still, our understanding of how environmental drivers shape plant communities is mostly based on above-ground diversity patterns, bypassing below-ground plant diversity stored in seed banks. As seed banks may shape above-ground plant communities, we question whether concurrently analysing the above- and below-ground species assemblages may potentially enhance our understanding of community responses to environmental variation. LocationTemperate deciduous forests along a 2000km latitudinal gradient in NW Europe. MethodsHerb layer, seed bank and local environmental data including soil pH, canopy cover, forest cover continuity and time since last canopy disturbance were collected in 129 temperate deciduous forest plots. We quantified herb layer and seed bank diversity per plot and evaluated how environmental variation structured community diversity in the herb layer, seed bank and the combined herb layer-seed bank community. ResultsSeed banks consistently held more plant species than the herb layer. How local plot diversity was partitioned across the herb layer and seed bank was mediated by environmental variation in drivers serving as proxies of light availability. The herb layer and seed bank contained an ever smaller and ever larger share of local diversity, respectively, as both canopy cover and time since last canopy disturbance decreased. Species richness and -diversity of the combined herb layer-seed bank community responded distinctly differently compared to the separate assemblages in response to environmental variation in, e.g. forest cover continuity and canopy cover. ConclusionsThe seed bank is a below-ground diversity reservoir of the herbaceous forest community, which interacts with the herb layer, although constrained by environmental variation in e.g. light availability. The herb layer and seed bank co-exist as a single community by means of the so-called storage effect, resulting in distinct responses to environmental variation not necessarily recorded in the individual herb layer or seed bank assemblages. Thus, concurrently analysing above- and below-ground diversity will improve our ecological understanding of how understorey plant communities respond to environmental variation.

J	Carta, A; Bottega, S; Spano, C				Carta, Angelino; Bottega, Stefania; Spano, Carmelina			Aerobic environment ensures viability and anti-oxidant capacity when seeds are wet with negative effect when moist: implications for persistence in the soil	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Interchangeable effects of temperature, moisture content and oxygen on seed longevity have been mostly examined to estimate seed viability during long-term dry storage, whereas few experiments have studied seed viability under near-natural conditions to evaluate seed persistence in the soil. To this end, we artificially aged seeds of Ranunculus baudotii, a hydrophyte widely distributed in temporary ponds constituting an abundant soil seed bank. Seeds were exposed to controlled ageing at three different relative humidities (RH) under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. Their viability, water content, membrane damage, oxidative stress and anti-oxidant enzymatic defence activity were evaluated. Seed survival was longer at higher relative humidity (97% RH), and lowest at a relative humidity (90% RH) simulating moist but not waterlogged soils. Anoxic conditions showed a protective role on viability at lower moisture contents (70% RH). Seed viability was negatively associated with hydrogen peroxide content and correlated with anti-oxidant enzyme activities, but not with membrane damage. Altogether, these results suggest negative roles for moist soils and anoxia in determining seed persistence in the field, but at higher moisture contents the negative effects of anaerobia diminished. The anti-oxidant system activation, even under unfavourable conditions, might recover seeds once all protective processes can operate, pointing out the plasticity of mechanisms involved in seed loss viability.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				MAR	2017	28	1					16	23		10.1017/S0960258517000307							WOS:000426530700003						
J	Tricault, Y; Matejicek, A; Darmency, H				Tricault, Yann; Matejicek, Annick; Darmency, Henri			Variation of seed dormancy and longevity in Raphanus raphanistrum L	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish) is a highly competitive weed in winter crops. Integrated weed management practices and decision-making tools benefit from the ability to predict seed longevity and dormancy status in the soil seed bank, as well as time and density of emergence in the field. We wondered if unique values taken from databases could serve for modelling purposes, whatever the origins of the weed populations. We investigated dormancy and longevity of fruits buried in the soil over a four-year seed burial experiment of two highly contrasted populations that differ by their biogeographical origin (oceanic versus continental climate), their habitat (arable field versus undisturbed) and their fruit size (thick versus thin fruit wall). High viability persisted over two years, followed by a rapid reduction, especially for the 'continental-undisturbed-thin' population. Dormancy cycling, with dormancy at its lowest in October, was observed for the 'oceanic-arable-thick' population, whilst a slow decrease without clear seasonal pattern was found for the other population. These results indicate different ways of regulating seed persistence in the soil, which might be taken into account when building demographic models. These differences could be due to interactions between fruit wall thickness and the other factors; it is possible that a thicker fruit wall increases longevity by promoting dormancy by physical restriction, but depending on temperature. Thinner fruit walls would make plants display other adaptive strategies to maximize survival time in the soil seed bank. Studies involving more populations and isogenic material are needed to address this specific question.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				MAR	2017	28	1					34	40		10.1017/S0960258517000319							WOS:000426530700005

The potential applications that this process has on wild species, which can be useful for restoration, are usually overlooked. This study analyses the germination response after natural priming and hydropriming of Penstemon roseus and Castilleja tenuiflora, two perennial herbs growing in a protected area known as Parque Ecologico de la Ciudad de Mexico'. Photoblastism was evaluated for both species. Seeds were exposed to a hydration/dehydration cycle and then placed in germination chambers to determine responses to hydropriming. To identify the effects of natural priming, seeds were buried in natural conditions and then recovered every two months and placed in germination chambers. Germination percentages and rates were then quantified. Both species proved to have permeable seed coats. Penstemon roseus seeds are positive photoblastic whereas C. tenuiflora seeds are indifferent to light. Priming methods increased C. tenuiflora germination rates, but they did not affect germination capacity. For P. roseus, priming methods did not improve germination rates, and germination capacity of recovered seeds decreased after the rainy season, suggesting that P. roseus forms a short-term, transient, seed bank. The germination strategies of these two species allow them to occupy suitable microsites for germination and establishment. These responses can be helpful in developing restoration programmes based on the accelerated establishment of native and characteristic successional species.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				MAR	2017	28	1					63	71		10.1017/S0960258518000016							WOS:000426530700008

We investigated the effects of dry (11-25% relative humidity) and freezing (-18 degrees C) storage conditions, phylogeny and plant life-history traits (life-form, life-span, microhabitat and seed dispersal mode) on seed germination percentage (GP) and time to reach 50% germination (T-50) of 53 species native to pine rocklands in South Florida, USA, a globally critically imperiled ecosystem. Most species we studied (68%) withstood dry and freezing storage conditions and thus ex situ seed banking can assist their long-term conservation. Bayesian mixed effect models revealed that there was a significant phylogenetic signal in GP and T-50 across species. Life-history covariates did not explain significant additional variation in GP in models controlling for the phylogenetic relationships among species. T-50 differed among species with contrasting dispersal modes, with animal-dispersed seeds exhibiting more delayed germination than wind-dispersed or unassisted seeds. Differential germination responses across species with different seed dispersal modes have implications for potential shifts in species composition under disturbance and climate change. Thus, knowledge of species-relatedness and some life-history traits such as seed dispersal mode can significantly assist management decisions regarding seed storage and conservation of subtropical endangered plants.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				MAR	2017	28	1					82	92		10.1017/S0960258517000332							WOS:000426530700010

Moreover, the fitness penalty associated with herbicide resistance is not a stable parameter and can be influenced by ecological factors. Here, we used two Brachypodium hybridum accessions collected from the same planted forest, sensitive (S) and target-site resistance (TSR) to photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors, to study the effect of agro-ecological parameters on fitness penalty. Both accessions were collected in the same habitat, thus, we can assume that the genetic variance between them is relatively low. This allow us to focus on the effect of PSII TSR on plant fitness. S plants grains were significantly larger than those of the TSR plants and this was associated with a higher rate of germination. Under low radiation, the TSR plants showed a significant fitness penalty relative to S plants. S plants exhibiting dominance when both types of plants were grown together in a low-light environment. In contrast to previous documented studies, under high-light environment our TSR accession didn't show any significant difference in fitness compared to the S accession. Nitrogen deficiency had significant effect on the R compared to the S accession and was demonstrated in significant yield reduction. TSR plants also expressed a high fitness penalty, relative to the S plants, when grown in competition with wheat plants. Two evolutionary scenarios can be suggested to explain the coexistence of both TSR and S plants in the same habitat. The application of PSII inhibitors may have created selective pressure toward TSR dominancy; termination of herbicide application gave an ecological advantage to S plants, creating changes in the composition of the seed bank. Alternatively, the high radiation intensities found in the Mediterranean-like climate may reduce the fitness penalty associated with TSR. Our results may suggest that by integrating non herbicidal approaches into weed management programs, we can reduce the agricultural costs associated with herbicide resistance.

J	Dos Santos, VM; Matheson, FE				Dos Santos, Virginie M.; Matheson, Fleur E.			Higher seagrass cover and biomass increases sexual reproductive effort: A rare case study of Zostera muelleri in New Zealand	AQUATIC BOTANY												Sexual reproduction by seagrasses is highly variable within and amongst species and the factors influencing this variability are not well understood. In particular little is known for Zostera Imielleri in New Zealand. After discovery of a flowering shoot in a North Island estuary, we quantified their abundance across the intertidal zone at multiple sites monthly for 2.5 years. We also measured plant cover, leaf size, light intensity and temperature. Seed bank density, plant biomass and porewater nutrients were included in a subsequent investigation of one site. We found that flowering shoots were present annually during spring and summer but not at all sites, and generally at low densities (mean: 1.3 shoots m(-2), maximum: 72 shoots m-2). Plant cover was significantly higher (by 1.5-fold) and leaf size was significantly larger (length by 1.5-fold, width by 1.8-fold) in plots containing flowering shoots than in plots with none. The single site investigation showed that dense patches with flowering shoots had significantly higher biomass (1.7-3.9-fold) than non-flowering areas. Our results correct a previous misconception that flowering in New Zealand Zostera muelleri is rare. They also suggest that allocation of energy into sexual reproduction in this species is plant cover and biomass dependent. Thus anthropogenic or natural factors that limit the development of dense patches or meadows in the intertidal zone may inhibit sexual reproduction and, consequently, genetic diversity and fitness.

(Theaceae): effects of cold-stratification and exogenous gibberellic acid application on germination	BOTANY												There are several different opinions regarding dormancy in tea (Camellia sinensis L.), but there is no strong evidence available to conclude whether or not these seeds are dormant. Freshly matured tea seeds collected from Hangzhou, China, at the natural dispersal time did not germinate in light at daily alternative temperature regimes of 10/15, 15/20, 20/25, or 25/35 degrees C, or at a constant temperature of 25 degrees C. Seeds were permeable to water and the embryos did not grow prior to radicle emergence, thus, the seeds have no physical, morphological, or morphophysiological dormancy. When cold-stratified at 4 degrees C for 1, 2, and 3 months, 64%, 88%, and 93% of the seeds germinated, respectively. Intact fresh seeds failed to germinate after treatment with 0, 10, 500, and 1000 ppm GA(3), whereas 3%, 4%, 61%, and 86% of cracked seeds germinated, respectively. Thus, the seeds have nondeep and intermediate physiological dormancy. Seeds cold-stratified for 2 months that were buried at soil depths of 0, 1, and 5 cm in pots showed that seeds at 1 cm depth established significantly higher number of seedlings (P < 0.05) than at other two depths. Because tea seeds are susceptible to summer temperature drying, these seeds do not establish a persistent seed bank.																	1916-2790	1916-2804				FEB	2017	95	2					147	152		10.1139/cjb-2016-0149							WOS:000395447200004

Spatial scale and specialization affect how biogeography and functional traits predict long-term patterns of community turnover	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Immigration, extirpation and persistence of individual populations of species are key processes determining community responses to environmental change. However, they are difficult to study over long time periods without corresponding historical and modern-day species occurrences. 2. We used historical and present-day plant species occurrence data from two different spatial scales (resolutions) to investigate the plant community turnover during the 20th century in a Baltic Sea archipelago. Patterns of turnover were analysed in relation to plant functional traits relating to dispersal and competition/persistence, as well as biogeographical variables. 3. Turnover was largely driven by interactions between functional traits and measures of area, connectivity and distance to mainland. However, the combinations of traits and biogeographical variables that were most important for predicting immigration and extirpation differed between data sets, and between species associated with grassland management and the entire species pool. 4. Taller plants were more likely to persist regardless of scale and biogeography, reflecting the grazing abandonment that occurred in the study area. Interactions between dispersal traits and biogeography were related to immigrations when the entire species pool was considered. However, increased dispersal potential, a smaller island size and increasing distance to mainland combined to promote extirpations in management-associated species. A perennial life span and seed banking contributed to species persistence. At the larger spatial scale, trait-driven turnover was not mediated by the biogeographical context. 5. We showed that it is important to consider functional traits, biogeographical variables and their interactions when analysing community turnover over time. Furthermore, we found that the understanding of how combinations of traits and biogeography predict turnover depends on the source and spatial scale of the available data, and the species pool analysed.

J	Vitova, A; Macek, P; Leps, J				Vitova, Alena; Macek, Petr; Leps, Jan			Disentangling the interplay of generative and vegetative propagation among different functional groups during gap colonization in meadows	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Meadow plant communities are commonly driven by strong competition, and the colonization of gaps plays an important role in the maintenance of their species diversity. Despite this, species-specific information about the dynamics of vegetative and generative propagation, and on the role of seed bank and seed rain, is rather scarce. 2. In a 3-year manipulative experiment, we aimed to disentangle the effects of seed bank, seed rain and vegetative propagation in vegetation and during colonization of artificial gaps in a mesotrophic meadow. Vegetative propagation was manipulated by felting and the presence of the seed bank by soil sterilization using gamma radiation. We focused on the dynamics of four main species groups with different regeneration strategies: dicots, Cyperaceae, Juncaceae and Poaceae. The shift from seedling dominance in early stages towards vegetative resprouts dominating at a later stage in the gap colonization process differed considerably among the four species groups. 3. Dicots and Juncaceae, regenerating frequently from the seed bank, acted as pioneer species, and determined species composition of newly disturbed sites. Seed rain became crucial later in the season and resulted in shifting dominance to the more competitive Poaceae. Stress-tolerating Cyperaceae were colonizing the gaps vegetatively mainly towards the end of the experiment. While graminoids showed preference for growing into gaps clonally, dicots propagated vegetatively mostly within intact vegetation. 4. Although seed rain soon equalized seedling numbers in plots with and without a seed bank, the presence of a seed bank proved to be crucial for certain species, and its effect on species diversity remained positive in all functional groups for the duration of the experiment, demonstrating the importance of a seed bank for the maintenance of species diversity. Nevertheless, seedling assembly converged to a similar functional composition in all gap types after 3 years. We have not detected any competitive effect of vegetative resprouts on seedlings or seedlings on vegetative resprouts throughout the experiment. 5. Each of the three means of regeneration has its unique role in the maintenance of species diversity during gap colonization, and the importance of these roles differs in different functional groups.

J	Menegat, A; Jack, O; Gerhards, R				Menegat, Alexander; Jaeck, Ortrud; Gerhards, Roland			Modelling of low input herbicide strategies for the control of wild oat in intensive winter wheat cropping systems	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Weeds are causing significant yield losses in intensive winter wheat cropping systems worldwide. Prospective weed control strategies aim to reduce herbicide inputs in order to diminish the environmental, food safety and operator risks. The objective of this study is to make a long-term comparison of herbicide saving weed control strategies in intensive winter wheat cropping systems. The herbicide saving weed control strategies are compared with emphasis on herbicide input, crop yield, economic net return and weed population dynamics. The modelling approach is based on existing models for calculation of crop yield loss, herbicide dose-response, weed seed bank development and economic net return. The model is parametrised for wild oat in winter wheat. Field experiments were conducted for model parameter estimation. Three herbicide saving weed control strategies were compared, namely the economic threshold strategy as well as two reduced herbicide dose strategies. The two reduced dose strategies differed in their intensity of dose reduction and thus in their risk for potential efficacy failure. The modelling results could show that, depending on the risk level, reduced dose strategies can decrease herbicide inputs by 21% respectively 59%, compared to the economic threshold method. Differences between the three herbicide saving weed control strategies regarding yield and economic net return were negligible. From the consumer and environmental safety point of view, the high potential for herbicide input reduction makes the reduced herbicide dose methods favourable. However, the benefit for farmers is questionable due to the absence of an actual economic benefit and the enhanced risk of efficacy failure and herbicide resistance development.

J	Chenot, J; Jaunatre, R; Buisson, E; Dutoit, T				Chenot, Julie; Jaunatre, Renaud; Buisson, Elise; Dutoit, Thierry			Long-term effects of topsoil transfer assessed thirty years after rehabilitation of dry alluvial quarries in Southeastern France	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Of the many techniques tested to date to rehabilitate degraded ecosystems, topsoil transfer appears to offer the best results. However, this method is recent, and results achieved in the short term (months to years) may not provide a sound indication of long-term vegetation reestablishment. In the plain of La Crau in southeastern France, many dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970s-1980s and are nearly all now abandoned. Various topsoil transfers were performed when operations ceased, for various rehabilitation purposes (aesthetic, security, agricultural, etc.) and now provide the opportunity to test their efficacy in the 30-year long-term. We used an ecological analysis of plant communities and soil carried out in 2015 to compare the reference ecosystem (the steppe of La Crau, positive control) with un-rehabilitated quarry pits (negative control) and with four different rehabilitation treatments: (1) soil transfer (40 cm) with no contact with the water table; (2) soil transfer (40 cm) in contact with the water table; (3) more than 40 cm of soil transfer and (4) anthropogenic material deposits (spoils) unrelated to the characteristics of the reference soil. Our results show that the treatment most favorable to restoration of the species richness, diversity and composition of the steppe vegetation is transferring soil with fine particles (clay, silt) (treatment 1), at least 40 cm thick and without contact with groundwater. However, even after thirty years, and the re-establishment of traditional sheep grazing, full restoration of the reference steppe is far from being achieved. The other treatments lead to the emergence of hybrid or novel ecosystems, such as temporary ponds, riparian woodlands or matorrals with new variables and common variables to the historical ecosystem. Additional techniques to enhance the effectiveness of topsoil transfer are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Streitberger, M; Schmidt, C; Fartmann, T				Streitberger, Merle; Schmidt, Carsten; Fartmann, Thomas			Contrasting response of vascular plant and bryophyte species assemblages to a soil-disturbing ecosystem engineer in calcareous grasslands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Species-rich grasslands are highly threatened by land-use change, including fertilization, land-use intensification and abandonment. These changes evoke a loss of structural heterogeneity. Aside from specific management measures to increase structural heterogeneity, small-scale patches of different vegetation within grasslands are promoted naturally by soil-disturbing ecosystem engineers. The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of Lasius flavus nest mounds for increasing structural and functional diversity in vascular plant and bryophyte assemblages within Central European calcareous grasslands. Our study clearly revealed that the mound-building activity of L. flavus ants in calcareous grasslands alters soil conditions and vegetation structure. Ant mound soil samples had higher potassium and phosphorus levels than control samples in the matrix vegetation. Ant mounds, in general, and the south-facing sides, in particular, represented highly disturbed microsites with open and low-growing vegetation containing high proportions of bare ground. In contrast, the north-facing sides were characterized by transient vegetation between the dense matrix and the open south-facing sides. However, the effects of soil disturbance by ants were different for vascular plant and bryophyte species assemblages. In vascular plants, differences among the three sample groups were less pronounced; in bryophytes, nearly all parameters differed. All in all, the occurrence of L. flavus increases vegetation heterogeneity within grasslands and, therefore, plays an important role in supporting species richness of both plants and animals in calcareous grasslands. This holds true in particular for fallow sites, where ant mounds often represent the only sites of open vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Finch-Savage, WE; Footitt, S				Finch-Savage, William E.; Footitt, Steven			Seed dormancy cycling and the regulation of dormancy mechanisms to time germination in variable field environments	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Many molecular mechanisms that regulate dormancy have been identified individually in controlled laboratory studies. However, little is known about how the seed employs this complex suite of mechanisms during dormancy cycling in the variable environment of the soil seed bank. Nevertheless, this behaviour is essential to ensure germination takes place in a favourable habitat and climate space, and in the correct season for the resulting plant to complete its life cycle. During their time in the soil seed bank, seeds continually adjust their dormancy status by sensing a range of environmental signals. Those related to slow seasonal change (e.g. temperature) are used for temporal sensing to determine the time of year and depth of dormancy. This alters their sensitivity to signals related to their spatial environment (e.g. light, nitrate, and water potential) that indicate that conditions are suitable for germination, and so trigger the termination of dormancy. We review work on the physiological, molecular, and ecological aspects of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis and interpret it in the context of dormancy cycling in the soil seed bank. This approach has provided new insight into the co-ordination of mechanisms and signalling networks, and the multidimensional sensing that regulates dormancy cycling in a variable environment.

K.; Neve, Paul			A generalised individual-based algorithm for modelling the evolution of quantitative herbicide resistance in arable weed populations	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: Simulation models are useful tools for predicting and comparing the risk of herbicide resistance in weed populations under different management strategies. Most existing models assume a monogenic mechanism governing herbicide resistance evolution. However, growing evidence suggests that herbicide resistance is often inherited in a polygenic or quantitative fashion. Therefore, we constructed a generalised modelling framework to simulate the evolution of quantitative herbicide resistance in summer annual weeds. RESULTS: Real-field management parameters based on Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) Sauer (syn. rudis) control with glyphosate and mesotrione in Midwestern US maize-soybean agroecosystems demonstrated that the model can represent evolved herbicide resistance in realistic timescales. Sensitivity analyses showed that genetic and management parameters were impactful on the rate of quantitative herbicide resistance evolution, whilst biological parameters such as emergence and seed bank mortality were less important. CONCLUSION: The simulation model provides a robust and widely applicable framework for predicting the evolution of quantitative herbicide resistance in summer annual weed populations. The sensitivity analyses identified weed characteristics that would favour herbicide resistance evolution, including high annual fecundity, large resistance phenotypic variance and pre-existing herbicide resistance. Implications for herbicide resistance management and potential use of the model are discussed.

We evaluated the population genetic diversity and structure, connectivity, recent bottlenecks and population size, using nuclear microsatellites. M. pectinifera showed high genetic diversity but some evidence of heterozygote deficiency (F-IS), recent bottlenecks in some populations and reductions in population size. Also, we found low population genetic differentiation and high values of connectivity for M. pectinifera, as the result of historical events of gene flow through pollen and seed dispersal. M. pectinifera occurs in sites with some degree of disturbance leading to the isolation of its populations and decreasing the levels of gene flow among them. Excessive deforestation also changes the original vegetation damaging the natural habitats. This species will become extinct if it is not properly preserved. Furthermore, this species has some ecological features that make them more vulnerable to disturbance such as a very low growth rates and long life cycles. We suggest in situ conservation to prevent the decrease of population sizes and loss of genetic diversity in the natural protected areas such as the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve. In addition, a long-term ex situ conservation program is need to construct seed banks, and optimize seed germination and plant establishment protocols that restore disturbed habitats. Furthermore, creating a supply of living plants for trade is critical to avoid further extraction of plants from nature. Copyright (C) 2017 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Kalusova, V; Ceplova, N; Lososova, Z				Kalusova, Veronika; Ceplova, Natalie; Lososova, Zdenka			Which traits influence the frequency of plant species occurrence in urban habitat types?	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Plants in cities must cope with various anthropogenic environments that differ from surrounding landscapes. Moreover, the differences in biotic and abiotic conditions among these habitats filter species with suitable traits and niche requirements. Here we aim to identify those attributes that promote species occurrence across and within urban habitat types of large cities. Species composition of spontaneously occurring vascular plant species was recorded in 1-ha plots in seven different urban habitat types in each of 32 European cities. Each species was characterized in terms of dispersal type, growth form, height, seed bank longevity, seed mass, selected leaf traits and ecological indicators including Ellenberg indicator values, Grime's life strategies, and immigration pathways using information from available speciestrait databases. For each species, total frequency of occurrence across all plots and habitat frequency of occurrence across plots of given habitat types were calculated and regression trees were used to relate them to traits and ecological indicators. The most frequently occurring species in the cities tended to be human-dispersed, nutrient-demanding plants that prefer drier to mesic soil conditions. These species do not possess the S-strategy and usually produce seeds of low mass forming short-term persistent seed banks. Habitat-specific responses were also revealed, indicating the effects of between-and within-habitat heterogeneity on trends in species performance in cities. Such patterns can be overlooked when differences in species occurrences in particular urban habitat types are not considered; thus, habitat-specific responses can resolve inconsistencies found when whole urban floras are analysed as a whole.

Scop., Plantago alpina L., and Silene vulgaris (Moench) Garcke. Seeds were gamma-irradiated with 100 and 200 Gy total doses delivered at a high dose rate of 2.7 Gy min(-1). Irradiated and non-irradiated seeds were used immediately, and subsequently 7 and 14 days after drying (15% Relative Humidity, 15 degrees C) to assess their response to standard seed bank processing. Germination rates, seedling length and weight, antioxidant activity and phenolics content were measured, while free radical accumulation profiles were acquired by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Germination was only hampered in irradiated C. barbata seeds. C. barbata and C. spinosissinum seedlings obtained from irradiated seeds suffered a decrease in length and weight, while growth was not affected in P. alpina and S. vulgaris, when compared to non-irradiated control. Although profiles of seed antioxidant activity were not influenced immediately after gamma-irradiation, subsequent drying under seed bank standards induced changes in seed antioxidant activity, depending on the species. According to EPR data, C. barbata and C. Spinosissinum seeds revealed high free radical levels in non-irradiated samples, which were further enhanced by gamma-irradiation. An opposite behaviour was observed in P. alpina and S. vulgaris. The four alpine species showed different profiles of gamma-ray sensitivity. The reported data encourage future research to test inter-specific variability in the plant response to gamma-rays based on a multidisciplinary approach which integrates environmental data. Considering that seeds of alpine plants are short-lived in storage, gamma-irradiation could emerge as a promissory priming tool for native endangered species.

A better understanding of the effects of litter on seed germination and seedling emergence is crucial for developing a new set of indicators for grassland ecosystem health and for grassland management policy. We investigated the effects of seed position in litter and amount of litter covering the seed on seedling emergence and seed persistence of three common species on the Loess Plateau in northwestern China. Seed position beneath the litter layer provided a suitable environment for seedling emergence of the three species. A moderate amount of litter (160 g/m(2)) was beneficial for seedling emergence of the small-seeded species Stipa bungeana and Lespedeza davurica from seeds from beneath the litter layer. The large-seeded species Setaria glauca was more tolerant of a high amount of litter (240 g/m(2)) than the two small-seeded species. Seed persistence in the soil differed among the three species and also was affected by seed position in litter and amount of litter cover. The proportion of viable seeds of Stipa bungeana and Setaria glauca on top of the litter layer increased with an increase in amount of litter. Seedling emergence and seed persistence varied significantly among species, amount of litter and seed position in litter. A moderate amount of litter and seeds positioned beneath the litter layer were better for seedling recruitment than for those on top of the litter layer. A high amount of litter was more favorable for persistence of seeds positioned on top of the litter than for those beneath the litter. Our study showed that maintaining litter amount between 80 and 160 g/m(2) is optimal for S. bungeana dominated grassland on the Loess Plateau. We suggest that litter amount can serve as a guide for monitoring and managing grassland ecosystems, as it is an indicator of ecosystem processes that are essential for biodiversity conservation and restoration.																	1664-462X					JAN 31	2017	8								103	10.3389/fpls.2017.00103							WOS:000392867400001	28197169					
J	Boutin, C; Carpenter, DJ				Boutin, C.; Carpenter, D. J.			Assessment of wetland/upland vegetation communities and evaluation of soil-plant contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace metals in regions near oil sands mining in Alberta	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Oil sands mining in Alberta, Canada, has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years. The extent to which the surrounding vegetation has been altered/contaminated by pollutants released during bitumen extraction has not been a focus of oil sands environmental monitoring efforts. The objectives of this study were to assess plant species richness and composition in wetlands and uplands in the vicinity of oil sands mining areas and to measure levels of contamination of trace metals and polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils and plants. Twenty-two sites were selected in three locations: near to (OS, n = 7), West (n = 7), and East (n = 8) of oil sands mining operations. Aboveground plant species were inventoried and soil was collected for a seedbank study. Soils and plants were collected for analyses of 28 metals and 40 parent and alkylated PAHs. Plant species richness and composition differed significantly among locations. More species were found in the OS sites, many of them being non-native, than in East and West sites, which contained almost exclusively native perennials. PAH levels were significantly higher in OS sites, and were mostly comprised of alkylated PAHs. Patterns of PAH distribution indicated contamination from bitumen/petroleum in four sites; other combustion types may have affected five additional sites at different levels. Metals were also elevated in OS sites. Metal levels were significantly correlated with distance to upgrader facilities. Ratios of some metals in soil vs. above- and belowground plant parts were significantly higher in West and East than in OS sites, likely due in part to pH as soil was acidic at the East and West locations but alkaline at OS sites. This study showed that sites located near oil sands mining operations were contaminated with PAHs and metals, and that the vegetation composition at these sites greatly differed from less disturbed areas.

Microscale Insight into Microbial Seed Banks	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial dormancy leads to the emergence of seed banks in environmental, engineered, and host-associated ecosystems. These seed banks act as reservoirs of diversity that allow microbes to persist under adverse conditions, including extreme limitation of resources. While microbial seed banks may be influenced by macroscale factors, such as the supply of resources, the importance of microscale encounters between organisms and resource particles is often overlooked. We hypothesized that dimensions of spatial, trophic, and resource complexity determine rates of encounter, which in turn, drive the abundance, productivity, and size of seed banks. We tested this using >10,000 stochastic individual based models (IBMs) that simulated energetic, physiological, and ecological processes across combinations of resource, spatial, and trophic complexity. These IBMs allowed realistic dynamics and the emergence of seed banks from ecological selection on random variation in species traits. Macroscale factors like the supply and concentration of resources had little effect on resource encounter rates. In contrast, encounter rates were strongly influenced by interactions between dispersal mode and spatial structure, and also by the recalcitrance of resources. In turn, encounter rates drove abundance, productivity, and seed bank dynamics. Time series revealed that energetically costly traits can lead to large seed banks and that recalcitrant resources can lead to greater stability through the formation of seed banks and the slow consumption of resources. Our findings suggest that microbial seed banks emerge from microscale dimensions of ecological complexity and their influence on resource limitation and energetic costs.

J	Cohen, O; Bar, P				Cohen, Oded; Bar (Kutiel), Pua			The impact of Acacia saligna invasion on the indigenous vegetation in various coastal habitats in Israel and its implication for nature conservation	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Coastal sand dunes are susceptible to invasive plants that significantly alter these endangered ecosystems. Acacia saligna is a small Australian tree that has become a significant invasive plant in Israel and in many other Mediterranean countries. The aim of this research was to study the impact of A. saligna on the indigenous vegetation of three coastal habitats (sand dunes, inter-dune depressions, and aeolianite [sandstone] ridges) in the Nizzanim Long Term Ecosystem Research Nature Reserve, Israel. Plant observations were conducted in the spring, in the following site types: (1) sites planted with A. saligna and sites invaded by A. saligna; and (2) reference sites not invaded by A. saligna. A simple index, the aggregate ecological value, was developed in order to evaluate the impact and the ecological value of each habitat and site for conservation purposes. The results indicate that planting A. saligna and invasion by A. saligna changed plant community composition, reduced psammophyte species richness, caused the disappearance of most endemic, rare, and protected species, and overall reduced the ecological value of the Nizzanim Nature Reserve.																	0792-9978	2223-8980					2017	64	1-2					111	121		10.1080/07929978.2016.1275362							WOS:000407557000012

However, it is not fully understood in some sensitive habitats, such as in abandoned cropland of the Chinese hilly gullied Loess Plateau region. This study evaluates seed redistribution patterns in major micro-sites including eroded, deposited and trap micro-sites, characterizes seed loss by using runoff plot, and explores the effect of vegetation coverage and rainfall on seed loss along three abandoned slopes in the Zhifanggou watershed. Soil seed bank densities in eroded, deposited and trap micro-sites were recorded at 4,482, 7,697 and 5,649 seeds m(-2), respectively. Seed density of loss due to overland flow in 2011 and 2012 were recorded at 52 and 27 seeds m(-2), respectively. Seed loss rate, which was the ratio of seed loss density to the mean density of soil seed banks in the three micro-sites due to soil erosion during the study period was 06%. Seed densities of loss exhibited an exponent relationship with natural erosive rainfalls, and significant correlations were not found between seed loss and vegetation coverage. Therefore, soil erosion resulted in seed redistribution and caused seeds to concentrate in soils or on soil surfaces in trap or deposited micro-sites. Seed loss was affected by erosive rainfall significantly, but it could not cause the loss of large quantities of seeds.

In the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 crop seasons, two cultivation modalities were evaluated in the summer/autumn - monocropped corn with residual regrowth of signal grass (Urochloa decumbens) from the soil seed bank and corn intercropped with palisade grass (U. brizantha ' Marandu')-, in a factorial arrangement with two cutting heights for silage production -0.20 and 0.45 m. After corn silage harvest, the forages were grazed by lambs in a semi-feedlot system, in the winter/spring. Monocropped corn and 0.45-m cutting height both reduced dry matter yield for silage. Corn intercropped with palisade grass improved land use efficiency from 13 to 31% compared with monocropped crop, with land equivalent ratio greater than 1. Palisade grass showed higher light interception than signal grass over the intercrop period with corn and provided greater forage yield for lambs to graze during winter/spring. Corn intercropped with palisade grass, compared with monocropped corn, especially at the cutting height of 0.45 m, is a viable option for improving silage and pasture production, as well as land use efficiency in the integrated crop-livestock system.				de Castilhos, Andre Michel/O-2721-2019; Martello, Jorge M/A-3846-2019; de Lima Meirelles, Paulo Roberto/AAA-5808-2019; Magalhaes Pariz, Cristiano/C-3154-2012	Martello, Jorge M/0000-0002-2119-7186; de Lima Meirelles, Paulo Roberto/0000-0001-9168-5081; Costa, Ciniro Costa/0000-0003-1854-2927; Costa, Nidia/0000-0003-0680-7561; /0000-0003-4673-1071												0100-204X	1678-3921				JAN	2017	52	1					54	62		10.1590/S0100-204X2017000100007							WOS:000398588100007

There is a need for proposing appropriate in situ or ex situ conservation strategies through a precise evaluation of population demographic and genetic characteristics. Methods - We investigated demographic dynamics for six years (rosette density, floral production, reproductive success, seed germination and seedling recruitment), pollination (visiting insects and potential pollinators) and genetic diversity using IS SR markers of the unique population of S. funckii var. aqualiense. Key results - Visiting insects and potential pollinators, especially common and generalist pollen foraging bees, are abundant in the population of S. funckii var. aqualiense and the plant seems highly attractive. Pollination limitation does not represent a conservation issue. Despite a good floral production in most years (250-1,558 flowering ramets, comprising 4-36 flowers), viable seed production and germination represent very rare events (0.05% viable seeds and 1 seedling) because of meiosis abnormalities related to the hybrid origin of the taxon. Recruitment by clonal propagation (vegetative rosettes) has been detected. Genetic diversity is very low (H = 0.0148), and may have originated from somatic mutations, related to extensive vegetative propagation, but is also compatible with relictual segregating sexual reproduction. Conclusions - The most cost-effective method for establishing new populations is the transplantation of rosettes. Given the low viable seed production, creating an ex situ seed bank requires collecting seeds for many nonconsecutive years. Conserving the rare genotypes can be done by preserving seeds and as many rosettes as possible. The preservation of the only existing population in its entirety appears to be the best option for long-term sustainable conservation of S. funckii var. aqualiense, and any partial destruction of the population should be avoided.

FLORISTIC AND PHYTOSOCIOLOGY OF WEEDS IN UPLAND RICE IN THE HUMID TROPICS	PLANTA DANINHA												Knowledge of the floristic composition and vegetation structure are essential conditions for development of more efficient and economic weed management strategies in crops in the humid tropics. The objective of the research was to carry on floristic and phytosociological surveys to know the main weeds in upland rice fields in the humid tropics of the Brazilian State of Maranhao. Weed samples were done by means of an open metal rectangle of 0.15 m(2) thrown at random in the vegetative and reproductive stages of rice crop in 2009/10 and 2010/2011 harvest. A total of 65 species from 23 families was identified 35 (53.85%) from the eudicotyledons botanical group, 29 (44.06%) from the monocotyledonous and one (1.53%) belonged to the pteridophytes. The most representative families were from the monocotyledonous botanical group including Poaceae and Cyperaceae, followed by Amaranthaceae and Malvaceae, both from the eudicotyledons group. The weed species with higher importance values in the upland rice crop vegetative stage were Urochloa sp., Panicum sp., C. flavus, C. benghalensis and C. argutus whereas in the reproductive stage the higher importance values were recorded for S. latifolia, C. argutus, L. octovalvis, A. tenella and P. maximum. The most important weeds in the crop vegetative phase were mainly from the monocotyledonous group, while in reproductive one they were the eudicotyledons. Weed diversity was high and the floristic similarity was lower in the vegetative one compared to the reproductive stage of upland rice cultivation in the humid tropics.																	0100-8358	1806-9681					2017	35								UNSP e017164304	10.1590/S0100-83582017350100083							WOS:000419765200001

The present study aims to verify the regeneration potential of the soil seed bank of a Seasonal Semidecidual Forest remnant. The study was carried out at Canchim Farm, CPPSE - Embrapa (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Soil samples were collected from the fragment in both the wet and dry seasons. An average of 307.8 seedlings/m(2) was found in the dry season and an average of 144 seedlings/m2 was found in the dry station. Twenty six species of trees with viable seeds were found in the soil, mostly pioneer species; among them, Cecropia glaziovi Snethlage was the most abundant pioneer species. The soil seed bank can be considered of great potential for regeneration due to the presence of pioneers, secondary and later species.																	0100-6762						2017	41	3							UNSP e410311	10.1590/1806-90882017000300011							WOS:000426481400006

(Malvaceae) in Andalusia	REVISTA DE SOCIEDAD GADITANA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												During the last two decades land use changes such as intensive agriculture have led to an environmental impact without precedents. Loss and fragmentation of habitats have isolated and threatened several species, especially those related to arable lands and ruderal areas. Plagionotus andreui (Fuente, 1908) (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) is an Iberian endemic species with a scattered distribution along the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. Currently, the species is highly threatened due to decline of its host plant Lavatera triloba L. (Malvaceae). This decline is the result of the land use changes (increase of the arable land) within the distribution area. As a consequence, this plant has been relegated to isolated populations in roadsides and crop edges with low population sizes. In the present survey, the distribution of P. andreui and L. triloba is updated. P. andreui is recorded for first time in the provinces of Huelva and Granada. Three new locations in the provinces of Seville and Jaen are provided. The current status of L. triloba populations and potential and observed threats in the known occurrence localities in Andalusia are evaluated at the patch scale. Conservation actions for L. triloba are proposed. These actions could include the monitoring of known populations, locating new populations, collection and preservation of seeds in seed banks, growing plants in the Andalusian nursery network, strengthening of populations, reintroduction in historical patches of occurrence. These proposals could be of help to preserve this threatened specific host-guest complex in Andalusia.

Impacts of invasive alien trees on threatened lowland vegetation types in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												This study investigated the autogenic recovery potential of native vegetation after clearing of dense stands of invasive alien trees in two critically endangered vegetation types in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region: Cape Flats Lowland Fynbos and Swartland Alluvium Fynbos. Sampling was done in areas previously occupied by the invasive tree Acacia saligna and plantations of Pinus radiata and in a fynbos reference site. Treatments varied in terms of the length of invasion and management histories. Plots previously under pines recovered well in terms of indigenous perennial species richness, but indigenous species cover decreased with increasing number of planting rotations. Areas cleared of acacia recovered poorly in terms of indigenous species cover (after one cycle of invasion), and indigenous species richness exhibited a declining trend with increasing cycles of invasion. Proteoid overstorey was lost in all previously invaded/planted plots and this element will need to be re-introduced to areas after one cycle of invasion regardless of the invasive species. Acacias changed some abiotic variables after two cycles of invasion. Follow-up clearing generally promoted better vegetation recovery in terms of overall species richness and structure but care should be taken not to damage indigenous ericoid shrubs. Overall, acacia invasion caused a greater change in biodiversity and vegetation structure than pine plantations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

What's a SNP between friends: The influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms on virulence and phenotypes of Clostridium difficile strain 630 and derivatives	VIRULENCE												Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic induced diarrhea worldwide, responsible for significant annual mortalities and represents a considerable economic burden on healthcare systems. The two main C. difficile virulence factors are toxins A and B. Isogenic toxin B mutants of 2 independently isolated erythromycin-sensitive derivatives (630E and 630 Delta erm) of strain 630 were previously shown to exhibit substantively different phenotypes. Compared to 630, strain 630E and its progeny grow slower, achieve lower final cell densities, exhibit a reduced capacity for spore-formation, produce lower levels of toxin and are less virulent in the hamster infection model. By the same measures, strain 630 Delta erm and its derivatives more closely mirror the behavior of 630. Genome sequencing revealed that 630 Delta erm had acquired 7 unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to 630 and 630E, while 630E had 9 SNPs and a DNA inversion not found in the other 2 strains. The relatively large number of mutations meant that the identification of those responsible for the altered properties of 630E was not possible, despite the restoration of 3 mutations to wildtype by allelic exchange and comparative RNAseq analysis of all 3 strains. The latter analysis revealed large differences in gene expression between the 3 strains, explaining in part why no single SNP could restore the phenotypic differences. Our findings suggest that strain 630 Delta erm should be favored over 630E as a surrogate for 630 in genetic-based studies. They also underline the importance of effective strain curation and the need to genome re-sequence master seed banks wherever possible.				; Monot, Marc/F-3058-2015	McBride, Shonna/0000-0001-6221-714X; Minton, Nigel/0000-0002-9277-1261; Monot, Marc/0000-0003-0738-7335												2150-5594	2150-5608					2017	8	6					767	781		10.1080/21505594.2016.1237333							WOS:000412306100025	27652799

Control of soil weediness and sugar beets by after crop green manure and different tillages	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The research program envisaged the studying of the variation of weediness of sugar beet crops under the influence of after crop sideration and the application of soil protection cultivation. The application of oil radish green manure provided a significant decrease in the amount of seed weeds in the entire 0-30cm layer of soil in comparison with the non-seeded background on 2.8-3.4 mln. seeds ha(-1) and a significant decrease in the weed density of all biological groups weeds on 0.5-6.5 weeds m(-2) and their weight on 5.6-77.4g m(-2) for the period of growing sugar beets. Comparing to plowing the methods of mouldboard-free cultivation provided a significant increase in the quantity of weed seeds in the layer of soil 0-10cm to 18.322.9x10(6) seeds ha(-1) and their significant decrease deeper than 10cm on 19.0-23.3 mln. seeds ha(-1). Among the variants of mouldboard-free cultivation the lowest amount of weed seeds in the soil layer of 0-5cm was discounted at the deepest cultivation - 24.5 and 23.5x10(6) seeds ha(-1). The decrease of the depth of the mouldboard-free cultivation led to a significant increase in the weed density (by 4.8-68.2 weeds m(-2)) and their weight (82.5-1193.5g m(-2)) in sugar beet crops and a substantial shortfall in yields of root crops - 2.9-5.8 t ha(-1). It follows from the research results that the application of after crop siderate of radish oil and basic mouldboard-free cultivation reduce the potential amount of weed seeds of root layer 0-30 cm; the deep soil cultivation on 28-30cm at the siderate background provides the greatest decrease in real weediness of sugar beet crops and allows to receive high yields of crops - 34.3 t ha(-1).																	2520-2138						2017	7	4					517	524		10.15421/2017_154							WOS:000447597100001

It is generally accepted that soil moisture and soil seed bank are primary dependent factors in the phases. But the binary correlation analysis between seedling density and soil seed bank density as well soil moisture in transition zones between windword slopes of active dunes and interdune lowlands indicated that the correlation between seedling density and soil seed bank density was not significant (P > 0.05) in the plant growing season; but the one between seedling density and soil moisture was significant and positive (P < 0.05); moreover, seedling density increased logarithmically with the increasing of soil moisture. The conclusions reveal that soil moisture is a primary dependent factor during seedling emergence and establishment in the transition zones between the windword slopes of active dunes and interdune lowlands, but soil seed bank is not; and plant natural regeneration depends more on those propagating seeds from plant communities in neighbouring sand dunes.																	1755-1307						2017	81								UNSP 012057	10.1088/1755-1315/81/1/012057							WOS:000439412700057

Research results show that using surface soil as main external-soil base material to conduct slope external-soil spray-seeding greening can effectively increase the average coverage of slope vegetation, remarkably promote slope vegetation to naturalized plant community succession and make slope vegetation to gradually converge with the neighboring natural slope plant community. Surface soil arising from the clearing construction of expressway is abundant in large quantities of such nutrients as humus, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and too often contains rich indigenous plant seed and soil microorganism resource. Hence, it is a precious recycling resource. The soil seed bank consisting of living seeds in surface soil resource is the potential plant population or community as well as the material basis of natural regeneration of vegetation [1]. Some developed countries including the US and Japan attach great importance to topsoil stripping and utilization, has possessed the relatively mature management system and technical means and conducted related researches [2-4]into the vegetation recovery effect through surface soil utilization. Study shows that refilling utilization of natural surface soil after stripping can increase biodiversity [5-6] of new surface soil, and accelerate the vegetation succession [7] beneficial to the early-stage development of indigenous shrub wood. Surface soil resource utilization is increasingly being stressed in the vegetation recovery in the expressway construction and has been simply utilized in part of expressway construction. For example, the stripped surface soil is utilized to cover the expressway disturbance region or refill for reclamation [8-10]. Relying on Guangzhou-Lechang expressway project in progress, the research takes surface soil as main external-earth base material and combines external-soil spray-seeding technology to conduct the beneficial trial for further probe into the utilization effect and value of surface soil resource in the expressway construction by conducting the test research into slope greening effect comparison.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-380-7				2017	111						75	83									WOS:000431391500011

This is particularly true for ants living in obligate symbiosis with myrmecophytic plants. Here we present the first direct observations of the swarming event in the association between Crematogaster captiosa and the pioneer tree Macaranga bancana in Southeast Asia. Nuptial flights of C. captiosa on M. bancana took place during the night, and alate females were seen to copulate with alate males on the tree. Data on C. captiosa from the Malay Peninsula as well as Borneo indicate that sexual production and colony founding occurs throughout the year. Despite episodic fruiting seasons of the host plants, Macaranga saplings for colony founding can also become available outside peak seasons from seed banks after disturbance. Therefore, continuous swarming might be a good strategy to avoid strong competition for limited nesting sites while still securing permanent colonisation of saplings - a prerequisite for their survival.

The aim of this study was to examine the ecophysiological aspects of the Peltophorum dubium aerial seed bank. Fruits were harvested monthly, before and after seed maturation, from selected trees in the municipality of Lavras, MG, Brazil, for determination of moisture content, acquisition of tolerance to desiccation, seed viability, maintenance of dormancy, and mean germination time. Physiological maturity of the species was attained in June, when low moisture content, maximum dry matter, and high germination percentage were observed. We found that there was no change in dormancy, in germination percentage, or in the protein profile of seeds during the period they remained in the aerial seed bank. The P. dubium species creates an aerial seed bank of short serotiny, with fruits remaining attached to the tree for 9 months.

Managing invasive plants on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island	RANGELAND JOURNAL					Conference on Restore, Regenerate, Revegetate - Restoring Ecological Processes, Ecosystems and Landscapes in a Changing World	FEB 05-09, 2017	Univ New England, Armidale, AUSTRALIA		Univ New England			The Antarctic region is one of the most inhospitable frontiers on earth for weed invasion. On Australia's world heritage sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island only three species of invasive weeds are well established (Poa annua L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill. and Cerastium fontanum Baumg.), although isolated occurrences of other species have been found and removed. These weed species are believed to have initially been introduced through human activity, a threat which is likely to increase, although strict biosecurity is in place. All three weeds are palatable and may have been suppressed to some extent by pest herbivore (rabbit) grazing. Given the high conservation value of Macquarie Island and threats to ecosystem structure and function from weed proliferation following rabbit eradication, well targeted invasive plant control management strategies are vital. We propose that a successful restoration program for Australia's most southerly rangeland ecosystem should integrate both control of non-native plants as well as non-native herbivores. Of the non-native plants, S. media may most easily be managed, if not eradicated, because of its more limited distribution. Little, however, is known about the soil seed bank or population dynamics after rabbit eradication, nor the effect of herbicides and non-chemical control methods in cold conditions. A current research project on this non-grass species is helping to fill these knowledge gaps, complementing and building on data collected in an earlier project on the ecology and control of the more widespread invasive grass, P. annua. With an interest in off-target herbicide impacts, our work also includes a study of the movement and fate of herbicides in the cold climate Macquarie Island soils. Research in such a remote, cold, wet and windy place presents a range of logistical challenges. Nevertheless, outcomes are informing the development of effective, low-impact control or eradication options for sub-Antarctic weeds.

Long-term persistence of Velloziaceae species in the soil seed bank in campo rupestre vegetation, Brazil	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Soil seed banks play an important role in regeneration in many ecosystems and contribute to ecosystem resilience in disturbed environments. This is especially true for the Brazilian campo rupestre, a fire-prone ecosystem that harbours a large number of endangered endemic species. Aims: We aimed to determine the persistence in the soil seed bank, through the evaluation of the in situ longevity, of seeds from four species of Velloziaceae, an endemic-rich and dominant family in the campo rupestre vegetation. Methods: Seeds of four sympatric and common Vellozia species were collected and placed in bags, which were buried in their natural area of occurrence. The germination capacity of the buried seeds was regularly evaluated under controlled light and temperature conditions over a 5-year period. Results: No in situ establishment was observed for any of the buried seeds. All species retained high germinability throughout the burial, except for V. glandulifera, whose germinability was reduced by 60%. The reduction in germinability of V. glandulifera was positively correlated with seed size and mass. Conclusions: Seeds of the studied species of Vellozia are capable of persisting in soil over time while maintaining high germinability. Seed traits appear to be important for seed bank persistence.

RAPID ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE WESTERN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA REGION DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN ACTIVITY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The Antarctic and the Southern Ocean are a critically important part of the Earth system. The climatic, physical, and biological properties of this region are closely linked to other parts of the global environment. 200 years of direct human impact, recent climate amelioration and changes in the main sources and circulation of biogenic compounds as well as accumulation of industrial contaminants have significantly affected the whole ecosystem. Particularly sensitive is the region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula, which is considered to be one of the hot spots of the Earth. In this paper, we review recent literature and compare it with historical data to estimate and predict the consequences of this process. The Antarctic ecosystems can no longer be regarded as pristine. Global as well as local human influence has transgressed the barriers isolating that continent from the rest of the World, causing previously observed changes to accelerate.

Barley breeding and collecting activities started at the beginning of 20th century in Turkey. During that time huge amount of material piled up at the seed banks and collections of plant breeding institutions through collecting missions and material exchange. We characterized around 3.500 barley accessions of Eskisehir Transition Zone Agricultural Research Institute. Characterized populations have been obtained from 44 countries (Asia 14, Europe 19, Americas 6, Africa 4 and Australia) of 5 continents and two international agricultural research institutes since 1950's up to date. We are presenting only the result of 2.517 two row barley accessions with this paper. Results of the study reveal a series of phenotypic similarities and differences between the materials of several countries. Results also show the existence of a significant amount of diversity between the populations which can be used as a source for breeding programs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the seed bank of a semideciduous forest patch, taking into account the influence of the landscape's topographical features. Two adjacent landforms, of convex and concave shapes, were selected. They were divided into mini sites (MS) I, II, and III in the convex landform and IV, V and VI in the concave one. Ten sample points on each MS were randomly distributed with a surface area of 0.0625 m(2) and 3 cm deep. A total of 4,862 germinated seeds. m(-1) was registered in 90 days, with the convex landform presenting the highest frequency of germinated seeds. m(-1). A total of 35 families and 88 species were identified in both landforms, of which 37% were of herbaceous habit, 24% arboreal, 18% shrubs, 12% lianas and 2% epiphytic. Regarding the landform's shape, 44% of the species were found in both convex and concave ones, 31% were found exclusively on the convex landform and 25% exclusively on the concave one. Regarding floristic and phytosociological parameters, the convex landform accounted for a higher number of seeds, families, and species richness, while the concave landform accounted for higher diversity. Topography was a determinant factor for the floristic and phytosociological composition of the seed bank. The highest species richness was recorded in the convex landform and highest diversity in the concave landform, with Asteraceae, Melastomataceae and Urticaceae families presenting the highest importance indexes of value.

In the case of abandoned pastures, there is an increased environmental vulnerability to colonization by invasive exotic grasses, which represent a barrier to the establishment of native plants, since the dispersion and seed germination until the later stages of their development. We proposed to discuss some of the processes of natural regeneration in pastures, addressing issues that hinder the recruitment of desirable woody species and, in this context, the exposure of some methodologies based on the concept of nucleation that can help this process. Through understanding of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of plant communities, we observed that the seed germination and seedling recruitments are crucial steps in the process of vegetation restoration. Because only a narrow range of conditions is suitable (safe sites) for the recruitment, successful regeneration depends on the environment ability to provide an appropriate bed for germination (seedbed). The use of methodologies that aimed the natural regeneration, to be effective in pasture areas, should be technically well established and adequate to the local reality, because although they have promising initial results, may no longer be effective over time.																	0103-9954	1980-5098					2017	27	4					1451	1464									WOS:000418414100030						
J	Myster, RW				Myster, Randall W.			Does the seed rain limit recruitment, regeneration, and plant community dynamics?	IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The role of the seed rain in affecting recruitment, regeneration, and plant community dynamics continues to be debated. Studies show that seed limitation for recruitment is more likely as ecosystems become colder and more species-poor, as in boreal forests, and for species that have large seeds and short-lived seed banks. Even if there is a limiting effect of the seed rain for recruitment, however, clumping seen for mature trees and other evidence suggests that its effect diminishes with time. I posit that the dynamics of plant communities are largely determined where the seed rain is abundant and not limiting-in local spaces close to dispersing plants. Putting all the evidence together, I conclude that it is what happens to seeds after dispersal-such as loss to predation and pathogenic attack, or germination success resulting from environmental tolerances-that has a greater effect on recruitment, regeneration and plant community dynamics. And thus the variation in the workings of seed fate mechanisms and environmental tolerances, deserve more research attention. The importance of the seed rain in affecting recruitment of individual plants, regeneration of individual plants, and plant community dynamics has been over-emphasized in plant modeling and theory.																	1918-3178						2017	10	1					12	16		10.4033/iee.2017.10.3.c							WOS:000417387700003

Resurgence of Harrisia portoricensis (Cactaceae) on Desecheo Island after the removal of invasive vertebrates: management implications	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												Desecheo Island hosts a natural population of the higo chumbo cactus Harrisia portoricensis, listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. The species was extirpated from mainland Puerto Rico and is restricted to the offshore islands of Mona, Monito and Desecheo. Herbivory by goats Capra hircus, rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta, and black rats Rattus rattus introduced to Desecheo Island have likely contributed to a population decline, with only a few individuals of higo chumbo reported in 2003. As part of a restoration program, goats have been eradicated, macaques are considered functionally extirpated, and actions to remove invasive rodents were completed in 2016 and confirmed as successful in 2017. Systematic monitoring was implemented between 2010 and 2013, including widespread searches for H. portoricensis, collecting data on population structure, number of individuals, height, number of branches and evidence of phenological events. After 4 yr of continuous monitoring, 72 individual plants were identified, which exhibited increased height and branching throughout the study years. No seedlings were observed and only a few juveniles recorded, suggesting a resurgence from suppressed adults with limited recruitment. Long-term monitoring is critical to understanding the population dynamics of this species on Desecheo Island. Efforts to safeguard this species on the island require completion of the invasive vertebrate removals and would benefit from a seed banking program and manual establishment of new populations.																	1863-5407	1613-4796					2017	34						339	347		10.3354/esr00860							WOS:000416862500005

Resilience of Zostera marina habitats and response of the macroinvertebrate community to physical disturbance caused by clam harvesting	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												The consequences of physical disturbances to seagrasses depend on disturbance frequency relative to the capacity for recolonization and recovery following fragmentation. In a subtidal seagrass meadow of Zostera marina L., following a season of clam harvesting, we compared the temporal change of shoot density and biomass of this seagrass together with the community structure of the associated macroinvertebrates, at two sites differing in the intensity of the physical disturbance. The impacted site showed significantly lower shoot density and total biomass than the non-impacted site initially. The increase in above-ground biomass over four months (May to September) of this species was significantly higher (46%) at the impacted site than in the area not affected by the disturbance. Four months after cessation of the extraction activity, the biomass and density values of Z. marina reached similar values to those measured in the non-impacted site. The sexual reproductive effort of the seagrass population affected by the disturbance (4%) was significantly lower than at the non-impacted site (10%), which could influence genetic diversity and the seed bank. The community structure of molluscs showed 54% similarity between sites at the beginning of the study. Four months later, mollusc communities increased to a similarity of 74%. The current closure season (four months annually) established for the recovery of the exploited stocks of bivalves allowed the recovery of Z. marina density and biomass. Nevertheless, other population properties, such as those related to reproductive patterns, remained altered by the disturbance.

Effectiveness of dry heat as a seed sterilisation technique: Implications for ex situ conservation	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Seed-borne pathogens are a daily issue for ex situ collection managers who try to solve it using various chemicals more or less harmful to the staff and the plant material stored. The most common physical method for seed sterilisation is moist heat, in contrast to dry heat which is used much less frequently. Consequently, the efficiency of dry heat as disinfection method and the behaviour of seeds undergoing this treatment are currently poorly known, especially for wild species. In this study, seed viability was estimated by performing germination tests according to standard procedures. Germination tests were conducted on 13,200 seeds from 66 wild species of temperate regions belonging to 22 different families. Results indicate that dry seeds exposed to 60 degrees C during 1hour were less infected by seed-borne pathogens in 14% of the cases, whereas no change has been registered in the other cases. For all 66 studied species, no decrease in germination percentage was detected after the heat treatment. Given its positive effect on infection control without affecting seed viability, dry heat treatment as proposed here opens opportunities for seed bank managers, but also for the disinfection of herbarium collections.																	1126-3504	1724-5575					2017	151	6					1054	1061		10.1080/11263504.2016.1231140							WOS:000416549800013						
J	Hosoya, K; Sugiyama, S				Hosoya, Keita; Sugiyama, Syu-ichi			Weed communities and their negative impact on rice yield in no-input paddy fields in the northern part of Japan	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE												Although weeds cause serious yield losses in agriculture, relatively few studies have been conducted on the relationship between weeds and yield loss in no-input rice production systems, where no herbicides are used. This study investigated weed communities in rice paddy fields and their influence on rice yield, by comparing 16 no-input paddy fields in northern Japan. The weed seed community in the paddy field soils, before transplanting, were analyzed using a spontaneous germination test, and the established weed communities in the fields were examined at the full heading growth stage of the rice. The weed community structures showed a marked difference between the seeds in the soil and the established weed communities. Although eight weed species germinated from the soil, only four weed species were observed in the fields at the full heading stage of the rice. The two dominant weed species, Monochoria vaginalis and Cyperaceae, accounted for 84% of the total weed biomass in the field. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that during the period of no-input cultivation, soil NO3 concentrations, air temperature, and sunlight hours had significant effects on the biomass of M. vaginalis, but not on Cyperaceae. Furthermore, the two dominant weed species had different impact on rice yield; Cyperaceae had a large negative effect on rice yield, whereas M. vaginalis did not. These results indicated that weed management in no-input paddies should be directed towards the control of specific weed species such as Cyperaceae sp., rather than the entire weed community.																	0144-8765	2165-0616					2017	33	4					215	224		10.1080/01448765.2017.1299641							WOS:000416552100001

Defining the role of fire in alleviating seed dormancy in a rare Mediterranean endemic subshrub	AOB PLANTS												Fire is a topical issue in the management of many ecosystems globally that face a drying climate. Understanding the role of fire in such ecosystems is critical to inform appropriate management practices, particularly in the case of rare and ecologically specialized species. The Mediterranean heathlands are highly fire-prone and occur in a biodiversity hotspot increasingly threatened by human activities, and determining the reproductive thresholds of at-risk heathland species is critical to ensuring the success of future conservation initiatives. This study examined the germination biology of the threatened carnivorous subshrub Drosophyllum lusitanicum, with specific focus on the role of fire-related cues (heat and smoke) in combination with seasonal temperatures and moisture conditions to determine how these factors regulate seed dormancy and germination. We found that D. lusitanicum produces water-permeable, physiologically dormant seeds with a fully developed, capitate embryo that when fresh (similar to 1 month old) and without treatment germinate to 20-40 % within 4-8 weeks. Seeds possess a restricted thermal window (15-20 degrees C) for germination and a neutral photoblastic response. Seed dormancy was overcome through precision nicking of the seed coat (>90 % germination) or by short exposure to dry heat (80 or 100 degrees C) for 5-30 min (60-100 % germination). We propose seedling emergence from the soil seed bank may be cued by the passage of fire, or by soil disturbance from the movement and browsing of animals. Long-term population viability is likely to be contingent upon appropriate management of the persistent soil seed bank, as well as the adequate management of key ecological disturbances such as fire. Drosophyllum lusitanicum faces an increasingly bleak future in the absence of conservation and management initiatives aimed at reducing habitat fragmentation in heathlands and aligning fire management and livestock practices with biodiversity outcomes.

Grassroot Initiatives for Sustainable Livelihood	BIODIVERSITY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT	Environmental Challeges and Solutions											On-farm management of agrobiodiversity in the Western Ghats, the biodiversity hotspot and a UN-accredited World Heritage Centre has become difficult due to an array of reasons. In rice paddy ecosystem, the conversion of ricefields and dwindling diversity of rice landraces are found to be the biggest challenge. This chapter describes the case of Wayanad District of Kerala, India, where, recognising the importance of paddy fields in terms of ecological, food and livelihood security provided by them, M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) launched a rice conservation programme in 1998 and a Seed-Care movement. This movement has been facilitated since 1998 by involving the major farming groups of Wayanad, especially the tribal communities of Kurichya, Kuruma, Pathiyar and Wayanadan Chetty, to promote the conservation and sustainable use of the indigenous crop varieties. This case study illustrates a movement that has promoted conservation of seeds of indigenous varieties in smallholders' family farms in Wayanad District of Kerala. The active integration of agrobiodiversity into the overall issue of sustainable development is necessary, giving equal consideration to all the three dimensions of it: economic, ecological and social sustainability. Efforts have been made to integrate conservation issues, cultivation knowledge, consumption awareness and commercial aspects into one overarching policy strategy.																	2214-2827		978-3-319-42162-9; 978-3-319-42161-2				2017							235	248		10.1007/978-3-319-42162-9_15	10.1007/978-3-319-42162-9						WOS:000400475300018

Through what organizational arrangements are ecosystem responses coordinated? The first part of this chapter reviews the concept of social innovation; the second part presents cases from southwest Rajasthan and west Yunnan on social innovation, based on fieldwork conducted in January and August 2011. The cases describe SIs that vary in scale and technology: beehives; improved wood burning stoves; pump sets; working groups to raise funds and share technology; working groups to clean shared water sources; community forest wardens; village councils for water sharing and commons access; and seed banks, land regeneration, child care, and night schools. However these cases can be read as not only demonstrating social innovation but also, in terms of critiques of the policies of neoliberal governments, and in terms of narrative ruptures, puzzles that reveal the push and pull of agential interests in the realm of ecology. The final part of the chapter argues for a focus on the politics of social innovation. As a term SI signifies the possibilities for shifting power structures through networked engagement. Networks including of NGOs must work with state governments to mobilize local people with their own interests. This requires a variety of groups, such as village councils, state-mandated bodies, registered NGOs, and networks, to negotiate and mobilize around ecological response.																			978-3-319-44037-8; 978-3-319-44035-4				2017							145	163		10.1007/978-3-319-44037-8_7	10.1007/978-3-319-44037-8						WOS:000412519700009

J	Rabitz, F				Rabitz, Florian			Access without benefit-sharing: design, effectiveness and reform of the FAO seed treaty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS												The 2001 International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture established a global network of seed banks which grants facilitated access to crops for breeding purposes while aiming that the resulting commercial benefits are shared fairly and equitably. While the treaty has been successful in terms of access, benefits are not being shared. I analyze the causes for the lack of benefit-sharing in terms of the treaty's institutional design, implementation challenges and the wider problem structure of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Subsequently, I evaluate the options which are currently under discussion for a comprehensive reform. I conclude by proposing a set of measures which would enhance the treaty's effectiveness both in terms of access to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of relevant benefits.

B	Singh, PK; Chauhan, RS; Singh, P		Singh, RL		Singh, Pradeep Kumar; Chauhan, Rajveer Singh; Singh, Pankaj			Biodiversity and Its Conservation	PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE	Applied Environmental Science and Engineering for a Sustainable Future											Environmentalists might define biodiversity as the total sum of all plant and animal life on the Earth and air, water, and land that support animal and plant life. It is an attribute of an area and specifically refers to the variety within and among living organisms, assemblages of living organisms, biotic communities, and biotic processes, whether naturally occurring or modified by humans. The richness of biodiversity provides humans a food security, health care, and industrial commodities that have support to high standard of living in the modern world. This diversity of organisms makes a sustainable support system which is utilized by every society/nation for its growth, development, and betterment. Those that overused or misused it are decayed. Animal, plant, and marine biodiversity consists of the natural capital that keeps our ecosystems functional and economically productive. The real problem the world faces, however, is the conservation of biodiversity. If we utilize this biodiversity in a sustainable manner, we can develop new products/services for several generations. It is only possible when we treat biodiversity as a valuable resource and prevent extinction of species globally. But the world is facing a dramatic loss of biodiversity. The loss of biodiversity has adverse effects on living being, water supply, food security, and resilience to extreme events. It has consequences for 78 % of the world's extreme poor who live in rural areas and rely on ecosystems and the goods they produce to make a living. Conservation of biological diversity leads to conservation of crucial ecological diversity to preserve the continuity of food chains. Conservation of wildlife along with their natural habitats is the demand of the present scenario and the only way to moderate the self-destruction processes initiated by the mankind since the beginning of human civilization. The two conservation strategies are ex situ (outside natural habitat) and in situ (within natural habitat). Zoo, cryopreservation, and seed bank are the common examples of ex situ conservation, and protected areas like national park, sanctuary, biosphere reserve, conservation reserve, community reserve, etc. are examples of in situ conservation. Biological diversity has no regional/national territories, and its conservation is therefore a combined responsibility of every society/country for the stable and healthy world.																			978-981-10-1866-4; 978-981-10-1865-7				2017							315	340		10.1007/978-981-10-1866-4_10	10.1007/978-981-10-1866-4						WOS:000410699100011

Lippold] - germination and longevity	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Cascabela thevetia (L.) Lippold (Apocynaceae), commonly known as Captain Cook tree or yellow oleander, has established large infestations in riparian areas along several creeks and rivers in northern Queensland. To better understand the ecology of C. thevetia and the implications for its spread and management, this study reports seven experiments related to the seed ecology of its yellow and peach biotypes. We quantified its germination response to ambient (Experiment 1a and 1b), alternating and constant temperature (Experiment 2a and 2b) regimes and exposure to different light conditions (Experiment 3). Seed longevity under two soil types, two levels of pasture cover and three burial depths was also determined (Experiment 4a and 4b). Both loose seeds and seeds still within pods (kernels) of the two biotypes of C. thevetia were able to germinate in all months of the year in northern Queensland, irrespective of the large differences in monthly ambient temperatures experienced at the Charters Towers study site. Both biotypes also germinated across a wide range of alternating day/night temperatures from 16/128 degrees C to 47/378 degrees C and constant temperatures from 178 degrees C to 44.08 degrees C. Germination of the two biotypes was significantly greater (4-fold) and faster (7 days earlier) under shade than under natural light conditions. Over all biotypes, soil types, levels of pasture cover and burial depths, no seeds of C. thevetia remained viable after 2 years: longevity was much less in many circumstances. The results demonstrate that C. thevetia seeds can germinate over a wide temperature range, whereas the ability of seed to remain viable at low temperatures highlights the potential for expansion of its current potential distribution towards southern latitudes of the Australian continent. Across all experimental conditions, the yellow biotype displayed superior seed germination and viability traits compared with the peach biotype. Seed banks of the peach and yellow biotypes of C. thevetia are short-lived (2 years), which may be exploited when developing management strategies to reduce its impacts.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2017	39	4					307	316		10.1071/RJ17025							WOS:000413963600001						
J	Haby, NA				Haby, N. A.			Long-term revegetation success of severely degraded chenopod shrublands	RANGELAND JOURNAL												The restoration of severely degraded vegetation communities is often said to require mechanical intervention. However, the degree of intervention required, and its capacity to successfully restore areas of bare (scalded) soil and high weed cover into functioning chenopod shrubland, is unknown. Ten years on from mechanical intervention and direct seeding using a Contour Seeder and Camel Pitter, the abundance and cover of species was compared across disturbed and undisturbed microtopographic zones using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise t-tests. Along Contour Seeder rip lines, recruitment of perennial species was greatest in the furrow (e.g. direct seeded: F-2,F-78 = 27.15, P < 0.001; wild-sourced: F-2,F-78 = 13.19, P < 0.001), and annual (and short-lived perennial) species equal to, or greater, on the undisturbed flat (wild-sourced: F-2,F-98 = 43.91, P < 0.001). At the species-level, these trends often coincided with the species' life-history strategy, but not always (e.g. the perennial Atriplex stipitata illustrated the annual trend; F-2,F-78 = 7.71, P < 0.001). It is also important to note that a trend in recruitment could be driven by recruitment patterns in any one demographic phase. For example, the perennial trend in Atriplex vesicaria and Sida fibulifera abundance was driven by the recruitment of reproductive plants (F-2,F-48 = 15.57, P < 0.001), or seedlings (F-2,F-36 = 5.24, P = 0.010), respectively. These results indicate the functional benefits of mechanical intervention vary between species. The perennial and annual trends detected along Contour Seeder rip lines were less apparent along Camel Pitter rip lines where both perennial and annual species benefited from the initial disturbance. Overall, mechanical intervention facilitated the patchy recruitment of a Maireana pyramidata over A. vesicaria low shrubland, including several perennial and annual chenopods, indicating an early stage of recovery.

A botanical, ecological and hydrological contribution to understanding the Lower River Murray and beyond	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												This paper summarises Keith Walker's contribution to the understanding of aquatic, littoral and floodplain understorey vegetation in inland arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems. The work undertaken by Keith and his Ph.D. students included the vegetation dynamics of lower River Murray weir pools, wetlands and floodplains, Darling River floodplain lakes and adaptations of plants to these environments. Studies showed that hydrology was the primary driver of the vegetation of these systems and changes to hydrology brought about by abstraction and river regulation resulted in changes to floristic composition. The responses and investigations of adaptions of individual species to hydrology in controlled experiments provided information regarding the mechanisms of change brought about by altered hydrology. This information has provided the basis of our understanding of vegetation dynamics in weir pools, fundamentally changed how weirs and storages were operated in the lower River Murray, contributed to guidelines for the management of wetlands with flow control structures and the development of vegetation monitoring programs used to assess the effectiveness of restoration activities.																	0372-1426	2204-0293					2017	141	2					92	107		10.1080/03721426.2017.1374818							WOS:000413625600002						
J	Baur, PA; Eggert, G; Lautsch, E; Schmidtlein, S				Baur, Pamela Alessandra; Eggert, Gregory; Lautsch, Erwin; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Ecology and development of Typha minima illustrated by a re-introduced population at the Upper Drava River (Austria)	TUEXENIA												The dwarf bulrush (Typha minima Funck ex Hoppe) is a characteristic alpine pioneer herb that occurs primarily along wild rivers. However, since the 1970s this indicator species has become locally extinct in Germany, and nearly so in Austria. Ongoing population declines are expected to be the result of wide spread river regulation and resulting alteration to key demographic processes. Thanks to the effort of reintroduction programs, T. minima can be found again along the Upper Drava River, Austria. In this paper we report on seed germination, growth, reproduction and the environmental preferences of T minima. Germination experiments revealed a very low mean germination rate of 15.6% with a range of 0-90%. Germination rates increased with higher temperatures, increased seed maturity and shorter seed bank periods. After seed storage for 480 hours no germination was observed. In monitored field populations at the Upper Drava, seedlings (height < 5 cm) were rarely found. Individuals at the young stage (height > 15 cm, only sterile shoots) accounted for the majority of basal area at about 62%. Individuals up to three years old developed only sterile shoots. Reproductive shoots developed after 9 years and the number of inflorescences increased with increasing age. An analysis of environmental conditions showed that T. minima was especially dependent on high soil moisture content, with an average of 39 Vol-% humidity. In 'addition, light conditions were also important for growth- declines in shoot density were found at > 50% canopy coverage by Salix shrubs. We conclude that 7'. minima populations are demographically sensitive during seed germination, and that modern range retractions are predominantly the result of river regulation and reduced morphodynamics that would normally create appropriate open patches for germinating seedlings.

Functional diversity increases ecological stability in a grazed grassland	OECOLOGIA												Understanding the factors governing ecological stability in variable environments is a central focus of ecology. Functional diversity can stabilize ecosystem function over time if one group of species compensates for an environmentally driven decline in another. Although intuitively appealing, evidence for this pattern is mixed. We hypothesized that diverse functional responses to rainfall will increase the stability of vegetation cover and biomass across rainfall conditions, but that this effect depends on land-use legacies that maintain functional diversity. We experimentally manipulated grazing in a California grassland to create land-use legacies of low and moderate grazing, across which we implemented rainout shelters and irrigation to create dry and wet conditions over 3 years. We found that the stability of the vegetation cover was greatly elevated and the stability of the biomass was slightly elevated across rainfall conditions in areas with histories of moderate grazing. Initial functional diversity-both in the seed bank and aboveground-was also greater in areas that had been moderately grazed. Rainfall conditions in conjunction with this grazing legacy led to different functional diversity patterns over time. Wet conditions led to rapid declines in functional diversity and a convergence on resource-acquisitive traits. In contrast, consecutively dry conditions maintained but did not increase functional diversity over time. As a result, grazing practices and environmental conditions that decrease functional diversity may be associated with lasting effects on the response of ecosystem functions to drought. Our results demonstrate that theorized relationships between diversity and stability are applicable and important in the context of working grazed landscapes.

J	Costan, AS; Sarasola, JH				Silvina Costan, Andrea; Hernan Sarasola, Jose			EARED DOVE (ZENAIDA AURICULATA) GRANIVORY AND ITS ROLE IN SEED DISPERSAL IN SEMIARID FORESTS OF CENTRAL ARGENTINA	ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL												The Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata) is one of the most abundant granivorous birds in the Neotropical region, and has been declared as a pest in several regions of southern South America. Most studies of this dove's diet have been conducted in agricultural lands in order to evaluate crop damage and dove preferences for particular crop seeds. More recently, it has been argued that Eared Doves may also play a role as seed dispersers, since often seeds contained in crops are spilled when doves are killed by predators. Here, we studied the food habits of the Eared Dove in xerophytic semiarid forests of central Argentina and the germination potential of seeds contained in crops. Based on crop contents, using an emetic formula and greenhouse germination experiments, we aimed to determine the diet of the Eared Dove and to evaluate the potential role of doves as seed predators and dispersers. Most of the birds captured (70%, n = 131) regurgitated crop contents. Crops contained almost exclusively seeds of six cultivated and 13 non- cultivated plant species, with a mean (+/- SD) of 207 +/- 286 seeds/crop. Doves consumed seeds in asynchrony with the plant fruiting or crop-sowing cycle for both non- cultivated and cultivated species, respectively, suggesting that doves forage not only directly from plants but also from crop-seed storage facilities, spilled grain, and the seed bank. We selected some of the most representative plant species obtained from dove crops to carry out germination experiments. While all species showed some level of germination potential, seeds from cultivated plant species (n = 5) showed a higher mean germination potential (56.8%)than those from non- cultivated species (23.1%, n = 3). Our results confirm the role of the Eared Dove as seed predator but also highlight its potential role as seed disperser following predation.																	1075-4377						2017	28						43	50									WOS:000403469200006						
J	Nuzzo, V; Davalos, A; Blossey, B				Nuzzo, Victoria; Davalos, Andrea; Blossey, Bernd			Assessing plant community composition fails to capture impacts of white-tailed deer on native and invasive plant species	AOB PLANTS												Excessive herbivory can have transformative effects on forest understory vegetation, converting diverse communities into depauperate ones, often with increased abundance of non-native plants. White-tailed deer are a problematic herbivore throughout much of eastern North America and alter forest understory community structure. Reducing (by culling) or eliminating (by fencing) deer herbivory is expected to return understory vegetation to a previously diverse condition. We examined this assumption from 1992 to 2006 at Fermilab (Batavia, IL) where a cull reduced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance in 1998/1999 by 90% from 24.6 to 2.5/km(2), and at West Point, NY, where we assessed interactive effects of deer, earthworms, and invasive plants using 30 x 30 m paired fenced and open plots in 12 different forests from 2009 to 2012. We recorded not only plant community responses (species presence and cover) within 1 m(2) quadrats, but also responses of select individual species (growth, reproduction). At Fermilab, introduced Alliaria petiolata abundance initially increased as deer density increased, but then declined after deer reduction. The understory community responded to the deer cull by increased cover, species richness and height, and community composition changed but was dominated by early successional native forbs. At West Point plant community composition was affected by introduced earthworm density but not deer exclusion. Native plant cover increased and non-native plant cover decreased in fenced plots, thus keeping overall plant cover similar. At both sites native forb cover increased in response to deer reduction, but the anticipated response of understory vegetation failed to materialize at the community level. Deer-favoured forbs (Eurybia divaricata, Maianthemum racemosum, Polygonatum pubescens and Trillium recurvatum) grew taller and flowering probability increased in the absence of deer. Plant community monitoring fails to capture initial and subtle effects of reduced or even cessation of deer browse on browse sensitive species. Measuring responses of individual plants (growth, flowering and reproductive success) provides a more sensitive and powerful assessment of forest understory responses to deer management.																	2041-2851						2017	9								plx026	10.1093/aobpla/plx026							WOS:000410143600005	28775829

Seed Biology of the Weed Maryland Meadowbeauty (Rhexia mariana L.) in Blueberry (Vaccinium spp.)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FRUIT SCIENCE												Studies were conducted at three locations across the North Carolina coastal plain region to determine sexual reproductive potential, seedbank density, frequency of seed dormancy, and effect of temperature on Maryland meadowbeauty seed germination. Seed capsule density ranged from 500 per m(2) to 1124 per m2 across locations. Each capsule contained an average of 74 seeds. Seeds germinated only in the 35/20 degrees C temperature regime, which represents the hottest month (August) of the growing season in southeastern North Carolina. Total number of germinated seeds differed across locations and ranged from 30% to 57%. The percent (average) of viable (66) and nonviable (26) meadowbeauty seeds was not different across locations. Relative germination and seed dormancy percentages were calculated based on the number of viable seeds. The percent relative germination and seed dormancy were different across locations and ranged from 47% to 86% and 14% to 55%, respectively. The highest number of germination resulted from 90 days of stratification. On average, 27 seeds germinated among soil samples, which is equivalent to 989 seeds per m(2). The data indicate that the populations of meadowbeauty in blueberry fields have the potential to sexually reproduce and contribute 5 x 10(6) to 1.1 x 10(7) seed capsules/ha and 3.7 x 10(8) to 8.3 x 10(8) seeds/ha of infestation. Freshly mature seeds can germinate and contribute 1.79 x 10(8) to 7.14 x 10(8) seedlings/ha in the year the seeds are produced and 5.18 x 10(7) to 4.4 x 10(8) seeds/ha can be dormant and incorporated into the seed bank on an annual basis.

Observations were carried out in Molinia caeruleae meadows representing early (Patch I), temporary (Patch II) and advanced (Patch III) stage of secondary succession. Patch I was dominated by meadow species creating delicate stems, Patch II abounded in large tussock grasses and tall-growing rhizomatous grasses and Patch III was overgrown by willow shrubs and bordered by trees. The number of seeds and taxa in the seed rain decreased gradually in the successive study sites. Species resident in the standing vegetation were the most abundantly represented in the seed rain and their share augmented remarkably in Patch III, most likely due to its spatial isolation by the surrounding shrubs and trees. The share of seedlings and taxa in artificially made gaps in the plant cover and litter decreases along the successional gradient. The majority of taxa appearing in the seedling pool of all the patches occurred in the seed rain, while the taxa in the soil seed-bank reserves were modestly represented only in Patches I and II. Combining the obtained results and published data, it can be stated that, being abundant in the seed rain, the best colonizers show the greatest germination capability. Although the best colonizers are meadow taxa, fast-growing weeds, trees as well as alien, invasive species also appeared in the seedling pool.																	0354-4664	1821-4339					2017	69	3					513	522		10.2298/ABS160722127K							WOS:000408923400015

Its importance stems from its adaptation to areas with poor soil conditions and water stress. The aim of this work is to describe the historical evolution of barley types and varieties of barley grown by farmers in Spain. A historical review was performed by consulting articles and books on the history, archaeology, and agronomy related to the issue. Different web sites and articles about the current varietal state of barley in Spain were also consulted. Another important information source was the CRF (Centro de Recursos Fitogeneticos, Spanish Center of Plant Genetic Resources) of Spain, where a large collection of landraces is preserved. The first barleys came to Spain approximately 7600 years BP. The crop spread throughout the country, and the cultivation of barley was reported by the Romans, Arabs, Castilians, and Spaniards. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the first attempt at classification was carried out. Until the 1940s, most barley acreage was sown with ancient landraces, but from that period up to the present, a steady varietal renovation occurred. The history of barley types and varieties in Spain is rich, and an extensive set of landraces is preserved in seed banks. These landraces contain genes for resistance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

Weed control with herbicides was carried out in July 1 and 2 years from planting, and wood ash (5 Mg ha(-1)) was applied in the spring of the 2nd year. Various vegetation, tree growth and nutrient assessments were made over the 21-year study period. Weed control decreased the weed cover by 36-56 percentage points, vegetation height by 4-26 cm and thus shading of seedlings by vegetation for at least 4 years after planting. For the same period, ash fertilization increased vegetation height by 6-15 cm and shading of seedlings. Weed control reduced seedling mortality by 27 percentage points in 21 years, but ash fertilization had no significant effect. Ash fertilization increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, but its effect declined, and severe K-deficiency was recorded 21 years after planting. Up to the 9th year, weed control had a greater influence on growth than fertilization. Later the significance of fertilization increased due to an aggravated K-deficiency. Stand volume at year 21 for the untreated control plots was 8 m3 ha(-1). Weed control and fertilization increased stand volume by 20 and 35 m(3)ha(-1), with a combined effect of 55 m(3)ha(-1). The effects of weed control and fertilization were additive and no significant interactions were found. Due to severe K-deficiencies, re-fertilization of all treatments would be necessary for the continued survival and growth of Scots pine.																	0037-5330	2242-4075					2017	51	3							1734	10.14214/sf.1734							WOS:000405579900008

To verify this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted on an unmown meadow in the Bialowieia National Park. The emerging seedlings of different species originating from C. cespitosa tussocks of different size (large and small) were observed under greenhouse conditions for four years. The size of a non-soil seed bank was evaluated based on the number of seedlings. Significant differences in the seedling number were found between large and small sedge tussocks (Mann-Whitney test Z = 3.96, P < 0.001). However, the number of recorded species was independent of tussock size. Both types of tussocks were dominated by meadow, forest and swamp species (in decreasing order). Some of these species are no longer present in the studied area, or their occurrence is limited to small groups at the meadow's edges. A non-soil seed bank within the tussock cores of C. cespitosa may be, similar to a soil seed bank, a tool for studying the changes occurring in plant communities.

J	Cochrane, A				Cochrane, Anne			Are we underestimating the impact of rising summer temperatures on dormancy loss in hard-seeded species?	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Short duration dry heat shock similar to the heat of fire is known to be effective in alleviating physical dormancy in seeds, but are we underestimating the impact of the cumulative heat dose of summer soil temperatures on dormancy loss in hard-seeded species in the context of a changing climate? This study investigated short and long duration dry heat treatments in seeds of four Acacia species (Fabaceae) from South-West Western Australia. Seeds were treated at 90, 100, 110 and 120 degrees C for 10 and 180min (fire') and at fluctuating temperatures of 30/20, 55/20, 65/20 degrees C for 14, 28, 56 and 112 days (summer'). The non-dormant seed fraction of each species was low, but seeds were highly viable after scarification. The results indicate the presence of species-specific temperature thresholds for dormancy loss with duration of heating slightly less important than temperature for dormancy break. Seeds remained highly viable after all long duration treatments but short duration heat shock treatments above 110 degrees C resulted in increased seed mortality. Although cumulative periods of lower fluctuating temperatures were less effective in breaking physical dormancy than the heat of fire in three of the four species, more than 40% of seeds of Acacia nigricans (Labill.) R.Br. lost dormancy after 28 days at 65/20 degrees C. These potentially disturbing findings suggest that long hot summer conditions may compromise soil seed bank longevity over time and may be detrimental to the bet-hedging ability afforded by a hard seed coat in some species in the face of climate warming forecasts for the region.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2017	65	3					248	256		10.1071/BT16244							WOS:000403052900005

Germination ecology of the endangered species Asterolasia buxifolia (Rutaceae): smoke response depends on season and light	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In fire-prone regions, many plant species rely on persistent seed banks for post-fire recovery. Understanding dormancy and germination cues is, therefore, important to predict population response. However, the germination ecology of species with physiologically dormant seeds in fire-prone regions is complex. We used the endangered species Asterolasia buxifolia, from riparian habitat in fire-prone south-eastern Australia, to investigate physiologically dormant seeds and their response to fire. We assessed whether fire cues alone promoted germination, or whether seasonal factors and light also played a role. Additionally, we tested the resilience of seeds to heat-shock temperatures produced in soil during fire, so as to identify potential factors that restrict such species to fire refugia. Seeds germinated only at winter seasonal temperatures, and had an obligate smoke and light requirement. Heat-shock treatments above 80 degrees C slowed the germination rate. Smoke-related germination and the tolerance of A. buxifolia seeds to high fire-related temperatures demonstrated that recruitment dynamics can be driven by fire; however, germination is restricted to winter temperatures. This highlights the potential that changes to fire season may have on population persistence. The slow germination rate caused by heat, and a light requirement, may contribute to restricting this species to riparian habitat.

George			Preemergence Control of Nine Invasive Weeds with Aminocyclopyrachlor, Aminopyralid, and Indaziflam	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												There are an estimated 400 million hectares of non-cropland in the United States primarily designated as rangeland and pastureland, and there are more than 300 invasive weeds found on these sites, causing an estimated annual loss of $5 billion. Among the most invasive and problematic weeds are Dalmatian toadflax, diffuse knapweed, downy brome, and musk thistle. Currently, herbicides are the most common management strategy for broadleaf weeds and invasive winter annual grasses. Indaziflam, a new herbicide for invasive plant management in non-crop areas, is a cellulose-biosynthesis inhibitor capable of providing residual invasive winter annual grass control up to 3 yr after treatment (YAT). A field experiment was conducted to determine whether residual Dalmatian toadflax and downy brome control by aminocyclopyrachlor, imazapic, and picloram could be extended by tank mixing these herbicides with indaziflam. Indaziflam tank mixed with aminocyclopyrachlor, imazapic, and picloram provided increased Dalmatian toadflax (84% to 91%) and downy brome (89% to 94%) control 4 YAT, compared with treatments excluding indaziflam. Treatments without indaziflam controlled 50% to 68% of Dalmatian toadflax and <25% downy brome 4 YAT. Based on these results, a greenhouse dose-response experiment was conducted with aminocyclopyrachlor, aminopyralid, and indaziflam to compare preemergence control of nine common non-crop weeds. Averaged across species, aminocyclopyrachlor and aminopyralid GR(50) values (herbicide concentration resulting in 50% reduction in plant biomass) were 29 and 52 times higher compared with indaziflam, respectively. These data suggest that indaziflam could be used for residual control of non-crop weeds as a tank-mix partner with other foliar-applied broadleaf herbicides.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JAN-MAR	2017	10	1					99	109		10.1017/inp.2017.7							WOS:000401815300012

Information is scarce for evidence-based restoration options. Sown Senna didymobotrya, planted Ficus thonningii cuttings, sown S. didymobotrya and planted F. thonningii combined, and previously occurring native non-browse shrubs (NNS) were compared for their effect on selected plant nutrients and occurrence of Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata in north-west Ethiopia. The treatments were applied to experimental units established on previous grazing land. At the end of the fourth year, 60% of planted F. thonningii stakes survived. The leaf biomass production was encouraging. Senna didymobotrya attained close to 1 m height and crown width. Natural regeneration of O. europaea was observed only under previously occurring shrubs. Six previously occurring NNS species were identified. Soils immediately under these shrubs were richer in nutrients than between shrubs in the open spaces. Our results suggest that vegetative stakes and NNS could be promising tools for ecological restoration of decimated ecosystems in the highlands of Ethiopia. Management interventions, which aim at steering succession close to pre-disturbance forest community structure by facilitation, should be selective of the shrub species.

Samples were taken from the first five centimeters of substrate containing the area propagative material. The samples were housed in a nursery where we counted the plant emergences every 24 hours, identifying the individuals at the end. The abundance and diversity indexes were calculated. In this study, three of the higher occurrence species were common in both periods (dry and rainy): Ageratum fastigiatum, Echinolaena inflexa and Borreria latifolia. The value found for the Shannon Index (H') for the species derived from propagules on the topsoil in vegetation in the altitude fields in Atlantic Forest during the dry period were of 2.79 nats. ind(-1) and during the rainy period was of 2.23 nats. ind(-1). Pielou's equability observed for the dry period was of 0.72 and for the rainy period was of 0.63. The similarity between both periods was of 0.36. Comparing the response variable number of individuals between both periods, we identified a statistical difference with a larger mean for the dry period. According to the conditions this work was performed in, it is possible to ascertain that there are species with potential to recover mined areas in vegetation in altitude fields. Therefore, we suggest that ecology complementary studies are performed on these species and seed technology as a way to fundament the application of this knowledge in mined area recovery practices.

The herbaceous, bush and tree strata provide food for animals and several products for human use, and supply seedbank with propagules to assure plant recovery. The objective of this study was to compare seedbank density, composition and diversity of three sites with different vegetation physiognomies: craibeira plantation site (A1), degraded site (A2) and juremas + sabia plantation site (A3), located at the Nupearido Experimental Station/Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Patos, PB state, Brazil. Five litterfal + soil samples were collected in each site and taken to the Forest Nursery of UFCG Campus in Patos and kept under a 50% solar radiation reduction plastic screen and a daily manual irrigation regimen, where they were observed during 90 days for counting and identification of the emerging seedlings. Plantule density for each site was compared by the chi(2) test (P<0.05). Plant diversity and species richness were evaluated by Shannon-Wiener (H') and Pielou Uniformity (e") indexes, respectively. Herb species predominated in seedbank of all sites, and the number of seeds of tree species increased in the craibeira plantation site resulting from the prolonged presence of animals attracted by the thermal comfort under tree canopy.																	0103-9954	1980-5098				JAN-MAR	2017	27	1					203	213		10.5902/1980509826459							WOS:000399381900017

Current Status of the Granite Pool Sprite, Gratiola amphiantha (Plantaginaceae), in Alabama	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Gratiola amphiantha (Granite Pool Sprite or Little Amphianthus) is a federally threatened plant species found in solution depressions formed on granite outcrops of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. In Alabama, its distribution has recently been reduced from 3 to 2 counties along the eastern border in 8 small pools totaling less than 10 square meters. This study was initiated to monitor population numbers in Alabama, identify new populations, and make recommendations for the conservation of this species. Counts of individuals and pools were made in 2012 and 2013 at Penton (Chambers County) and Almond (Randolph County); a third site at Wehadkee Creek (Randolph County) was added in 2016. Numbers of individuals per pool differed dramatically; Pool P-3 dropped 72% from 2012 to 2013 before recovering partially (to-36%) in 2016. Densities were calculated for the larger pools, with Pool A-1 reaching 32.41 plants per 10 cm(2) in 2016. Because of habitat loss due to human disturbance-quarrying, recreational use, and dumping-G. amphiantha are close to extirpation in Alabama. A recovery plan, featuring the purchases of key properties, removal of competing vegetation, and the transferring of seed banks to additional pools, should be immediately implemented.																	1528-7092	1938-5412					2017	16	1					59	69		10.1656/058.016.0105							WOS:000398177300006

M.; Carroll, Jacky A.; Jones, Laurence M.; Scott, Richard			Evaluation of topsoil inversion in UK habitat creation and restoration schemes	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Habitat creation and restoration schemes on former agricultural soils can be constrained by high residual soil fertility, a weedy seed bank, and a lack of suitable species in the seed rain. Topsoil inversion has been trialled across the United Kingdom as a novel technique to address these constraints. We investigated 15 topsoil inversion sites ranging in age (time since inversion) from 6 months to 5 years. We assessed surface soil fertility compared to adjacent noninverted soil, and vegetation composition with respect to the species introduced at each site. Soil organic matter, total and extractable N and P were lower in topsoil inversion surface soils, demonstrating that topsoil inversion can successfully reduce surface soil fertility prior to habitat creation and restoration. This reduction was maintained over the timescale of this study (5 years). Cornfield annual nurse crops provided instant visual appeal and gave way to grassland species over time. Sown species varied widely in their establishment success, and sowings were more successful than plug plantings. Grasses colonized naturally following sowing forb-only seed mixes, allowing introduced forbs to establish early on with reduced competition from the seed bank. Plant communities did not yet resemble seminatural communities, but all were in the early stages of community development. Results indicate that topsoil inversion can successfully lower surface soil fertility and reduce competition between sown species and agricultural weeds.

In the Arctic, global warming has already caused vegetation change across the region and is acting as a significant stressor on Arctic biodiversity. Many of the rare plants in the Arctic are relicts from early Holocene warm periods, but their ability to benefit from the current warming is dependent on the viability of their populations. We therefore examined Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data from regional red listed vascular plant species in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and reference populations from the main distribution area of: (1) Botrychium lunaria, (2) Carex capillaris ssp. fuscidula, (3) Comastoma tenellum, (4) Kobresia simpliciuscula ssp. subholarctica, (5) Ranunculus wilanderi, (6) Sibbaldia procumbens and (7) Tofieldia pusilla. In addition, we gathered population size data in Svalbard. The Svalbard populations had low genetic diversity and distinctiveness and few or no private markers compared to populations outside the archipelago. This is similar to observations in other rare species in Svalbard and the genetic depletion may be due to an initial founder effect and/or a genetic bottleneck caused by late Holocene cooling. There seems to be limited gene flow from other areas and the Svalbard populations should therefore be considered as demographically independent management units. Overall, these management units have small and/or few populations and are therefore prone to stochastic events which may further increase vulnerability to inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variation, and reduced evolutionary potential. Our results support theory predicting lower levels of genetic diversity in small, isolated and/or peripheral populations and may be of importance for management of other rare plant species in the Arctic.

PRESENTATION OF THE HUSEEDWILD - A SEED WEIGHT AND GERMINATION DATABASE OF THE PANNONIAN FLORA - THROUGH ANALYSING LIFE FORMS AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR TYPES	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this paper, we present the HUSEEDwild, which is an online seed weight and germination database relying on our investigations concerning the regional seed collection (Pannon Seed Bank) of the Pannonian flora (available at: http://huseed.nodik.hu:8243/en/wild). Our data of 806 taxa (sensu species and subspecies) represent nearly 40% of the Pannonian flora. With our database, we contribute to former Hungarian databases with seed weight data of 50 taxa, and data of 20 taxa are first to be published in Europe. Our database is the first national germination database, and it contributes to European databases with germination data of 228 taxa. Additionally, we exemplify the ecological applicability of the dataset through analysing two plant strategies: (i) life forms and (ii) social behaviour types. Correlations between seed traits and plant strategies are investigated. Our findings are the following: (i) woody plants have significantly higher seed weight and significantly lower germination capacity than herbs (incl. forbs and graminoids); (ii) within herbs, perennials have significantly lower germination capacity than annuals and within forbs, they have significantly higher seed weight as well; (iii) herbaceous ruderals have significantly lower seed weight and significantly higher germination capacity than herbaceous stress tolerants. Our online database is being extended continuously, and its standardised data make it suitable for integration into larger European online databases.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	1					225	244		10.15666/aeer/1501_225244							WOS:000397162200018

The geographic distributions of a species, be it native or alien, is expected to be limited at some point by environmental conditions. In this situation, a range edge equilibrium (REE) takes place, i.e., populations occurring beyond the edge have a growth rate reduced below replacement. The occurrence of REE has never been tested for an invasive species. In Western Europe, the invasive weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. has spread in most parts of southern and central France, where it can be found in very high densities in sunflower fields, but seems to be limited in its northwards expansion. It is currently unknown whether the range has reached a limit or not. Information about how the species responds to sunflower competition is also lacking. Objectives. This work addressed two questions: Has the northern part of A. artemisiifolia invaded range in Western Europe reached REE? How is A. artemisiifolia performance influenced by sunflower competition? Method. Plots were established in an agricultural field ca. 250 km north to the current invaded range, in Belgium. We planted A. artemisiifolia seedlings with or without sunflower competition. The following year, the population growth rates and the soil seed bank were assessed. Results. The species established populations with relatively high growth rates and soil seed bank. Sunflower competition did not have a significant impact on plant performance. Conclusions. The results invalidate the hypothesis of equilibrium at the current margin of A. artemisiifolia invaded range, and suggest a significant potential for invasion northwards.																	1370-6233	1780-4507					2017	21	1					12	21									WOS:000396792900002

Resource Limitations Influence Growth and Vigor of Idaho Fescue, a Common Understory Species in Pacific Northwest Ponderosa Pine Forests	FORESTS												Alterations in under-canopy resource availability associated with elevated ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) abundance can negatively influence understory vegetation. Experimental evidence linking under-canopy resource availability and understory vegetation is scarce. Yet this information would be beneficial in developing management strategies to recover desired understory species. We tested the effects of varying nitrogen (N) and light availability on Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer), the dominant understory species in ponderosa pine/Idaho fescue plant associations in eastern Oregon. In a greenhouse experiment, two levels of N (50 kg.N.ha(-1) and 0 kg.N.ha(-1)) and shade (80% shade and 0% shade) were applied in a split-plot design to individual potted plants grown in soil collected from high abundance pine stands. Plants grown in unshaded conditions produced greater root (p = 0.0027) and shoot (p = 0.0017) biomass and higher cover values (p = 0.0378) compared to those in the shaded treatments. The addition of N had little effect on plant growth (p = 0.1602, 0.5129, and 0.0853 for shoot biomass, root biomass, and cover, respectively), suggesting that soils in high-density ponderosa pine stands that lack understory vegetation were not N deficient and Idaho fescue plants grown in these soils were not N limited. Management activities that increase under-canopy light availability will promote the conditions necessary for Idaho fescue recovery. However, successful restoration may be constrained by a lack of residual fescue or the invasion of more competitive understory vegetation.																	1999-4907					JAN	2017	8	1							6	10.3390/f8010006							WOS:000395506900005

(rock rose) shrublands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Cistus monspeliensis shrublands are strongly exposed to fire hazard and are rapidly expanding on oligotrophic soils as a consequence of the abandonment of silvopastoral activities. We hypothesised that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilisation could contribute to reduce Cistus cover and biomass and to direct the regeneration of the vegetation from seed bank after fire to grasslands able to prevent recurrent wildfires. Two experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of NP fertilisation on plant assemblage composition, diversity, grazing value, dry matter production and Cistus shrubland regeneration in (i) established shrublands, or (ii) recovering vegetation in burned areas. In the shrublands, NP fertilisation negatively affected Cistus cover, regeneration and biomass and significantly improved grazing value without significant effect on plant diversity. In burned areas, NP fertilisation significantly suppressed C. monspeliensis seedlings, increased the grazing value during the first 3 years since the last fire while it significantly reduced plant diversity. The increased grazing value following fertilisation in both burned and unburned areas is high enough to support silvopastoral activities. Soil fertilisation can be a key tool to support the conversion of shrublands in oligotrophic soils into productive grasslands, particularly when surrounding forests and urbanised areas, to reduce wildfire hazards through pastoral activities.

R.; DeYoe, Hudson; Stalter, Richard			The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands: Avicennia germinans	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Avicennia germinans (L.) L. is a pantropical, subtropical, and occasionally warm-temperate mangrove species that occurs on shorelines that have a broad horizontal tidal range. Also known as black mangrove, stands typically develop under anoxic, water-logged conditions in substrates of silt or clay. Black mangrove can tolerate salinity values ranging from 0 to 90 parts per thousand. Salt is excreted from salt glands on both leaf epidermal surfaces, and aerosol salt spray and salt crystals are frequently observed on the upper leaf epidermis. Avicennia germinans is viviparous. The embryos have no dormancy requirements, and there is no seed bank. This mangrove species has the northernmost distributional range of any mangrove species in North America. It occurs in Louisiana and northern Florida. Color-infrared photography and airborne video imagery techniques have been used successfully to map stands of black mangrove on subtropical coastal shorelines. Reforestation efforts using seedlings and saplings have been successful in several areas of the tropics and subtropics. Avicennia germinans stands play an important role in ecosystem functions as a natural barrier to coastal erosion caused by tropical storms, as habitat for a wide range of organisms in intertidal food chains, and as a carbon repository.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					191	207		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00013.1							WOS:000394926100016

Preparing Florida Pasture for Grassland Restoration: Seedling Establishment after Herbiciding and Tilling	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Nonnative pasture grasses established for agriculture and livestock husbandry have replaced countless acres of natural habitat in the last century of Florida history. Many endemic species, such as cutthroat grass (Coleataenia abscissa), are now endangered and may not return to areas until the dominant pasture grass has been removed. To determine the best strategy for native revegetation, we examined the effects of two soil preparations (tilling and no tilling) in pasture plots dominated by bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) on the Archbold Reserve in south-central Florida. In preparation for the experiment, the No-Till and Till plots were first herbicided with glyphosate and burned to remove bahiagrass cover and expose the seed bank, then the Till plots were disked to a depth of 5-10 cm. Reference plots were left undisturbed to provide a pre-restoration baseline. The pre-tilling herbicide application and burn reduced bahiagrass cover in experimental plots to an average of 24% compared to 80% in reference plots. In the first year following tilling, overall plant community composition differed between tillage treatments, with 52 and 38 plant taxa found in the No-Till and Till plots, respectively, compared to only 14 in the reference plots. Importantly, native species richness was significantly higher in the No-Till treatment, and tilling resulted in minimal reduction of cover of bahiagrass and other exotic grasses. Seedling species composition differed among experimental blocks, suggesting soil moisture or other local abiotic conditions may significantly influence seedling establishment and restoration outcomes regardless of mechanical soil preparations.

J	Bernards, SJ; Morris, LR				Bernards, Samantha J.; Morris, Lesley R.			Comparisons of Canyon Grassland Vegetation and Seed Banks Along an Early Successional Gradient	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												The seed bank represents the future trajectory of plant communities following disturbance and is vital to their regeneration. Worldwide, grassland seed banks have been well studied. However, there are no examinations of the seed bank for the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie system found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This absence may arise from the limited amount of intact grasslands in this type following decades of agricultural development and cultivation. In this study, we examined the seed bank from grasslands sites along an early successional gradient to evaluate how they relate to above ground vegetation, successional stage, and historical cultivation. We found that similarities between above ground vegetation and the seed bank were the strongest in the earliest successional stages, when annual grasses dominate. Surprisingly, this relationship was driven by the presence of a relatively new introduced annual grass, Ventenata dubia. Finally, the seed bank within cultivated sites had significantly (p < 0.05) more introduced species than noncultivated reference sites, especially seeds of introduced annual grasses. Overall, our results suggest that these sites are native seed limited and could potentially shift to invasive species dominance with further disturbance, especially on historically cultivated areas. These results have important implications for management given the conservation concern for these remaining intact grasslands. In addition, they add to the growing literature regarding the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie and seed banks within the grassland biome.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				JAN	2017	91	1					27	40									WOS:000395164800004						
J	Fettig, CE; Hufbauer, RA				Fettig, Christa E.; Hufbauer, Ruth A.			Reproductive Strategy, Performance, and Population Dynamics of the Introduced Weed Black Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger)	WEED SCIENCE												Determining whether and how to manage an introduced species requires basic ecological and biological knowledge. If a decision is made to actively manage an invader, doing so efficiently and effectively is critical. Basic biological or ecological information can be key in designing effective and cost-efficient management approaches. We used a greenhouse experiment and observational field studies of naturalized populations to study the modes of pollination, fecundity in the field, seed ecology, population dynamics, and demography of the introduced and toxic weed, black henbane. We showed that henbane was able to self-pollinate. Furthermore, outcrossing did not increase number or size of seeds. Plants in the sampled populations produced an estimated average of 25,300 +/- 4,004 seeds by the middle of the growing season. We found no difference in the viability of field-collected seeds that were 1 to 4 yr old. The number of flowering plants in a population was best predicted by the number of rosettes at that location in July of the previous year. The probability of rosettes surviving over the winter to reach reproductive maturity increased with precipitation and growing degree days. Total population sizes fluctuated dramatically between years. Henbane populations are ephemeral, but with large seed banks, outbreaks are possible if conditions are right. Given that this weed is toxic to livestock and humans, it is important to identify infestations and manage populations.

Weed-management techniques that reduce weed production need to be investigated to provide new approaches. The first step in this process is the determination of weed productivity in different competitive conditions. Field experiments were conducted in 2006 and 2008 in an experimental field in Padinska Skela to quantify growth and seed production of velvetleaf in maize, as well as in a velvetleaf monoculture. A density of velvetleaf ranging from 1 to 8 plants m-1 was artificially created. In a mixture with maize, velvetleaf was sown in crop rows. The growth of velvetleaf was estimated based on plant height, fresh aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI). Velvetleaf fecundity was determined as seed mass plant(-1) and seed mass m(-2). Differences between years in plant production were very prominent. In general, velvetleaf productivity in maize depended on its density. Intraspecific competition had a major influence on growth and seed production when velvetleaf density was from 4 to 8 plants m(-1) in maize rows. This information indicates that environmental conditions and weed density can promote/reduce inter-and intraspecific competition and help in the construction of population dynamics models to predict population density, seed bank and competitiveness of weeds and reduce inputs for weed management.

Ribosomal RNA Internal Transcribed Regions Identify Possible Misidentification or Mislabeling among Trifolium (Clover) Specimens from Germplasm Collections	CROP SCIENCE												Accurate identification and labeling of plant germplasm is essential for creating new hybrids with enhanced agronomic characteristics and for basic genetic and evolutionary studies. Expert collectors and seed banks do their best to attain high levels of accuracy and reliability, but errors are inevitable. During the course of a study of clover (Trifolium) transposable elements, we obtained DNA sequence results that led us to question the species designation of some accessions. By sequencing the internal transcribed spacer regions of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene, we show that 4 of the 13 specimens we obtained appear to have been mislabeled or misidentified.																	0011-183X	1435-0653				JAN-FEB	2017	57	1					322	326		10.2135/cropsci2016.07.0626							WOS:000396378800031

Although seed survival in soil generally increases with an increase in burial depth, whether the effects of burial on seed survival are comparable across different sites is unclear. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that the positive effects of burial on seed survival decrease as vegetation develops through succession. Four wetland species, Drosera rotundifolia, Lobelia sessilifolia, Rhynchospora alba and Moliniopsis japonica, were used for the study. The four species differ in their light requirement for germination; i.e., D. rotundifolia, L. sessilifolia and R. alba germinate best in light, whereas M. japonica germinates equally well in light and darkness. The seeds of these species were buried for two years at three depths (litter, 0 and 4 cm) in three successional stages with different amounts of vegetation and litter in a post-mined peatland. The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature at each of litter layer, 0 cm and 4 cm depths were measured for each successional stage. The between-depth differences in PAR and temperature fluctuations decreased as succession progressed. For the three light demanding species, burial promoted seed survival more in the initial successional stage than in the later successional stages, whereas for M. japonica, burial promoted seed survival equally in all successional stages. This study revealed significant variation in the effects of burial on seed survival, particularly for light-sensitive seeds, and that the soil surface layers in vegetated sites can contain persistent seeds, which could be used as a seed source in restoration.

Establishment of woody species across 26years of revegetation on a Queensland coal mine	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												The establishment success of woody plant species at 56 revegetation sites, four to 26years old, across the Meandu open-cut coal mine in south-east Queensland was assessed. The revegetation process involved returning stockpiled topsoil, deep ripping and mechanical sowing of a mix of native seeds. Blakes Wattle (Acacia blakei) and less often Black Wattle (A.leiocalyx), both primarily derived from respread topsoil seed, dominate the vegetation canopy at 59% and 20% of revegetation sites, respectively. The additional sowing of seeds of many tree and shrub species within the sites has had limited success with most failing to persist or grow well. Revegetation management, for example selective thinning of acacias (Acacia spp.) saplings within the first 5years is recommended to release the competition pressure on the poorly performing tree species. This will also allow opportunities for other less well represented shrub and herb species to persist. This study has shown that a range of tree and shrub species, including Eucalyptus spp., are performing poorly under the current revegetation regime, suggesting adjustments to revegetation species selection and/or methodologies are needed. The natural colonization of woody native species within the sites from nearby remnant vegetation is shown to be limited to only four species, and therefore is unlikely to significantly supplement the species diversity of the revegetation.

Previously, we developed pcDNA-CCOL2A1, a novel therapeutic DNA vaccine, which encodes the full-length chicken type II collagen sequence, and demonstrated that the efficacy of this vaccine for treating rheumatoid arthritis was comparable to that of the current "gold standard" treatment, methotrexate. In this study, we investigated the genetic stability of a strain engineered to produce the vaccine during continuous passage and long-term storage at different temperatures. By screening a panel of 12 strains, we identified a DH5 alpha strain that exhibited high levels (12.30 +/- 0.05 mgL(-1)) of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 production after 15 h cultivation, and subsequently utilized this strain to establish a three-tier cells bank for future studies. Continuous passage of this strain for 100 inoculation times demonstrated that a higher percentage (>95%) of cells maintained the plasmid when cultivated under selective pressure (ampicillin) than under nonselective conditions, suggesting that the presence of antibiotics in the medium prevents the loss of the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 plasmid. Meanwhile, restriction digestion and gene sequencing analyses demonstrated that the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 vector remained stable, and that the plasmid sequence was conserved during this period. Lastly, the DH5a pcDNA-CCOL2A1 strain exhibited a high plasmid preservation (>90%) and high levels of plasmid production (9.05mg L-1) after storage for 60 months at -80 degrees C. Furthermore the plasmid extracted from the DH5 alpha pcDNA-CCOL2A1 strain after storage for 60 months at -80 degrees C was transfected to COS-7 cells, it can stably express the target protein chicken type II collagen. Conversely, this strain exhibited a complete loss of capability after 24 and 18 months storage at -20 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively. These findings will facilitate further pilot-scale testing, and even industrial-scale production, of the novel therapeutic vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the south Gondar region of Ethiopia, most of the remaining native forests are tiny fragments (5.42 ha +/- 0.34) surrounded by pasture and agriculture that are protected because they encompass churches of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church (EOTC). A small number of communities have erected stone walls around the perimeter of the forests to demarcate the boundary, and/or protect the interior of the forest. We evaluated the effectiveness of these walls at protecting ecological conditions by examining tree and seedling communities among sacred forests with and without walls in Montane and Upper Montane sites. We found the wall to be an effective conservation tool as regeneration potential was higher in forests with a wall. The density and species richness of seedlings were significantly higher in forests with a wall and these effects were more pronounced in Upper Montane forests. Forests with a wall also had seedlings of many native tree species that were not found in forests without walls. As expected, there were few differences in tree communities in forests with and without a wall. Although rare on the landscape, the presence of a stone wall around these forests was effective at protecting the seedling community because it likely reduced access to the forests by grazers and directed human visitors to trails. The use of a stone wall may protect seedling communities in other sacred forest fragments, particularly for those that are small, isolated, surrounded by agriculture, and have a depleted seed bank.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				JAN	2017	26	1					209	221		10.1007/s10531-016-1239-y							WOS:000392186600012

The Sage-Grouse Habitat Mortgage: Effective Conifer Management in Space and Time	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Management of conservation-reliant species can be complicated by the need to manage ecosystem processes that operate at extended temporal horizons. One such process is the role of fire in regulating abundance of expanding conifers that disrupt sage-grouse habitat in the northern Great Basin of the United States. Removing conifers by cutting has a beneficial effect on sage-grouse habitat. However, effects may last only a few decades because conifer seedlings are not controlled and the seed bank is fully stocked. Fire treatment may be preferred because conifer control lasts longer than for mechanical treatments. The amount of conservation needed to control conifers at large temporal and spatial scales can be quantified by multiplying land area by the time needed for conifer abundance to progress to critical thresholds (i.e., "conservation volume"). The contribution of different treatments in arresting conifer succession can be calculated by dividing conservation volume by the duration of treatment effect. We estimate that fire has approximately twice the treatment life of cutting at time horizons approaching 100 yr, but, has high up-front conservation costs due to temporary loss of sagebrush. Cutting has less up-front conservation costs because sagebrush is unaffected, but it is more expensive over longer management time horizons because of decreased durability. Managing conifers within sage-grouse habitat is difficult because of the necessity to maintain themajority of the landscape in sagebrush habitat and because the threshold for negative conifer effects occurs fairly early in the successional process. The time needed for recovery of sagebrush creates limits to fire use in managing sage-grouse habitat. Utilizing a combination of fire and cutting treatments is most financially and ecologically sustainable over long time horizons involved in managing conifer-prone sage-grouse habitat.

J	Sumberova, K; Duchacek, M				Sumberova, Katerina; Duchacek, Michal			Analysis of plant soil seed banks and seed dispersal vectors: Its potential and limits for forensic investigations	FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL												Plant seeds exhibit many species-specific traits, thus potentially being especially helpful for forensic investigations. Seeds of a broad range of plant species occur in soil seed banks of various habitats and may become attached in large quantities to moving objects. Although plant seeds are now routinely used as trace evidence in forensic practice, only scant information has been published on this topic in the scientific literature. Thus, the standard methods remain unknown to specialists in such botanical subjects as plant ecology and plant geography. These specialists, if made aware of the forensic uses of seeds, could help in development of new, more sophisticated approaches. We aim to bridge the gap between forensic analysts and botanists. Therefore, we explore the available literature and compare it with our own experiences to reveal both the potential and limits of soil seed bank and seed dispersal analysis in forensic investigations. We demonstrate that habitat-specific and thus relatively rare species are of the greatest forensic value. Overall species composition, in terms of species presence/absence and relative abundance can also provide important information. In particular, the ecological profiles of seeds found on any moving object can help us identify the types of environments through which the object had travelled. We discuss the applicability of this approach to various European environments, with the ability to compare seed samples with georeferenced vegetation databases being particularly promising for forensic investigations. We also explore the forensic limitations of soil seed bank and seed dispersal vector analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regeneration properties of a Populus euphratica riparian forest located in the vicinity of the Ejina Oasis, Inner Mongolia, China	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												To explore the regeneration properties of a Populus euphratica Oliv. forest under unstable environmental conditions, we performed replicate censuses to determine the sapling dynamics of a P. euphratica population in the vicinity of the Ejina Oasis (Inner Mongolia). Even when the stands were established on riverside flatland, we detected slight variations in ground levels and salt concentrations. Due to leaching by flood water, the salinity of topsoil was lower in the riverbed than on the riverbank. Newly recruited saplings grew on riverbanks with high-salinity soil. Saplings were distributed over a wide area via fluctuating water levels, and those growing where salt levels were relatively low were able to grow more easily and become canopy trees. Small individuals comprise a sapling bank on the forest floor that is relatively stable. The dieback of larger saplings results in few reaching a height of more than 2 m. The growth of saplings (including new recruits) is balanced by the death of smaller saplings and the dieback of larger saplings. Individual saplings persist for about 4 years on the forest floor. In summary, hydrological events coupled with soil conditions may drive vegetation distribution patterns in riparian areas in arid regions. P. euphratica forests regenerate via a sapling bank rather than a seed bank. Yearly fluctuations in water flow facilitate the spread of the sapling bank, which guarantees regeneration of the forest. Dieback through partial defoliation is a mechanism used by saplings to escape adverse conditions, thereby maintaining a stable state in arid regions.																	1860-1871	1860-188X				JAN	2017	13	1					71	79		10.1007/s11355-016-0302-x							WOS:000391940700007

Seed storage and asymbiotic germination of Hadrolaelia grandis (Orchidaceae)	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Hadrolaelia grandis is an endangered species of orchid that is experiencing population declines due to habitat destruction and collection for ornamental purposes. Seed storage, in vitro germination and development of seedlings for propagation were investigated. Tetrazolium test (TZ) and asymbiotic germination were used to evaluate seeds stored at -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C for 24, 30, and 36 months. Seeds were germinated on Woody Plant Medium (WPM), Murashige & Skoog (MS), Vacin & Went (VW) and Knudson C (KC) media. The temperature of -80 C was the most effective for seed storage since the percentage of viable seeds (81.86%), as determined by TZ, was higher than those stored at -20 degrees C (64.24%) for 36 months. WPM proved to be the most effective medium for seed germination and seedling development (94.71%, and a germination speed index of 25.33) after 36 months of storage at -80 degrees C. Protocorm elongation and root development were achieved on WPM medium containing activated charcoal (1 g L-1), and after 16 weeks seedlings were successfully acclimatized after 12 weeks (91.07% survival rate) using vermiculite as a substrate.

The nightshift: Seed dispersal and consumption differences by rodents before and after dark	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed burial by dispersal vectors in fire-prone ecosystems is thought to increase seed survival rates by protecting them from fire and other seed consumers. In the fire-prone fynbos, seed burial is usually performed by ants. Historically, rodents in the fynbos were viewed purely as seed consumers; however, more recent evidence suggests that some species may also disperse seeds. This is done by scatter-hoarding the seeds in caches buried below the soil surface. Since seed dispersal and consumption by rodents usually takes place unobserved, it has been difficult to positively confirm which rodents disperse seeds and which ones only consume them. Here, the dispersal and consumptive behaviour of 2 rodents, Rhabdomys pumilio and Gerbilliscus paeba, are disentangled by using a combination of camera traps and the temporal compartmentalisation of seed fate patterns into day versus night in a depauperate, Cape strandveld rodent community. In this study, it is clearly demonstrated that the nocturnal hairy-footed gerbil (G. paeba) dispersed Willdenowia incurvata (Restionaceae) seeds. Although G. paeba also consumes seeds, they cached more seeds than they consumed during the period of observation. In contrast, the diurnal 4-striped mouse (R. pumilio) consumed but never cached seeds left out during the day. These results demonstrate that ecological roles of Cape rodents vary between species and that rodents in general cannot simply be regarded as seed consumers or dispersers as they have in the past.

Acacia shrubs respond positively to high severity wildfire: Implications for conservation and fuel hazard management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												High severity wildfires pose threats to human assets, but are also perceived to impact vegetation communities because a small number of species may become dominant immediately after fire. However there are considerable gaps in our knowledge about species-specific responses of plants to different fire severities, and how this influences fuel hazard in the short and long-term. Here we conduct a floristic survey at sites before and two years after a wildfire of unprecedented size and severity in the Warrumbungle National Park (Australia) to explore relationships between post-fire growth of a fire responsive shrub genera (Acacia), total mid-story vegetation cover, fire severity and fuel hazard. We then survey 129 plots surrounding the park to assess relationships between mid-story vegetation cover and time-since-fire. Acacia species richness and cover were 2.3 and 4.3 times greater at plots after than before the fire. However the same common dominant species were present throughout the study. Mid-story vegetation cover was 1.5 times greater after than before the wildfire, and Acacia species contribution to mid-story cover increased from 10 to 40%. Acacia species richness was not affected by fire severity, however strong positive associations were observed between Acacia and total mid-story vegetation cover and severity. Our analysis of mid-story vegetation recovery showed that cover was similarly high between 2 and 30 years post-fire, then decreased until 52 years. Collectively, our results suggest that Acacia species are extremely resilient to high severity wildfire and drive short to mid-term increases in fuel hazard. Our results are discussed in relation to fire regime management from the twin perspectives of conserving biodiversity and mitigating human losses due to wildfire. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Saving rainforests in the South Pacific: challenges in ex situ conservation	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Rainforests in the South Pacific hold a considerable amount of plant diversity, with rates of species endemism >80% in some countries. This diversity is rapidly disappearing under pressure from logging, clearing for agriculture or mining, introduced pests and diseases and other anthropogenic sources. Ex situ conservation techniques offer a means to limit the loss of plant diversity. Seed banking is considered the most efficient and cost effective of these techniques but is applicable only to seed capable of tolerating desiccation and cold storage. Data on the degree of tolerance of these conditions was lacking for more than half of the 1503 South Pacific rainforest genera examined for this review. Of the 710 genera for which data were available, the storage behaviour of 324 was based on an assessment of only one or two species, although 76% of those genera contained at least 10 species. Many of the unstudied or poorly studied genera are shared across several South Pacific nations, providing an excellent opportunity for collaboration on future ex situ research and conservation. Of the 386 genera for which three or more species have been studied, 343 have a very high proportion of species (>95% of those tested) that are suitable for seed banking. Seed banking could therefore provide a suitable means for preserving a large proportion of the rainforest flora before it becomes extinct in the wild. Alternatives for preserving species that are not suitable for seed banking are also discussed.

We discuss the main elements of plant life history that drive the transition between life stages in seed plants (reproduction, dispersal, seed banks, germination, establishment, growth and survival). We illustrate the variety and pattern in life histories for plant species and the vegetation communities they form, along with predictive plant traits that are associated with these patterns. We identify key elements of the capacity for species to either cope with the inherent variability and changes that occur (robustness and resistance) or to recover from adverse impacts (resilience and rehabilitation). We then present some key examples of ecosystems that illustrate the role that understanding of plant life history processes can play in managing vegetation. In particular, we highlight two issues critical in species persistence: the importance of the dispersal capacity of seeds in the ability of species and vegetation communities to track changes in environmental niches over time; and the role of the soil seed bank as a critical buffer to offset adverse above ground impacts.

Seed banks can be incredibly large, often consisting of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of seeds per square meter in a variety of different habitats and communities around the world. These seeds can be short- or long-lived. Seed banks provide a "memory" of prevailing site conditions, as well as climatic and edaphic conditions present many years or decades earlier. Hence, much of the genetic diversity of plant populations is preserved in seed banks. Furthermore, as seeds age in the soil, mutations accumulate and novel variation is introduced into a population. Soil seed banks play a pivotal role in the formation, maintenance, and evolution of plant communities.																			978-1-351-66656-5; 978-1-4987-8699-7				2017							868	870		10.1081/E-ESS3-120001608							WOS:000467370700200

Kuhn IN CAPARAO NATIONAL PARK, MG	REVISTA ARVORE												The goal of this study was to restore an area dominated by P. aquilinum in the National Park of Caparao, by nucleation techniques. In an area covered by P. aquilinum, 60 nuclei or gaps of 2 x 2 m were cleared, i.e., 10 nuclei per treatment. In these open areas, all P. aquilinum cover was removed down to the soil. In the center of each gap was delimited one parcel of 1 x 1 m, in which the treatments were applied: T1 - liming, T2- seed bank and litter transposition, T3- direct-seeding, T4-liming + seed bank and litter transposition, T5-liming + direct-seeding, T6- control. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with 10 replications. In each nucleation plot, after one year, all arbustive-arboreous species were recorded, by measuring plant height and diameter at ground level. The plants were classified according to the succession class and dispersion type. One year after the installation of the nucleation experiment, 331 individuals of 19 species, 12 genera and 10 botanical families were recorded. Pioneer plants were the predominant ecological group, and the prevailing dispersion type was zoochoric. The richest families were Solanaceae and Euphorbiaceae. Solanaceae was represented by the highest number of individuals (56.2%), followed by Fabaceae (10%). The genus Solanum had the highest richness and abundance. The applied nucleation techniques triggered the succession process in the area invaded by P. aquilinum. Treatments with seed banks were the most appropriate to facilitate forest regeneration in this area.																	0100-6762						2017	41	1							UNSP e410104	10.1590/1806-90882017000100004							WOS:000402532600004

Effects of temperature, moisture and soil type on seedling emergence and mortality of riparian plant species	AQUATIC BOTANY												Restoration of riparian plant communities on bare soil requires germination of seeds and establishment of seedlings. However, species that are present in the soil seed bank do not always establish in the vegetation. Temperature, moisture conditions and soil type could play a major role in the establishment of riparian plant communities, through impacting seedling emergence. We studied the effects of temperature, combinations of temperature and moisture conditions, and soil type on seedling emergence and mortality of perennial reeds (Typha latifolia and Phragmites australis) and annual or biannual pioneer species (Senecio congestus, Rumex maritimus and Chenopodium rubrum). The responses to the environmental conditions were species-specific and resulted in context-dependent differences in proportions of species emerging from the soil seed bank. Typha latifolia and S. congestus preferred wet or very wet conditions, C. rubrum and R. maritimus preferred dry to very dry conditions. Phragmites australis was able to establish under all conditions. Both cold and very dry conditions resulted in low emergence and survival, which was not fully compensated for when conditions became favorable again. Senecio congestus, R. maritimus and C. rubrum benefitted from secondary seedling emergence when, after a very dry period, the weather became very wet again, while T. latifolia and P. australis remained absent. When the conditions remained wet, more seedlings emerged from sand than from clay. However, when the soil was drying out, fewer seedlings emerged from sand than from clay. We propose that using information on plant species-specific responses to abiotic environmental conditions during germination, emergence and establishment can help to restore different target riparian plant communities.

However, because there is no economically feasible system for large-scale industrial production, its application is limited. In order to develop a low-input system, CP-synthesis was established in the two commercial Nicotiana tabacum (N. tabacum) cultivars 'Badischer Geudertheimer' (BG) and 'Virginia Golta' (VG), by introducing the cyanophycin-synthetase gene from Thermosynecchococcus elongatus BP-1 (CphA(Te)) either via crossbreeding with transgenic N. tabacum cv. Petit Havana SR1 (PH) T2 individual 51-3-2 or by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Both in F1 hybrids (max. 9.4% CP/DW) and T0 transformants (max. 8.8% CP/DW), a substantial increase in CP content was achieved in leaf tissue, compared to a maximum of 1.7% CP/DW in PH T0 transformants of Huhns et al. (2008). In BG CP, yields were homogenous and there was no substantial difference in the variation of the CP content between primary transformants (T0), clones of T0 individuals, T1 siblings and F1 siblings of hybrids. Therefore, BG meets the requirements for establishing a master seed bank for continuous and reliable CP-production. In addition, it was shown that the polymer is not only stable in planta but also during silage, which simplifies storage of the harvest prior to isolation of CP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing the effects of hybridization and precipitation on invasive weed demography using strength of selection on vital rates	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: As global climate change transforms average temperature and rainfall, species distributions may meet, increasing the potential for hybridization and altering individual fitness and population growth. Altered rainfall specifically may shift the strength and direction of selection, also manipulating population trajectories. Here, we investigated the role of interspecific hybridization and selection imposed by rainfall on the evolution of weedy life-history in non-hybrid (Raphanus raphanistrum) and hybrid (R. raphanistrum x R. sativus) populations using a life table response experiment. Results: In documenting long-term population dynamics, we determined intrinsic (r) and asymptotic (lambda) population growth rates and sensitivities, a measure of selection imposed on demographic rates. Hybrid populations experienced 8.7-10.3 times stronger selection than wild populations for increased seedling survival. Whereas crop populations generally exhibit little dormancy and wild populations often exhibit dormancy, non-hybrid populations experienced 10% stronger selection than hybrid populations for exhibiting seed dormancy. Selection on survival-toflowering in wild, not hybrid, populations declined marginally with increasing soil moisture. Hybrid populations exhibited greater r, but not., than wild populations regardless of moisture environment. In general, fecundity contributed most to differences in. but fecundity only contributed positively to hybrid. relative to wild. when precipitation was altered (either higher or lower than control) and not under control watering conditions. Conclusions: Selection on key demographic traits may not change dramatically in response to rainfall, and hybridization may more strongly influence the demography of these weedy species than rainfall. If hybrid populations can respond to selection for increased dormancy, this may make it more difficult to deplete weed seed banks and increase the persistence of crop genes in weed populations.																	1471-2148					DEC 7	2016	16								266	10.1186/s12862-016-0833-7							WOS:000389418800001	27923349

Herein, we studied Tephroseris longifolia subsp. moravica in five of nine existing population sites to determine its spatio-temporal regeneration patterns. Our main aims were: (i) to confirm the existence of a soil seed bank and to determine its type and density, (ii) to assess the rate of natural seedling recruitment and the factors affecting seed germination and seedling survival, and (iii) to assess the potential of artificial disturbance regimes to enhance natural seedling recruitment. We used a series of experiments based on long-term seed burial, seedling emergence, germination and seedling establishment in permanent plots and artificial disturbance regimes. We found that this taxon forms a short-lived persistent seed bank and its seed germinability decreases over time. The average germination in situ was 3.8 %. While the moss and herb layer cover supported seedling survival, tree-litter cover negatively affected in situ germination. Turf removal had the strongest positive effect on germination percentage in our three tested in situ treatments, followed by litter removal and no management procedures. Seedling mortality was very high (60-100 % of seedlings died), with no difference determined between the treatments. Our results suggest that seedling recruitment from seed banks and artificial disturbance regimes might be an extremely beneficial conservation protocol to enhance small populations of this critically endangered taxon.

Sediment Accumulation in Prairie Wetlands under a Changing Climate: the Relative Roles of Landscape and Precipitation	WETLANDS												Sediment accumulation threatens the viability and hydrologic functioning of many naturally formed depressional wetlands across the interior regions of North America. These wetlands provide many ecosystem services and vital habitats for diverse plant and animal communities. Climate change may further impact sediment accumulation rates in the context of current land use patterns. We estimated sediment accretion in wetlands within a region renowned for its large populations of breeding waterfowl and migrant shorebirds and examined the relative roles of precipitation and land use context in the sedimentation process. We modeled rates of sediment accumulation from 1971 through 2100 using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a sediment delivery ratio and the Unit Stream Power Erosion Deposition model (USPED). These models predicted that by 2100, 21-33 % of wetlands filled completely with sediment and 27-46 % filled by half with sediments; estimates are consistent with measured sediment accumulation rates in the region reported by empirical studies. Sediment accumulation rates were strongly influenced by size of the catchment, greater coverage of tilled landscape within the catchment, and steeper slopes. Conservation efforts that incorporate the relative risk of infilling of wetlands with sediments, thus emphasizing areas of high topographic relief and large watersheds, may benefit wetland-dependent biota.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2016	36			2			S383	S395		10.1007/s13157-016-0748-5							WOS:000394134100013

Studies were conducted for two consecutive years (2012 & 2013). Mostly annual species were observed to be growing on the study site which exhibited persistent nature of seed bank and few perennial species were also collected. Existing vegetation was well represented in the seed bank samples in both years however; the seed bank species in 2013 were not well represented in the above ground vegetation which was related to increased site disturbance. Seed densities for most species were highest before rainfall with a gradual decrease after rainfall. The onset of dispersal caused significant increase in seed densities in the third collection i.e., in soil samples collected after seed rain. Enhanced surface disturbance in the year 2013 caused a decline in overall seed count.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				DEC	2016	48	6					2277	2280									WOS:000394176900014						
J	Clause, J; Barot, S; Forey, E				Clause, Julia; Barot, Sebastien; Forey, Estelle			Earthworms promote greater richness and abundance in the emergence of plant species across a grassland-forest ecotone	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Chalk grasslands are subject to vegetation dynamics that range from species-rich open grasslands to tall and encroached grasslands, and woods and forests. In grasslands, earthworms impact plant communities and ecosystem functioning through the modification of soil physical, chemical and microbiological properties, but also through their selective ingestion and vertical transportation of seeds from the soil seed bank. Laboratory experiments showed that seed-earthworm interactions are species specific, but little is known on the impact of seed-earthworm interactions in the field. The overall aim of this study was to better understand seed-earthworm interactions and their impact on the plant community. First we analyzed the composition of seedlings emerging from casts after earthworm ingestion. Then we compared seedling composition in casts to the plant composition of emerging seedlings from the soil and of the aboveground vegetation along four stages of the secondary succession of chalk grasslands. Methods Four stages of the secondary succession of a chalk grassland-from open sward to woods-were sampled in Upper Normandy, France, in February 2010. Within each successional stage (x3 replicates), we sampled the standing vegetation, soil seed bank at three soil depths (0-2, 2-5 and 5-10 cm) and earthworm surface casts along transects. Soil and cast samples were water sieved before samples were spread onto trays and placed into a greenhouse. Emerging seedlings were counted and identified. Effect of successional stage and origin of samples on mean and variability of abundance and species richness of seedlings emerging from casts and soil seed banks were analyzed. Plant compositions were compared between all sample types. We used generalized mixed-effect models and a distance-based redundancy multivariate analysis. Important Findings Seedling abundance was always higher in earthworm casts than in the soil seed bank and increased up to 5-fold, 4-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, in the tall grassland, woods and encroached grassland compared to the soil surface layer. Species richness was also higher in earthworm casts than in the soil seed bank in all successional stages, with a 4-fold increase in the encroached grassland. The plant composition of the standing vegetation was more similar to that of seedlings from casts than to that of seedlings from the soil seed bank. Seedlings diversity emerging from casts in the tall and encroached grasslands tended toward the diversity found in woods. Our results indicate that earthworms may promote the emergence of seedlings. We also suggest that the loss of some plant species in the seed bank and the tall grass vegetation in intermediary successional stages modify the local conditions and prevent the further establishment of early-successional plant species.				barot, sebastien/A-8447-2012	barot, sebastien/0000-0002-5910-538X; Clause, Julia/0000-0003-1498-7478												1752-9921	1752-993X				DEC	2016	9	6					703	711		10.1093/jpe/rtw008							WOS:000393036400005

A better understanding of the timing of seedling emergence would facilitate the development of better control strategies for this weed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of different factors on muskweed seed germination. Only 2.8% of the seeds of this species, which are encapsulated in siliques, germinated by, while the seeds that had been removed from the siliques had a 50% germination rate. The immersion of muskweed fruits in concentrated sulfuric acid for 110 min was the best treatment for promoting germination. Gibberellic acid stimulated the germination of the naked seeds by 29.1%, potassium nitrate (40 mmol L-1) increased the germination rate to 71%, while higher concentrations of potassium nitrate inhibited germination. The optimum germination temperature for the naked seeds was 20/10 degrees C (day/night) and light was not required for germination. No seedling emerged when the seeds were buried 6 cm deep. The seeds were sensitive to both osmotic and salinity stress, but they germinated to 46-49% over a pH range of 4-10. The results of this study revealed that the seeds of M. perfoliatum have physiological dormancy and that it is slowly broken via after-ripening. However, the fruit wall can prevent germination after physiological dormancy is broken. Thus, this species has the potential to form a persistent seed bank because of the presence of the fruit wall.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				DEC	2016	16	4					186	193		10.1111/wbm.12110							WOS:000393324600005

Using 16S pyrosequencing, we investigated how the coastal bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) respond to a phytoplankton bloom in the Xiangshan Bay, East China Sea. The results showed that BCCs were significantly different among the pre-bloom, bloom, and after-bloom stages, with the lowest bacterial diversity at the bloom phase. The BCCs at the short-term after-bloom phase showed a rapid but incomplete recovery to the pre-bloom phase, evidenced by 69.8% similarity between pre-bloom and after-bloom communities. This recovery was parallel with the dynamics of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, whose abundance enriched when bloom occur, and decreased after-bloom, and vice versa. Collectively, the results showed that the BCCs were sensitive to algal-induced disturbances, but could recover to a certain extent after bloom. In addition, OTUs which enriched or decreased during this process are closely associated with this temporal pattern, thus holding the potential to evaluate and indicate the succession stage of phytoplankton bloom.

Research on the Gasbreen foreland (S Spitsbergen) traced the succession of particular groups of organisms and species, particularly lichens and bryophytes, and determined the effect of selected abiotic factors on this succession. Fieldwork in 2008, employed a continuous linear transect of phytosociological releves (1 m(2)) along the foreland. Data analysis allowed to distinguish five different succession stages and three types of colonisers. Canonical correspondence analysis and a permutation test showed that distance from the front of the glacier and fine grain material in the substrate mostly influenced the distribution and abundance of vegetation, and the steepness of the moraine hills affected the colonisation process, mainly in the older part of the marginal zone.				; Wietrzyk-Pelka, Paulina/M-9724-2015	Wegrzyn, Michal/0000-0001-7638-4803; Wietrzyk-Pelka, Paulina/0000-0002-1324-2012												0138-0338	2081-8262				DEC	2016	37	4					493	509		10.1515/popore-2016-0026							WOS:000390412400004

Depending on the degree of flooding, different proportions of wetland and arable species contribute to the seed bank. This is reflected by high inter-annual variations in plant communities with a high conservation value. Due to ongoing agricultural intensification, the biodiversity of temporarily flooded depressions has declined, and several plant species have become regionally extinct. Because seed banks harbour persistent seeds over long periods, they play a crucial role in the conservation and restoration of temporary wetland vegetation. This study focuses on the effects of different flooding regimes on plant species emerging from seed banks of temporarily flooded depressions in arable fields in northeast Germany. We cultivated soil samples from upper and lower wetland zones under short, intermediate and long-term flooding (5, 15 and 40 cm above soil surface) in a common garden experiment over 2 years. We observed significant changes in species composition depending on the flooding duration. Species richness declined and evenness increased with increasing flooding duration. Upper and lower zones showed similar species richness and evenness, but species compositions differed. Red List species emerged from all treatments although the species differed, indicating that all communities emerging under different flooding regimes have a high conservation value. Seed banks under fluctuating site conditions can constitute a series of alternating plant communities. This could be used to develop management strategies that benefit different communities with high conservation values.

J	Pastore, AI; Scherer, BP				Pastore, Abigail I.; Scherer, Brendan P.			Changes in community phylogenetic structure in a North American forest chronosequence	ECOSPHERE												Several studies of succession in tropical and subtropical climates include phylogenetic analyses of the plant communities; the majority of these studies find a shift from more closely related to less closely related assemblages over succession. It has been suggested that this pattern indicates a shift from abiotic to biotic filters structuring communities over time, but there is considerable debate surrounding this interpretation. Conducting analyses for multiple components of plant assemblages can provide insight into the processes structuring communities. Here, we present community phylogenetic analyses of a deciduous forest chronosequence for three community components: standing vegetation, seed bank, and vegetation regenerated after small-scale disturbance. We constructed a phylogeny from 228 taxa present in the community data of a chronosequence obtained from previously published research. In the standing vegetation, we found a shift from more closely related to less closely related vegetation over the chronosequence. These results are consistent with other studies of chronosequences in tropical forests, lending support to the ubiquity of such shifts in relatedness over succession under different climatic conditions. However, the seed bank and vegetation regenerated after small-scale disturbance showed no consistent pattern with stand age, suggesting recruits are experiencing different forces than surrounding vegetation. These phylogenetic analyses of seed banks and vegetation regenerated after small-scale disturbance over a chronosequence provide additional evidence into the mechanisms driving forest succession.																	2150-8925					DEC	2016	7	12							UNSP e01592	10.1002/ecs2.1592							WOS:000390136700017

Geoff			Comparison of Spatial Distribution Patterns of Seed Rain between Larch Plantations and Adjacent Secondary Forests in Northeast China	FOREST SCIENCE												The conversion of pure larch plantations into mixed larch-broadleaf forests by promoting the natural regeneration of native broadleaved tree species of secondary forests in larch plantations is a basic strategy in Northeast China. This strategy can solve the problems existing in the larch plantations, such as mono-species composition, decreased soil fertility, and unsustainable productivity. Seed production and dispersal, the beginning of a natural regeneration process that links the end of the reproductive cycle of adult plants and their subsequent life cycle stages, are crucial to successful regeneration. The first objective of this study was to determine the spatial patterns of seed rain for broadleaved tree species produced by the common spatial distribution types of larch plantations at an independent hillside: the contour type (secondary forests and larch plantations are located at the same slope position and aspect) and the downslope type (larch plantations are located at the downslope of the adjacent secondary forests at the same aspect). The second objective was to determine the contributions of seed rain to the soil seed bank for the two common types of seed dispersal (wind- and gravity-dispersed species). We found that the seed densities of these two dispersal types tended to decrease along the gradient from secondary forests to boundary and to larch plantations of the contour type of stands. The seed density of the wind-dispersed species in the downslope type of stands was significantly higher than that in the contour type of stands, particularly in the larch plantation portion of a stand. The similarity in species composition between the seed rain and the seed bank in the downslope type of stands (0.36 +/- 0.06) was significantly higher than that in the contour type of stands (0.14 +/- 0.04). The contribution of the seed rain to the seed bank of the wind dispersed species (13.0-18.6%) was considerably greater than that of the gravity-dispersed species (1.4-1.8%). Our results indicated that the relationships between the seed rain and the seed bank were significantly influenced by both the spatial distribution types of larch plantations and the dispersal types of species. The natural regeneration potential of wind -dispersed species may be more critical in converting larch plantations into mixed forests in the downslope type of stands.																	0015-749X	1938-3738				DEC	2016	62	6					652	662		10.5849/forsci.15-048							WOS:000390180900008						
J	Eager, EA; Rebarber, R				Eager, Eric Alan; Rebarber, Richard			Sensitivity and elasticity analysis of a Lur'e system used to model a population subject to density-dependent reproduction	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES												Sensitivity and elasticity analyzes have become central to the analysis of models in population biology and ecology. While much work has been done applying sensitivity and elasticity analysis to study density independent (linear) matrix and integral projection models, little work has been done to study the sensitivity and elasticity of density-dependent models, especially integral projection models. In this paper we derive sensitivity and elasticity formulas for the equilibrium population n* of a structured population modeled by a Lur'e system, which consists of a linear system plus a nonlinearity modeling density dependent fecundity. Sensitivity and elasticity formulas are easy to interpret ecologically, and we apply these formulas to published models for Chinook Salmon and Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens). In the C. canescens example we show that models with identical equilibrium populations can have sensitivities that are an order-of-magnitude apart, depending on the functional form for the nonlinearity.
