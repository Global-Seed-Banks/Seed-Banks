Intercrop effects on weed community structure have rarely been studied. A 6-yr study was initiated in 1999 and the response of aboveground weed flora (1999-2002 and 2005) and seed bank (2005) to the intercropping of saffron and black zira, two perennial crops was investigated. Mixtures consisted of 0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, and 100/0 saffron/black zira ratios, each planted at three densities: 30, 50, and 70 plant m(-2). The effect of planting density on weed populations was variable and in most cases not significant. However, mixture ratios caused drastic species compositional changes in the weed community for which univariate and multivariate analyses explored four major associations: (1) weeds that favored a higher ratio of saffron in mixtures (e.g., grasses, field bindweed, pigweeds), (2) weeds that preferred a higher ratio of black zira in mixtures (e.g., Persian speedwell, Brassicaceae complex, Polygoaceae complex, and carthsmoke), (3) weeds that were more abundant in 50/50 mixtures (e.g., Caryophyllaceae complex), and (4) weeds that showed no specific pattern (e.g., common lambsquarterss). Pigweeds, prostrate knotweed, and common lambsquarters dominated the viable seed bank with relative densities of 48, 28, and 8%, respectively. The seed bank of most weed species responded to mixture ratios in a similar manner to those of their corresponding aboveground flora. Seed density decreased as soil depth increased, leading to the accumulation of 66, 22, and 12% of viable seeds in soil layers of 0-5, 5-15 and 15-25 cm, respectively. Greater weed and seed densities were found in more pure stands of black zira. These findings contribute to improving current understanding of crop-weed community structures and may help in developing weed management practices.

Hakea sericea: Development of a model of the impacts of biological control on population dynamics and rates of spread of an invasive species	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This paper reports on the development and testing of a simulation model to assess the impacts of two seed-feeding biological control agents on the dispersal of an invasive perennial tree, Hakea sericea (Proteaceae), which was introduced into South Africa from Australia during the 1850s. The agents are known to reduce seed banks at the individual plant level but the population-level effects are not well understood. The aim of the study was to estimate the extent to which the biological control has reduced the population growth and rate of spread of this species. H. sericea is a serotinous species which releases its wind-dispersed seeds en masse when the parent plants are killed, usually by fire. Field data were used to develop functions describing the fecundity of the plants and the impacts of the biological control agents as well as seedling recruitment rates and density dependent mortality. A group of 'experts' provided estimates of the cumulative proportion of seeds that would disperse over distances from SO to 1000 m following a fire. The estimates were used to fit various long-range dispersal functions. The Weibull distribution gave the overall best fit and was used to generate parameter sets from each expert's estimates of dispersal. Simulations were then run using a reasonable range of fire intervals and dispersal parameters for the two experts whose estimates represented the minimum and maximum dispersal distances. Biological control agents have reduced the seed loads on H. sericea plants by more than 95%. This, in turn, reduced population growth rates, maximum seed dispersal distances and the formation of new invasion foci. Population growth rates and spread rates were positively correlated because greater dispersal distances resulted in lower densities and, thus, lower levels of density dependent mortality. Numerous previous studies have found that biological control can limit population growth rates of invasive plants, but this is one of the few to have estimated the impacts on the invasion rates and to use an individual-based modelling approach to estimate population-level effects.

Post-hurricane vegetation recovery in an urban forest	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban forests are increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic disturbance, and their isolation and human use may challenge the ability of vegetation to recover spontaneously. We examined vegetation responses to recent hurricane disturbance in a temperate mixedwood urban forest: Point Pleasant Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which suffered over 70% canopy loss during Hurricane Juan in fall 2003. In 2005 we surveyed 30 paired plots with disturbed and intact tree canopies to assess early regeneration patterns and seed banks. Native early successional tree species dominated seed bank and seedling layers. Soil properties were similar between intact and disturbed urban plots and local reference forests, thus long-term woody debris removal, hurricane disturbance and subsequent clean-up activities have not caused substantial soil degradation. Non-native species were not abundant throughout the park but were concentrated at the park boundary adjacent to residential neighbourhoods. The results of this study suggest that urban forests can show natural successional trajectories after catastrophic disturbance, and management is probably not necessary for forest recovery in Point Pleasant Park. Conversely, intervention to speed up regeneration of shade-tolerant canopy species may be desired by local citizens, so managers will have to balance conflicting values in developing a restoration plan for the park.

J	Zhou, YB; Zhang, L; Kaneko, Y; Newman, C; Wang, XM				Zhou, You-Bing; Zhang, Liang; Kaneko, Yayoi; Newman, Chris; Wang, Xiao-Ming			Frugivory and seed dispersal by a small carnivore, the Chinese ferret-badger, Melogale moschata, in a fragmented subtropical forest of central China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The capacity for the Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata), a small carnivorous mustelid mammal, as a frugivore and endozoochorous seed disperser was evaluated over the main fruiting period during 2 years of study in a fragmented subtropical forest of central China. Seeds of eight plant species were dispersed by M. moschata, based on the analysis of the 163 faecal samples. Three forest types were sampled; one subject to commercial clear-cut logging, the second a selectively logged site and the third a natural primary forest habitat. The proportion of seed-bearing faecal samples was greatest amongst those collected from the primary forest, with the selectively logged and clear-cut habitats having a lower frequency of seed-bearing faeces, respectively. Ferret-badgers mainly defecated in open habitats, however the proportion of seed-bearing faeces did not differ according to the type of cover present at the deposition sites. Ferret-badgers selected fleshy-fruited and seed-pulp rich species. Significantly, selection was found for the large-seeded species, Diospyros lotus, however, they chose to consume the smaller seeds from this plant. Seed passage time through the gut ranged between 0.8 and 5.9 h. No significant individual-specific differences were detected in the passage time for the different fleshy fruits. Five out of six dominant species had seeds germinate successfully from faecal samples. Only the germination of D. lotus seeds were lower than expected by comparison to the control seeds. By contrast, ingested seeds of Hovenia dulcis had higher germination rates than in control samples, but no statistical differences were detected. These findings indicated that ferret-badgers were legitimate (they defecated viable seeds), but inefficient dispersers (seeds in faeces were mainly deposited on open sites which were regarded as "unsafe microsites" for seed germination and seedling establishment). In order to fully understand the role of M. moschata in forest recruitment and regeneration, quantitative research on their efficiency as endozoochorous seed dispersers and the effects of their digging activities on the seed bank and seedling survival should be undertaken, focusing on sites degraded by forestry operations, especially in badly affected sites.

J	Cirujeda, A; Recasens, J; Torra, J; Taberner, A				Cirujeda, Alicia; Recasens, Jordi; Torra, Joel; Taberner, Andreu			A germination study of herbicide-resistant field poppies in Spain	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Field poppy, Papaver rhoeas L., is a very common weed in winter cereals in North-Eastern Spain. Its control is becoming difficult due to expanding herbicide resistance. To control field poppies there are alternative strategies such as non-chemical control that take into account the weed emergence period. However, there is a lack of knowledge of P. rhoeas emergence patterns in semi-arid conditions. Thus, here we conducted pot experiments on the emergence of P. rhoeas. We aimed to describe the emergence period and to quantify the emergence of a susceptible and of a herbicide-resistant P. rhoeas population at two locations in Catalonia, Spain, from 1998 to 2001 and until 2004 at one of them. Therefore, pots containing seeds of both populations were established at the two locations and emergence was recorded monthly. We studied the origin of the population, the sowing location, the effect of cultivation and the sowing year. First, we found that the main emergence peaks in our experiments occurred in autumn, accounting for between 65.7 and 98.5% of the annual emergence from October to December, and only little emergence was recorded in spring. This emergence pattern is different from those found in the literature corresponding to Northern European countries, where in some cases main flushes occur only in autumn, in spring and winter or only in spring. The emergence was mainly affected by cultivation, but the effect of light stimulus was observed several months later. As a consequence, cultivation should be done in early autumn, promoting emergence during the whole autumn and winter so that emerged seedlings can be controlled before sowing a spring crop. Second, most experiments showed that the emergence was significantly higher in the first autumn than in the following seasons, e. g. 4.1% emergence in the first year and only 2.1, 2.3, 0.5 and 0.6% new emergence at one of the locations for the second, third, fourth and fifth years. Thus, after having a severe P. rhoeas infestation causing a big seed rain, emergence should be stimulated by autumn cultivation in the following season and seedlings controlled by trying to deplete the soil seed bank as much as possible. Despite the fact that emergence will be staggered throughout several years and that there was a significant relationship between rainfall and emergence, so that dry years will cause a smaller emergence rate of the weed, these findings define a cultural management strategy to reduce P. rhoeas infestations and to contribute to integrated weed management strategies combining it with other tools.

Gopher mounds may provide safe sites for less competitive species, potentially increasing both species diversity and vegetation heterogeneity (spatial variation in species composition). We compared species composition, diversity and heterogeneity among gopher mounds of different ages in three montane meadows in the Cascade Range of Oregon. Cover of graminoids and forbs increased with mound age, as did species richness. Contrary to many studies, we found no evidence that mounds provided safe sites for early successional species, despite their abundance in the soil seed bank, or that diversity peaked on intermediate-aged mounds. However, cover of forbs relative to that of graminoids was greater on mounds than in the adjacent meadow. Variation in species composition was also greater within and among mounds than in adjacent patches of undisturbed vegetation, suggesting that these small-scale disturbances increase heterogeneity within meadows.

Initial invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) into burned pinon-juniper woodlands in western Colorado	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												We studied initial invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) into burned pinon-juniper woodlands to determine: (1) if particular features enhance invasion and (2) if particular grasses promote or retard invasion. We compared cheatgrass cover among roads, burn edges, seeded interiors, unseeded interiors and unburned woodlands and quantified grasses present or absent near cheatgrass. Invasion was favored by burn edges, roads and seeded interiors, but not unseeded interiors. Odds of finding cheatgrass were seven times higher near prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), but six times lower near James' galleta (Hilaria jamesii) and two times lower near intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium). Invasion may be favored: (1) in burn edges because of higher seed-bank survival, (2) along roads because of moisture, disturbance and dispersal and (3) in seeded interiors because of seed-mix contamination or seeded species that enhance invasion.

Location: Central coast of California, USA. Methods: N. pulchra was sown from seeds and transplanted into a degraded grassland in a multi-factorial experiment testing the effects of (1) two grazing intensities (lightly grazed by native mammal species or ungrazed); (2) topsoil removal and (3) reduction of plant neighbours. The experiment was carried out on two types of surrounding vegetation (exotic annual grasses and exotic forbs). Results: Topsoil removal greatly enhanced establishment from seeds and transplant survival, mainly because it reduced the exotic vegetation and thus reduced competition. While removing neighbours was essential when topsoil was left intact, it had a negative effect on N. pulchra when surrounding species included exotic forbs (Brassica spec. and Asteraceae) at low density (after topsoil removal). Moderate grazing by native mammals (deer, rabbits and gophers) did not affect N. pulchra. Conclusion: Our results suggest that seeding after topsoil has been removed is a promising method to reintroduce N. pulchra to highly degraded sites where there is little to no native seed bank.

J	Rosef, L				Rosef, Line			Germinable soil seed banks in abandoned grasslands in central and western Norway and their significance for restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Could the seed bank increase biodiversity during restoration of abandoned, species-poor, formerly cultivated vegetation? Is it possible to identify how climate, soil and former and present management and vegetation affected the seed bank? Location: The study sites were eight abandoned grasslands, four in Orkdal, central Norway and four in Gaular, western Norway. Methods: 144 seed bank samples were collected from three depths. Each sample was sown and placed in a greenhouse. After three months, the trays were dried and stored at 4 C in a dry place for two months. This was repeated twice. Results: There was a separation of the two regions along the first DCA axis in both the seed bank and in the vegetation analysis and also a clear separation of the seed bank from the vegetation along the second axis. These results are caused by differences in former management as well as temperature, precipitation and soil type between Gaular and Orkdal. We found more annuals, short-lived species and species demanding light open conditions in the seed bank than in the vegetation probably because these species have the capacity for producing persistent seeds. Most of the species found only in the seed bank were found in very few samples and with few individuals. Conclusion: These results suggest that it may be difficult to increase vegetation biodiversity through restoration of grasslands such as those investigated if the natural soil seed bank is the main seed source.																	1402-2001					APR	2008	11	2					223	U34		10.3170/2008-7-18361							WOS:000255229600009

How does the relationship between seed bank and vegetation change? What are the implications for seed bank dynamics? Location: An ancient Quercus petraea - Carpinus betulus forest in conversion from coppice-with-standards to regular Quercus high forest near Montargis, France. Methods: Seed bank and vegetation were sampled in six replicated stand types, forming a chronosequence along the conversion pathway. The stand types represented mid-successional stages of stands in transition from coppice-with-standards (to high forest (16 plots) and early-and mid-successional high forest stands (32 plots). Results: Seed bank density and species richness decreased with time since last disturbance. Adjusting for seed density effects obscured species richness differences between stand types, but species of later seres were nested subsets of earlier seres, implying concomitant shifts in species richness and composition with time since disturbance. Later seres were characterized by species with low seed weight and high seed longevity. Seed banks of early seres were more similar to vegetation than to later seres. Conclusions: Abandonment of the coppice-with-standards regime altered the seed bank characteristics, as well as its relationship with vegetation. Longer management cycles under high forest yield impoverished seed banks. For their persistence, seed bank species will increasingly rely on management of permanently open areas in the forest landscape. Thus, revegetation at the beginning of new high-forest cycles may increasingly depend on inflow from seed sources.

Selection of foraging sites by desert granivorous birds: Vegetation structure, seed availability, species-specific foraging tactics, and spatial scale	AUK												Seed availability in the algarrobal of the Monte desert, Argentina, as in other deserts, is highly heterogeneous at small scales and is associated with vegetation structure. Granivores are expected to use space selectively (within the capacities of their foraging techniques), resulting in a heterogeneous effect on the seed bank. First, we describe the foraging repertoire of granivorous birds in the algarrobal to develop predictions about their expected use of space. Although the granivory guild as a whole tracked the temporal availability of seeds, species within the guild differed in foraging behavior and seasonal changes. We assessed selection of space by foraging birds through a two-scale bird-centered analysis, comparing the distributions of used and available sites. Granivorous birds, considered as a guild, used the whole range of available microsites, though as a result of an aggregation of contrasting partial patterns. Microsites with more cover of shrubs, grasses, and litter were preferred for predispersal consumption, which is consistent with the frequent technique of attacking grasses from low woody perches. By contrast, use of microsites for postdispersal consumption did not differ from random, which suggests that there are no safe microsites for seeds in this habitat. At a larger scale not particularly related to heterogeneity in food availability, a selective pattern was clearer: birds avoided mesosites with low shrub and litter cover, far from trees. In conclusion, patterns are not straightforward and depend on considerations of spatiotemporal scale and species-specific characteristics. Even when predictions seemed clear-cut and were tested with proper scale and target-group, granivorous birds did not select space according to environmental clues of food abundance.																	0004-8038	1938-4254				APR	2008	125	2					473	484		10.1525/auk.2008.07085							WOS:000257193800026

Fire season effects on the recruitment of non-sprouting serotinous Proteaceae in the eastern (bimodal rainfall) fynbos biome, South Africa	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Research in Mediterranean-climate shrublands in both South Africa and Australia shows that recruitment of proteoid shrubs (non-sprouting, serotinous Proteaceae) is best after warm-season (summer and autumn) fires and worst after cool-season (winter and spring) ones. This pattern has been attributed to post-dispersal seed attrition as well as size of pre-dispersal seed reserves. Here we investigate patterns of post-fire recruitment for four proteoid species in the eastern part of South Africa's fynbos biome, which has a bimodal (spring and autumn) rainfall regime. Despite the lack of significant differences in recruitment between cool- and warm-season burns, we find some evidence for favourable recruitment periods following fires in spring and autumn, immediately before, and coinciding with, the bimodal rainfall peaks. This suggests that enhanced recruitment is associated with conditions of high soil moisture immediately after the fire, and that rapid germination may minimize post-dispersal seed attrition. In two of the species, we also find a shift from peak flowering in winter and spring in the Mediterranean-climate part of the fynbos biome, to summer and autumn flowering in the eastern part. Because these two species are only weakly serotinous, warm-season flowering would result in maximal seed banks in spring, which could explain the spring recruitment peak, but not the autumn one. We conclude that eastern recruitment patterns differ significantly from those observed in the western and central parts of the biome, and that fire management protocols for the east, which are currently based on data and experience from the winter-rainfall fynbos biome, need to be adjusted accordingly. Fire managers in the eastern fynbos biome should be less constrained by requirements to burn within a narrow seasonal range, and should therefore be in a better position to apply the required management burns.

Perennial grassland dynamics on fertile plains: Is coexistence mediated by disturbance?	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The response of grasslands to disturbance varies with the nature of the disturbance and the productivity of the landscape. In highly productive grasslands, competitive exclusion often results in decreased species richness and grazing may allow more species to coexist. Once widespread, grasslands dominated by Dichanthium sericeum (Queensland bluegrass) and Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) occur on fertile plains but have been reduced in extent by cultivation. We tested the effects of exclusion of livestock grazing on these grasslands by comparing the floristic composition of sites in a nature reserve with an adjacent stock reserve. In addition, sites that had been cultivated within the nature reserve were compared with those where grazing but no cultivation had occurred. To partition the effects of temporal variation from spatial variation we sampled sites in three different years (1998, 2002 and 2004). Some 194 taxa were recorded at the nature reserve and surrounding stock routes. Sampling time, the occurrence of past cultivation and livestock grazing all influenced species composition. Species richness varied greatly between sampling periods relating to highly variable rainfall and water availability on heavy clay soils. Native species richness was significantly lower at previously cultivated sites (13-22 years after cultivation), but was not significantly influenced by grazing exclusion. After 8 years it appears that reintroducing disturbance in the form of livestock grazing is not necessary to maintain plant species richness in the reserve. The highly variable climate (e.g. droughts) probably plays an important role in the coexistence of species by negating competitive exclusion and allowing interstitial species to persist.

Positive feedbacks between plant invasions and fire regimes: Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch (Fabaceae) in central Chile	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive species can increase fire frequency and intensity, generating favorable conditions for their self-perpetuation. Mediterranean south-central Chile may be especially prone to the effects of invasive species on fire regimes because it is less adapted to fire and it contains a highly endemic flora. Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch (syn. Cytisus monspessulanus L.; Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson) is an introduced shrub that forms monotypic stands or is present as an understory species in native forests as well as in forestry plantations. Dense T. monspessulana stands are completely destroyed by fire, generating the conditions for it seeds to germinate and establish an abundant regeneration, with up to 900 plants/m(2). We report key evidence on abundance and biomass in adult stands, and patterns of seed bank and regeneration after fire in stands of T. monspessulana around the city of Concepcion, Chile. We estimated living biomass in pure stands and underneath Eucalyptus plantations. In burned areas, we assessed T. monspessulana seed bank and studied regeneration patterns. We found that T. monspessulana densities reaches 52,778 plants/ha and 8.92 ton/ha in pure stands and 34,223 plants/ha and 2.31 ton/ha underneath Eucalyptus plantations. T. monspessulana generates small caliper fuel and acts as a ladder-fuel. Large soil seed banks allow for abundant regeneration after fire, with mean densities of 877,111 plants/ha, but an overall mortality of 37.2% in the first year after the fire. The high values of regeneration compared to final densities in adult stands suggest that density-dependent mortality. Our results indicate that T. monspessulana regeneration is not only favored by fires, but also that the species creates favorable conditions for intense and continuous fires, both under pure conditions, but also associated to exotic tree plantations. To understand the implications of positive feedbacks between invaders and fire, we recommend focusing in the mechanisms by which they increases fuel accumulation and fuel flammability, and how higher fire frequency and intensity favors invasive species recruitment over native species. Comprehension of this dynamics will allow for better management and control of these invasions which have major ecological, economical and social implications.

J	Liebst, B; Schneller, J				Liebst, Burgi; Schneller, Jakob			Seed dormancy and germination behaviour in two Euphrasia species (Orobanchaceae) occurring in the Swiss Alps	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The optimal time for germination of a seed depends on environmental conditions of its habitat, the life cycle of the germinating plant, and the conditions for successful establishment, growing and reproduction. We studied the germination behaviour of the alpine annual Euphrasia minima and an alpine ecotype of E. salisburgensis in a lowland garden experiment. Seeds of both species and their hybrids germinated at constant (5 degrees C) and at varying temperatures (3-10 degrees C), and never before spring after seed ripening. Germination was spread over 3 years, which suggests that the seeds formed a persistent seed bank. The two species together with E. minima and E. minima hybrids differed significantly in the germination rate in the first and second spring.

S. racemosa is a common deciduous shrub in central Japan and is known to grow predominantly at forest edges or roadsides. This indicates that it is a highly light-demanding species, and occurrence in gaps in old-growth stands suggests its ``fugitive,'' gap-dependent life history in old-growth forests. We found that one distinctive feature of this species was that its seedlings can survive well in shaded conditions by alternating stems every year like perennial herb species. Matrix model analyses demonstrated that S. racemosa can continuously regenerate under the present disturbance regime of this forest and is highly adaptable to the structural dynamics of the old-growth forest. The maturity of S. racemosa shrubs depends on their size, and nearly all (> 90%) of the mature ( reproducing) individuals were found in gaps or near gaps. But wide seed dispersal by birds and the ability to form both seed banks and seedling banks, the latter of which has been regarded as a common characteristic of shade-tolerant climax species, probably increase the species' chances to encounter canopy gaps. Dynamic-canopied matrix models showed that the greatest elasticity is with shaded seedling survival. The frequent stem alternation of shaded seedlings often makes the growth rate negative, but the survival rate of seedlings in low light awaiting new gap creation is remarkably high (0.93 yr(-1)). The lower survival rate of the larger individuals and smaller minimum size to start reproduction than other canopy or subcanopy shade-tolerant species indicate that S. racemosa has the potential to reproduce before the closure of the encountered gaps and to complete its life history rapidly.																	0012-9658					APR	2008	89	4					1155	1167		10.1890/06-2009.1							WOS:000255580200029	18481539

Influence of seed head-attacking biological control agents on spotted knapweed reproductive potential in western Montana over a 30-year period	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Five insect biological control agents that attack flower beads of spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe L. subsp. micranthos (Gugler) Hayek, became established in western Montana between 1973 and 1992. In a controlled field experiment in 2006, seed-head insects reduced spotted knapweed seed production per seed head by 84.4%. The seed production at two sites in western Montana where these biological control agents were well established was 91.6-93.8% lower in 2004-2005 than 1974-1975, whereas the Dumber of seed heads per square meter was 70.7% lower, and the reproductive potential (seeds/m(2)) was 95.9-99.0% lower. The average seed bank in 2005 at four sites containing robust spotted knapweed populations was 281 seeds/m(2) compared with 19 seeds/m(2) at four sites where knapweed density has declined. Seed bank densities were much higher at sites in central Montana (4,218 seeds/m(2)), where the insects have been established-for a shorter period. Urophora affinis Frauenfeld was the most abundant species at eight study sites, infesting 66.7% of the seed heads, followed by a 47.3% infestation by Larinus minutus Gyllenhal and L. obtusus Gyllenhal. From 1974 to 1985, Urophora spp. apparently reduced the number of seeds per seed head by 34.5-46.9%; the addition of Larinus spp. further reduced seed numbers 84.2-90.5% by 2005. Path analysis indicated that both Larinus spp. and U affinis contributed significantly to reduction of seed production over the 30-yr period. Spotted knapweed density may not decrease significantly until the seed bank falls below a critical threshold.																	0046-225X					APR	2008	37	2					510	519		10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[510:IOSHBC]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000258342400027	18419924

Differences in seed mass between hydric and xeric plants influence seed bank dynamics in a dryland riparian ecosystem	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Dryland riparian zones have steep spatial gradients of soil moisture and flood disturbance, and the component hydrogeomorphic surfaces support hydric to xeric plant species. These systems undergo extremes of flood and drought, a dynamic that may select for persistent soil seed banks. We asked if reliance on this strategy differed among plants in three moisture groups (hydric, mesic and xeric), and if patterns were related to diaspore traits. 2. We assessed the composition of soil and litter seed banks (emergence method) and extant vegetation along a riparian hydrogradient, and measured seed persistence (using an indirect method) and diaspore mass and shape variance of the component species. 3. Hydroriparian species had smaller diaspores than xeroriparian species, corresponding to differences in selective pressures on seedlings in their respective habitats, but the two groups formed persistent seed banks at approximately equal percentages. Persistent seeds were smaller than transient seeds, but within the persistent seed group there was separation between the smaller-diaspored hydrophytes and larger-diaspored xerophytes. 4. Distribution patterns of extant vegetation, in concert with diaspore trait differences among moisture-affinity groups, gave rise to divergent spatial patterns of diaspores within the soil: hydroriparian diaspores were abundant not only along wet channel bars but also in deep soils under floodplain forests and shrublands, presumably owing to dispersal by flood waters. Xeroriparian diaspores were largely restricted to the litter and upper soil layers of their drier, higher, floodplain habitats. With increasing depth in the soil of floodplain forests and shrublands, viable diaspores became smaller and rounder, and plant composition shifted from xeroriparian to hydroriparian species. 5. The wide distribution of hydroriparian diaspores in floodplain soils influences disturbance dynamics, increasing the probability that ephemeral wetland communities will develop wherever suitable conditions are stochastically created by floods. Persistent seed banks also allow many xeric annuals to be maintained in dryland riparian zones throughout extended drought, similar to processes that occur in desert uplands.

Linking the physiology and ecology of Cochlodinium to better understand harmful algal bloom events: A comparative approach	HARMFUL ALGAE												The red tide forming dinotlagellate genus Cochlodinium appears to be expanding globally, as well as blooming and/or causing more economic losses within its previously reported geographic distribution. Despite the widespread occurrence of this organism in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, relatively few studies of its ecophysiology have been conducted. Here we summarize the ecophysiological characteristics through both a literature review and by assessing recent bloom events in Monterey Bay, CA, USA. Using this comparative approach, we identify the basic characteristics of this organism: Cochlodinium is found in both warm and cool (11-30 degrees C) waters in the western and eastern Pacific, respectively, at moderate salinities (30-34). The production of pelagic vegetative seed banks or benthic seed beds by this organism and ability to survive ballast water transport likely facilitate its ability to colonize and establish itself in new habitats. It is a strong vertical migrator capable of utilizing both inorganic and organic nitrogen sources as well as mixotrophy and may be associated with moderate nutrient loading. These characteristics provide Cochlodinium with an adaptive capability conducive to rapid colonization of newly opened ecological niches, which may partially explain the apparent global expansion of its geographic range and bloom frequency.

Japanese Stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) Management for Restoration of Native Plant Communities	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Japanese stiltgrass is a nonnative invasive grass occupying a range of habitats in the eastern United States. Conventional management recommendations include hand-removal, mowing, or a nonselective herbicide application in autumn prior to flowering. However, no study has directly compared the ecological impacts of long-term management strategies on Japanese stiltgrass populations or recruitment and establishment of native flora. An experiment was initiated in 2002 and continued for three growing seasons in mixed pine-hardwood forests in central North Carolina. Conventional treatments included hand-removal, mowing, or an application of glyphosate (1.1 kg ai/ha) once in autumn, and selective removal by hand or fenoxaprop-P (0.19 kg ai/ha) season-long as needed. All treatments were compared to nontreated plots. Percent vegetation cover by species was recorded twice annually. Data were aggregated into five classes; Japanese stiltgrass, other exotic plants, native forbs, native monocots, and native woody plants. The soil seed bank of all species was estimated annually by extracting soil cores and documenting seedling emergence. All Japanese stiltgrass management treatments significantly reduced Japanese stiltgrass cover and seed bank over time compared to no management. However, recruitment and reestablishment of native plants and overall species richness were greater with selective Japanese stiltgrass management treatments including both hand-removal and fenoxaprop-P. Relative cover of other exotic plants decreased 2% to 49% after 3 yr with all Japanese stiltgrass management treatments except season-long hand-removal, which increased relative cover of other exotic plants 51%.																	1939-7291					APR-JUN	2008	1	2					111	119		10.1614/IPSM-07-011.1							WOS:000208393300001

Parameter uncertainty challenges the use of matrix models because it violates key assumptions underlying elasticity analyses. We have developed a matrix model to compare Monte Carlo methods with elasticity analyses for estimation of the relative importance of factors in the asymptotic population growth rate, lambda, of Cirsium vulgare (spear thistle) in Nebraska, USA. 2. We calculated lambda for a base model using 11 parameter estimates available for Nebraska populations plus eight extracted from the literature, causing parameter uncertainty. We then calculated lambda for 10 000 alternative models using Monte Carlo parameter estimation; parameters were drawn from the full range of each parameter in the literature and partial rank correlation analysis (PRCC) was used to order the parameters by the magnitude of their effect on lambda. 3. Monte Carlo analysis found that insect floral herbivory, affecting the regeneration transition, was the most important parameter affecting lambda, whereas elasticity analyses suggested that the transition from small to medium size was the most significant. Statistical comparison, using PRCC vs. lower level elasticity (LLE), showed that the Monte Carlo analysis provided a more accurate assessment. 4. As lambda > 1 in 99% of the model runs even with significant floral herbivory, we added two parameters influenced by weed management (probability of large thistles dying without producing seed and proportion of seeds that failed to germinate). Simulations that included reductions in these parameters, along with floral herbivory, led to lambda < 1 in 17% of the runs, suggesting these three factors interact to produce the low densities observed for this invasive thistle in our study area. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the utility of the Monte Carlo approach for modelling weed dynamics with parameter uncertainty and multiple, potentially interacting, parameters. Invasive population growth by C. vulgare could be limited by a combination of weed management practices and the biotic resistance imposed by native floral herbivores.

Many cultivated species can escape from fields and colonize seminatural habitats as feral populations. Of these, feral oilseed rape is a widespread feature of field margins and roadside verges. Although considered in several studies, the general processes leading to the escape and persistence of feral oilseed rape are still poorly known. Notably, it remains unclear whether these annuals form transient populations resulting mainly from seed immigration (either from neighbouring fields or during seed transport), or whether they show real ability to persist (either through self-recruitment or seed banks). 2. We conducted a 4-year large-scale study of factors involved in the presence of feral oilseed rape populations in a typical open-field area of France. The results were subjected to statistical methods suitable for analysing large data sets, based on a regression approach. We subsequently addressed the relative contribution of the ecological processes identified as being involved in the presence of feral populations. 3. Many feral oilseed rape populations resulted from seed immigration from neighbouring fields (about 35-40% of the observed feral populations). Immigration occurred at harvest time rather than at sowing. Around 15% of such populations were attributed to immigration through seed transport. 4. The other half resulted from processes of persistence, mainly through persistent seed banks (35-40% of the observed feral populations). This was all the more unexpected because seed banks have not yet been documented on road verges (despite being frequent within fields). Local recruitment was rare, accounting for no more than 10% of the feral populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding the dynamics of feral oilseed rape populations is crucial for evaluating gene flow over an agro-ecosystem. Our results show that, while many feral populations do come from annual seed dispersal, a significant number also result from seeds stored in the soil for several years. In the current context of coexistence and management of transgenic with non-transgenic crops, feral persistence and, especially, the seed bank contribution to the dynamics of feral populations need to be considered seriously. The latter, combined with self-recruitment, indicates a high potential for the persistence of transgenes and the possible emergence of gene-stacking.

J	King, EG				King, E. G.			Facilitative effects of Aloe secundiflora shrubs in degraded semi-arid rangelands in Kenya	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Livestock overgrazing can threaten the ecological integrity of rangelands, and can also threaten the sustainability of pastoralist societies who depend on rangelands for their livelihood. Using facilitator plants in the restoration of degraded semi-arid rangelands offers a promising strategy because in such environments, facilitators can ameliorate harsh conditions that often limit the establishment and success of surrounding vegetation. In a degraded rangeland in Kenya, I compared local biotic and abiotic environmental conditions around naturally occurring Aloe secundiflora shrubs to conditions around Maerua decumbens shrubs and points without shrub cover. The presence of A. secundiflora shrubs was positively associated with increased vegetation cover, species richness, litter cover, soil seed banks, and soil retention within a 2 m radius of shrubs, as compared with conditions surrounding M. decumbens and areas lacking shrub cover. The pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that A. secundiflora acts as a facilitator in this plant community. These findings are the basis for additional studies to determine whether transplanted A. secundiflora shrubs can also elicit the formation of patches with ameliorated environmental conditions. If so, augmenting populations of native A. secundiflora shrubs may be a feasible strategy in the ecological restoration of degraded rangelands. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of slash and burn practices on a soil seed bank of caatinga vegetation in Northeastern Brazil	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The semiarid tropical zone covers 20% of Brazil and is dominated by caatinga, a thorny deciduous savanna well adapted to seasonal water shortage and periodic drought years. This study was focused on effects of slash and burn agriculture on the soil seed bank in a Caatinga area, in Sobral, CE, Brazil. Caatinga is rich in species, called therophytes, which remain as seeds in the soil during unfavorable seasons and rely on regeneration from the soil seed bank for persistence in the environment. Although slash and burn agriculture has been intensified in the region for the past three centuries, its effects on the soil seed bank are not well known. A seedling emergence greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate differences in seed bank density and diversity among soil samples collected before and after an experimental burning. Soil samples were previously submitted to sequential sieving to assess fire effects on different-sized seeds. Fire significantly reduced overall seed bank density, with smaller sieving fractions being most strongly affected. Shanon's diversity index was also lowered by fire. Combined, these results show that agricultural practices represent a serious threat to plant biodiversity conservation in the Caatinga biome. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Forty-five seedling plots (2 x 2 m), each including a soil-sampling quadrat (40 x 40 cm), were established randomly under or around the crowns of mature M. stellata trees. Seeds of M. stellata were collected from each quadrat to a depth of 5 cm. Only four seeds of M. stellata were found (0.56 seeds/m(2)) and all were located under mature crowns. Current-year seedlings were abundant in water channels, on moss, or under mature crowns, suggesting that the seeds may require wet soil conditions for germination. Magnolia stellata seeds show considerable germination below the crowns of mature trees in the year following masting, while some seeds remain dormant in the soil. Considering the soil seed bank and the current-year seedling bank of M. stellata, a frequent supply of seed is essential for the regeneration of this species. Thus, it is important to maintain mature trees in addition to promoting seed production.

Changes in forest structure and species composition following invasion by a non-indigenous shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii)	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Heavy infestations of a non-indigenous shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) are frequently linked to poor individual performance and reduced species diversity. We used chronosequence methods and analysis of forest strata to investigate potential impacts of L. maackii on 1) species richness, 2) density of sub-canopy recruitment layers, 3) indicator species affinity, and 4) within- and among-strata compositional similarities. We compared sites ranging from 12 to 26 years since initial invasion as well as non-invaded, control sites. When assessing non-invaded versus long-invaded sites, we found significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced densities in the herb (-57%), seedling (-58%), and sapling layers (-90%), and also reduced species richness in the seedling (-34%), and sapling (-58%), and herbaceous layers (-4%). Interestingly, the germinable seed bank density showed significant increases among non-invaded and long-invaded sites (+78%), while the species richness of the seed bank demonstrated a marked decrease (-41%). Indicator species analysis found that most species had greater frequencies and abundances in non-invaded sites, and nearly all species had greater affinities for the non-invaded sites, especially in the seedling, sapling, and seed bank layers. Responses were species-specific in the herbaceous layer. Within-layer species similarity decreased with increased time of L. maackii occupancy in all sub-canopy strata. This pattern was also found with reductions in between-layer compositional similarity for the long-invaded (r = 0.16) versus the recently-invaded (r = 0.37) and non-invaded (r = 0.51) sites. Our data suggest that in many invaded sites, habitats are experiencing wholesale alterations in species composition, structure, and successional trajectory, and invasion may also change competitive interactions in forest understories as well as alter between-layer species linkages. These results validate the candidacy of L. maackii sites for increased removal and restoration efforts.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				APR-JUN	2008	135	2					245	259		10.3159/07-RA-036.1							WOS:000257900200009

Two out of three tested plant species, Centaurea nigra and Origanum vulgare, had a higher seedling emergence when we added the fungivorous collembolan Protaphorura fimata to mesocosms, compared to a control treatment where we excluded soil mesofauna by using defaunated soil and preventing re-colonization from the ambient soil. P. fimata increased seedling emergence to a similar extent as a treatment of the seeds with the fungicide Aathiram. In contrast, a treatment designed to allow re-colonization of defaunated soil from the ambient soil did not result in increased seedling emergence compared to the control treatment. In a third plant species, Anthriscus sylvestris, overall seedling emergence was too low for any significant treatment effects to be detected. This study corroborates the findings of a previous experiment carried out in the laboratory to explore the influence of P. fimata on seed mortality under controlled environmental conditions and shows that there are similar effects on seedling emergence under field climatic conditions.

J	Podlaski, R				Podlaski, Rafal			Dynamics in Central European near-natural Abies-Fagus forests: Does the mosaic-cycle approach provide an appropriate model?	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: The mosaic-cycle concept of forest dynamics dominates in Central Europe. According to this concept intermediate-scale disturbances only accelerate the forest break-up under existing cycles of forest development. Is such an approach correct, or should new developmental cycles be elaborated for intermediate-scale disturbances? Location: Near-natural Abies alba - Fagus sylvatica forests in the Swietokrzyski National Park in Central Poland. In these forests intermediate-scale disturbances occurred between 1970 and 1990. Methods: Data were collected twice in areas surrounding 212 permanent sample points ( in 1994 and 2004). Two increment cores were taken from 259 sample Abies trees. The effect of intermediate-scale disturbances on radial increment of Abies was assessed. Probabilities of stand transition during a 10-year period between individual stages and phases of development of the mixed forest were calculated. The development stages and phases were arranged into hypothetical succession series of successive changes. Results: In 1994 70 stands and in 2004, 47 stands representing stages and phases containing the older generation formed by trees > 100-150 years were found. Also, in 1994 142 and in 2004, 165 stands representing stages and phases containing the younger generations only, formed by trees < 100-150 years, were recorded. Stages and phases containing only younger generations do not occur in the existing forest development cycle which does not consider the influence of intermediate-scale disturbances separately. Two developmental cycles, which take into account the presence of the older generation and the younger generations only ( under conditions of the occurrence of intermediate-scale disturbances), are proposed. Conclusion: The mosaic-cycle concept of forest dynamics can be used to analyse the dynamics of Central European near-natural mixed-species forests, but new developmental cycles should be elaborated for intermediate-scale disturbances.

Its invasive characteristics include high seed production (as many as 300-350 seeds per flower and multiple flowers per plant), seed dormancy, ability to tolerate dry conditions, and possible allelopathic effects. Disturbed areas with a relatively sandy substrate within warm, and climate zones are vulnerable to invasion by V. encelioides. Verbesina encelioides is found on all of the main Hawaiian islands except Ni'ihau but is particularly problematic on Midway and Kure Atoll, where it may threaten the habitat of nesting birds such as Laysan and black-footed albatrosses and Christmas and wedge-tailed shearwaters. Many other Pacific islands with similar habitats could be invaded by V encelioides. The plant has become naturalized in many other U.S. states, parts of South America, the Bahamas, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, parts of Europe, Saudi Arabia, India, Ethiopia, Morocco, Botswana, Namibia, Israel, and Australia. It is a pest of various crops in the southern United States and India and is poisonous to sheep and cattle. Verbesina encelioides can be controlled via herbicides or mechanical means, but measures must be repeated due to the presence of persistent seed banks. Further research on V. encelioides is needed to understand its population dynamics, allelopathic properties, and impacts on natural ecosystems.																	0030-8870					APR	2008	62	2					161	176		10.2984/1534-6188(2008)62[161:BAIOPI]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000254944500001						
J	Neve, P				Neve, Paul			Simulation modelling to understand the evolution and management of glyphosate resistant in weeds	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: A simulation model is used to explore the influence of biological, ecological, genetic and operational (management) factors on the probability and rate of glyphosate resistance in model weed species. RESULTS: Glyphosate use for weed control prior to crop emergence is associated with low risks of resistance. These low risks can be further reduced by applying glyphosate in sequence with other broad-spectrum herbicides prior to crop seeding. Post-emergence glyphosate use, associated with glyphosate-resistant crops, very significantly increases risks of resistance evolution. Annual rotation with conventional crops reduces these risks, but the proportion of resistant populations can only be reduced to close to zero by mixing two of three post-emergence glyphosate applications with alternative herbicide modes of action. Weed species that are prolific seed producers with high seed bank turnover rates are most at risk of glyphosate resistance evolution. The model is especially sensitive to the initial frequency of R alleles, and other genetic and reproductive parameters, including weed breeding system, dominance of the resistance trait and relative fitness, influence rates of resistance. CONCLUSION: Changing patterns of glyphosate use associated with glyphosate-resistant crops are increasing risks of evolved glyphosate resistance. Strategies to mitigate these risks can be explored with simulation models. Models can also be used to identify weed species that are most at risk of evolving glyphosate resistance.

Fairy ring disease of cranberry: Assessment of crop losses and impact on cultivar genotype	PLANT DISEASE												Fairy ring is a disease of cultivated cranberry common in the eastern growing regions of the United States, especially New Jersey and Massachusetts. Rings may persist for many years, and current control recommendations are costly and largely ineffective. The goal of this study was to accurately assess the impact of this disease on cranberry, a long-lived, high-value, perennial crop. The rate of fairy ring expansion, rate of formation of new rings, and distribution of rings across three cultivars were determined using a geographical information system (GIS) database that incorporated aerial and satellite imagery. Ring growth rates, estimated from imagery collected over a 10-year period in cv. Ben Lear, averaged 0.455 m in radius per year. Rings were observed in 'Ben Lear' three times more frequently than in either 'Early Black' or 'Stevens' cultivars. Direct sampling showed that estimates for yield within rings were 22 to 68% less than unaffected areas of the field for cv. Ben Lear. These estimates included the effects of fruit rot, which was elevated within rings to 18 to 29% of the total harvest. The impact on yield of 'Stevens' and 'Early Black' was lower than in 'Ben Lear'. Most cranberry cultivars are clonal and variation in fruit morphology within rings, particularly in 'Ben Lear', prompted an analysis of vine genotype. Areas affected by fairy ring in 'Ben Lear' showed an increase in genetic diversity at least 0.4 to 4 times that of unaffected areas. Therefore, it appears that fairy ring not only directly reduces yield but also can increase the host genetic diversity. This likely is due to increased seedling establishment resulting from seed drop when fruit decompose. Because seedlings typically yield less than the parental cultivar, the increase in genetic diversity also may contribute to long-term reduction of productivity in a cranberry field.

Although the effect of patches on seed density is widely known, we still lack information on how patch features affect seed bank density and composition. Our aim was to answer two basic questions: (1) How do seed bank density and composition vary within and outside patch aboveground physical limits? and (2) Do patch characteristics affect soil seed bank density and composition? We sampled 50 shrub patches in a semi-arid gypsum system in Central Spain, measuring patch size, composition and structure, and seed bank at three locations per shrub (centre, edge and outside). We calculated the effect of interior patch location, patch composition and structure on seed density and composition. Patches acted both as seed sources, increasing seed density in neighbouring areas and as seed sinks by trapping seeds from bare areas. Patch structure (erect perennial cover) had the greatest effect on seed bank density, whereas patch size and microslope had the greatest influence on bare area density. Patch structure, composition and interior location explained the variation in seed bank composition. Patch effect extends to the surrounding bare matrix creating a seed bank gradient in density and composition. This effect is modulated by patch structure and composition and affects seed bank composition. Our results suggest that the spatial structure of gypsum community seed banks may act as a mechanism for a spatial storage effect contributing to the maintenance of high levels of diversity in semi-arid environments.

J	Buhk, C; Hensen, I				Buhk, Constanze; Hensen, Isabell			Seed longevity of eight species common during early postfire regeneration in south-eastern Spain: A 3-year burial experiment	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Species that frequently regenerate sexually after fire were not found in soil seed banks of previous studies in south-eastern Spain (Province of Murcia) and this led to the idea of studying seed longevity in the species concerned. A seed burial field experiment was carried out over a period of 30 months to examine the seed longevity of eight species that mainly reproduce sexually during early postfire succession. In addition, longevity was determined for seeds stored at room temperature and the results were compared to those obtained for buried seeds. Seeds of the study species showed very different patterns of persistence. Water-impermeable seeds of Cistus albidus, Cistus clusii, Fumana laevipes, Convolvulus lanuginosus and Calicotome intermedia survived at least 1 year of burial in high numbers. However, seeds of Calicotome intermedia did not survive a second year, and only approximately 20% of the Fumana laevipes and Convolvulus lanuginosus seeds were alive after 30 months of burial. The longevity of buried water-permeable seeds of Asterolinum linum-stellatum, Teucrium pseudochamaepitys and Stipa tenacissima did not exceed 2 years. When buried for 30 months in a coastal and a mountain population site, the number of viable seeds of Convolvulus lanuginosus and Stipa tenacissima did not differ significantly between the two sites. Seeds of most species showed better survival under room temperature than under burial conditions. We concluded that the seed longevity of some species in soil might have previously been overestimated.

Both species have seed dormancy. To help preserve these species we ran seed germination experiments to determine the effect of seed age and putrescine on breaking seed dormancy. The treatments used were seed age (from four different years) and the administration of exogenous putrescine (0.1 mu mol/L, 0.1 mmol/L and a control). The seed collection years were 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005 for T. lophophoroides, and 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 for T. pseudopectinatus. The response variable evaluated was the final germination percentage. Turbinicarpus lophophoroides showed the greatest germination percentage for seeds that had been collected for 4 years (2001), both in the control (66%) and in the 0.1 mu mol/L putrescine (54%) treatments. Seeds of T. pseudopectinatus with the greatest germination percentage (48%) were those collected within a year (2004) for the control group. This implies that putrescine inhibited the germination of T. pseudopectinatus. The results show that both species have the potential to produce seed banks.

We also aimed to estimate the time required for vegetation regeneration and indicate differences in secondary succession patterns at different altitudes in sand dunes. Two sites in the low and two in the high parts of the dunes were chosen and sampled for twelve years. The initial stages are characterized by ruderal communities dominated by nitrophilous annual weeds. Ruderal vegetation was soon replaced by nutrient-poor communities dominated by short-lived pioneer dicotyledonous plants and grasses. In the last few years of the study, coinciding with a rainy period, the low sites were dominated by the perennial grasses, Poa angustifolia, P. pratensis and Cynodon dactylon. In contrast, in the high sites a less dense cover of perennials developed. The influence of initial composition on vegetation development decreased with time and the influence of altitude increased during succession. The altitude of the site had a significant effect on regeneration. Species richness and Shannon diversity of the high sites increased during vegetation development and that of the low sites decreased. Most annuals persisted in the high sites but became extinct in the low sites. The mean species turnover rate, irrespective of altitude, decreased during the study.

Variant maturity in seed structures of Pinus albicaulis (Engelm.) and Pinus sibirica (Du Tour): key to a soil seed bank, unusual among conifers?	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												The seeds of Cembrae pines are dispersed by nutcrackers (Genus Nucifraga), which cache seeds in soil during autumn. The dispersal and establishment of seedlings via this mutualistic relationship is highly successful. On the other hand, irregular quality of seed crops and lack of detailed knowledge on germination process of Cembrae pine seeds hamper effective seedling production in the nursery. Therefore we studied basic structures and maturity of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) and Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) seeds, as well as structural changes during a multi-step treatment of whitebark pine seeds, using field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. The most striking differences compared to many other conifer seeds were the solid surface structures, early structural differentiation of the embryo, clustering of the thin-walled megagametophyte cells, and great accumulation of starch in both the untreated and treated seeds. Protein bodies of the embryo were in early developmental stages, whereas in the megagametophyte their stages varied. The number, form and size of lipid bodies also varied within different parts of the seed, and lipids dissolved easily. Our results indicated that despite maturity of the seed coat and advanced differentiation of the embryo, the embryo and the megagametophyte were still immature. These morphological features and a notable proportion of storage reserves remaining in unstable form may, however, be advantageous for maintaining viability and reaching maturity within a soil seed bank. Well-controlled pre-treatment simulating natural conditions should result in improved germination.																	0931-1890					APR	2008	22	2					225	236		10.1007/s00468-007-0179-2							WOS:000254240300011

Modelling the population dynamics of Papaver rhoeas under various weed management systems in a Mediterranean climate	WEED RESEARCH												The demography of the annual dicotyledonous weed Papaver rhoeas and the efficacy of different management practices were studied during three consecutive years in winter cereals in the north-east of Spain. These data were used to estimate the parameters of a weed life cycle model that was used to describe the population dynamics of this species and to predict the effect of various control strategies and integrated weed management (IWM) scenarios. Without control, the annual rate of increase was 40 (lambda(t)), and the minimum control level required to maintain the population stable was 99% of the emerged plants. The annual application of post-emergence and/or pre-emergence herbicides did not prevent the growth of the population. Using various cultural control tactics (delayed seeding, harrowing and fallow) resulted in different trends in the overall population depending on the techniques and combinations analysed. Simulations showed that delayed seeding, fallow and pre-emergence herbicides are the best techniques to employ in IWM programmes, always using a combination of these and other more common practices (i.e. post-emergence herbicides). Sensitivity analysis indicated interaction between the parameters and that the model was especially sensitive to seed losses and also to fecundity, seedling survivorship and emergence. The study shows that new strategies should be sought to control these parameters. To develop IWM programmes for P. rhoeas, the combination of two or more control strategies is required.

The general processes leading to the escape and persistence of cultivated species on field margins are still poorly investigated. An exhaustive 4-year survey was conducted in the centre of France at a landscape level to study the origin of feral oilseed rape populations. We present here results obtained with machine learning methods, which are increasingly popular techniques for analysing large ecological datasets. As expected, the dynamics of feral populations relies on large seed immigration from fields and transport. However, the seed bank was shown to be the keystone of their persistence rather than local recruitment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bertoncini, AP; Rodrigues, RR				Bertoncini, Alzira Politi; Rodrigues, Ricardo Ribeiro			Forest restoration in an indigenous land considering a forest remnant influence (Avai, Sao Paulo State, Brazil)	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The expansion of agricultural and pasture areas over native forest areas has been broadly documented and represents the main cause of deforestation that has occurred for the last decades. Such reality is not different in indigenous lands, and has been considered as an important obstacle for individuals who directly depend upon the appropriate management of natural resources to maintain their traditions. We investigated the seed rain, seed bank and natural regeneration of native woody species within a degraded pasture land in different distances from an adjacent seasonal semideciduous forest fragment to define methodological procedures based on ecological processes that might subsidize forest restoration in an indigenous land. Most seeds and seedlings picked from the seed rain and seed bank belonged to anemochoric and autochoric dispersing shrubby and herbaceous species originated in the pasture land. The woody species regeneration, on the other hand, reached higher levels, in terms of abundance and richness, as the forest fragment became closer. Zoochoric dispersal was predominant among such species and was mainly detected closer to the forest fragment. Several woody species picked in the forest fragment were also found in the pasture land, thus reinforcing their important role in supplying propagules and easing the successional process.

Most of the seedling emergence (88%) that occurred during the first year after wildfire, took place between the end of the winter and the beginning of the spring, although meteorological conditions during the first autumn after fire were not adverse. The mild environmental conditions during the first summer after wildfire resulted in very low seedling mortality. The degree of crown damage caused by wildfire significantly and negatively affected pine seedling stocking, which was, as average, 3.5 seedlings m(-2) at the end of the first year after wildfire. Salvage logging was carried out 13 months after the fire. Three post-fire alternatives were compared: no harvesting (standing burned trees), harvesting + windrowing slash and harvesting + slash chopping. Slash chopping favoured a new seedling cohort. Harvesting and slash windrowing caused an immediate seedling mortality of 22%. Harvesting and slash chopping operations caused a mean mortality of 18 and 31%, respectively. Averaged over both slash treatments, 27% of the seedlings were damaged, which increased deferred mortality during the subsequent months. Pine seedling survival was significantly related to seedling height, especially in harvested plots and was significantly reduced by harvesting and logging slash operations, with this reduction significantly higher in the harvest + slash chopping treatment. Harvesting and slash manipulation significantly reduced seedling height and growth, especially after slash chopping. The percentage of bare soil resulting from clearcutting was significantly and negatively related to P. pinaster density, survival and height. Because of the contribution of the new cohort, at the end of the study there were no differences in seedling density related to treatment; the densities ranged from 3.4 seedlings m(-2) in the non-harvested treatment to 2.5 seedlings m(-2) in harvest + slash windrowing treatment, whereas in the harvest + slash chopping treatment these were 3.2 seedlings m(-2). The delay in harvesting, may have lessened the impact of these forestry operations on P pinaster recruitment. Reduction in seedling density caused by harvest and slash manipulation operations might reduce the need for subsequent thinning operations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mahogany has been severely overexploited throughout its natural range, which stretches from southern Mexico through Central and South America as far south as the Bolivian Amazon. We investigated effects of selective logging on the genetic diversity of a mahogany population in eastern Amazonia. Using eight hypervariable microsatellite loci, we estimated the number of alleles per locus (A), mean expected and observed heterozygosity (H-e, H-o), the number of distinct multilocus genotypes (G(o)), and the inbreeding coefficient (f) for pre- and post-logging cohorts (adults and seedlings) collected over identical spatial scales. We found a significant reduction in the number of alleles, observed heterozygosity, and distinct multilocus genotype number in the post- compared to the pre-logging cohort. The loss of genetic diversity is likely to have occurred due to a reduction in the effective population size as a consequence of logging, which leads to the loss of alleles and limits mating possibilities. The results raise concerns about the conservation genetics of logged mahogany populations where a high proportion of adults are removed from the system. We suggest initiatives to promote the maintenance of genetic diversity as an integral part of the production system, allowing genetically sustainable use of this valuable timber resource.

Species richness and floristic composition of the weedy species were studied in 20 plots along a farming succession, from rice fields, to 1-year-old, 4-8-year-old and over 10-year-old pastures planted to Brachiaria brizantha. In the early phases of the farming cycle reduction in the average plant total species richness in 50 m 2 plots decreased from 67 to 20 species and comprised both woody and herbaceous species. The increase to 41 species further observed in mature pastures was essentially comprised of herbaceous species. Rice fields were characterised by a great floristic heterogeneity which later decreased when they were planted to pastures. PCA of plant communities ordinated plots along a gradient of increasing anthropisation that explained 23.6% of total variance. Species were classified into four ecological groups, which floristic composition and specific richness changed throughout the farming succession. Species richness and density of forest woody species decreased progressively from 32 to 7 species and from 152 to 16 2 individuals per 50 in, and only a few species such as Memora allanmandiflora and Poecilanthe effusa resisted pasture conditions. Pioneer/ secondary woody species of the genera Cecropia and Solanum germinated out of the forest seed bank, and seven species on average were observed in rice fields and 1-year-old pastures. At later stages (>4 years) their respective species richness decreased to three species while their density decreased sharply, from 439 to 41 individuals per 50 m(2). A few forest herbaceous species of the families Marantaceae and Poaceae and the fern species Adiantum argutum, which survived in rice fields (2 species per 50 in 2 on average), almost disappeared in the 4-8-year-old pastures. In the early phase of the intra-farming succession, a rather stable community of six species of secondary herbaceous plants on average was established. Species richness further increased to 16 in the > 10-year-old pastures with addition of species such as Desmodium axillare, Phyllanthus amarus or Cyperus compressus. In accordance with the concept of Initial Floristic Composition, floristic composition at the beginning of the intra-farming succession was determined by the floristic composition of the former forest and by the nature and intensity of the initial disturbance (deforestation and burning). Further changes in species richness, floristic composition and density in the intrafarming succession are driven by the intra-farming management. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bocci, R; Chable, V				Bocci, Riccardo; Chable, Veronique			Peasant seeds in Europe: Stakes and prospects	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES												The myth of technological progress in agriculture and then modern plant breeding, have resulted in a separation of farming from breeding activities. Seed laws as well have contributed to this end (e.g. by imposing strict rules for the inscription of varieties to the official catalogue). Nowadays, some pioneers, among farmers refusing industrialised agriculture and more often practicing organic agriculture, are proposing a different option. In Europe, since the beginning of this century, they have been organising themselves in networks: the Reseau Semences Paysannes in France, the Red de Semillas in Spain and the Rete Semi Rurali in Italy. Their members are farmers, consumers and scientists working together in order to reconsider the scientific, technical and legal aspects of seed production. These new varieties are designated "peasants' varieties", a concept that encompasses two main aspects: the seed, the reproductive pan of the plant linked to its "terroir" and the variety, shaped by the history and coevolved with farmers. Scientists working with these networks are developing participatory plant breeding projects, which aim to broaden agrobiodiversity by creating new peasants' varieties. The basis of these projects comes from old local varieties and landraces conserved in seed banks. In Europe, the legal framework has evolved since the establishment of "conservation varieties" by the directive 98/95. The European research project Farm Seed Opportunities is on going to support new seed policies considering also the different national contexts. The debate in Europe now offers a range of seed systems models. It is time to enlarge this debate to southern countries through the sharing of knowledge between farmers of the North and the South, aiming at conserving agrobiodiversity and promoting rural innovation.																	1166-7699					MAR-APR	2008	17	2					216	221									WOS:000256049400025

Reduced herbicide rates provide acceptable weed control regardless of corn planting strategy in Ontario field corn	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												A study was conducted at three locations in central-southwestern Ontario from 1996 to 1998 to determine if corn (Zea mays L.) productivity and weed control can be maintained when row spacing is narrowed, crop density is increased and herbicide rate is reduced. Post-emergence herbicides [(rimsulfuron + nicosulfuron) plus (dicamba + atrazine)] at four rates (full label rate (1 x), 75% full rate (0.75 x), 50%, full rate (0.5 x) and an untreated check) were tested at three corn row-spacings (38, 50, and 75 cm) and two plant densities (75 000 and 90 000 plants ha(-1)). Herbicide application at the 0.5x rate versus an untreated check still allowed for increased corn yield 8.3 vs. 4.9 t ha(-1)) and decreased weed dry weight (9.4 vs. 240.4 g m(-2)), weed plant density (11.0 vs. 52.6 plants m(-2)) and weed seed density (239 vs. 14241 seeds m(-2)). Corn LAI was not affected by decreasing herbicide rate. In this study, increasing corn plant density and decreasing corn row spacing were not factors in reducing herbicide inputs in corn cropping systems in central-southwestern Ontario. Herbicide rate could be reduced by up to 50% while maintaining corn grain yield, weed density, weed dry weight, and the number of weed seeds entering into the soil seed bank. Implementation of these reduced rates will help to increase the economic and environmental sustainability of the Canadian Field corn industry.																	0008-4220					MAR	2008	88	2					373	378		10.4141/CJPS07082							WOS:000255143400016

The seed-bank in different layers at 5 cm intervals was also studied by using the seedling-emergence method with waterlogged and submerged greenhouse treatments. Thirty-four species and 1788 seedlings germinated in the seed-bank, with a mean density of 1227 seedlings m(-2) (40-2600). Thirty-one species and 22261 individuals were obtained in the extant vegetation with a mean density of 1436 seedlings m(-2) (368-12632). The Margalef species richness index was 4.41 in the seed-bank and 2.99 in the extant vegetation. Little overlap (14 taxa, 43%) was found between the seed-bank and the extant vegetation. The total number of species and seedlings that germinated in different layers was significantly different. The number of species that germinated in the surface layer (21 taxa) was not significantly different from that in the second layer (27 taxa). Only 39.2% of the total number of seedlings appeared in the surface layer. Our results indicated that a lakeshore wetland seed-bank with viable seeds and high species richness can be used as a macrophyte pool in degraded wetland restoration. Vegetation produced from such a seed-bank will have species similar to the pre-disturbance assemblage. The large number of viable seeds that we found conserved in deeper layers suggests that the most valuable macrophyte pools are conserved at depth. With disturbance, these seeds could be brought back to the surface, and serve as a reserve in recruiting the extant vegetation. We suggest using the sediment containing rich viable propagules in the actual reconstruction project.																	1385-0237					MAR	2008	195	1					69	76		10.1007/s11258-007-9299-4							WOS:000252800700007

This resilient genus has the ability to survive extreme environmental stresses by depositing hardy, dormant "seed banks" of propagules, mostly commonly oospheres, into the sediments. The present study investigates the effect of extended periods of anoxia on the survival of Vaucheria propagules. Sediment samples from a flooded riparian zone in Ashford, Connecticut, a habitat where Multiple Species Of Vaucheria have been known to grow, were placed in anoxic Bio-Bag (TM) chambers for 15 months. Our results demonstrate that three species, V. aversa, V. uncinata, and K undulata, are able to Survive at least five months of anoxia, with V. aversa and V. uncinata Surviving one year lacking O-2.																	0035-4902	1938-3401				SPR	2008	110	942					217	224		10.3119/07-18.1							WOS:000257901600006

Germination ecology of the holoparasite Cuscuta epithymum	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Little is known about the seed ecology of annual holoparasites, such as Cuscuta (dodders), and how germination is timed to occur when seedlings can attach to a host. Seeds of Cuscuta epithymum, which is a rare and often threatened species in dry heaths of north-western Europe, were water-impermeable (physically dormant) at maturity in late summer. An 8-week period at 5 degrees C, followed by incubation at 23, 15/6 or 30/20 degrees C, resulted in 15-30% germination. Thus, in nature, only part of the seed population exposed to low winter temperatures and a subsequent warm spring potentially becomes water-permeable and can germinate in spring. When scarified seeds were cold-stratified at 5 degrees C for 8 weeks and then incubated at 23 degrees C, essentially all the viable seeds (c. 65%) germinated. It is concluded that seeds have a combination of physical (PY) and physiological (PD) dormancy (the first to be reported in the Convolvulacese), which is interpreted as a double safety mechanism preventing germination at unfavourable times or places. After PY and PD were broken, seeds did not require light or fluctuating temperatures for germination. Some loss of PD (afterripening) can occur before PY is broken. These data indicate that a portion of the seed crop remains physically dormant in spring and potentially forms a persistent seed bank, a strategy that eliminates the risk of a total reproductive failure in a particular bad year.

Effect of climate fluctuations on long-term vegetation dynamics in Carolina Bay wetlands	WETLANDS												Carolina bays and similar depression wetlands of the U.S. Southeastern Coastal Plain have hydrologic regimes that are driven primarily by rainfall. Therefore, climate fluctuations such as drought cycles have the potential to shape long-term vegetation dynamics. Models suggest two potential long-term responses to hydrologic fluctuations, either cyclic change maintaining open emergent vegetation, or directional succession toward forest vegetation. In seven Carolina bay wetlands on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, we assessed hydrologic variation and vegetation response over a 15-year period spanning two drought and reinundation cycles. Changes in pond stage (water depth) were monitored biweekly to monthly each year from 1989-2003. Vegetation composition was sampled in three years (1989, 1993, and 2003) and analyzed in relation to changes in hydrologic conditions. Multi-year droughts occurred prior to the 1989 and 2003 sampling years, whereas 1993 coincided with a wet period. Weiland plant species generally maintained dominance after both wet and dry conditions, but the abundances of different plant growth forms and species indicator categories shifted over the 15-year period. Decreased hydroperiods and water depths during droughts led to increased cover of grass, upland, and woody species, particularly at the shallower wetland margins. Conversely, reinundation and longer hydroperiods resulted in expansion of aquatic and emergent species and reduced the cover of flood-intolerant woody and upland species. These semi-permanent Upper Coastal Plain bays generally exhibited cyclic vegetation dynamics in response to climate fluctuation, with wet periods favoring dominance by herbaceous species. Large basin morphology and deep ponding, paired with surrounding upland forest dominated by flood-intolerant pines, were features contributing to persistence of herbaceous vegetation. Drought cycles may promote directional succession to forest in bays that are smaller, shallower, or colonized by flood-tolerant hardwoods.																	0277-5212					MAR	2008	28	1					17	27		10.1672/06-117.1							WOS:000255117200002						
J	Igarashi, T; Kiyono, Y				Igarashi, Tetsuya; Kiyono, Yoshiyuki			The potential of hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa [Sieb. et Zucc.] Endlicher) plantation forests for the restoration of the original plant community in Japan	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We estimated the potential of plantation forests for the restoration of the original plant community. We compared the understory vegetation in hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa [Sieb. et Zucc.] Endlicher) plantations at the understory re-initiation stage and in adjacent natural forests. To estimate the effect of the original natural forests on the understory species composition of plantation forests, we established study sites in five types of natural forests (mature evergreen broadleaf, mature deciduous broadleaf, mature evergreen coniferous, immature deciduous broadleaf warm-temperate, and immature deciduous broadleaf cool-temperate) and nearby plantation forests. The understory vegetation of the plantation forests had a higher species richness, a higher proportion of early-seral species, and a higher proportion of herb or fern species than the natural forests. The differences between natural and plantation forests varied according to the species composition of the natural forests. The composition of the understory vegetation of the plantations at the understory re-initiation stage was similar to that of the immature deciduous forests. The characteristics of immature, disturbed forests remained in the understory vegetation of the hinoki forests. No great loss of species was observed. Our findings suggest that most of the original forest species still survive in the understory of the plantation forests. These forests have the potential to follow the successional pathway to broadleaf or mixed forests via thinning or clear-cutting without planting. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dausse, A; Bonis, A; Bouzille, JB; Lefeuvre, JC				Dausse, Armel; Bonis, Anne; Bouzille, Jan-Bernard; Lefeuvre, Jean-Claude			Seed dispersal in a polder after partial tidal restoration: Implications for salt-marsh restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: The vegetation in a polder after partial tidal restoration does not resemble the targeted salt-marsh vegetation. Is this difference in vegetation due to lack of dispersal or unsuitable abiotic conditions ? What could be done for a better restoration of the site? Location: Northwestern France. Methods: Seeds were trapped at the single inlet of the polder with a 200-mu m mesh net to estimate inputs of seeds from the bay. In parallel, seed dispersal was studied in the polder by placing Astroturf(R) seed traps on the surface of the sediment at three different elevations in three distinct areas. Abiotic conditions such as flooding frequency, water table level and soil salinity were monitored. Results: All but one species from the adjacent salt marshes were trapped at the inlet. Not all of these species were on the seed traps inside the polder. Seed dispersal was not homogeneous in the polder and seed trap content mostly discriminated in function of their elevation. Salinity and water logging at the bottom of the slope were very high compared to tolerance of most halophytes but decreased rapidly higher up the slope. Conclusions: The development of salt marsh target species is highly restricted by limited hydrochory inside the polder but also by unfavourable soil conditions induced by the actual hydrological regime. Halophytes are excluded at the bottom of the slope by abiotic conditions and out-competed by sub-halophytes higher up. In order to restore salt marsh vegetation inside the polder, a larger opening should be induced in order to increase the flooded surface, and diminish water logging and flooding frequencies.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				FEB	2008	11	1					3	12		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2008.tb00199.x							WOS:000252958300002						
J	Reinhardt, AC; Galatowitsch, SM				Reinhardt, Adams Carrie; Galatowitsch, Susan M.			The transition from invasive species control to native species promotion and its dependence on seed density thresholds	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Does the seed density of invasive species affect establishment by native species in a bare ground context (following invasive species control efforts), and is it possible to promote transition to a native species dominated state by manipulating sowing density of the native community? Location: Experimental wetland basin in Chanhassen, Minnesota, USA. Methods: A mesocosm experiment investigated the influence of Phalaris arundinacea (invasive species) propagule pressure on establishment of native wet meadow species in the context of a newly restored wetland. Mesocosms were sown with P. arundinacea (0, 10, 50, 100, or 500 seeds/m(2)) and a mix of native species (3000 or 15000 seeds/m(2)). Results: When planted at densities > 100 seeds/m(2), P. arundinacea increased suppression of native species. Also, high native seed density suppressed P. arundinacea biomass production. This effect was more pronounced when P. arundinacea seed density was high (> 100 seeds/m(2)), but high native seed density (15000 seeds/m(2)) did not suppress recruitment of P. arundinacea from seed. Conclusions: The transition from post-control bare ground (a common result of efforts to control invasive species) to native species establishment depends on both native species and invader seed density. These results suggest that a threshold of P. arundinacea propagule pressure exists, beyond which transition to a native community is less likely without management intervention. P. arundinacea can establish in the presence of a newly developing native plant community, even at very low densities of P. arundinacea seed. Invader control (following initial site clearing efforts) is essential to native species establishment.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				FEB	2008	11	1					131	138		10.3170/2007-7-18335							WOS:000252958300014

Comparison of two methods characterising the seed bank of amphibious plants in submerged sediments	AQUATIC BOTANY												We analysed the submerged soil seed bank of three fishponds in the Waldviertel region in Austria. We aimed our study at comparing the efficiency of two methods in detecting seeds quantitatively from soil samples of four characteristic mud-flat species, i.e. Carex bohemica, Coleanthus subtilis, Elatine hexandra, and Eleocharis ovata: the seedling-emergence and the rinsing method. Additionally, the actual vegetation was described based on 65 phytosociological releves. Soil seed bank analyses were based on 31 samples representing the vegetation zonation. Mixed soil samples were portioned into 62 subsamples further treated with the two methods in parallel. Analysis of vegetation revealed a typical zonation with Isoeto-Nanojuncetea communities from the centre of dried-up fishponds to Phragmition/Magnocaricion communities at the shorelines. The study species were detected in the soil seed banks of all vegetation types, but seed abundances were generally higher in two fishponds characterised by muddy substrate than in one sandy mesotrophic pond (with the exception of E. hexandra). Therefore beside the water regime and the vegetation cover, additional factors such as soil type are likely to influence the soil seed bank composition of submerged sediments. The quantitative comparison of the seedling-emergence and the rinsing method revealed significantly higher seed numbers by the rinsing method. As we obtained 5.7 times (Elatine hexandra) to 17.5 times (Coleanthus subtilis) more seeds by rinsing, the averaged detection failure across the four study species was at least 89.7% with the seedling-emergence method. In addition to this advantage in the quantitative description of submerged soil seed bank compositions, the rinsing method enables us to use seeds subsequently for conservation management and revegetation purposes.

J	Giantomasi, A; Tecco, PA; Funes, G; Gurvich, DE; Cabido, M				Giantomasi, Alejandra; Tecco, Paula A.; Funes, Guillermo; Gurvich, Diego E.; Cabido, Marcelo			Canopy effects of the invasive shrub Pyracantha angustifolia on seed bank composition, richness and density in a montane shrubland (Cordoba, Argentina)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Invasive woody species frequently change the composition of the established vegetation and the properties of the soil under their canopies. Accordingly, invasion may well affect regenerative phases of the community, especially at the seed bank level, likely influencing community restoration. Pyracantha angustifolia (Rosaceae) is an invasive shrub in central Argentina that affects woody recruitment, particularly enhancing the recruitment of other exotic woody species. There is though no information regarding its effect on the soil seed bank within the invaded community. The present study was set up to gain further insight into the canopy effects of P. angustifolia. We aimed to assess whether the invasive shrub affects seed bank composition, richness and seed density as compared with the dominant native shrub Condalia montana (Rhamnaceae), and to relate the observed seed bank patterns with those of the established vegetation. We evaluated the composition of the germinable seed bank and the established vegetation under the canopy of 16 shrubs of P. angustifolia, 16 shrubs of C. montana, and in 16 control plots (10 m(2)) without shrub cover. The floristic composition of the seed bank differed among canopy treatments. However, seed bank richness did not differ significantly. There was an overall high seed density of exotic species throughout the study site, though exotic forbs showed significantly lower seed densities under the invasive shrub. Pyracantha angustifolia would not promote the incorporation of new species into the seed bank of the invaded community but rather favour the establishment of woody species that do not depend on seed banks. The absence of dominant woody species in the seed bank, the dominance of exotic forbs, and the high similarity between established exotic species and those present in the seed bank may surely affect community restoration following the main disturbances events observed in the region.

J	Norsworthy, JK				Norsworthy, Jason K.			Effect of tillage intensity and herbicide programs on changes in weed species density and composition in the southeastern coastal plains of the United States	CROP PROTECTION												An experiment was conducted from spring 2001 to 2005 at Blackville, SC, to determine the impact of no-till and glyphosate-resistant crops on changes in the weed community. Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean) was grown in 2001 and 2003, and Zea mays L. (corn) was grown in 2002 and 2004. Tillage each year included no-tillage and conventional tillage (disking and field cultivation prior to crop sowing). Glyphosate-only and nonglyphosate programs were evaluated within each tillage system. Soil cores were collected at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths prior to spring to estimate the seedbank. Weed biomass by species was determined in mid-summer each year, except in 2003. Twenty-seven species were found in soil collected from the test site throughout the study. Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. (large crabgrass), Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats. (Palmer amaranth), and Mollugo verticillata L. (carpetweed) were the dominant weeds in soil at initiation of the experiment. Summer annual grasses comprised more than 20% of total weed biomass in 2001, but less than 1% of total biomass in 2002 and 2004. D. sanguinalis seed density in soil was reduced rapidly in all management systems and was replaced by Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Willd (crowfootgrass) as the dominant summer annual grass. There was an 80-99% reduction in the A. palmeri seed density (0-5 cm depth) during the first year of the study and M. verticillata became the dominant summer annual broad-leaved weed. Perennial weeds comprised <10% of the total weed biomass in 2001, but by 2004, >99% of the total weed biomass was made up of perennial weeds in nonglyphosate systems regardless of tillage treatment. These perennial weeds consisted of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (bermudagrass), Cyperus rotundus L. (purple nutsedge), and Solanum carolinense L. (Carolina horsenettle). The seed density in soil of most species declined over the four cropping seasons. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Poulickova, A; Lysakova, M; Hasler, P; Lelkova, E				Poulickova, Aloisie; Lysakova, Monika; Hasler, Petr; Lelkova, Eva			Fishpond sediments - the source of palaeoecological information and algal "seed banks"	NOVA HEDWIGIA												Sediment samples were taken for the first reconstruction of the eutrophication process in a man-managed fishpond using diatom frustules. Samples were also used for culture experiments in order to make good the lack of information about surviving and/or overwintering of most freshwater cyanobacteria and algae and to assess the significance of this ability in population recurrence. The extraction of a sediment core took place in January 2003, i.e. 43 years after the last restoration by sediment removal. A slow increase of eutrophication is shown by an increasing nitrogen and phosphorus content in the sediment along with changes in the diatom assemblage, especially marked in the shift from attached (Amphora copulata) to planktonic species (Stephanodiscus) tolerating high trophic level. Diatoms (Cyclotella) were observed among the first algae growing in culture experiments. The most frequent green algae encountered were species of Scenedesmus. Flagellates (Chlamydomonas) were observed in the upper layers of sediment. Cyanobacteria were represented by Nostoc and Anabaena. All germinated diatom taxa were also found in the palaeoecological part of the study, but they were not necessarily the most abundant species in the core. Thus the ability to form viable resting stages and/or to grow quickly can have a similar significance for the return of the population. The viable resting stages in the bottom sediment represent a "seed bank" for the potential return of various algal species, depending on the character of sediment disturbances. Superficial disturbances (wind, water circulation, macrozoobenthos) offer a chance for growth from resting stages of more recent populations, but profound disturbances (fish, man - restoration by sediment removal) can cause the rejuvenation of species from deep sediment layers.

The strips were set aside in the grass crop or ploughed at the start of the experiment, and either uncut or cut each autumn. Uncut strips became species-poor and dominated by Elymus repens. Cut strips contained more species than the grass crop but most were generalists or woody species. A few semi-natural species were present in non-experimental field margins bordering the grass crop fields, but few colonized the strips. Setting aside non-fertilized strips is not sufficient to increase plant species richness; further management, e. g., annual cutting and removal of plant material is required. Strips created on fertile soils may be a poor habitat for several semi-natural species and are not likely to contribute to an increased plant species richness of any significance.																	0906-4710						2008	58	1					43	50		10.1080/09064710601160276							WOS:000251632800006						
J	Dzwonko, Z; Loster, S				Dzwonko, Zbigniew; Loster, Stefania			Changes in plant species composition in abandoned and restored limestone grasslands - the effects of tree and shrub cutting	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Abandoned semi-natural limestone grasslands are often overgrown by shrubs and trees. Little is know if and to what extant xerothermic limestone grasslands can be restored by tree cutting. This was tested in a 12-year experiment after the clearing of a 35-year-old secondary pine wood developed on unmanaged grassland in the close proximity of not overgrown old grassland. After 12 years, there were no significant differences in the number of field layer species on the plots in the old and restored grasslands. But over this period the number of meadow species increased in all sites, while the number of xerothermic calcareous species increased significantly only in the old grassland plots. The developing shrub layer negatively influenced the number of nitrophilous and ruderal species in grasslands restored in the former close and open woods, and the number of all species, including the number of non-tufted perennials and perennials with vegetative spread, in the former open wood. The number of meadow species increased in years with higher precipitation in late spring and early summer. The obtained results suggest that in overgrowing grasslands shrubs and trees should be cut every few years, before their covers increase to about 30%. However, this treatment alone will not stop the changes to communities with dominance of tall and vegetatively spreading grasses and forbs. Cutting trees and shrubs in sites where most grassland species have already vanished, without additional managements supporting their dispersal, seedling recruitment and development, is not sufficient to restore limestone grasslands rich in xerothermic species.																	0001-6977	2083-9480					2008	77	1					67	75									WOS:000254674800010						
J	Czarnecka, J				Czarnecka, Joanna			Spatial and temporal variability of seed bank resulting from overgrowing of xerothermic grassland	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The aim of my study was to determine changes in the seed bank and vegetation during the process of overgrowing of the xerothermic grassland situated on the slopes of the White Mountain (349 m a. s. L, the Central Roztocze Region, South-Eastern Poland). I also examined whether the changes of vegetation can be predicted if we know the structure of the burned seed flora. To achieve this goal I used two sets of data: one collected from three different environments (grassland, brushwood and woodland) at the same time (toposequence), and the other collected twice from the same place at the interval of seven years (chronosequence). I stated that the appearance of even a small number of ornitochorous seeds and their seedlings can be treated as a signal that the bush encroachment will accelerate. Seed number seems to decrease during succession in the analysed sequence of plant communities. The total number of species in the seed bank did not change in the most dynamic plant communities: grassland and brushwood, and it was significantly higher there than in the seed bank of woodland. During the time of observation, the most important quantitative and qualitative changes took place in grassland vegetation, which is more similar to brushwood vegetation now than it was at the beginning of the study.																	0001-6977	2083-9480					2008	77	2					157	166									WOS:000257558100009

The primary objective is to measure the effectiveness of Community Seed Banking (CSB) in enhancing diversity while providing productivity incentives. Our results indicate a significant impact of participation in CSB on farm-level agrobiodiversity. However, the level of biodiversity conservation was not found to have the expected reinforcing impact on participation, indicating no support for simultaneity. CSB participation also led to an increase in productivity, consistent with a need for such incentives in order to enhance diversity at a farm level. Our assessment of the performance of the GLS estimator yielded a significant discrepancy between the GLS and bootstrap estimates. This led to the conclusion that bootstrapping asymptotic estimations might be required for appropriate inference.																	0169-5150	1574-0862				JAN	2008	38	1					77	87		10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00283.x							WOS:000251807700008

Fire, which has historically played an important role in defining the prairie landscape, may also play some role in breaking dormancy by producing a variety of biologically active smoke substances. The role of smoke as a germination cue was investigated in this study, during which the ex situ germination of 37 prairie species was measured in response to aerosol smoke treatment. Overall, one third of the species responded positively, while others were either inhibited or exhibited no response at all. Smoke may therefore play a more significant role in maintaining the composition and structure of tallgrass prairie communities than was previously realized.																	0003-0031					JAN	2008	159	1					251	256		10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[251:ESGROM]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000252783900021

Wetland classes (lake, floating emergent, emergent marsh, meadow marsh, fen, and exposed substrate) were delineated through interpretation of aerial photographs for the period 1938 to 1995. Scan vectorization was used to develop a digital data base of wetland classes. Spatial and temporal analyses, conducted in a Geographic Information System (GIS), allowed comparison of trends among and within wetland classes which were linked to water level conditions. In periods with low water levels, overall wetland area increased primarily through expansion of the exposed substrate class lakeward; although meadow marsh also contributed to the increase. While wetland area increased during low water levels, exposed substrate did not markedly add to wetland habitat value but represents potential new wetland area that can be recolonized from seed banks. During high water levels, wetland area decreased as the lake class expanded inland and exposed substrate contracted or disappeared. Fen remained consistent in areal extent and location for most years at Howdenvale, but fen at Baie du Dore expanded with lower water levels, and contracted and became more fragmented with higher levels. At Oliphant, during low water levels fen area did not change, and with high levels the lake flooded the fen. With high water levels, lake area and wetter classes dominated and migrated inland. Under low water level conditions, lake was replaced by exposed substrate and drier wetland classes expanded, but did not necessarily colonize exposed substrate.																	1463-4988						2008	11	2					167	181		10.1080/14634980802104529							WOS:000257032200007

Effect of grazing strategy, ryegrass overdrilling and herbicide application on vulpia content, tiller density and seed production in perennial pastures	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Vulpia species C. C. Gmel. are annual grass weeds that can reduce the productivity of perennial pastures throughout southern Australia. To develop more effective strategies to manage vulpia, a 3-year experiment was established in western Victoria (average annual rainfall: 625 mm) comparing different methods currently used to control this weed. Overdrilling perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seed and simazine application treatments were applied to phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.) pastures that were set-stocked or rotationally grazed (either as a four-paddock or strategic rotation) with Merino ewes. The content of vulpia, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) and other annual grasses as a proportion of total dry matter increased, and the proportion of phalaris decreased in most grazing treatments throughout the experiment. The mean vulpia content was lowest and the phalaris content was highest in the four-paddock rotation, whereas vulpia content was greatest and phalaris content was lowest under set-stocking. Simazine application in June with or without ryegrass overdrilling reduced the number of vulpia tillers/m(2) in 2000 and 2001 and vulpia panicle production in 2000, although vulpia populations increased to pretreatment levels in herbicide-treated swards by 2002. The number of vulpia seeds in the soil seed bank was not affected by any of the treatments. The most effective treatment was a combination of ryegrass overdrilling and herbicide application in the four-paddock, rotationally grazed pastures. This experiment highlights the need for an integrated approach to manage vulpia since relying on herbicide application alone is ineffective. This is particularly the case when competitive pasture species are unable to adequately utilise available resources and prevent a recovery in vulpia populations.																	0816-1089						2008	48	5					632	640		10.1071/EA06144							WOS:000254670600006						
J	Martinkova, J; Klimesova, J; Mihulka, S				Martinkova, Jana; Klimesova, Jitka; Mihulka, Stanislav			Compensation of seed production after severe injury in the short-lived herb Barbarea vulgaris	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												A pot experiment with the common ruderal herb Barbarea vulgaris (Brassicaceae) was set up to elucidate to what extent short-lived species sprouting from roots regenerate and compensate for seed production after damage. We tested if sprouting from roots ensures survival after severe aboveground biomass damage, but the number of seeds produced declines with increasing severity of injury, decreasing nutrient availability and progress in the life cycle at the time of injury. Plants of B. vulgaris were cultivated in a 3-year garden experiment at two nutrient levels (high vs. low). During the experiment, two levels of injury severity were applied: high (removal of all aboveground biomass) and low (removal of aboveground biomass leaving basal axillary buds intact). Damage was applied at four life-cycle phases: young rosette, overwintered rosette, flowering plant and fruiting plant. All injured plants survived and resprouted irrespective of life-cycle phase, severity of injury and nutrient availability. Injury significantly affected seed production and also the plants' life cycle. Plants injured in the second year of their life (overwintered rosette, flowering plant and fruiting plant) postponed reproduction to the third season (in the case of high injury severity) or their seed production was lower than in intact plants (in the case of low injury severity). In plants injured in the first life year, seed production and life cycle were not influenced. Nutrient level only marginally affected resprouting after injury and seed production. The experiment showed that the ability to sprout from roots enables plants to survive a 100% loss of aboveground biomass, and to keep some seed production or even compensate it. The short-lived ruderal species B. vulgaris successfully copes with severe disturbance by resprouting and does not rely only on its seed bank. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

However, buried seeds face several mortality factors, including the decay caused by microbial activity. Recent seed burial studies involving both fungicide-treated seeds and untreated seeds provide evidence for the importance of saprophytic soil fungi as a seed mortality factor. In this review, we summarize the available evidence. We discuss the influence of abiotic and biotic environmental factors, the specificity of plant-fungal associations at the seed level and mechanisms of resistance to seed decay. Finally, we discuss implications for plant communities and for the biocontrol of agricultural weeds. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Ramula, S				Ramula, Satu			Responses to the timing of damage in an annual herb: Fitness components versus population performance	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The timing of damage plays an important role in plant fitness but its effect on population performance has received relatively little attention. I examined the effect of the timing of damage on nine components of fitness and population performance in four populations of the annual Melampyrum pratense by clipping plants at the vegetative stage (early clipping) or at the beginning of the flowering period (late clipping). I estimated population performance using a matrix population model that predicts the long-term population growth rate, A. In early clipping, the plants were usually able to compensate for the damage during the growing season. In consequence, early clipping reduced A in only one out of four populations, whereas late clipping reduced it in three populations. The elasticity analyses revealed that the relative importance of different demographic transitions to A varied among the populations. This among-population variation in the sensitivities of to demographic transitions makes it difficult to use changes in specific fitness components as a measure of population performance for annual plants with a seed bank. The current study illustrates that although early-season damage may have a negligible impact on population dynamics in annual plants, the effect of the timing of damage often varies among populations.

Elimination of this species is required since it hinders secondary succession. In June 2006 broadcast-applied glyphosate was sprayed to three oldfileds. Broadcast application of glyphosate affects both target and non-target species in the plant community. In June 2006 and 2007, percentage cover of vascular plant species was estimated in 1 m(2) plots. Relative abundance of categories of seed bank types and time of seed production were used to explore the effects of herbicide treatment on the resident vegetation. The revealed changes showed that non-target vegetation was significantly affected by the extensive herbicide application in the study sites. The time of seed production has more predictive value on the nature of vegetation changes than does soil seed bank type. Species producing seeds before glyphosate application gained advantage in contrast with species of usual seed production after the glyphosate treatment. The abundance of species with different seed bank types changed according to the time of seed production.																	0133-3720						2008	36		3	S			1587	1590									WOS:000260964100049

Effects of cattle grazing timing and intensity on soil seed banks and regeneration strategies in a Mediterranean grassland	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The relationship between the soil seed bank at the onset of the growing season and file Structure of the ensuing vegetation under grazing was investigated in an eastern Mediterranean grassland. Species responses to two contrasting, Cattle grazing regimes were Studied through plant trait analyses. Traits included plant size, phenology, seed size and germination fraction. Changes in species composition of the soil seed bank and the vegetation were analyzed using a plant Functional group approach. The results showed that seed bank and relative cover of tall annual and perennial grasses increased when grazed late in the growing season. The opposite was noted for short annual grasses, annual legumes, annual thistles, annual crucifers and other annual forbs. Grazing treatments little affected plant cover of herbaceous perennials. Tall annual and fall perennial grasses have large seeds and germination rates over 90%. Short annual grasses showed similarly high germination rates but with smaller seeds. Annual legumes were characterized by medium size seeds and lower germination fractions (<50%). Tall annual grasses showed high competition capabilities at late grazed paddocks due to a combination of regeneration traits that included: high germination fraction, larger seed and seedling size, and inflorescence with morphological defenses. It is proposed that in addition to plant size and palatability, regeneration traits such as seed dormancy, seed and seedling size play an important role in determining the vegetation structure under different grazing regimes, thus contributing to the high plant species diversity characteristic to Mediterranean grasslands.																	1585-8553	1588-2756					2008	9			S			97	106		10.1556/ComEc.9.2008.S.14							WOS:000263432100014						
J	Middleton, B; Wu, XB				Middleton, Beth; Wu, X. Ben			Landscape pattern of seed banks and anthropogenic impacts in forested wetlands of the northern Mississippi River Alluvial Valley	ECOSCIENCE												Agricultural development on floodplains contributes to hydrologic alteration and forest fragmentation, which may alter landscape-level processes. These changes may be related to shifts in the seed bank composition of floodplain wetlands. We examined the patterns of seed bank composition across a floodplain watershed by looking at the number of seeds germinating per m(2) by species in 60 farmed and intact forested wetlands along the Cache River watershed in Illinois. The seed bank composition was compared above and below a water diversion (position), which artificially subdivides the watershed. Position of these wetlands represented the most variability of Axis 1 in a Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) analysis of site environmental variables and their relationship to seed bank composition (coefficient of determination for Axis 1: r(2) = 0.376; Pearson correlation of position to Axis 1: r = 0.223). The 3 primary axes were also represented by other site environmental variables, including farming status (farmed or unfarmed), distance from the mouth of the river, latitude, and longitude. Spatial analysis based on Mantel correlograms showed that both water-dispersed and wind/water-dispersed seed assemblages had strong spatial structure in the upper Cache (above the water diversion), but the spatial structure of water-dispersed seed assemblage was diminished in the lower Cache (below the water diversion), which lost floodpulsing. Bearing analysis also suggested that water-dispersal process had a stronger influence on the overall spatial pattern of seed assemblage in the upper Cache, while wind/water-dispersal process had a stronger influence in the lower Cache. An analysis of the landscapes along the river showed that the mid-lower Cache (below the water diversion) had undergone greater land cover changes associated with agriculture than did the upper Cache watershed. Thus, the combination of forest fragmentation and hydrologic changes in the surrounding landscape may have had an influence on the seed bank composition and spatial distribution of the seed banks of the Cache River watershed. Our study suggests that the spatial pattern of seed bank composition may be influenced by landscape-level factors and processes.				Wu, X. Ben/E-3772-2010; Middleton, Beth/D-1778-2014	Wu, X.

Factors influencing landscape pattern of the seagrass Halophila decipiens in an oceanic setting	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The scale of landscape pattern formation of an ecological community may provide clues as to the processes influencing its spatial and temporal dynamics. We conducted an examination of the spatial organization of an annual seagrass (Halophila decipiens) in an open ocean setting at two spatial scales and growing seasons to identify the relative influence of external (hurricanes) versus internal (clonal growth) factors. Visual surveys of seagrass cover were conducted over 2 years within three replicate I km 2 study areas each separated by similar to 25 km in an inshore-offshore transect along the southwest coast of Florida at depths between similar to 10 and 30 m. A towed video sled allowed observations of seagrass cover of 1 m(2) areas approximately every 6 m over thousands of meters of evenly spaced transects within the study areas (coarse scale). The towed video revealed that 17.5% of the seafloor was disturbed irrespective of location or sample time. Randomly selected 10 x 10 m quadrats within the larger, 1 km(2) study areas were completely surveyed for seagrass cover by divers at 0.625 m(2) resolution (fine scale). The coarse-scale observations were tested using both conventional geostatistics and an application of a time-series technique (Runs test) for scale of seagrass cover contiguity. Fine-scale observations were examined using conventional geostatistics and a least squares approach (cumulative logistic). The coarse-scale observations revealed little scale dependency and indicated that the structure was organized at spatial extents finer than our sample spacing; the cumulative logistic technique revealed potential fine-scale patterns not otherwise discerned. In contrast, surveys of the 10 x 10 m quadrats detected strong scale dependency with multiple small gaps, indicating scale-dependent patterns arising from processes operating at extents generally < 14 m. Between June and October 1999, a Category I hurricane passed over the study area, rearranging large areas of sand that uncovered some rocky hard bottom areas, while covering others; by the next growing season the newly covered areas were vegetated with Halophila decipiens that likely arose from transported seeds. Spatial analysis revealed that the storm led to a shift to greater frequency of H. decipiens, but lower density coverage. Seagrass density remained substantially depressed in all areas a full year following the storm. The short life history of H. decipiens and the apparent existence of a moveable seed bank means that spatial organization of this community is dictated first by large-scale dispersal of plant propagules (hundreds of meters) and then within a growing season, by clonal organization of the seagrass operating over very small distances (m). The two techniques (semivariance and Runs test) led to similar conclusions regarding the organizational scales of seagrass landscape pattern. As with terrestrial examples, this study demonstrates the importance of selecting the appropriate scale for detection of landscape pattern and processes influencing population ecology of a seagrass ecosystem.

Oilseed rape volunteers play a major role and the survival, dormancy and emergence of the volunteer seeds left after oilseed rape crops are key processes for gene flow. In the present paper, these processes were analysed and modelled in detail for integration into the GENESYS model, which quantifies the effects of cropping systems on spatio-temporal gene flow. In this model, seed bank dynamics are the result of seed survival, dormancy induction, dormancy cycles, germination processes and pre-emergent shoot growth in soil. These biological processes depend on tillage tools and dates, in interaction with temperature and soil moisture. The model was evaluated by comparing its simulations to independent field data on volunteer emergence after different tillage strategies and in different cropping systems. Finally, the model was used to simulate the effect of tillage strategies on volunteer densities in winter cereals and the adventitious presence of GM seeds in non-GM oilseed rape crops in case of temporal and/or spatial co-existence of GM and non-GM oilseed rape varieties.

J	Weiterova, I				Weiterova, Iva			Seasonal and spatial variance of seed bank species composition in an oligotrophic wet meadow	FLORA												Seasonal and small-scale spatial variation of the seed bank in an oligotrophic wet meadow (Molinion) was assessed by two methods: (1) direct determination of seeds extracted from soil samples (6 cm in diameter, 10 cm depth) and (2) germination of seeds according to Ter Heerdt et al. [1996. An improved method for seed bank analysis: seedling emergence after removing the soil by sieving. Funct. Ecol. 10, 144-151]. Samples were taken three times during the year (July and November 2001, March 2002) from three distinct microhabitats (moss layer, gaps, Molinia caerulea tussocks). Using the extraction method, more seeds were found in the upper 0-3 cm soil layer than in the deeper 3-7 cm layer, significant differences in the number of seeds were found among microhabitats (with the lowest seed bank densities in Molinia tussocks). The highest number of seeds was found in the spring census, but the test was not significant (P < 0.10). However, seasonal variation was found when damaged seeds were included in the analysis. Changes in damaged/undamaged and light/heavy seed ratios, and in numbers of grass/herbs/sedges seeds are also discussed. The spatial distribution of seeds is probably influenced to a great degree by abiotic factors, such as microtopography (round and heavy seeds of sedges prevail in gaps and in deeper soil layers). The species composition of the seed bank varied among microhabitats, depth, and throughout the year. No differences were found by the seed germination method. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Klug-Pumpel, B; Scharfetter-Lehrl, G				Klug-Puempel, Brigitte; Scharfetter-Lehrl, Gabriele			Soil diaspore reserves above the timberline in the Austrian Alps	FLORA												Soil diaspore reserves are considered to support self-healing processes after vegetation disturbances. Therefore, the stratified reserves of viable diaspores in superimposed soil layers of four sites above the timberline in the Austrian Alps were assessed. At each site, a semi-natural ("undisturbed") extensive alpine pasture and the disturbed vegetation on hiking trails were investigated. Eighty soil cores in total (corresponding to 400 slices, each representing a I-cm layer between 0 and 5 cm depth) were taken in autumn and subjected to germination tests after vernalization. The total diaspore numbers in disturbed and undisturbed plots did not differ significantly, but all undisturbed soils contained higher species numbers than disturbed ones. Seed shape and size clearly influenced the vertical distribution. Intact soils showed a significant decrease in big/long diaspores with increasing soil depth. Disturbances influenced the aboveground species composition and therefore the distribution of seeds of different size. In case of disturbances, the restriction of most big seeds to superficial layers means a threat for small populations of rare and protected species such as Viola lutea subsp. sudetica with relatively big seeds near the soil surface. When the disturbances stop, the diaspore communities might initiate a first, but with respect of landscape protection and preservation of species diversity insufficient step of vegetation restoration.

The analysed accessions refer to 148 taxonomic units belonging to 102 genera and 47 families, typical of the Sardinian flora, and of the Mediterranean basin in general. The images of diaspores were acquired by a flatbed scanner and elaborated with a macro specially developed for the morphometric and colorimetric measurements. This method allowed carrying out a database for the characterization of autochthonous germplasm in entry to the bank and the realization of statistic classifiers for the discrimination of genera and species within the following families: Apiaceae, Boraginaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Cistaceae, Fabaceae and Scrophulariaceae. Such classifiers, based oil the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique and checked by cross-validation. showed a performance included between 74.3% and 96.4%. In addition. for the genus Astragalus, it was possible to elaborate a classifier able to identify very similar taxa of a species complex, obtaining a performance between 83.7% and 100%. Such analysis proved the validity of the methodology also from the taxonomic point of view. Suggestions for subsequent methodological progress, which Could offer applications in other research issues, Such as ecological analysis, soil seed bank and archaeological botany are proposed.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Prescribed fire is a widely applied management tool in native forests. There have been concerns raised about the ecological impacts of prescribed fire on native flora. One aspect of the debate is the extent to which prescribed fire heats the soil to levels reported to trigger germination in the soil seed banks. We used Thermochrons to test soil temperatures at 2 and 5 cm in prescribed burns in dry sclerophyll forests. Soil temperatures during the burns were generally low (< 40 degrees C) with less than 5% of sites being exposed to temperatures necessary for the germination of fire-dependent shrub species. High temperatures were associated with high fuel consumption and large woody debris. This information suggests that prescribed fires, carried out according to standard practices, in these forests are unlikely to trigger germination in the majority of the soil-stored seed banks. If ecological burns in these forests are aimed at promoting populations of senescing obligate seeder species, they need to be hotter than standard practice if they are to achieve their objectives, although we acknowledge that there are inherent risks associated with hotter burns.

Moreover, this pattern is predicted to increase owing to global change. Although a reduction in the density and growth of post-fire regeneration is usually observed in recurrently burnt areas, the potential effects on reproductive ability have seldom been explored. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether structural changes induced by fire recurrence may constrain reproduction ability of Pinus halepensis forests. We conducted the current study in Catalonia (NE Spain) in 12 study sites, consisting of two adjacent areas differing in the number of fire events suffered throughout the last 16 years (one v. two fires). Twice-burnt areas showed a lower density of pines, lower pine height and a lower reproductive ability, namely (i) a 3-year delay in the onset of pine reproduction; (ii) a reduction of 52% in the number of reproductive pines; and (iii) a 36% lower mean cone crop per tree. The lower mean cone production per tree coupled with a lower density resulted in an similar to 80% lower canopy seed bank in twice-burnt areas. These results suggest that the occurrence of a third fire event in twice-burnt areas would severely constrain natural regeneration.

Dune slack restoration in Dutch mainland coastal dunes	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												The 45,000 ha Dutch dunes are relatively well protected but they suffer from severe desiccation. During the last decade a lot of knowledge has been obtained about the steering processes of eco-hydrology in dunes resulting in well-founded schemes to restore wet dune slack communities. In two case studies a large-scale restoration of the landscape was necessary. Since 1987 in the North-Holland Dune Reserve the groundwater catchment has been reduced (from 8 million m(3) to 2 million m3 per year) and the resulting development monitored. In another case, large-scale intervention on 35 ha of the Amsterdam Water Supply Dunes in 1995 resulted in the restoration of active sand drift with opportunities for the establishment of pioneer vegetation. In small parts of the area, the surface has stabilised as a result of vegetation growth, but elsewhere drifting sand has spread and covered previously stable surfaces. Many wet to moist dune slacks developed and results relating to geomorphology, hydrology and vegetation are presented. Finally, in 1996 yet another project of 50 ha was carried out in the Meijendel dunes, in which infiltration ponds were removed to allow vegetation succession to develop from scratch. Results of these three case studies will be presented. If only hydrological restoration is carried out, sod-cutting was found to be necessary to restore the whole series of vegetation types of dune slacks. In two cases an area was denuded. The seed bank and surrounding slacks seem to play an important role in the success of restoration, this is especially true for the pioneer vegetation types. Future monitoring will prove whether critical (Red List) plant species will return.

Sites with recent Aquatic Warbler records showed shorter and sparser vegetation, a thinner litter layer, and a higher total plant species richness and cover of small and least competitive (CSR) species than abandoned or unoccupied sites. On a long-term study plot, during a period of late mowing and subsequent cessation of land use, vegetation height increased, the cover of CSR species decreased, and the site became abandoned by Aquatic Warblers. The probability of Aquatic Warbler occurrence was dependent on elevation and increased with the proportion of early mown or grazed area in the preceding year, with early use being most important on slightly higher elevated sites. This rapid deterioration of eutrophic habitats by delayed or discontinued land use is atypical for the majority of Aquatic Warbler breeding habitats. We conclude that both late or no land use and land use during the breeding season negatively affect the Pomeranian breeding sites and that a more sophisticated and flexible land management is urgently needed.																	2193-7192	2193-7206				JAN	2008	149	1					105	115		10.1007/s10336-007-0241-2							WOS:000251592100012

Investigations on weed infestation in the multi-year cultivation of glyphosate-resistant maize	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					24th German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 04-06, 2008	Stuttgart Hohenheim, GERMANY					The influence of different herbicide treatments on weed infestation was investigated in field studies in a continuous transgenic herbicide-resistant maize rotation. The studies, at 3 representative sites in Germany, began in 2003 and will extend over a total period of 6 years. The focus of the studies was the comparison between representative local treatments and potential standard treatments in the glyphosate-resistant maize with the split application of 2 x 3 1/ha Roundup Ready (360g/l glyphosate). A total of 68 weed species were found in the weed seed bank, while only 38 weed species occurred in the field appraisals. Fourteen weed species occurred in the studies at least 75% of the time, while many others occurred only sporadically. The spectrum of weed species and number of weed seeds in the soil were highly location-dependent, although the diversity tended to increase over the test period independently of the herbicide treatment. Above all Amaranthus retroflexus, Solanum nigrum, Veronica persica and Chenopodium album had high fecundity, so that there were increasing numbers of seeds in the ground in almost all treatment variants. Only the Roundup Ready treatment showed a slight decrease by 10% in comparison from the first year to the third year. The composition and relative frequency of weeds, however, did not differ from the local standard treatment. A selection for certain weed species could not be identified.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2008					21		57	62									WOS:000255966400011

Emergence and establishment of volunteer oilseed rape in spring and winter crops	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					24th German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 04-06, 2008	Stuttgart Hohenheim, GERMANY					Volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) can contribute to gene dispersal by pollen flow or by seed admixtures. The study should analyse the competition capacity of different crops towards oilseed rape volunteers. A field with a large soil seed bank of oilseed rape was planted with three winter crops (winter turnip rape (replacing oilseed rape, similar performance of turnip and oilseed rape presumed), winter barley, winter wheat) and three spring crops (faba beans, spring barley, maize). The crops were managed according best management practice and compared with "fallow" plots where all operations were similar to the crop plots, except sowing. The fallows should allow assessing the competition of crops and volunteers. The crop with the lowest competition capacity and highest risk for gene dispersal by oilseed rape volunteers was turnip rape (30 volunteers m(-2)), most of which flowered and set seeds (475 seeds plant(-1)), and thus exceeded the labelling threshold for transgenic admixture. Half as much volunteers established in faba beans (14 plants m(-2)), flowered and set seed (13 plants m(-2)) Though flowering volunteers were observed in spring barley, no seeds were produced. Volunteers emerged in all other crops as well, but reached neither flowering nor seed maturity. The comparison of crop and fallow showed that turnip rape, winter wheat and spring barley had the highest competition capacity towards oilseed rape volunteers. If the management practise (use of herbicides) is additionally taken into account, the crops with the lowest risk of gene dispersal by volunteer oilseed rape were maize, winter wheat and winter barley. The fallow plots were useful to assess the potential of emerging volunteers from the soil seed bank, and of gene dispersal. Plots like these (10-20 m(2)) could be routinely established in commercial fields as control measurement for model calculations and predictions in terms of risk assessment.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2008					21		193	198									WOS:000255966400033						
J	Saska, P				Saska, P.			Temporal dynamics of seed predation upon shed seeds of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					24th German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 04-06, 2008	Stuttgart Hohenheim, GERMANY					Control of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) volunteers represents a big challenge to farmers since they compete with subsequent crops. During the harvest, large quantities of seeds are shed on the soil surface, where they either germinate or enter soil seed bank. Seed predation may represent a natural means of mortality of these seeds. in this study the temporal dynamics of predation upon rape seeds on the soil surface and the nature of the seed predators were studied in two localities (Praha-Uhrineves and Praha-Ruzyne) and two seasons (2006 and 2007). Temporal dynamic was studied using seed cards, presented in 3-4 sampling dates inside the plots with organic winter rape. The exposure continued for 7 days, during which invertebrates were collected using pitfall traps. The cards were put either in a cage which prevented vertebrate predators from predation on seeds, or freely so all surface active predators could eat the seeds, in order to reveal the nature of the predators. Seed predation varied with time and between sites in both years. No effect of caging was found in 2006 but appeared in spring 2007 in Praha-Uhrineves. No correlation between seed predation in cages and activity density of carabid beetles was found in any of the sites and years, suggesting that other underlying processes affecting the dynamics of seed predation are involved.

Assessed parameters were weed seedling emergence, crop-weed competition, seedlings mortality, herbicide efficacy, seed production and viability. It was found that most of the tested population parameters were weed density dependent. With increasing weed density weed biomass and fecundity increased in this study. Seed viability showed no correlation to density biomass or seed production rate. All findings support that weed density has to be considered in weed management strategies.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2008					21		209	214									WOS:000255966400036

JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					24th German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 04-06, 2008	Stuttgart Hohenheim, GERMANY					Volunteers originating from crop harvest losses can cause many serious problems in agroecosystems due to the competition with crops, admixture in harvest product, hosting of pests and diseases etc. Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) represents one of the most important volunteers worldwide. After the crop harvest, large quantities of seeds survive on the soil surface, where they stay until germination or enter the soil seed bank. Seed predation by herbivores is an useful tool that may significantly reduce the seed input in the soil seed bank and in this way reduce the abundance of volunteers in the subsequent crop. In this study, we investigated which groups of invertebrate seed predators are involved in the depletion of rape seeds on the soil surface. Nine carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and one terrestrial isopod (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscoidea) which were most abundant in pitfall traps placed in the rape fields were observed under laboratory conditions. Laboratory essay in which 50 dry seeds of winter rape were offered to individual beetles or isopods revealed that Pseudoophonus rufipes, Pterostichus melanarius and Amara ovata consumed the highest numbers of seeds per mass unit. Harpalus affinis, Poecilus cupreus, A. aenea, A. familiaris, and A. littorea consumed fewer seeds per mass unit, and H. signaticornis and the isopod species Armadillidium vulgare ate the rape seeds only occasionally. Surprisingly, carnivorous carabids significantly contributed to seed predation.

Effects of introducing organic farming on the population ecology and diversity of arable weeds	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					24th German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 04-06, 2008	Stuttgart Hohenheim, GERMANY					On the FAM research station in Scheyern, southern Bavaria, Germany, the effects of introducing organic farming on arable weed populations were investigated for 10 years on 31.2 ha of arable land. In the present study, the results on the two following questions will be discussed. First, which effects do cultivating individual crops have on the arable weed populations? After the conversion, a significant increase in weed densities occurred, however, an increased cultivation of cover crops and underseeds, reduced weed populations from the 4(th) year on. Grass clover proved to be particularly efficient on that score. Second, which effects does the conversion have on the species diversity and on the occurrence of rare species? After the change of management, the number of species increased from 16 to 34.5 per 100 m(2). Since the 6(th) year, however, these values declined again. Since this development goes along with the decrease in the population sizes, increased cultivation of cover crops is again considered to be the reason. The rare species were generally favoured by organic farming, however, several species were not able to use these improved living conditions.

Effect of long-term organic farming on weed seed-bank	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					24th German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 04-06, 2008	Stuttgart Hohenheim, GERMANY					Weed seed-bank response to organic farming duration under two different crop rotations was investigated. Longterm organic farming increases the diversity of weed species in "good" and "poor" crop rotation by 30 and 57%. The amount of weed seeds in the soil in the ninth year of organic farming in "good" crop rotations decreases by 41.6%, while in "poor" crop rotation it tended to increase compared to the beginning of transition period. Most of seeds found in 0-25 cm soil layer were therophytes, germinate in summer and spread barochory. Both in "good" and "poor" crop rotations and both survey years qualitative (number of species) and quantitative (10(3) seeds per m(-2) of soil layer 0-25 cm.) distribution of weeds into biological groups and types of dispersal was even. Long-term organic farming determined uneven quantitative distribution of weeds into ecophysiological and ecological groups. This farming increases the amount of seeds that belongs to indifferent to soil pH, nitrogen rich and dry-moderately moist soil weed species.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2008					21		379	384									WOS:000255966400067						
J	Bell, SS; Fonseca, MS; Kenworthy, WJ				Bell, Susan S.; Fonseca, Mark S.; Kenworthy, W. Judson			Dynamics of a subtropical seagrass landscape: links between disturbance and mobile seed banks	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Disturbance is a well known modifier of landscapes. In marine systems hurricanes may not only remove or bury subtidal seagrasses but they may also impact the seed banks of these taxa. We ask whether seagrass landscape pattern and seed dispersal are influenced by physical disturbance in a subtropical deep water setting. We examined the spatial dynamics of an offshore landscape composed of the seagrass, Halophila decipiens in summer 1999 and again in 2000 after the passage of a hurricane. A towed video camera was used to collect data within a 1 km(2) area and construct benthic maps of seagrass, macroalgae, hard bottom outcrops, and sediments from over 20,000 video frames. The appearance of sand and seagrass at a portion of the site in summer 2000 that was previously hard substrate verified sediment and seed movement. Although seeds released by this seagrass are deposited into sediments near parent plants, movement en masse of the seagrass seed reservoir appears to be an important component of dispersal. The generation of new landscape patches when disturbance is large and intense suggests that large-scale disturbance, resulting in the local redistribution of sediment and the seed bank, appears to mold the spatial signature of the resulting seagrass landscape in a MidShelf area. This impact of physical disturbance differs from that previously reported for factors influencing spatial arrangements of seagrass in shallow waters but has some features similar to those of large infrequent disturbances studied in terrestrial settings.																	0921-2973						2008	23			1			67	74		10.1007/s10980-007-9137-z							WOS:000252922800006

LISTY CUKROVARNICKE A REPARSKE												In the Czech Republic, Senecio vulgaris occurs in all growing areas from lowlands to mountain areas. it emerges especially from the soil surface and shallow soil depths, where achenes are influenced by solar radiation and where the concentration Of CO2 is relatively low. Even if this species can emerge during the whole vegetation period, the main wave of emergence occurs in spring (April) and in the end of summer and early autumn (August, September). Achene longevity in the soil is relatively low and when dissemination is prevented, then soil seed bank is depleted in a short period of time. Senecio vulgaris act as a weed in sugar beet stands especially in the beginning of vegetation. It can not compete with the beet after closure of the crop canopy; the only exceptions are gappy and worse closed stands where the weed can obtain enough light. In sugar beet stands, common groundsel can be controlled by the majority of commonly used herbicides, like: desmedipham, phenmedipham, or triflusulfuron. In later growth stages of the weed, only clopyralid shows sufficient efficacy.

A post-fire management model to improve Aleppo pine forest resilience	MODELLING, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF FOREST FIRES	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				1st International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Forest Fires	2008	Univ Castilla, La Mancha Campus, Toledo, SPAIN	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm	Univ Castilla, La Mancha Campus			The number of forest fires, their severity and recurrence, the surface burned and the duration of fire risk season have increased in the Mediterranean basin over the last few decades. These factors promoted an increase of naturally regenerated, unmanaged pine forests and as a consequence, the risk of new wildfires. Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis mill.) is an obligate seeder adapted to fire-prone habitats, and a very important timber species affected by this phenomenon. In eastern Spain alone more than 100 000 ha of Aleppo pine forests were burned in summer, 1994. One of the forests (naturally regenerated) was selected in order to design an adequate post-fire management model. Several plots were set in two different sites of the fires considered. Silvicultural treatments were carried out at five and ten years after the fire. All trees in the selected plots were marked and monitored. Growth, reproductive characteristics and several allometric parameters were measured in the treated plots. Several measurements in burned (all treated and control plots) and unburned plots were recorded in order to obtain structural patterns and biodiversity indices, The plots thinned ten years after the fire and the unburned plots showed a regular, non-aggregated distribution pattern and low diameter differentiation. Also, these thinned plots showed biodiversity characteristics similar to mature stands. The increases and final values for growth and reproductive characteristics measured in the monitored plots were different for each site but thinning improved growth and the amount of seeds stored in the canopy, thus insuring a more successful regeneration should fire affect the same site again in the early life stages. The optimal management policy obtained improves growth and reproductive processes, shortens the juvenile phase, accelerates the mature age and increases the canopy seed bank. It reduces the immaturity risk and improves the post-fire resilience.

We studied the effect of seed age and seed dormancy on germination and seedling establishment of an endangered species of cactus (Mammillaria huitzilopochtli) from Oaxaca, Mexico, in controlled and natural conditions. Germination experiments were conducted in greenhouse conditions and seedling survival was assessed in controlled and natural areas. We found that M. huitzilopochtli has non-dormant seeds and that germination occurred during the first seven days after sowing for seeds less than one year old ((x) over bar = 90%). Germination decreased with time, which indicated that this species might be able to form a transient seed bank (maximum one year old). Scarification treatments in M. huitzilopochtli did not interact with seed age response and did not enhance germination percentages, asserting that seeds are nondormant. When compared with other species of the same genus inhabiting the same region, we conclude that dormancy in cacti is probably more related to environmental heterogeneity than to phylogenetic constraints. Similar to the majority of cacti species, seedlings of M. huitzilopochtli only established in shade conditions. The seeds and seedling traits of this endangered species must be taken into account for conservation programs. Because few seeds were produced yearly, no seeds could be stored at room conditions for long time periods (> 2 yr) and seedling survival was low (mean = 13.75%).

J	Brown, RL; Chenoweth, J				Brown, Rebecca L.; Chenoweth, Joshua			The effect of Glines Canyon Dam on hydrochorous seed dispersal in the Elwha River	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Hydrochory, the dispersal of seeds by water, is important for maintaining the diversity and genetic continuity of riparian plant communities. Dams may reduce levels of hydrochory to downstream reaches by trapping seeds within their impoundments. On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, we studied whether hydrochory in the Elwha River was affected by the Glines Canyon Dam. We also explored whether Lake Mills, the dam's impoundment, holds a hidden seed bank of trapped hydrochorous seeds, which may aid in revegetation after the dam is removed. Hydrochory levels were sampled during three time periods in July and August, 2005 using floating and submerged drift nets above and below Glines Canyon Dam. The Lake Mills seed bank was sampled along transects across Lake Mills. For all drift net samples there was a 90% reduction in seed abundance and 84% reduction in species richness below Glines Canyon Dam. The decline in seed abundance was seen at each of the three sampling times. Similar numbers of seeds were found in both floating and submerged nets, suggesting that buoyancy is not required for hydrochory in this system. Relatively few seeds germinated from the Lake Mills seed bank. There was no relationship between seed density and distance from the Lake Mills delta; however seed density declined with increasing water depth. Our results suggest that Glines Canyon Dam has reduced the rate of hydrochory in the Elwha River, which may cause fragmentation of the riparian flora and reduced diversity of riparian species below the dam.																	0029-344X						2008	82				SI		197	209		10.3955/0029-344X-82.S.I.197							WOS:000256791700016

OIKOS												There are indications that a persistent seed bank can protect small and isolated plant populations from local extinction. Genetic mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon are the increase of local effective population size - and hence the decrease of genetic drift - through a reservoir of persistent seeds, and the accumulation of intergenerational genetic diversity in the seed bank. To find evidence for these mechanisms, we conducted two formal meta-analyses. First, we analyzed 42 published habitat fragmentation studies and investigated whether the degree of genetic differentiation between fragmented plant populations was mediated by seed longevity. Second, we reviewed 13 published studies reporting the genetic diversity of both the seed bank and the above ground plants, aiming at comparing genetic diversity contained in the seed bank with the above ground vegetation. We conclude that a persistent seed bank may indeed mitigate the consequences of habitat fragmentation and protect a species from genetic drift and population genetic differentiation. We found no evidence, however, of high levels of genetic diversity accumulating in the soil seed bank. If genetic differences are present between the standing crop and the seed bank, they are very likely the result of local selection acting either directly or indirectly as a filter on the alleles present in the seed bank. We finally suggest that 1) the role of the seed bank should not be neglected in habitat fragmentation studies and 2) it is not very fruitful to continue comparing seed bank genetic diversity with above ground plant genetic diversity, unless this is performed under different selection regimes.

Characteristics of the Psidium cattleianum (myrtaceae) seed bank in Hawaiian lowland wet forests	PACIFIC SCIENCE												Psidium cattleianum Sabine (strawberry guava) is one of Hawai'i's most disruptive alien plants. Dense stands can suppress growth and establishment of native species, support high populations of crop-damaging fruit flies, and preclude restoration or management of native forests. Our research investigated factors affecting persistence of P. cattleianum seeds in lowland wet forest soils. We collected soil cores from four forested sites immediately after fruit fall and 6.5 months later. We found abundant germination of P. cattleianum, seeds immediately after fruit drop. Soil collected under mature P. cattleianum clumps yielded 761 viable seeds/m(2). We found no viable seeds 6.5 months after fruit drop. We evaluated seed longevity using seed bags buried below the litter layer that we retrieved after 28, 56, 196, and 365 days. Seeds either germinated or deteriorated rapidly after fruit drop; after 28 days, 22.3% of the buried seeds were viable and there were no viable seeds at 196 days. Predator effects were assessed using trays with a known number of seeds with and without predator exclosures. After 28 days, 37% of the seeds in the open trays were damaged by predators. The lack of a persistent seed bank likely is due to a combination of rapid, high germination rates, postdispersal seed predation, and seed mortality. We suggest that chemical or mechanical control efforts would be most efficient and effective if conducted at least 3 months after the fruiting season, when the vast majority of seeds have either germinated or died.																	0030-8870					JAN	2008	62	1					129	135		10.2984/1534-6188(2008)62[129:COTPCM]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000251102300008

Seed banks of invasive Australian Acacia species in South Africa: Role in invasiveness and options for management	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Despite impressive efforts at clearing stands of invasive Australian Acacia species in South Africa, insufficient attention has been given to understanding the role of seed banks in the invasiveness and long-term persistence of populations. We review information on seeds of these species, considering seed production, seed rain, and the dynamics of seeds in three layers: leaf litter, and upper and lower seed banks in the soil. Many factors affect the accumulation and susceptibility to destruction of seed banks and thus the opportunities for intervention to reduce seed numbers for each of these components. Reduction of seed banks is crucial for the overall success of the multi-million dollar management initiatives against these species. Classical biological control of buds, flower and young pods has reduced the seed production of many Australian acacias in South Africa. Fire can be applied to reduce seed numbers in the leaf litter and upper seed bank in some cases, although there are serious problems associated with high fire intensities in dense acacia stands. Other options, e.g. soil inversion and solarisation, exist to exercise limited reduction of seed numbers in some situations. There is little prospect of meaningful reduction of seed numbers in the lower seed bank. Preventing the accumulation of seed banks by limiting seed production through biological control is by far the most effective means, and in almost all cases the only practical means, of reducing seed numbers. This must be an integral part of management strategies. Several invasive Australian acacias are already under effective biological control, and further work to identify additional potential agents for all the currently invasive species and potentially invasive alien species is the top priority for improving the efficiency of management programmes.

J	Morbidoni, M; Estrelles, E; Soriano, P; Martinez-Solis, I; Biondi, E				Morbidoni, Massimiliano; Estrelles, Elena; Soriano, Pilar; Martinez-Solis, Isabel; Biondi, Edoardo			Effects of environmental factors on seed germination of Anthyllis barba-jovis L.	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The influence of the main environmental factors on seed germination of Anthyllis barba-jovis L. were analysed. This work is part of a broader investigation aimed at the reintroduction of this species on Mount Conero, Ancona (central Italy), where it is at present extinct. The seeds were collected from the Gargano headland (southern Adriatic coast). Experimental analyses were carried out to determine: (i) dormancy levels of seeds collected in successive years, and also collected from the soil seed bank; (ii) effects of usual pre-treatments for overriding the physical dormancy of the seeds; (iii) optimal temperature range for maximum germination; (iv) effects of fire on seed germination; and (v) effects of NaCl on germination and on early stages of seedling development. Our results confirm that A. barba-jovis seeds have a physical dormancy due to their teguments, which are water-impermeable. This barrier persists in naked seeds that remain in the soil. Regularly water-drenched seeds show a high germinative ability. The optimal seed germination temperature is 20 degrees C, with germination decreasing progressively at lower temperatures, and falling drastically over 20 degrees C. Fire and high temperatures positively affected germination. The seeds were shown to be strongly resistant to salt stress, thus enabling the plants to colonize a habitat suitable for halophytes.

Impact of flooding on potential and realised grassland species richness	PLANT ECOLOGY												In order to reduce flood risk, river management policies advise floodplain restoration and the recreation of water retention areas. These measures may also offer opportunities for the restoration of species-rich floodplain habitats through rewetting and the restoration of flood dynamics. The potential to enhance biodiversity in such flood restoration areas is, however, still subject to debate. In this paper we investigate whether flooding along a small altered lowland river can contribute to the potential and realised species richness of semi-natural meadows. We compare the seed bank and vegetation composition of flooded and non-flooded semi-natural meadows and test the hypothesis that flooding contributes to an input of diaspores into the meadow seed banks, thereby promoting seed density and potential species richness. Furthermore we hypothesise that, where habitat conditions are suitable, flooding leads to a higher realised species richness. Results showed that seed densities in flooded meadows were significantly higher than in non-flooded meadows. The seed banks of flooded meadows also contained a higher proportion of exclusively hydrochorous species. However, the seed bank species richness, as well as the species richness realised in the vegetation did not differ significantly between flooded and non-flooded meadows. Finally, the seed bank and standing vegetation of flooded sites showed larger differences in species composition and Ellenberg nitrogen distribution than non-flooded sites. From these results we conclude that, although flooding does contribute to the density and composition of the seed bank, most imported seeds belong to only a few species. Therefore, it is unlikely that flooding substantially enhances the potential species richness. Furthermore, even if new species are imported as seeds into the seed bank, it seems unlikely that they would be able to establish in the standing vegetation. However, it is unclear which factors impede the establishment of imported species in the vegetation. The implications of our findings for flood meadow restoration are discussed.																	1385-0237					JAN	2008	194	1					85	98		10.1007/s11258-007-9276-y							WOS:000251147200007						
J	Kramberger, B; Kaligaric, M				Kramberger, Branko; Kaligaric, Mitia			Semi-natural grasslands: The effects of cutting frequency on long-term changes of floristic composition	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The objective of the experiment was to study the effects of different frequencies of cutting on long-term changes in the floristic composition of grassland, with an emphasis on the effects of very late cutting. Cutting at 2, 4, 6, 8 10 and 12-weekly intervals was applied from 1995 to 2006 in a randomized block experiment on semi-natural grassland fertilized with 170 kg N, 40 kg P and 150 kg K ha(-1). The floristic composition of treatments was determined in May 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2006. In the final year (2006) the proportion of grasses in the dry matter of harvest was highest (77%) in the treatment with the least frequent cuts, and it was the highest obtained during the whole experiment. Under very frequent cuts, the proportion of grasses ranged only from 45 to 57%. Among legumes, only Trifolium repens L. was represented in high proportions in the dry matter of the harvest (from 19 to 25%) in 2006, but only in the treatments involving high cutting frequencies. The proportion of non-legume forbs in treatments involving low cutting frequency did not exceed other treatments; moreover, their proportion in the dry matter of the harvest in the treatment with the lowest cutting frequency decreased significantly to the lowest value (19%). The increased proportion of grasses in treatments with low cutting frequency indicates that a very late cut does not necessarily mean that forbs increase in the floristic composition, but can help grasses to retain their dominant and stable proportion in the semi-natural sward. Consequently, when farmers are being provided with financial incentives with the aim of protecting diversity and the natural environment, it is worth recommending also a very late cutting, which includes natural reseeding to a greater extent. This can help to find a compromise between farmers' expectations of stable yield and quality forage, and the public interest in having grasslands of high biodiversity.

J	Czarnecka, J; Kitowski, I				Czarnecka, Joanna; Kitowski, Ignacy			THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF NESTS OF BLACK-BILLED MAGPIE PICA PICA L. IN ACCUMULATION AND DISPERSAL OF SEEDS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The study aimed to describe the seed pool accumulated in the nest material of Magpie Pica pica, and to determine the importance of this mechanism of seed dispersal for such ecological processes as colonization of new habitats and expansion of alien plants. The seedling germination and seed extraction methods were used to determine seed abundance in the soil layer, the inner layer, and in the lining of 9 nests collected in three types of agricultural landscape: the first with domination of arable fields; the second with similar shares of arable fields and other landscape elements such as meadows of different types, shrubs, tree clumps and rushes; and the third with domination of lowland hay meadows. In all the nests, considerable numbers of diaspores were found (from 26 to 371 seeds per nest, belonging to more than 80 taxa). The main plant groups found in the nests are species connected with field roads, weeds and ruderal species, but also meadow and brushwood species were found there. The soil was gathered by birds from habitats with low vegetation cover and large areas of bare soil. Although the structure of seed pool of nests suggests that soil was mainly collected in the close vicinity of the nests' future location, this mechanism of seed dispersal can probably be involved in long distance dispersal. Seeds of two rare kenophytes: Erucastrum gallicum (Willd.) O. E. Schulz and Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC were found in the material of nests localized more than 100 m away from their closest populations. It can be assumed that this mechanism of seed dispersal can play a potential role in the expansion of alien plants and colonisation of new habitats.																	1505-2249						2008	56	4					673	682									WOS:000262099800011

Nevertheless, the area occupied by landfills is steadily growing. It is an urgent need to avoid toxic impacts such as landfill gas or leachate arising from old landfills, and to find environmentally friendly after-uses for the sites. The cooperation of waste management and botany shows viable practices for the future: Phytosociological releves of the (spontaneous or seeded) vegetation on old landfills can indicate not only the quality of the top cover, but also gaps in the cover where methane or leachate emerge. This information helps companies and authorities to take appropriate steps of sanitation. Well-kept old landfills may be re-integrated into the production of energy plants or fibre plants. Another possible after-use would be a park for recreation. In this case, special care has to be taken for selecting local tree and shrub species with suitable demands and a superficial root system. In regions where rare ecosystems in the vicinity of a landfill are threatened by extinction, one can think of a re-establishment of those ecosystems. By providing a suitable top cover and introducing species of the threatened ecosystem, it is possible to trigger a succession towards this. Nevertheless, steady monitoring of the vegetation development and the soil seed bank is necessary to guarantee success. A new experimental field for botanists and ecological engineers is re-vegetation on combustion slag. To reduce the volume of waist, some municipalities have chosen this method recently instead of mechanical-biological waste treatment. Re-cultivating combustion slag causes many ecological problems., and this is one of the challenges for the future.																			978-960-474-001-7				2008							76	+									WOS:000260451300008						
J	Allen, EA; Nowak, RS				Allen, Elizabetb A.; Nowak, Robert S.			Effect of pinyon-juniper tree cover on the soil seed bank	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												As pinyon-juniper (specifically, Pinus monophylla and Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands in the western United States increase in distribution and density, understory growth declines and the occurrence of crown fires increases, leaving mountainsides open to both soil erosion and invasion by exotic species. We examined if the lose in understory cover that occurred with increasing tree cover was reflected in the density and diversity of the seed bank. Seed banks in stands with low, medium, and high tree cover were measured in late October for 2 yr. Multivariate analyses indicated that cover and diversity of standing vegetation changed as tree cover increased. However, the seed bank did not differ in overall seed density or species diversity because seeds of the 13 species that comprised 86% of the seed bank occurred in similar density across the tree-cover groups. Sixty-three percent of the species that were in the seed bank were absent from the vegetation (mostly annual forbs). In addition, 49% of the species that occurred in the standing vegetation were not in the seed bank (mostly perennial forbs and shrubs). Only Artemisia tridentata, Bromus tectorum, and Collinsia parviflora displayed positive Spearman rank correlations between percent cover in the vegetation and density in the seed bank. Thus, much of the standing vegetation was not represented in the seed bank, and the few species that dominated the seed bank occurred across varying covers of pinyon-juniper.																	1550-7424					JAN	2008	61	1					63	73		10.2111/07-007R2.1							WOS:000252491000007

Relationships between soil temperatures and properties of fire in feathertop spinifex (Triodia schinzii (Henrard) Lazarides) sandridge desert in central Australia	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Soil temperatures during wild. res are known to influence seed bank and plant resprouting dynamics in arid Australian grasslands. Nevertheless, relationships between soil temperatures and factors such as fuel load, fuel type, season of burn, time-of-day and soil moisture are poorly understood. This study used small-scale experimental burns to determine the effects of these five variables on soil temperature profiles (0-4 cm) during. re in spinifex sandridge country in the Haasts Bluff Aboriginal Reserve, west of Alice Springs. Fuel load and type were found to strongly influence soil temperatures, with soils directly beneath Triodia hummocks experiencing more heating than hummock edges or between-hummock gaps, and soils beneath Triodia hummocks experiencing more heating than either mulga (Acacia aneura F.Muell. ex. Benth.) litter or Aristida holathera Domin. tussocks. Season and time-of-day also had strong effects on below-ground heating, with soil temperatures remaining elevated for longer periods during summer compared to winter burns, and day-time burns producing higher temperature maxima and longer durations of elevated soil temperatures than night burns. Soil moisture also had a strong impact on temperature profiles during. re, with high levels of soil moisture strongly reducing the soil heating during. re. These results indicate that the examined factors will strongly influence soil temperature regimes during spinifex wild. res. Hence, they are likely to affect the composition of plant assemblages in post-fire environments through their impacts on vegetative regeneration and on seed bank processes.

Germination of fourteen endemic species from the Iberian Peninsula, Canary and Balearic Islands after 32-34 years of storage at low temperature and very low water content	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Final germination percentage and mean germination time of fourteen accessions from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain) seed bank were evaluated after 32-34 years of storage. All the accessions chosen, belonging to fourteen genera and twelve different plant families, are of species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, Canary or Balearic Islands. Three of these taxa are classified as "vulnerable" and one as "rare" according to the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) criteria. The seeds had been stored at temperatures between -5 degrees C and -10 degrees C in flame sealed vials containing dehydrated (blue) silica gel. Seed water content was in general lower than 3% after storage. The germination trials were carried Out under controlled conditions of light and temperature. In half of the accessions, the highest germination Percentage was reached by seeds without any pre-sowing treatment (untreated seeds). In the other seven accessions, the germination was significantly enhanced by soaking in gibberellic acid (GA(3)) or mechanical scarification. In ten of the fourteen accessions the final germination after storage was equal to or higher than 90%: in two accessions it was over 70% and in the remaining two accessions where germination was lower than 55%, tetrazolium test showed that viability was much higher. Therefore, the seed preservation method based on silica gel and relatively low temperature (-5 degrees C and -10 degrees C) has proven to be highly efficient in the endemic species assayed. The results obtained in this work support the possibility of using ultra-dry methods for long-term storage of orthodox seeds from a range of plant families.				Gonzalez-Benito, M.

Neotyphodium endophytes in tall fescue seed: viability after seed production and prolonged cold storage	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This research quantified frequencies of Neotyphodium-infected (E+) tillers and mature seed from E+ plants of two wild tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbyshire (= Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) accessions from the Mediterranean basin that were stored in the seed bank at the USDA, ARS Western Regional Plant Introduction (PI) Station, Pullman, Washington USA. Tiller-infection levels were high in glasshouse (> 97%) and field (100%) plants of each accession and over 99% of the seed from E+ plant, of both accessions harbored viable Neotyphodium endophyte. Seed germination was either slightly improved (Morocco accession) or not affected (Italy) by endophyte infection. High levels of viable E+ seed were produced by E+ field plants grown under a wide range of ambient temperatures (-27 degrees to 37 degrees C). These collective results suggest that viable endophyte is retained with current seed-regeneration practices at the Pullman PI Station. This study also documented viable Neotyphodium infection frequencies (16-100%) in plants grown from seed of 20 additional Mediterranean tall fescue accessions stored for four to ten years in the Pullman seed bank. For some of these accessions, low post-storage infection frequencies, in comparison with their high initial viability levels, suggested a decline in endophyte viability during seed storage. Additional evidence for diminishing endophyte viability levels in some accessions was provided by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), immunoblot, and microscopic seed assays.																	0251-0952						2008	36	3					710	720		10.15258/sst.2008.36.3.20							WOS:000261588500020

Restoration of cheatgrass-invaded wildlands is generally impractical without some form of cheatgrass control. We are investigating the possibility of manipulating indigenous fungal pathogens that already occur on cheatgrass for short-term biocontrol in conjunction with restoration seedings. Three potential biocontrol organisms have been identified. The head smut pathogen (Ustilago bullata) and the chestnut bunt pathogen (Tilletia fusca) infect at the seedling stage and prevent seed set, while the black-fingers-of-death pathogen (Pyrenophora semeniperda) kills seeds in the seed bank. Both head smut and chestnut bunt pathogen races on cheatgrass are host-specific, whereas black-fingers-of-death is a generalist grass seed pathogen that does not appear to form host-specific races. Inoculation trials with the head smut pathogen yielded high levels of disease only when seedlings emerged at moderate temperatures in fall, whereas the chestnut bunt pathogen infects at near-freezing winter temperatures but requires persistent snow cover for successful infection. The black-fingers-of-death pathogen is most effective at destroying seeds in the carryover seed bank. A combined approach using all three pathogens shows some promise for biocontrol of this troublesome weed.																	1945-0672						2008		52					61	+									WOS:000282107500008						
J	Holmes, PM				Holmes, P. M.			Optimal ground preparation treatments for restoring lowland Sand Fynbos vegetation on old fields	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A restoration field trial was designed to investigate herbaceous weed control and Sand Fynbos plant establishment on a fallow field at Riverlands Provincial Nature Reserve located on the West Coast forelands. The objectives were to investigate optimal treatments for reducing weed cover and the interaction between weed cover and shrub establishment. Herbaceous weeds were controlled using tilling, herbicide and carbon-rich mulch in a split-plot replicated design. Seedlings of two bioassay fynbos species were planted and survival monitored. Tilling in April reduced weed cover for four months, but thereafter had no overall effect. Herbicide applied twice, in May and early July, reduced weed cover significantly for a longer period, whereas mulch had no effect. Soil nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those of untransformed Sand Fynbos soils but no effects of the treatments on nitrogen mineralization rates or total available nitrogen were found. Bioassay plant establishment was highest in the herbicide plus mulch treatment and was negatively related to herbaceous weed cover. Molerat activity, which was positively related to weed cover, was noted to reduce the establishment success of shrub seedlings. There was no overall effect of tilling and mulch on plant establishment in the field, although mulch influenced growth rates in the pot experiment. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it is recommended that herbicide treatment be used to control herbaceous weeds prior to the re-introduction of fynbos species. Other factors to consider in planning a Sand Fynbos restoration, that may impact on native seedling establishment, include whether to: burn the site to remove standing alien biomass and litter; reduce soil N levels; control molerat and gerbil colonies; control browsers; and control of regenerating invasive alien plants.

J	Tipping, PW				Tipping, Philip W.			Mowing-induced changes in soil seed banks and populations of plumeless thistle (Carduus acanthoides) and musk thistle (Carduus nutans)	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Populations of plumeless thistle and musk thistle were mowed at various growth stages at two separate sites in Maryland during a 6-yr period to elucidate relationships among seed rain, soil seed banks, and population recruitment. The majority of seeds (96%) in the soil profile were distributed within 7.6 cm of the surface at both sites. Mowing plumeless thistle when most of the flower heads were at the full bud or postbloom stage did not reduce seed bank or plant densities, unlike mowing at full bloom, which significantly and quickly reduced both. Musk thistle responded differently, with plant density declining only with the postbloom mowing treatment, which occurred after the parent plant had dispersed seeds and died. Seed bank densities were unchanged by this treatment. This indicates that other factors may limit the recruitment and maintenance of musk thistle, such as allelochemical production by parents and interspecific plant competition. Density of musk thistle declined over an 11-yr period at one monitoring site, whereas plumeless thistle remained unchanged. The disproportionate seed-destroying activities of the weed biological control agent Rhinocyllus conicus on musk thistle may explain this difference.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2008	22	1					49	55		10.1614/WT-07-087.1							WOS:000254237700009

Weed management impacts on the population dynamics of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in glyphosate-resistant cotton in Australia	WEED TECHNOLOGY												An experiment was conducted to determine the population dynamics of barnyardgrass under a range of weed management treatments in glyphosate-resistant (GR) cotton in Australia. These treatments consisted of glyphosate herbicide only (Glyphosate only), glyphosate herbicide plus a combination of conventional or integrated weed management practices (Glyphosate + IWM), glyphosate herbicide plus a reduced residual herbicide program (Glyphosate + Res.), glyphosate herbicide plus a grass herbicide (Glyphosate + Grass), and a combination of conventional weed management practices (IWM only). The experiment investigated the effects of weed management on the weed seed bank, weed emergence patterns, and weed populations. After three years, all treatments resulted in commercially acceptable control of barnyardgrass. However, treatments containing soil-applied residual herbicides proved more effective over the period of the experiment. Seed bank reductions were in the order of 100-fold over the period of the experiment for treatments that received residual herbicides compared to 10- to 20-fold reductions for treatments that did not. The experiment highlighted the importance of early-season weed control, as well as the importance of an integrated approach to weed management with residual herbicides to control later-emerging weeds in GR cotton.

J	Meyer, KM; Wiegand, K; Ward, D; Moustakas, A				Meyer, Katrin M.; Wiegand, Kerstin; Ward, David; Moustakas, Aristides			SATCHMO: A spatial simulation model of growth, competition, and mortality in cycling savanna patches	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Many mechanisms have been suggested to explain the coexistence of woody species and grasses in savannas, yet, evidence from field studies and simulation models has been mixed. Shrub encroachment is an ecological and economic problem in savannas worldwide which generally is attributed to overgrazing. Patch-dynamics is a new mechanism explaining tree-grass coexistence and the natural occurrence of shrub encroachment in savannas. A patch-dynamic savanna consists of patches in which cyclical succession between grassy and woody dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The spatially explicit, individual-based patch-scale simulation model SATCHMO was developed to investigate cyclical succession in the paradigm of patch-dynamics for and and semi-arid savannas. SATCHMO is designed to capture within-patch shrub population dynamics based on a grid of 51 In side length and a resolution of 10 cm. The model shrub characteristics were derived from Acacia mellifera, the main encroaching species in African savannas. The aim of SATCHMO is to give a detailed small-scale understanding of above- and belowground growth, competition, and mortality of savanna woody plants and the influence of precipitation and fire on patch transition frequencies, shrub growth rates, and shrub size frequencies. With SATCHMO, we want to identify the conditions leading to cyclical successions in general and shrub encroachment in particular. Soil moisture is the most important parameter in SATCHMO influencing growth, reproduction, and mortality of shrubs and grass tufts, and that mediates competition. To acknowledge the importance of belowground interactions in savannas, shrub root growth and competition are modelled spatially explicitly. The model output was successfully validated with morphometrical and spatial data from the field site in the South African Kalahari thornveld and with recent literature data on savanna woody species cover. Global sensitivity analysis with Latin hypercube sampling shows that soil moisture is the most important driver of shrub cover dynamics in semi-arid savannas. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Construction and preclinical evaluation of recombinant Peru-15 expressing high levels of the cholera toxin B subunit as a vaccine against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli	VACCINE												Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the leading cause of traveler's diarrhea. The heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) toxins mediate ETEC induced diarrhea. ETEC strains may express LT, ST, or both LT and ST, with LT-expressing strains accounting for similar to 50-60% of ETEC-related traveler's diarrhea. Cholera toxin (CT) is >80% homologous to LT and vaccination with CT-B subunit (CT-B) -based vaccines elicit a protective immune response against LT-producing ETEC strains. Peru- 15 is an oral, single-dose, live-attenuated cholera vaccine candidate that has been investigated in several clinical trials (n > 400 subjects) and was proven well tolerated, immunogenic, and efficacious. Peru- 15 was genetically engineered to express and secrete high levels of CT-B by cloning ctxB onto a glnA balanced-lethal plasmid under the transcriptional control of a strong constitutive promoter, resulting in Peru- 15pCTB. In vitro characterization demonstrated that Peru- 15pCTB secreted similar to 30-fold more CT-B than Peru- 15 and CT-B was stably produced after 40 generations of growth and throughout simulated Seed Bank and FDP (Final Drug Product) production conditions. In preclinical studies, the geometric mean anti-CT-B IgG titer in the sera of mice inoculated intranasally with two doses of Peru-15pCTB was >32-fold higher than in mice inoculated with Peru-15. Similarly, rabbits orally inoculated with a single dose of Peru -15pCTB developed titers that were similar to 30-fold higher than rabbits inoculated with a single dose of Peru- 15. Sera from Peru-15pCTB vaccinated mice and rabbits neutralized LT toxicity in an in vitro assay. Peru-15pCTB has several promising characteristics of an oral, single-dose, bivalent cholera/ETEC vaccine and is advancing towards a Phase I clinical trial. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The contribution of rewetting to vegetation restoration of degraded peat meadows	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: What is the contribution of a rise in groundwater level to vegetation restoration of degraded peat meadows compared to abandonment only? Location: Abandoned peat meadows in the central part of The Netherlands. Methods: Comparison of species composition and species abundance of vegetation and seed banks of reference and rewetted peat meadows, using plant trait and seed bank analysis. Results: Vegetation of rewetted meadows shared on average only 27% of their species with the reference meadow, while this was 50% on average for species in the seed bank. Rewetted meadows had a lower total number of species and a lower number of wet grassland and fen species present in the vegetation, but had higher species richness per m(2), although evenness was not affected. Rewetting increased the dominance of species of fertile and near neutral habitats, but did not result in an increase of species of wet or waterlogged habitats. Rewetted meadows were dominated by species relying mainly on vegetative reproduction and species with a low average seed longevity compared to the reference meadow. Conclusion: Rewetting was not effective as a restoration measure to increase plant species diversity or the number of wet grassland and fen species in the vegetation. If no additional restoration management is applied, the seed bank will be depleted of seeds of species of wet grassland or fen habitats, further reducing the chances of successful vegetation restoration.				van Bodegom, Peter/N-8150-2015; van Dijk, Jerry/C-6197-2009	van Bodegom, Peter/0000-0003-0771-4500; van Dijk, Jerry/0000-0002-1945-9415												1402-2001	1654-109X				DEC	2007	10	3					315	U14		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2007.tb00430.x							WOS:000250089300003

Plant community establishment in a restored wetland: Effects of soil removal	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: This study investigated the establishment of wetland plant assemblages following soil removal and restored hydrology in a former agricultural field. The following questions were posed. Does plant community composition differ as a result of soil removal? Does soil removal reduce the frequency of non-wetland plants? Does soil removal reduce the frequency of non-native invasive plants? Location: The Panzner Wetland Wildlife Reserve (PWWR) in Summit County, northeastern Ohio, USA. Methods: During 2000-2001, restoration was conducted on two adjoining fields (3.9 ha total) by excavating the upper 40-50 cm of soil layer and establishing 12 10 m x 10 m undisturbed control plots. Preliminary data included seed bank composition and soil organic matter, estimated from three different soil depths on the control plots. In spring 2004, a 10 m x 10 m soil-removed plot was established adjacent to each control plot. Plant percent cover of all species was estimated within the center 5 m x 5 m of every plot. Above-ground biomass of all species from three 0.25-m(2) quadrats was collected. Environmental water measurements included water depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and conductivity. Results: The top 10 cm of soil contained the most seeds, the highest species diversity, the greatest proportion of annual to perennial plants, and the lowest organic content. Obligate and facultative wetland plants were found in soil-removed plots while facultative upland and upland plants were found in control plots. The only plots with arable weeds were the control plots. However, plant communities on soil-removed plots in the North field, which had a higher elevation (ca. 15-20 cm), had a different species composition than soil-removed plots in the South field. Conclusions: The results of a controlled, replicated large-scale study on the effects of soil removal showed that soil removal altered both the biotic and abiotic environment, but that the proximity to the water table was the primary controlling factor in the assembly of plant communities.																	1402-2001					DEC	2007	10	3					383	U81		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2007.tb00437.x							WOS:000250089300010

Using long-term monitoring of fen hydrology and vegetation to underpin wetland restoration strategies	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How can long-term monitoring of hydrological and ecological parameters support management strategies aimed towards wetland restoration and re-creation in a complex hydrological system? Location: Newham Bog National Nature Reserve, Northumberland, UK, a site with a long history of active management, and recorded as drought-sensitive over the last 100 years. Methods: Water level readings are correlated with longer-term hydrological databases, and these data related to vegetation data collected intermittently over a 12 year period. Two analyses are undertaken: (1) a composite DCA analysis of 1993 and 2002 survey data to assess plant community transitions within the wetland and over time, and (2) analysis of recent vegetation data to explore wider vegetation gradients. This allows (3) communities to be classified using NVC classes and (4) integrated with revised Ellenberg F-values. Results: Drought impact and subsequent hydrological recovery over a 22-year period are quantified. Vegetation data display strong moisture and successional gradients. Analysis shows a shift from grassland communities toward mire communities across much of the site. Conclusion: The site is regionally unique in that it has a detailed long-term monitoring record. Hydrological data and vegetation survey have allowed the impact of the most recent 'groundwater' drought (1989-1997) to be quantified. This information on system resilience, combined with eco-hydrological analyses of plant community-water regime/quality relationships, provide a basis for recommendations concerning conservation and restoration.

Effects of topsoil removal, seed transfer with plant material and moderate grazing on restoration of riparian fen grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How do moderate grazing, topsoil removal and hay transfer affect species diversity and abundance on a eutrophic fen grassland site? Location: Northern Germany. Method: A three-factorial field experiment with the factors grazing, topsoil removal and hay transfer of diaspore-rich material was established in 2001. Soil nutrients and seed bank were analysed at the beginning of the experiment, species composition and vegetation development was monitored for four years (2002-2005). Results: Topsoil removal had a significant effect on the abundance of different plant species groups: resident vegetation of agricultural grasslands was suppressed, while clonal reed species were facilitated in recolonising the area. The establishment of regionally rare and endangered species of nutrient-poor fens and wet meadows introduced with hay was achieved mainly on plots with topsoil removal, with the exception of Rhinanthus angustifolius, which also established on plots with intact topsoil. Effects of grazing after four years of experiments were of minor influence on species composition. Conclusion: The establishment of target plant species of nutrient-poor fens is most successful when both an adequate number of viable diaspores and suitable sites for germination and establishment are available. In our experiment this was achieved by the combination of topsoil removal and hay transfer. We recommend this combination, together with continuous management (grazing/cutting), for further restoration in fen grasslands.

Long-term effects of exclusion of grazing stock on degraded herbaceous plant communities in a riparian Eucalyptus camaldulensis forest in south-eastern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Stock grazing has degraded many riparian ecosystems around the world. However, the potential for ecosystem recovery following the removal of grazing stock is poorly known. We developed a conceptual model to predict the responses of native and exotic herbaceous plants to grazing exclusion, based on site productivity and the degree of initial vegetation degradation. The effects of excluding grazing stock on richness, cover and composition of herbaceous plants were examined over 12 years in the degraded understorey of a riparian forest in Gulpa Island State Forest in south-eastern Australia. We predicted that grazing exclusion would lead to limited changes in vegetation cover, richness and composition, owing to presumed low site productivity and the high degree of understorey degradation. Results showed that the cover, richness and composition of native and exotic species varied significantly among years. Over all plots, regions and years, total cover was slightly but significantly lower in grazed than in ungrazed plots (43.4% vs. 50.8%). While the cover of native plants increased over time in both treatments, the rate of increase was slightly greater in ungrazed plots. Grazing exclusion had no effect on the richness of native or exotic species, but had a significant but minor impact on plant composition, with different common species (mostly exotics) being promoted or diminished in ungrazed plots. The composition of grazed and ungrazed areas did not become more different over time. Overall, the effects that could be attributed to grazing exclusion were relatively minor and transient. Results are consistent with predictions based on site productivity and initial degradation, and should not be extrapolated to other more productive, or less degraded, riparian systems.

Wet meadow restoration in Western Europe: A quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of several techniques	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Techniques such as rewetting, topsoil removal, diaspore transfer or combinations of these are increasingly applied in fen meadow and flood meadow restoration in Western Europe. In this paper, we present a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the commonly used meadow restoration methods. We use the change in 'saturation index' to evaluate the degree of success. The index reflects the completeness of restored communities in comparison to regional target communities. Meadow restoration has limited success in most cases, with an average increase in species richness below 10% of the regional species pool. Restoration success was partly determinated by the starting situation. The more species-rich the starting situation, the higher the saturation index after restoration but, at the same time, the smaller the increase in the number of target species due to restoration. Top soil removal and diaspore transfer were found to contribute most to restoration success. A combination of top soil removal and diaspore transfer and a combination of all three techniques appeared to be the most effective measure and resulted in an increase in the saturation index of up to 16%. Rewetting alone had no measurable effect on restoration success.

J	Kipfer, T; Bosshard, A				Kipfer, Tabea; Bosshard, Andreas			Low seed bank of herb species suitable for grazing hampers the establishment of wood pastures in the Swiss lowlands	BOTANICA HELVETICA												Controlled forest grazing is expected to yield benefits for biodiversity conservation, landscape quality, and in some cases also for land use economy. In the Swiss lowlands, first attempts are being made to reintroduce forest grazing in productive beech forests, but methodic experience is still limited. One main issue concerns the development of the vegetation after forest stands have been thinned to improve light conditions: Will grassland vegetation establish spontaneously? The present study analyses the composition of the soil seed bank of four beech forest stands. The seed bank density ranged from 1'244 to 28'651 seeds m(-2). Seed banks mainly consisted of forest and ruderal species; most abundant were Juncus effusus, Carex sylvatica, Rubus spp. and Clematis vitalba. Seeds of grassland plants were restricted to a few species, and their abundance in the seed bank decreased rapidly with increasing distance from the forest edge. These results reveal that there is little potential for grasslands to develop spontaneously from the seed bank. The introduction of grassland species of local origin using the green hay method is therefore recommended to prevent soil degradation during the first years of grazing, to fulfil minimal biodiversity requirements and to lower the risk of an establishment of neophytes and other problematic plant species.																	0253-1453					DEC	2007	117	2					159	167		10.1007/s00035-007-0815-x							WOS:000252236900004

Ellen			Impacts of postfire salvage logging on understory plant communities of the boreal mixedwood forest 2 and 34 years after disturbance	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												We compared understory vegetation composition and richness in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood forest stands in Alberta, Canada, that had been burned by wildfire with those that burned and were subsequently salvage logged. Stands were examined at early and midsuccessional (2 and 34 years after disturbance(s), respectively) developmental stages. In comparison with wildfire stands, understory communities of early successional salvage-logged stands were characterized by greater species richness, weedy species presence, higher shrub abundance, and lower abundances of fire-specialist seed bank species. In constrained ordination, the understory community of early successional wildfire stands was related to greater canopy cover, sapling density, and moss depth, whereas that of salvage-logged stands was related to greater light, volume of downed deadwood, and litter and organic matter. Longer term effects of salvage logging on the understory community were minimal and, instead, reflected the influence of forest canopy redevelopment. In midsuccessional stands, understory composition was related to conifer density, litter cover, soil moisture, organic layer depth, tall shrub density, and bryophyte-covered microsite cover. Postfire salvage logging can have substantial short-term effects on the postfire understory plant community; in the longer term, effects will depend to a large extent on the influence of harvesting and subsequent management on canopy redevelopment.																	0045-5067					DEC	2007	37	12					2637	2651		10.1139/X07-107							WOS:000253179200021

The main reproductive process for Carlemannia tetragona was verified as self-pollination by the pollination experiments in this work. Germination rates for seeds of both C. tetragona and Silvianthus bracteatus could reach 100% when the seeds were collected after two months, while the rates decreased to 25% when collection took place in the previous year. It was found that the seed had no dormancy stages, and their seed banks were of the Transient Soil type. In field observations, the dehiscence status for fruits showed that their seeds could not be ejected effectively by capsules for dispersal. After analyzing the temperature and rainfall data from the years 1971 to 2000, it was shown that annual rainfall, the lowest mean monthly temperature in a year, and the extreme lowest temperature in a month had a great effect on the distribution range of Carlemanniaceae, while the mean annual temperature had a lesser effect. The narrow distribution range of Carlemanniaceae was affected by multiple factors, such as the short pollen dispersal distance and the Transient Soil Seed Bank. The population sizes of Carlemanniaceae were also easily affected by the level of rainfall, not by any single variable.																	1001-6538	1861-9541				DEC	2007	52			2			244	250		10.1007/s11434-007-7017-1							WOS:000253907400027

Although dormant stages of various plant and animal species are known to remain viable for decades and even centuries, little is known about the effective influence of recolonization from such old sources on the genetic continuity of intermittent populations under natural conditions. Using recent and old dormant eggs recovered from a dated lake sediment core in Kenya, we traced the genetic composition of a local population of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia barbata through a sequence of extinction and recolonization events. This was combined with a phylogeographic and population-genetic survey of regional populations. Four successive populations, fully separated in time, inhabited Lake Naivasha from ca. 1330 to 1570 AD, from ca. 1610 to 1720 AD, from ca. 1840 to 1940 AD, and from 1995 to the present (2001 AD). Our results strongly indicate genetic continuity between the 1840-1940 and 1995-2001 populations, which are separated in time by at least 50 years, and close genetic relatedness of them both to the 1330-1580 population. A software tool (Colonize) was developed to find the most likely source population of the refounded 1995 2001 population and to test the number of colonists involved in the recolonization event. The results confirmed that the 1995-2001 population most probably developed out of a limited number of surviving local dormant eggs from the previous population, rather than out of individuals from regional (central and southern Kenya) or more distant (Ethiopia, Zimbabwe) populations that may have immigrated to Lake Naivasha through passive dispersal. These results emphasize the importance of prolonged dormancy for the natural long-term dynamics of crustacean zooplankton in fluctuating environments and suggest an important role of old local dormant egg banks in aquatic habitat restoration.

Impact of red : far red ratios on germination of temperate forest herbs in relation to shade tolerance, seed mass and persistence in the soil	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. The effect of the ratio of red : far red light (R : FR) on seed germination of herbaceous species from northern temperate deciduous forest has received little attention. Here for 27 such species, we investigated the relationship between seed mass and the suitability of micro-sites for germination. Germination in light and in darkness was compared after cold stratification, and for the light-requiring species, the germination response to R : FR was determined. In addition, seed bank persistence was monitored over 4 years. 2. With increasing seed mass, germination became less dependent on light and seed bank persistence decreased. Furthermore, for the light-dependent species, there was a significant negative relationship between the R : FR that resulted in 50% germination and seed mass. 3. These data suggest that small-seeded species only germinate in micro-sites with a high R : FR, which signals the absence of over-topping vegetation or leaf litter. Such micro-sites are comparatively rare, which may necessitate persistence in the soil seed bank. 4. For small-seeded species, we propose that a key benefit from restricting germination to high R : FR is a reduction in the time-frame over which the initially small seedlings remain small and hence highly vulnerable to mortality: high R : FR is likely to indicate high-light levels which would facilitate rapid seedling growth.

J	Osem, Y; Perevolotsky, A; Kigel, J				Osem, Yagil; Perevolotsky, Avi; Kigel, Jaime			Interactive effects of grazing and shrubs on the annual plant community in semi-arid Mediterranean shrublands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: We studied the interactive effects of grazing and dwarf shrub cover on the structure of a highly diverse annual plant community. Location: Mediterranean, semi-arid shrubland in the Northern Negev desert, Israel. Methods: Variation in the biomass and plant density of annual species in the shrub and open patches was monitored during four years, inside and outside exclosures protected from sheep grazing, in two contrasting topographic sites: north and south-facing slopes that differed in their dominant dwarf shrubs species: Sarcopoterium spinosus and Corydothymus capitatus, respectively. Results: Above-ground biomass, density and richness of annual species were lower under the canopy of both shrub species compared to the adjacent open patches in the absence of grazing. Grazing reduced the biomass of annuals in open patches of both topographic sites, but not in the shrub patches. On the north-facing slope, grazing also reduced plant density and richness in the open patches, but increased plant density in the shrub patches. At the species level, various response patterns to the combined effects of grazing and patch type were exhibited by different annuals. Protection against the direct impacts of grazing by shrub cover as well as species-specific interactions between shrubs and annuals were observed. A conceptual mechanistic model explaining these interactions is proposed. Conclusion: In semi-arid Mediterranean shrublands grazing and dwarf shrub cover interact in shaping the structure of the annual plant community through (1) direct impacts of grazing restricted to the open patches, (2) species-specific facilitation/interference occurring in the shrub patches and (3) subsequent further processes occurring among the interconnected shrub and open patches mediated through variation in seed flows between patches.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				DEC	2007	18	6					869	+		10.1658/1100-9233(2007)18[869:IEOGAS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000250089400011

Location: Southeastern Australia. Methods: We used a long-term study of a shrubby, fleshy-fruited Persoonia species (Proteaceae) to examine (1) seed removal from beneath the canopy of adult plants; (2) seedling recruitment after fire; (3) the magnitude and location of the residual soil seed bank; and (4) the implications for fire management of obligate seeding species. We used demographic sampling techniques combined with Generalised Linear Modelling and regression to quantify population changes over time. Results: Most of the mature fruits (90%) on the ground below the canopy of plants were removed by Wallabia bicolor (Swamp wallaby) with 88% of seeds extracted from W. bicolor scats viable and dormant. Wallabies play an important role in moving seeds away from parent plants. Their role in occasional long distance dispersal events remains unknown. We detected almost no seed predation in situ under canopies (< 1%). Seedling recruitment was cued to fire, with post-fire seedling densities 6-7 times pre-fire adult densities. After fire, a residual soil seed bank was present, as many seeds (77-100%) remained dormant and viable at a soil depth where successful future seedling emergence is possible (0-5 cm). Seedling survival was high (> 80%) with most mortality within 2 years of emergence. Plant growth averaged 17 cm per year. The primary juvenile period of plants was 7-8 years, within the period of likely return fire intervals in the study area. We predicted that the study population increased some five-fold after the wildfire at the site. Conclusions: Residual soil seed banks are important, especially in species with long primary juvenile periods, to buffer the populations against the impact of a second fire occurring before the seed bank is replenished.

Seed bank responses to grazing history by invasive and native plant species in a semi-desert shrub-steppe environment	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Invasive alien plants frequently possess greater seed banks than native species in disturbed areas, but native disturbance-adapted species may also possess large seed banks. We analyzed seed banks of ten sites with varying grazing histories in a shrub-steppe ecosystem dominated by antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) in the Okanagan valley in British Columbia, Canada. Overall effects of grazing on seed banks were overshadowed by site-specific differences, but canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the composition of the seed bank was significantly affected by bare soil which was positively correlated with grazing. Other factors affecting seed bank composition included liner, cover of spikemosses (Selaginella), shrub cover and microbiotic crust cover. The seed bank of the invasive herb diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) was largest at two of the three most heavily grazed sites. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), another invasive species, exhibited large seed banks at all sites regardless of grazing history. Native species such as sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus) and Douglas' knotweed (Polygonum douglasii) had substantial seed banks (> 1500 seeds m(-2)). Planting sand dropseed, Douglas' knotweed, needle-and-thread grass (Hesperostipa comata) or their ecological equivalents could aid in the restoration of arid ecosystems because of their adaptation to disturbance and persistence of seeds in the soil.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				WIN	2007	81	1					37	49		10.3955/0029-344X-81.1.37							WOS:000245933900003						
J	King, TJ				King, Timothy John			The roles of seed mass and persistent seed banks in gap colonisation in grassland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Gaps in grassland created by animals are often sites for species regeneration. The persistent seed banks of ant-hills and surrounding soils in a calcareous grassland in southern Britain were compared and analysed in terms of seed mass and longevity. The relative abundance of species on ant-hills compared to the pasture was highly correlated with seed abundance in ant-hill soil. The abundance of plant species on ant-hills compared to the pasture was significantly negatively correlated with seed mass, and positively correlated with seed longevity. These results suggest that germination from the seed bank in ant-hill soils, as well as limited seed dispersal and vegetative invasion, contributes to the distinctive ant-hill vegetation. The same may apply to other gaps created by animals in grasslands. Gaps in grassland created by animals are often sites for species regeneration.

J	Walters, C				Walters, Christina			Materials used for seed storage containers: Response to Gomez-Campo [Seed Science Research 16, 291-294 (2006)]	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Efficient seed storage is a shared concern among the growing number of seed banks established for crop improvement or ex situ conservation. Container properties greatly affect seed interactions with the environment and the overall cost and success of seed banking operations. Several material properties contribute to their suitability as seed containers. This paper provides a consolidated list of water vapour permeability properties of thermal plastics commonly used for packaging. Composite packages with layers of film with different properties provide distinct advantages to seed banks. Different seed banks must rank the importance of the various factors depending on their mission and resources. Once the risks, costs and benefits are weighed, an appropriate strategy can be developed that addresses a seed bank's specific needs. Because there are many problems and several solutions, it is likely that strategies will vary among seed banks. This response details variables to consider when selecting seed storage packages, and focuses on water diffusion rates of packages with different compositions. A 'moisture audit' will help seed bank operators make informed decisions about packaging.

J	Feldman, SR; Lewis, JP				Feldman, Susana R.; Lewis, Juan Pablo			Demographic responses to fire of Spartina argentinensis in temporary flooded grassland of Argentina	WETLANDS												Population characteristics of Spartina argentinensis after fire were analyzed. Field experiments were done in temporary flooded tall grassland, dominated by S. argentinensis at the Reserva Federico Wildermuth (Argentina), on burnt and non-burnt plots. The following variables were analyzed: soil seed bank, potential and real establishment of seedlings and the effect of fire on them, percentage of tillers that continue growing after fire, emergence and survival of tillers, number of tillers that differentiated particles, and production and predation of propagules. Plants resprouting after fire produced a larger number of tillers with greater tiller emergence, recruitment, and survival than tillers of those of the non-burnt plants. The proportion of tillers with particles and number of full spikelets per plant was greater in burnt plants than in non-burnt plants, but individuals caryopses unitary weight as well as germination percentage and viability were not affected by fire. Caryopses were severely predated and they did not build up a permanent seed bank. In spite of the high output of caryopses, seedling establishment was almost negligible under most circumstances. Fire and environmental conditions provided very limited "windows of opportunity" for seedlings recruitment. Asexual reproduction was the main process of population maintenance and growth, and fire triggers off the output and eventual establishment of sexual propagules.																	0277-5212					DEC	2007	27	4					785	793		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[785:DRTFOS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000251471400002						
J	Capon, SJ				Capon, Samantha J.			Effects of flooding on seedling emergence from the soil seed bank of a large desert floodplain	WETLANDS												Australia's large desert floodplains are among the world's most hydrologically variable wetlands and vegetation in these habitats changes dramatically over time in response to flooding and drought. Annual forb and grass communities in these desert floodplains rely on large, diverse soil seed banks as critical sources of propagules for recruitment. I investigated the effects of flooding on seedling emergence from the soil seed bank of the Cooper Creek floodplain in and central Australia. My objective was to determine the effects of differences in both short-term flooding characteristics as well as the longer-term flood history of sediments on the composition of plant communities establishing from the soil seed bank. I conducted a greenhouse experiment in which sediments collected from high (inundated at least once every 1-5 yrs), medium (inundated approximately once in every 5-10 yrs), and low (inundated less than once a decade) flood frequency zones were subjected to different durations of submergence, rates of drawdown (i.e., duration of post-submergence waterlogging), and seasonal timing of flooding. The abundance of emerging seedlings more than doubled in response to longer overall durations of wetting, but the relative duration of submergence (i.e., 8 vs. 4 weeks) versus subsequent soil waterlogging (i.e., 4 vs. 8 weeks) within this period did not have a significant effect. The duration of submergence versus waterlogging did however influence the composition of emerging seedlings with almost twice as many annual monocots appearing following longer durations of submergence. All dominant species emerged frequently following both summer and winter flooding, suggesting opportunistic germination strategies. The composition of moderately abundant and rare species, however, differed in response to the seasonal timing of inundation with monocots more common following summer floods and forbs following winter flooding. Common species were well-distributed in the soil seed bank across the flood history gradient, and the species richness of emerging seedlings did not vary between different flood frequency zones. However, seedlings of species emerging from low flood frequency zone samples tended to be less abundant and differed in composition compared with those emerging from samples of high and medium flood frequency zones. My results suggest that changes to both short- and long-term flooding patterns, through flow management or climate change, are likely to affect vegetation responses to inundation in these desert floodplains. Reductions in flood pulse magnitude and frequency, for instance, could result in a decline in the abundance of valuable pasture grasses germinating in response to summer flooding and a loss of hydrophytic species in rarely flooded areas.

Transplanting native dominant plants to facilitate community development in restored Coastal Plain wetlands	WETLANDS												Drained depressional wetlands are typically restored by plugging ditches or breaking drainage tiles to allow recovery of natural pending regimes, while relying on passive recolonization. from seed banks and dispersal to establish emergent vegetation. However, in restored depressions of the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, certain characteristic rhizomatous graminoid species may not recolonize because they are dispersal-limited and uncommon or absent in the seed banks of disturbed sites. We tested whether selectively planting such wetland dominants could facilitate restoration by accelerating vegetative cover development and suppressing non-wetland species. In an operational-scale project in a South Carolina forested landscape, drained depressional wetlands were restored in early 2001 by completely removing woody vegetation and plugging surface ditches. After forest removal, tillers of two rhizomatous wetland grasses (Panicum hemitomon, Leersia hexandra) were transplanted into single-species blocks in 12 restored depressions that otherwise were revegetating passively. Presence and cover of all plant species appearing in planted plots and unplanted control plots were recorded annually. We analyzed vegetation composition after two and four years, during a severe drought (2002) and after hydrologic recovery (2004). Most grass plantings established successfully, attaining 15%-85% cover in two years. Planted plots had fewer total species and fewer wetland species compared to control plots, but differences were small. Planted plots achieved greater total vegetative cover during the drought and greater combined cover of wetland species in both years. By 2004, planted grasses appeared to reduce cover of non-wetland species in some cases, but wetter hydrologic conditions contributed more strongly to suppression of non-wetland species. Because these two grasses typically form a dominant cover matrix in herbaceous depressions, our results indicated that planting selected species could supplement passive restoration by promoting a vegetative structure closer to that of natural wetlands.																	0277-5212					DEC	2007	27	4					972	978		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[972:TNDPTF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000251471400019

The effects of disturbance intensity on temporal and spatial patterns of herb colonization in a southern New England mixed-oak forest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												As managing forests for biodiversity becomes more common, it is important to understand how understory species respond to disturbance. We monitored changes in species' dominance, calculated as importance values, over a 4-year period in order to determine how species' dominance varied with disturbance intensity and gap position. An experimental linear canopy opening was created in a southern New England mixed-oak forest. and plots were established on the south side, center, and north side of the opening. All vegetation was removed in half of the plots, simulating a lethal disturbance. In the other half of the plots, only the overstory was removed, simulating minimal disturbance (release plot). Before the disturbance. Dennstaedtia punctilobula dominated the plots, but typical forest understory species such as Kalmia latifolia, Trientalis borealis, Maianthemum canadense, and Mitchella repens were very common. After the disturbance, D. punctilobula expanded and continued to remain dominant in all types of plots. Early successional species, such as Carex pensylvanica, Poaceae species, Rubus ideaus, and Rubus allegheniensis dominated the lethal and center plots; late successional forest understory species experienced a reduction in frequency and cover in these plots. However, in release and edge plots, late successional species maintained relatively similar frequencies and covers to pre-disturbance values. The ability of early successional species to seed into lethal plots and grow rapidly in the high light environment of the center plots allowed them to dominate in these plots. Late successional species were able to remain relatively dominant in release plots through clonal expansion and in edge plots through exclusion of early successional species from low light levels. Three years after the disturbance, most of the residual forest understory species had attained similar frequencies and covers to pre-disturbance values in all types of plots. Thus, although there is some initial loss of residual species in highly disturbed areas and in the center of the opening, most of these species are able to recover in a relatively short time period. However, locally uncommon species may be vulnerable to permanent loss. In order to minimize loss of species from the understory, forest managers should attempt to keep groundstory disturbance as minimal as possible where desirable late-successional species exist and create edge-partial shade effects with the remaining canopy for regeneration treatments.

J	Casanova, MT				Casanova, Michelle T.			Typification and circumscription of Nitella sonderi (Characeae, Charophyceae)	AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY												Nitella sonderi A.Braun in family Characeae was described in 1852, on the basis of a single specimen collected by Ferdinand von Mueller from Melbourne. This specimen was lost and not referred to again, nor illustrated. From 1857 until 1935, three other specimens of N. sonderi were examined or referred to in published literature. The species was amalgamated with the Asian species N. pseudoflabellata in 1962 and a neotype ( Lewis 6) was assigned in 1972. In the year 2000, a specimen with the same collection locality and collector as the type of N. sonderi, labelled N. sonderi, was found in the National Herbarium of Victoria ( Mueller, September 1852). In the present paper, I deal with the following two issues: typification of N. sonderi ( i.e. is the Lewis or the Mueller specimen the most appropriate type?) and whether N. sonderi and N. pseudoflabellata are the same species. The Lewis and the Mueller specimens were compared with the protologue, and the neotype is retained. Oospores and vegetative features of N. sonderi were compared with type material of N. pseudoflabellata var. imperialis (sensu R.D. Wood) and N. sonderi is reinstated as a separate species on the basis of its vegetative morphology, dioecy and oospore morphology, and a description is given with reference to specimens from its entire range. N. sonderi is a spring and summer-growing annual of sheltered sites in temporary wetlands throughout Victoria, New South Wales, and upland south-eastern Queensland. It persists during dry times via a bank of dormant, long-lived oospores in the seed bank. Linking a good taxonomy with thorough ecological studies in this way can inform management of water resources.																	1030-1887	1446-5701				NOV 8	2007	20	5					464	472		10.1071/SB06038							WOS:000250757300008

Soil seed bank composition in pastures of diverse mixtures of temperate forages	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Seed banks may contribute useful or weedy species that fill gaps in pastures. In a previous study, pastures planted to complex mixtures of forages had a lesser proportion of weedy species in the aboveground vegetation. In this study, we relate changes in the species composition of the seed bank to changes in the aboveground vegetation. In August 2001, four mixtures [two, three, six, and nine species of temperategrasses, legumes and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)] were established in replicated 1-ha pastures (eight total) in central Pennsylvania. Pastures were grazed by dairy cattle from April to September in 2002 and 2003. Soil cores (1.88-cm diam. by 5-cm depth) were taken in April and October in 2002 and 2003, and in April 2004 to determine the density of germinable seeds. Soil samples were placed in a greenhouse under natural light and controlled temperatures for 12 to 18 mo and germinated seedlings counted regularly. The total density of germinable seeds from all species did not differ among mixtures (P = 0.08). Annual nonleguminous forbs accounted for 79% of the germinable seeds. Yellow woodsorrel (Oxalis stricta L.) was the dominant annual forb. There were significant differences among pastures planted to different mixtures in the density of germinable annual forb seeds; however, these differences likely occurred because of preexisting spatial variation in seed bank composition. Seeded species contributed fewer than 1000 seeds m(-2) total in the 3 yr. Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were the most common forage species in the seed bank. There was little relation between the species composition of the seed bank and the composition of the aboveground vegetation. Data from this study indicate that previous land management had larger effects on the soil seed bank than did planting diverse mixtures of forages.																	0002-1962					NOV-DEC	2007	99	6					1514	1520		10.2134/agronj2006.0371							WOS:000251104400013						
J	Dolle, M; Schmidt, W				Dolle, M.; Schmidt, W.			Changes in plant species diversity during thirty-six years of undisturbed old-field succession	ALLGEMEINE FORST UND JAGDZEITUNG												This long-term permanent plot study describes the patterns and process of forest restoration by spontaneous succession on former agricultural land. In 1968, initiated by Heinz Ellenberg, an experimental study site was set up on an arable field in the New Botanical Garden of Gottingen University (Germany). At the beginning of the experiment the study plots were either sterilized by heating or by applying herbicides (to eliminate soil seed bank) or were ploughed only (soil seed bank present) and subsequently left to themselves. Species richness was continuously recorded. Density of shrub and tree species was counted 20 and 36 years after abandonment. A fundamental vegetation change took place within the study plots during the 36 years of abandonment. On all plots, undisturbed succession has lead to a change from open annual vegetation into mixed pioneer forest stands; or in other words, from a profoundly affected agricultural land-use system towards an ecosystem much more close to nature. The species-rich pioneer forests with a closed tree canopy established themselves irrespective of whether the initial soil seed bank was left intact or not. Dominant tree layer species are Salix caprea, Fraxinits excelsior and Betula pendula, reaching up to 22 in in height. The species-rich shrub layers cover 45-60%, with Cornus sanguinea and F excelsior being the dominant species. We determined a clear decrease in total plant species richness over time. While plant species typical to open landscapes disappeared nearly completely, typical herb layer species to closed forests increased rather slowly during the 36 years of old-field succession.																	0002-5852					NOV-DEC	2007	178	11-12					225	232									WOS:000251900600006						
J	Barrat-Segretain, MH; Cellot, B				Barrat-Segretain, Marie-Helene; Cellot, Bemard			Response of invasive macrophyte species to drawdown: The case of Elodea sp.	AQUATIC BOTANY												The response to drawdown of vegetative fragments (whole plants, shoot fragments and turions) of two invasive macrophyte species, Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii, was studied through laboratory experiments. In addition, field observations were made on the colonisation of a wetland by E. nuttallii before and after a natural drawdown. The survival and the growth of vegetative fragments of E. nuttallii were higher than those of E. canadensis after an artificial drawdown of several days. In the field the recolonisation by E. nuttallii of a wetland that was drained for 10 weeks during a summer drawdown was very rapid, the abundance of this macrophyte species being not affected by the drawdown event. We conclude that E. nuttallii possesses a high resilience to desiccation and that a summer drawdown would not be efficient in the control of this invasive species. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Kuntze (Menyanthaceae)	AQUATIC BOTANY												We examined seed bank characteristics and seed germination and the survival of seedlings to understand the significance of water-level fluctuations on sexual regeneration in Nymphoides indica (L.) Kuntze. The seed bank existed throughout the pond. The longevity of the seed bank was more than 3 years. Seed germination started on the exposed mudflat as soon as water drawdown occurred. At the juvenile stage, exposed conditions were required for seedling growth and the young seedlings died under submergence. It was suggested that seedling establishment was successful after occasional water drawdown or along the water margin according to the period and pattern of water-level fluctuation. This study indicated the significance of the exposed mudflat at the water edge for seed germination and the growth of juvenile plants to the success of sexual regeneration in N. indica.

J	Espinar, JL; Clemente, L				Espinar, Jose L.; Clemente, Luis			The impact of vertic soil cracks on submerged macrophyte diaspore bank depth distribution in Mediterranean temporary wetlands	AQUATIC BOTANY												In temporary wetlands, a majority of diaspores are located in the upper layers of the soil. In general, it is assumed that the vertical movement of diaspores is caused by animal disturbance, and that reduction in this activity concentrates the diaspores in the topsoil. The occurrence of seasonal cracks and the dispersion of topsoil during dry periods are processes that have been underestimated in diaspore bank studies. Our results indicated that diaspore size can partially explain the density of diaspores of submerged macrophytes observed at four discrete soil depths in Donana National Park temporary marshes (SW Spain). The top layers of the soil exhibit the largest number of species. Spore density of Riella spp., a liverwort, increases with depth, creating an important reserve of viable diaspores in deep soil. Downward movement of diaspores in soil cracks during dry periods, and the extended longevity of Riella diaspores together explain this inverse depth distribution.

J	Franklin, J				Franklin, Janet			Recovery from clearing, cyclone and fire in rain forests of Tonga, South Pacific: Vegetation dynamics 1995-2005	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												In late 2001 a category 3 cyclone impacted forest plots that were established in Tonga in 1995, and additionally, one plot was accidentally burned by an escaped land-clearing fire. Subsequent surveys provide observations of 10 years of forest dynamics in this poorly studied region, and the first reported observations of large interannual variation in juvenile (seedling and sapling) abundance in the western tropical Pacific. The severely disturbed (burned) plot was initially colonized by a non-native early pioneer, Carica papaya L., but 3.5 years later a native pioneer, Macaranga harveyana (Muell. Arg.) Muell. Arg., was the most abundant tree species. The seedling layer included some long-lived pioneers and shade-tolerant species. Two mature forest plots affected only by the cyclone changed very little over a decade. Late-successional shade-tolerant species that dominated the overstory were also abundant as seedlings and saplings. This is in contrast with a 30- to 40-year-old, formerly cultivated, secondary forest plot that still shows no recruitment of late-successional dominants, in spite of the proximity of remnant forest patches. This study suggests differing pathways of succession following shifting cultivation versus cyclone and fire disturbances in Tonga. Land use legacies appear to have a long-lasting effect on community composition.																	1442-9985					NOV	2007	32	7					789	797		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01766.x							WOS:000250144400007

In particular, species that need active management for their survival may be more prone to extinction than later successional species. In this paper, we tested if six local factors (type of last management, canopy height, % cover of bare soil, pH and mean Ellenberg N (productivity) and F (soil moisture)) and/or three regional variables (patch size, patch age, i.e. interval since last practice, and isolation) have impact on the distribution and abundance of the endangered holoparasite Cuscuta epithymum. The presence of this species, its population size and host range were studied in more than 160 heathland patches within four nature reserves in Flanders (Belgium). The structure of the canopy, determined by management, was the key factor controlling the abundance of this species. The parasite performed best (in terms of population size) in patches which has been managed (mowing, burning or turf-cutting) in the previous seven years, mainly composed of young Calluna vulgaris individuals and had a canopy height between 10 and 30 cm. However, contrary to expectations, distribution patterns were not related to any other local or regional variable, except for site location. We, therefore, suggest that the current distribution of C. epithymum in this dynamic heath landscape may be driven by the presence of a persistent seed bank. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hansen, MJ				Hansen, Malin J.			Evaluating management strategies and recovery of an invasive grass (Agropyron cristatum) using matrix population models	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The success of invasive species control depends on management type, duration and recovery following management. Population models were here used to compare response and recovery of clipped and herbicide-treated Agropyron cristatum populations invading native North American grasslands. Matrix models were produced for experimental populations of A. cristatum using probabilities of tussocks changing size class (based on tiller number), as well as average seed production, germination, juvenile survival (progression to size class 1), and survival of seeds in the seed bank. Tiller and seed production, as well as growth rate were compared among four management strategies: clipping (to simulate grazing) for one or two consecutive years, and selective herbicide application for one or two years. The responses of managed populations were compared with an unmanaged population. Elasticity analyses were used to identify life-history stages that contributed the most to survival and growth, thereby providing important insights into invasive species control. Herbicide application for one year slowed population growth, while application for two years eradicated the population. Clipping for one year slowed population growth, but did not cause the population to decrease in size, whereas the population clipped for two years was stable. Recruitment, especially seed production, contributed the most to the high growth rate of the unmanaged population, which was significantly higher than the growth rate of populations that were clipped or treated with herbicide for either one or two year periods. In summary, strategies to control this invasive grass need to target seed production. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term sustainable control strategies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Martins, AM; Engel, VL				Martins, Andreza Maria; Engel, Vera Lex			Soil seed banks in tropical forest fragments with different disturbance histories in southeastern Brazil	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					22nd World Congress of the International-Union-of-Forest-Research-Organizations	AUG 08-13, 2005	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Int Union Forest Res Org				Soil seed banks are considered an important mechanism for natural regeneration in tropical forest ecosystems. This paper investigated the soil seed bank in two semideciduous seasonal tropical forest fragments with different disturbance histories in Botucatu, southeastern Brazil. In each study site, 40 superficial soil samples (30 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm) were taken at the end of both the dry and rainy seasons. The seeds were estimated by the germination method. Average soil seed density was 588.6 and 800.3 seeds m(-2), respectively, for site 1 (less disturbed) and site 2 (more disturbed). Seed density and diversity (H') were significantly higher in site 2 in both seasons. Non-woody taxa predominated in both fragments, but pioneer tree species were better represented in the less disturbed forest. Both ecosystems have a potential for regeneration from soil seed banks, but this potential is higher in the less disturbed site. Low richness and density of pioneer tree species in the seed bank indicate that the ecosystem has lost its resilience. The seed bank is not as important in these ecosystems as in other forests. Results indicate that management strategies to restore these forests should take into account the possibility of recovering soil seed bank processes and dynamics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Zooplankton succession on seasonal floodplains: surfing on a wave of food	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Floodplains represent ecotones with frequent high productivity mediated by regular shifts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We examined interactions along this intercept on a seasonal floodplain of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We focused on the zooplankton communities in order to gain knowledge on the energetic and stoichiometric interplay of the two systems involved. A conspicuous horizontal migration and pulsed biomass increase was found for the dominant zooplankton species ( Moina micrura, Daphnia laevis, Mesocyclops leuckarti), culminating in truly extreme numbers before a final collapse. There was a distinct succession in the peak abundance of these species, apparently subsidized by hatchlings from the seed bank of resting eggs as the flood proceeded over the savannah. The high productivity of the system seems to be driven by a strong coupling of the terrestrial and aquatic phase of the floodplains via a mobilization of terrestrially derived nutrients, through nutrients from grazing ungulates during dry periods. Carbon of terrestrial origin, however, appeared to be of minor importance for the planktonic part of the food web.

J	Keith, DA; Holman, L; Rodoreda, S; Lemmon, J; Bedward, M				Keith, David A.; Holman, Lisa; Rodoreda, Suzette; Lemmon, Jedda; Bedward, Michael			Plant functional types can predict decade-scale changes in fire-prone vegetation	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Plant functional types (PFTs) are groups of species sharing traits that govern their mechanisms of response to environmental perturbations such as recurring fires, inundation, grazing, biological invasions and global climate change. The key components of a PFT approach are an underlying model of vegetation dynamics for a given system and a classification of functional types based on traits deduced from key processes in the model. 2. Prediction and generalization underpin the potential utility of the PFT approach for understanding ecosystem behaviour. For PFTs to be useful in ecosystem management, they (in concert with their underlying model) must reliably predict vegetation change under given environmental scenarios and they must produce robust generalizations across the species that are classified and the range of environments in which they occur. 3. The efficacy of plant functional types has been explored using various approaches in a wide range of ecosystems. However, very few studies have tested the accuracy and generality of PFT predictions against vegetation changes observed empirically over medium to long time scales. 4. We applied this approach to examine the predictive accuracy and generality of a PFT classification and an associated model of vegetation dynamics for a fire-prone, species-rich wet heathland in south-eastern Australia. We assigned each species to one of six PFTs derived using a deductive approach based on the vital attributes scheme. We measured their initial abundance at a set of sample sites distributed across local environmental gradients. We used the PFT traits and processes in the underlying model to predict qualitative changes in abundance in response to a fire regime scenario observed at the sample sites during a subsequent period of 21 years. We then re-surveyed the sample sites to compare predictions with observed changes in abundance. 5. The PFTs and their underlying model produced an accurate prediction of average vegetation responses over the 21-year period. The majority of species within each PFT exhibited the predicted response and few species had strongly opposing responses in different environments. However, not all species within a PFT underwent the predicted direction of change, and responses of individual species were not uniform across the environmental gradients. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that plant functional types based on vital attributes are very useful tools for prediction and generalization in ecosystem management, although interpretations need to be tempered by the fact that PFTs may not accurately predict responses of all species across all environments.

J	Sletvold, N; Rydgren, K				Sletvold, Nina; Rydgren, Knut			Population dynamics in Digitalis purpurea: the interaction of disturbance and seed bank dynamics	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Plant ecologists have long since realized that the persistence of many facultative biennial plants depends upon disturbance. However, we still have a limited knowledge of the population-level effects of disturbance, and the connection between adult and seed bank dynamics. 2. Using data from a 3-year demographic study combined with experimental gap-opening in a large population of Digitalis purpurea, we parameterized stochastic transition matrix models in 'disturbed' vs. 'undisturbed' areas. We simulated different gap sizes (fraction of population that was disturbed) and temporal disturbance patterns (constant, random, regular and irregular return intervals) and evaluated the effects on population growth rate and seed bank dynamics. To explore seed bank importance we used two alternatives for seed bank survival rate (0.75/0.35) and three alternatives for seed bank recruitment fraction (0.9/0.5/0.1). 3. Observed background recruitment levels were insufficient to ensure a positive population growth rate. Increased amounts of gap-opening led to higher growth rates, and population persistence was predicted at moderate disturbance levels if seed bank survival was high (0.75). 4. Temporal disturbance pattern affected model results; random and interval scenarios resulted in lower population growth rates and higher extinction risks than constant scenarios of the same average disturbance level. Small and frequent disturbances led to considerably higher growth rates than large and rare disturbances. 5. Stochastic elasticity analyses identified the seed bank as the most important life cycle stage with respect to population growth and persistence in most scenarios, and its relative impact was positively related to seed bank survival rate and negatively related to disturbance level. Variation in the recruitment fraction from seed bank vs. seed rain affected both population growth rate and elasticity patterns, indicating the large impact of spatial variation in seed bank density. 6. Synthesis: Despite the existence of a large seed bank, our data suggest that recruitment may be locally seed-limited due to a patchy seed bank structure. Local population development may consequently differ widely from gap to gap. These results illustrate how spatial structures in both seed bank, adult population and gap formation interact to shape plant population dynamics, as well as the occurrence of microsite- vs. seed-limitation.																	0022-0477					NOV	2007	95	6					1346	1359		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01287.x							WOS:000250265700017

Screening studies on the host range of branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa)	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Studies on the host range of Orobanche ramosa L., by screening different Summer and Winter crops, medicinal herbs, and a large number of weeds for possible attack by the parasite, revealed substantial variation among species in the number and vigour of parasites attached to their roots. The crops and medicinal herbs most affected were: Apium graveolens, Carthamis tinctorius, Carum carvi, and Trachyspermum ammi (with 36 - 214 Orobanche shoots per pot). Among the crops studied, Ammi visnaga, Brassica nigra, B. oleracea var. botrytis, Cucurbita moschata, Linum usitatissimum, Lupinus albus, and Raphanus sativus were least infected (with 1 - 2 Orobanche shoots per pot). Weeds, including Datura metel, Ferula communis, and Rumex acetosella were heavily infected (with 40 - 67 shoots per pot). In contrast, Antirrhinum orontium, Convolvulus arvensis, Diplotaxis erucoides, Polygonum aviculare and Solanum cornutum showed extremely low infection (with 1 - 2 shoots per pot). T ammi is reported, for the first time, as a potential "trap species" for O. ramosa. Other plants tested are useful as "catch species" and both may be used effectively to manage infestation by the parasite by their inclusion in crop rotation or intercropping systems. Non-host species, or those that allowed very low parasite attachment may be grown in fields heavily-infested by the parasite. Control of highly-infected weed species is necessary to prevent parasite multiplication and spread. However, timing this operation after parasite attachment, or before emergence may be effective in exhausting the soil seed-bank, providing the weeds do not pose a serious competition with the crop plants. Many of the plant species tested were not attacked, suggesting a different mechanism of resistance, or lack of stimulants for O. ramosa seed germination. Of the species reported to be good "trap crops" for this parasite, L. usitatissimum showed very low infection, but B. campestris, C. frutescens, C. annuum, Coriandrum sativum, and T foenum-graecum were heavily infected.

Effects of experimental restoration on the diaspore bank of an upland moor degraded by Pteridium aquilinum invasion	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												We assessed the effects of a range of experimental restoration treatments on the diaspore bank (seed and spores) on an upland moor infested by dense Pteridium aquilinum, 9 years after implementation. Experimental treatment included both Pteridium control (cutting, spraying and combinations) and restoration treatments (grazing, seeding); both univariate and multivariate analyses of variance were used to assess significant effects. The seed bank was made up largely of Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus and Agrostis capillaris with the majority germinating from the litter (38 per cent) and upper soil layer (53 per cent). Soil depth influenced species composition and density, with greatest numbers near the surface, in keeping with a negative exponential response. In the lowest soil depth only ferns were abundant. A. capillaris seed density was greater in the most disturbed treatment (cut twice yearly with grazing), whereas C vulgaris was greater in the low-disturbance treatment (herbicide application only). The diaspore bank composition response identified that certain treatment combinations had a grass-heath composition in the upper soil layer, which may assist future restoration. There was a significant effect of C. vulgaris seed addition detected in the Pteridium litter layer suggesting that this litter acted as a barrier to seed transfer to the soil. There was little evidence of coupling developing between the diaspore bank and vegetation. The most successful treatment combination was cutting twice per yr with low grazing plus C. vulgaris addition as brash. Where seed is added the Pteridium litter should be disturbed.

J	Michalski, SG; Durka, W				Michalski, Stefan G.; Durka, Walter			High selfing and high inbreeding depression in peripheral populations of Juncus atratus	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The mating system of a plant is the prime determinant of its population genetic structure. However, mating system effects may be modified by postzygotic mechanisms like inbreeding depression. Furthermore, historical as well as contemporary ecological factors and population characteristics, like the location within the species range can contribute to genetic variability. Using microsatellite markers we assessed the population genetic structure of the wind-pollinated Juncus atratus in 16 populations from peripheral and nearly central areas of the distribution range and studied the mating system of the species. In three peripheral populations, outcrossing rates at seeds stage were low (mean t(m) = 5.6%), suggesting a highly autogamous mating system. Despite this fact, on adult stage both individual heterozygosity (mean H-O = 0.48) and gene diversity (mean H-E = 0.58) were high even in small populations. Inbreeding coefficients were consistently low among all populations (mean F-IS = 0.15). Within the three peripheral populations indirect estimates of lifetime inbreeding depression were surprisingly high (delta(eq) = 0.96) and inbreeding depression could be shown to act mostly on early seedling establishment. Similar conditions of autogamy combined with high inbreeding depression are typical for plants with a large lifetime genomic mutation rate that cannot avoid selfing by geitonogamy. However, the results presented here are unexpected for small-statured, herbaceous plants. Substantial genetic differentiation among all populations was found (mean F-ST = 0.24). An isolation-by-distance pattern was apparent on large scale but not on local scale suggesting that the overall pattern was largely influenced by historical factors, e. g. colonization, whereas locally genetic drift was of greater importance than gene flow. Peripheral populations exhibited lower genetic diversity and higher inbreeding coefficients when compared with subcentral populations.

Seed rain and soil seed bank of Picea asperata Mast. in subalpine coniferous forest of western Sichuan, China	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Dragon spruce (Picea asperata Mast.) is widely planted on clear-cuts from natural subalpine coniferous forests in western Sichuan. To assess the natural regeneration potential of this species in spruce plantations of different ages, field studies on the seed rain, seed bank, and seedling recruitment were conducted in 20-year, 30-year, and 60-year plantations, and in a retained natural forest ca. 150 years old for comparison. Moreover, a series of temperature and light regimes were also designed in March 2003 to test germination/dormancy responses of the P. asperata seeds to different conditions. In the plantations considered, both the densities of seed rain and soil seed bank increased with increasing stand age, whereas they were both low beneath the natural forest partially due to low adult density of P. asperata adult trees. P. asperata has a transient seed bank, and ca. 60% of seeds were found in the litter layer. Seed decay and seed predation were the two most important factors affecting soil seed bank dynamics, which caused a number of seed losses from the soil. Only a small fraction germinated and produced seedlings, and the indices of the losses from the seed bank via germination in the 30-year plantation, 60-year plantation and natural forest were 4.75, 5.10, and 2.80%, respectively. High seedling mortality was observed after seedling emergence, and most of the germinated seedlings died out within one growing season. The P. asperata seeds showed a high percent germination and no significant differences under most light and temperature regimes except for full sunlight or temperature below 5 degrees C. In conclusion, despite a substantial number of seed produced, the high depletion of soil seed, the low seedling output, and high seedling mortality may obscure the natural regeneration potential of this tree species.																	1126-3504					NOV	2007	141	3					314	322		10.1080/11263500701627406							WOS:000252341900004						
J	Honda, Y; Katoh, K				Honda, Yukio; Katoh, Kazuhiro			Strict requirement of fluctuating temperatures as a reliable gap signal in Picris hieracioides var. japonica seed germination	PLANT ECOLOGY												Picris hieracioides var. japonica (Asteraceae), which grows in occasionally disturbed habitats such as riverbanks, is rarely observed under dense vegetation. We examined the effect of the experience and timing of receiving leaf-transmitted light in gap-detecting seed germination in this plant. Seeds under unfiltered light, which simulated the light conditions of seeds on the soil surface in a canopy gap, germinated at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. However, most seeds in darkness, which simulated the light conditions of seeds buried in the soil without receiving leaf-transmitted light, germinated under temperature fluctuations of over 4 degrees C. Seeds in darkness after receiving leaf-transmitted light for 1 week, which simulated the light conditions of seeds buried in the soil after receiving leaf-transmitted light, germinated under temperature fluctuations of over 8 degrees C. Finally, seeds under continuous leaf-transmitted light, which simulated the light conditions of seeds on the soil surface below preexisting vegetation, germinated under temperature fluctuations of over 12 degrees C. Seeds that experience unfiltered light, which suggests that they are in a gap, should not delay germination. In contrast, seeds that have received leaf-transmitted light should delay germination until the vegetation above is removed. Seeds exposed to leaf-transmitted light required larger temperature fluctuations in darkness than did untreated seeds, and seeds under continuous leaf-transmitted light required the largest temperature fluctuations. The various germination reactions to each gap signal in P. hieracioides var. japonica seeds allow the more reliable detection of gaps for subsequent seedling establishment. The requirement for gap signals that created high precision of timing in the germination process results in the germination of this species only in gaps. Therefore, P. hieracioides var. japonica is rarely found under dense vegetation.																	1385-0237					NOV	2007	193	1					147	156		10.1007/s11258-006-9254-9							WOS:000249802700011

The potential for horses to disperse alien plants along recreational trails	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Plant invasions are rapidly becoming an important threat to the conservation of wildlands. Understanding how potentially 19 invasive plants are dispersed to new habitats is a critical step in the process of understanding such invasions. Our objective was to characterize the potential for long-distance transport of plant species in the digestive tract of horses along recreational trails. 14 We sampled horse dung along the first 4 000 in of the Lower Piney River trail in the White River Forest of western Colorado. 14 We evaluated the seed content of each sample by applying standard methods for soil seed bank analysis. We found 20 species and 564 seedlings. Twelve of the species were graminoids, 6 were forbs, 1 was a shrub, and 1 was a tree. The species were evenly 141 divided between natives and aliens, but 85% of the seedlings were aliens. An average of 47 seedlings emerged per sample, but the range was from 4 to 192. Our results make it clear that horses, and very likely all pack stock used on recreational trails, 14 represent a potentially important dispersal vector for alien plants into western wildlands.																	1550-7424					NOV	2007	60	6					574	577		10.2111/06-102R1.1							WOS:000251094300003

The seed bank consisted of 36-plant species altogether, of which 14 were not represented in the vegetation. There were 42 phanerogam species in the forest understory, which were not represented in the seed bank. There were on average 900 seeds per m(2) in the top 10 cm soil layer, this number was significantly higher in young (1105 seeds) than in old (640 seeds) stands. Differences in the seed bank between the top 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers were negligible. Rubus idaeus and Carex pallescens were the most abundant species in the seed bank, the first species being abundant in old stand gaps, whereas the second was not represented in the vegetation. CA ordination showed that community composition differed between the vegetation and the seed bank, as well as between young and old stands. Within both young and old stands, there was a poor correspondence between the vegetation and the seed bank. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kettenring, KM; Galatowitsch, SM				Kettenring, Karin M.; Galatowitsch, Susan M.			Temperature requirements for dormancy break and seed germination vary greatly among 14 wetland Carex species	AQUATIC BOTANY												We evaluated dormancy loss in seeds of 14 Carex species (C atherodes, C brevior, C comosa, C. cristatella, C. cryptolepis, C. granularis, C. hystericina, C lacustris, C pellita, C scoparia, C stipata, C stricta, C utriculata, C vulpinoidea) under growing season and stratification conditions and determined the temperature requirements for germination. Seeds were germinated for I year at a diel temperature regime (5/1 degrees C, 14/1 degrees C, 22/8 degrees C, or 27/15 degrees C) or a seasonal regime (seeds moved among the four diel regimes to mimic seasonal temperatures). All species had conditionally dormant seeds at maturity. The optimal temperature for germination of most species was 27/15 T. The 14 species were grouped by their seed viability, dormancy, and germination with a Seed Regeneration Index (SRI; range 0-1) using the results of this study and a previously published paper on stratification effects on Carex seed dormancy and germination. The eight species that had an SRI value > 0.5 (C. brevior, C. comosa, C. cristatella, C. cryptolepis, C. hystericina, C. scoparia, C. stipata, C. vulpinoidea) had high seed viability (> 60%) and required little to no stratification to germinate readily over a broad range of temperatures. The six species with an SRI value < 0.5 (C. atherodes, C granularis, C. lacustris, C. pellita, C. stricta, C. utriculata) generally had low seed viability (< 50% and often < 1%) and required stratification or particular temperatures (35/30 degrees C or 5/1 degrees C for C. stricta; 35/30 degrees C for C. utriculata; 27/15 degrees C for C. atherodes, C. lacustris, C. pellita; 511 'C for C. granularis) for germination >= 50%. These six species will require more attention from restoration practitioners to ensure that there are sufficient viable seeds to meet revegetation goals, that dormancy break is achieved, and that seeds are sown when temperatures are optimal for germination. The different seed germination syndromes that we found for these Carex species likely contribute to variable seed bank formation and emergence patterns, and species coexistence.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Factors governing the germination of Chara vulgaris L. and Nitella flexilis L. were investigated in a series of three experiments. Temperature, light regimes, drying, and changes in oxidation-reduction potential are postulated to be possible triggers working in isolation or in combination on dormant oospores originating in sediments with different physical/chemical characteristics. In Experiment 1, none of the N. flexilis oospores inoculated into Petri plates and culture tubes containing either agar or water and then exposed to 'normal' 12 h daylight 12 It dark germinated when the redox of the media remained relatively constant over the 20-day observation period, while all of the oospores in a tube in which the redox of the agar declined to below 200 mV, germinated. Similarly no germination occurred in the dark without a decrease in redox. When redox fell to below 200 mV, 11% of the inoculated oospores germinated. In Experiment 2, N.flexilis and C vulgaris oospores were subjected to cold pre-treatments and inoculated into either water or agar in both plates and tubes. Of the N. flexilis oospores 53% germinated in the dark, and 31% under normal lighting. Of the C vulgaris, 3% germinated in the dark and 53% under normal lighting. The stimulation of germination with the decrease in redox in the media did not re-occur. Experiment 3 compared the germination of C vulgaris oospores from four ponds contaminated by mining wastes and from a comparatively clean wetland. The oospores were again subjected (or not) to cold pre-treatments, and were drawn from both freshly concentrated sediments and air-dried sediments that had been held in storage for either 97 or 376 days. Notably, a consistent reduction in oospore viability occurred in oospores from a particular mine pond, contaminated by nickel tailings. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kellerman, MJS; Van Rooyen, MW				Kellerman, M. J. S.; Van Rooyen, M. W.			Seasonal variation in soil seed bank size and species composition of selected habitat types in Maputaland, South Africa	BOTHALIA												Seasonal variation in seed bank size and species composition of five selected habitat types within the Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa, was investigated. At three-month intervals, soil samples were randomly collected from five different habitat types: a, Licuati forest; b, Licuati thicket; c, a bare or sparsely vegetated zone surrounding the forest edge, referred to as the forest/grassland ecotone; d, grassland; and e, open woodland. Most species in the seed bank flora were either grasses, sedges, or forbs, with hardly any evidence of woody species. The Licuati forest and thicket soils produced the lowest seed densities in all seasons. Licuati forest and grassland seed banks showed a two-fold seasonal variation in size, those of the Licuati thicket and woodland a three-fold variation in size, whereas the forest/grassland ecotone maintained a relatively large seed bank all year round. The woodland seed bank had the highest species richness, whereas the Licuati forest and thicket soils were poor in species. Generally, it was found that the greatest correspondence in species composition was between the Licuati forest and thicket, as well as the forest/grassland ecotone and grassland seed bank floras.				van Rooyen, Margaretha W/K-3559-2019													0006-8241					OCT	2007	37	2					249	258		10.4102/abc.v37i2.323							WOS:000252335200014						
J	Kotanen, PM				Kotanen, Peter M.			Effects of fungal seed pathogens under conspecific and heterospecific trees in a temperate forest	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												This study investigated the impacts of soil fungi on seeds of two eastern North American temperate-zone trees: Acer saccharum Marsh. (sugar maple) and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr (eastern hemlock). Seeds of each species were buried at locations dominated by either conspecifics or heterospecifics. Half were protected with fungicide, and the net consequences for survival and germination were assessed. Net effects of fungicide usually were positive, indicating that pathogens affected seeds more strongly than any potential mutualists. Losses of A. saccharum to fungi were modest, and almost identical in areas dominated by itself versus areas dominated by T. canadensis. In contrast, fungal impacts on T. canadensis were strongly habitat-dependent: losses to fungi were high in T. canadensis-dominated sites, but not in A. saccharum-dominated sites. This result is consistent with an accumulation of host-specific pathogens, either by a direct feedback between T. canadensis and its fungal enemies, or indirectly through modification of the soil environment. Even though these two trees share similar habitats, responses to fungicide indicate that their seeds are affected very differently by the soil environment.

Alvar seed bank germination responses to variable soil moisture	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Environmental heterogeneity can create differential opportunities for seedling recruitment among plant species. We collected soil seed banks from alvar habitats in southern Ontario and exposed them to three soil moisture treatments. Density and species richness of germinants were greatest in treatments kept moist compared with treatments where soil was either saturated with standing water at the soil surface or where drought was imposed. Contrary to previous studies, the drought treatment did not stimulate the germination of species that remained ungerminated in other treatments, but did increase the germination of five species that also germinated in wetter soils. Although 12 of the 40 species germinated in only one of the three treatments, overall community composition among watering treatments was relatively consistent; few species showed evidence of differential responses to soil moisture conditions. Variability in soil moisture in this system can alter population and community properties by rarefaction effects, as opposed to niche differences among species.

J	De Groote, H; Wangare, L; Kanampiu, F				De Groote, Hugo; Wangare, Lucy; Kanampiu, Fred			Evaluating the use of herbicide-coated imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seeds to control Striga in farmers' fields in Kenya	CROP PROTECTION												The performance of imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seed, coated with the herbicide, and conventional maize seeds were compared for the control of Striga during on-farm trials. The researcher-managed trials from 2002 (on 3 farms with 2 replications, using conventional hybrid maize as control) showed good Striga control, especially in the early stages, increasing yields by 2.39 tons/ha. Farmer-managed trials from 2004 (on 60 farms in 3 districts, no replications, using farmer's maize variety as control) showed good control in two districts, increasing average yield by 0.69 tons/ha. In the third district, the IR-maize and control plots showed similar levels of Striga infestation, probably caused by heavy rains and flooding which can wash off the herbicide. The yield response to IR-maize seed was categorized at two levels. The germplasm effect was estimated at 0.37 tons/ha. The herbicide effect was estimated at 0.13 tons/ha (49 kg/ha for each reduction of the Striga numbers/m(2)). With maize prices at US$202/ton, seed prices at US$34/ha and herbicide cost at US$4/ha, the overall marginal rate of return (MRR) was 2.4 (good), with an MRR of 1.9 (respectable) for the germplasm and an MRR of 5.6 (very good) for the IR-maize technology. Farmers generally appreciated the technology and indicated their willingness to pay (WTP), which was, however, very price-sensitive. The methodology of on-farm work can be improved substantially by including a sufficient number of sites, by measuring compounding factors (soil fertility, Striga seed bank, rainfall), by involving the farmers more (explain the design better, visit more often), by inviting more farmers for the evaluation and by using experimental auctions of IR-maize seed to estimate their WTP for this new technology.

Using a 60- year time series of annual sighting records of plant species, we studied the correlates of local extinction risk associated with a risk of species extinction in the Park Grass Experiment where plants received long- term exposure to nutrient enrichment, soil acidification, and reductions in habitat size. We used multivariate linear models to assess how extrinsic threats and life history traits influence extinction risk. We investigated effects of four extrinsic threats ( nitrogen enrichment, productivity, acidification, and plot size) as well as 11 life history traits ( month of earliest. flowering,. flowering duration, stress tolerance, ruderalness [ plant species' ability to cope with habitat disturbance], plant height, diaspore mass, seed bank, life form, dispersal mode, apomixis [ the ability for a species to reproduce asexually through seeds], and mating system). Extinction risk was not influenced by plant family. All of the 11 life history traits except life form and all threat variables influenced extinction risk but always via interactions which typically involved one threat variable and one life history trait. We detected comparatively few significant interactions between life history traits, and the interacting traits compensated for each other. These results suggest that simple predictions about extinction risk based on species' traits alone will often fail. In contrast, understanding the interactions between extrinsic threats and life history traits will allow us to make more accurate predictions of extinctions.

Persistent soil seed bank in Agriophyllum squarrosum (Chenopodiaceae) in a deep sand profile: Variation along a transect of an active sand dune	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Distribution of soil seed bank in a deep sand profile along a transect of an active sand dune has been rarely studied. Reports on the persistence of the seed bank of pioneering dune plants are also scarce. In mid-September of 2005, just before the new seed set, an investigation was therefore conducted to determine the magnitude of the persistent soil seed bank in the pioneering annual plant Agriophyllum squarrosum in a I m sand profile along a transect of an active sand dune. Horizontally, seeds on the middle and upper windward slope, and on the lower leeward slope were more abundant than those in other locations. On the leeward slope, the mean seed density increased from the upper to the lower slope, but on the windward slope a contrary trend was evident. Seeds tended to be vertically concentrated in the profile of 20-70 cm, and be buried deeper and deeper along the transect from the lower windward slope to the lower leeward slope. This study indicates that (1) the presence of a persistent seed bank is one of the mechanisms for the pioneering annual dune species to adapt to active dunes; (2) the soil seed bank pattern in the active dune at the end of the growing season differs from that at the beginning of the growing season; and (3) a shallow sand profile is not enough to elucidate soil seed bank pattern of active sand dunes.

Location Continental western Europe, five countries in particular: France, Luxemburg, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The region is situated between 42 degrees and 55 degrees N and 5 degrees W and 15 degrees E and has a summed total area of 971,404 km(2). Methods Distribution data were compiled from five national data bases and converted to a 10' grid. Life-history traits were taken from existing compilations of autecological information of European species. The spatial arrangement of occupied grid cells was investigated using Ripley's K. Cross-species correlations and phylogenetically independent contrasts were used to investigate the relationships between plant life-history traits and three range characteristics: area of occupancy, latitudinal extent and centroid latitude. Results For herbaceous species, seed dispersal mode, seed production and seed bank longevity exhibited significant associations with geographical range characteristics, including area of occupancy. Woody plant species exhibited fewer significant associations, although maximum height was positively associated with range centroid latitude within the study area. Furthermore, the ranges of species with limited dispersal ability were found to be more clustered than the ranges of species with morphological adaptations for long-distance seed dispersal. Main conclusions For western European forest plant species, life-history traits that are related to colonization ability at local scales are associated with variation in large-scale geographical range characteristics. This finding implies that the distributions of some forest plant species in the study area may be limited by seed dispersal and colonization capacity rather than climate or other environmental factors.

J	Arunyawat, U; Stephan, W; Stadler, T				Arunyawat, Uraiwan; Stephan, Wolfgang; Staedler, Thomas			Using multilocus sequence data to assess population structure, natural selection, and linkage disequilibrium in wild tomatoes	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												We employed a multilocus approach to examine the effects of population subdivision and natural selection on DNA polymorphism in 2 closely related wild tomato species (Solanum peruvianum and Solanum chilense), using sequence data for 8 nuclear loci from populations across much of the species' range. Both species exhibit substantial levels of nucleotide variation. The species-wide level of silent nucleotide diversity is 18% higher in S. peruvianum (pi(sil) approximate to 2.50%) than in S. chilense (pi(sil) approximate to 2.12%). One of the loci deviates from neutral expectations, showing a clinal pattern of nucleotide diversity and haplotype structure in S. chilense. This geographic pattern of variation is suggestive of an incomplete (ongoing) selective sweep, but neutral explanations cannot be entirely dismissed. Both wild tomato species exhibit moderate levels of population differentiation (average F-ST approximate to 0.20). Interestingly, the pooled samples (across different denies) exhibit more negative Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D values; this marked excess of low-frequency polymorphism can only be explained by population (or range) expansion and is unlikely to be due to population structure per se. We thus propose that population structure and population/range expansion are among the most important evolutionary forces shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity within and among denies in these wild tomatoes. Patterns of population differentiation may also be impacted by soil seed banks and historical associations mediated by climatic cycles. Intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) decays very rapidly with physical distance, suggesting high recombination rates and effective population sizes in both species. The rapid decline of LD seems very promising for future association studies with the purpose of mapping functional variation in wild tomatoes.

Effects of prescribed fire and thinning on the spatial heterogeneity of the seed bank in a mixed oak forest	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Prescribed fire and thinning are commonly employed management practices in mixed-oak forests of the central Appalachians. The effects of these practices on the soil seed bank are important to consider in order to evaluate the full impact of these treatments on plant community dynamics in the understory. Species composition of the soil seed bank was examined under three treatments: thin, burn, and thin followed by burning, and an untreated control. Thinning was conducted in Fall 2000, and burns were conducted in Spring 2001. Soil samples were collected in March 2004, three years following treatment. Species composition was assessed by seedling emergence. Seventy total species were found in the seed bank. Ruderal species such as Erechtites hieraciifolia, Carex spp., and Rubus spp. were the most commonly occurring species across all treatments. No significant difference in species composition or proportion of functional groups was found between any of the treatment groups. However, as found in previous studies, species composition of the seed bank and aboveground vegetation were significantly different in all treatments. Species composition and canopy cover were each significantly spatially autocorrelated in the thinned and burned treatment. While thinning and burning did not produce detectable changes in the species composition of the soil seed bank at these sites, they may influence the spatial heterogeneity of the soil seed bank.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				OCT	2007	27	4					320	331		10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[320:EOPFAT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000250291700005						
J	Guimaraes, IC; Proctor, J				Guimaraes, Ima Celia; Proctor, John			Mechanisms of plant regeneration during succession after shifting cultivation in eastern Amazonia	PLANT ECOLOGY												The role of seed bank, seed rain, and regeneration from seedlings and sprouts after swidden agriculture was compared in 5-, 10- and 20-year-old secondary forest and in a primary forest in Bragantina, Para, Brazil. The seed bank (0-5 cm soil depth) was largest in the 5-year-old forest (1190 +/- 284 seeds m(-2)) and decreased nearly ten-fold with age to 137 +/- 19 seeds m(-2) in the primary forest. The highest seed rain was in the 5-year-old forest (883 +/- 230 seeds m(-2) year(-1)) and the least in the primary forest (220 +/- 80 seeds m(-2) year(-1)). Large plants (>= 5 cm dbh) had more individuals and species that regenerated from sprouts than from seeds and the most abundant tree species in the secondary forest stands of all ages appear to be maintained by sprouting. The smaller individuals (>= 1 m tall, < 5 cm dbh) in the 5-year-old forest were mainly from sprouts, but those in the older secondary forests originated mainly from seeds. These results show that at the beginning of succession, although many species can be introduced to swidden fallow from seed bank and seed rain, it is the sprout that is the main source of recruits of primary forest species in secondary forests in Bragantina.

Glyphosate-induced weed shifts in glyphosate-resistant corn or a rotation of glyphosate-resistant corn, sugarbeet, and spring wheat	WEED TECHNOLOGY												A field trial was conducted for 6 yr (1998 through 2003) at Scottsbluff, NE, to measure weed shifts following multiple applications of two rates of glyphosate or alternating glyphosate with nonglyphosate treatments in continuous corn or in a crop rotation of corn, sugarbeet, and spring wheat with all three crops resistant to glyphosate. After 6 yr, plant densities of common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, hairy nightshade, and common purslane increased in the crop-rotation treatment compared with continuous corn. There were four weed control subplot treatments consisting of two in-crop applications of glyphosate at 0.4 or 0.8 kg ae/ha each spring, alternating two applications of glyphosate at 0.8 kg/ha one year with a nonglyphosate treatment the next year, or a nonglyphosate treatment each year. The composition of the weed population averaged across all four treatments shifted from kochia and wild proso millet to predominately common lambsquarters. After 3 yr of using glyphosate at 0.4 kg/ha twice each year, common lambsquarters density increased compared with that in the 0.8 kg/ha rate of glyphosate or alternating glyphosate treatments. By the sixth year, the density of common lambsquarters in the glyphosate at 0.4 kg/ha treatment had increased to the extent that corn grain yield was reduced 43% compared with corn grain yield in the 0.8 kg/ha glyphosate treatment. Using glyphosate at either rate for 6 yr decreased the densities of kochia, wild proso millet, and longspine sandbur, did not alter densities of redroot pigweed and green foxtail, and increased the density of hairy nightshade. In the low-rate treatment of glyphosate, the number of common lambsquarters seeds in the seed bank were 134 seeds/kg soil in 1998, declined to 15 seeds/kg by 2002, but began to increase in 2003 as the densities of plants not controlled by glyphosate increased.

The results showed that in shifting sand dunes, content of very fine sand, silt and clay, organic matter, total N and P, available P and soil moisture at 0-20cm depth was higher under remnant shrub canopies of Caragana microphylla and Salix gordejevii than in open space. Soil seed density was nearly 12 times higher under Arternisia halodendron canopy than in open space. The herbaceous perennial Pennisetum centrasiaticum, usually restricted to fixed sand dunes, not only survived under shrub canopy in shifting sand dunes, but also had higher plant densities, plant height, cover and aboveground biomass. After fencing shifting sand dunes and establishing shrub plantings, fine soil particles, soil nutrients, plant species richness, vegetation cover and aboveground biomass increased gradually both under shrub canopy and in open spaces with increasing enclosure or plantation age, but the speed of restoration processes was significantly higher under canopy compared to open spaces. These results suggest that shrubs created significant "islands of fertility" and had an important role in maintaining or augmenting herbaceous species richness in shifting sand dunes, and could improve soil properties and facilitate vegetation recovery for controlling desertification processes.																	0925-8574					SEP 3	2007	31	1					1	8		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2007.04.010							WOS:000249086400001

Factors influencing the natural regeneration of Polyscias kikuyensis Summerh in Nyamweru forest - Kikuyu escarpment, Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Polyscias kikuyensis is endemic to central Kenya highlands but shows poor natural regeneration. In addition, there is widespread destruction of its natural habitat. This study investigated effects of shade and moisture on seedling regeneration and growth, soil seed distribution and seed viability. The soil seed reserves, seedlings, saplings and trees were greater in undisturbed sites. Seedlings were mainly found in shaded microsites in disturbed sites. High light and low moisture levels depressed growth of seedlings. Over 40% of seedlings that were continuously exposed to full sunlight died. Fresh seeds were predominantly empty whereas germination of fresh whole seeds and soil seeds was low. Higher seed germination was also recorded from seeds collected from undisturbed sites. The concentration of soil seed reserves decreased with soil depth and distance from mother tree. The results indicate that any forest exploitation that exposes seedlings to continuous direct radiation and soil to moisture loss will adversely affect the growth of seedlings and seed germination and contribute to poor regeneration of P. kikuyensis. In addition, the soil seed reserves are a poor indicator of the ability of this species to regenerate, as most seeds were not viable.																	0141-6707					SEP	2007	45	3					242	248		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00698.x							WOS:000248867100003

In order to study the reproductive characteristics of P. halepensis after forest fires, six locations were selected in four areas affected by serious fires in the summer of 1994, and the following different precipitation zones were studied: dry-subhumid, dry and semi-arid. Ten years after the fires, data relevant to the production of pine cones: serotinous (grey), mature (brown), immature (green) and opened cones, was collected from areas with natural post-fire regeneration. Various cone and seed characteristics, such as pine cone seed number and weight, and germination percentage, were measured. The results showed greater production of cones and strobili in high-density sites. The biggest cone sizes (volume) and seed number per cone were related to site quality (dry-subhumid precipitation zone). Also, viability and germination percentages were higher with better site quality, with significant differences in values for serotinous and non-serotinous cones. Despite these differences, the canopy seed bank was large enough to ensure regeneration in this area for this age stand.

Response surfaces for the combined effects of heat shock and smoke on germination of 16 species forming soil seed banks in south-east Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												There is limited understanding of how fire-related cues such as heat shock and smoke can combine to affect the germination response of seeds from fire-prone vegetation because combinations of multiple levels of both cues have rarely been investigated. Germination response surfaces were determined for the combination of heat shock and smoke by applying factorial combinations of temperature (up to 100 degrees C) and aerosol smoke (0-20 min) to 16 species that form soil seed banks in the Sydney region of south-eastern Australia. Duplicate populations of three species were also examined to assess the constancy of a species response surface. Of the 19 populations examined, 16 showed a germination response to both the fire cues, which combined interactively in 14 populations, and independently in two. No population responded only to a single cue; however, seeds of 11 populations responded to heat in the absence of smoke, and nine responded to smoke in the absence of heat. Heat applied in the absence of smoke negatively affected germination in seven populations, either progressively as temperature increased, or above a set temperature. Negative germination responses over part of the temperature range were fully reversed at higher temperatures for unsmoked seeds of four populations (curvilinear heat response). Smoke effects were most frequently positive over all or part of the range of durations used, and when combined with heat frequently fully or partially reversed negative heat effects. Three populations required the obligatory combination of smoke and heat. A novel response to the cues was observed for three species, with smoke reversing negative heat effects at 75 degrees C, being supplanted by a positive heat response of unsmoked seed at 100 degrees C. The response surface for duplicate populations of two of the three species examined was variable. Heat shock and smoke frequently combined to affect germination, in both positive and negative ways. Consequently, to gain an accurate assessment of the response of seeds to fires, an experimental design that samples within the potential response zones of germination cues is essential.

The soil samples were placed to germinate in trays under 11.5 and 60 % shade. The germinated seeds were classified as graminoids, herbaceous-lianas, shrub and arboreal groups. A total of 3,416 seeds germinated, being 30.2 % of graminoids, 29.2 % herbaceous-lianas, 17.5 % shrub and 23.1 % arboreal individuals. The shrub-arboreal individuals were distributed into 17 families, 25 genus and 31 species. Melastomataceae, Cecropiaceae and Piperaceae accounted for 31.8 %, 10.0 % and 8.8 %, respectively, of the total shrub-arboreal species germinated seeds, being Miconia cinnamomifolia and Leandra purpurascens the predominant species (59.3 % of the total germinated seeds). Pioneer species accounted for 61.3 % of the shrub-arboreal species and 88.5 % of the germinated seeds. There were no late secondary species. The average number of germinated seeds from all life habit and sites studied accounted for 949 seeds/m(2). The number of shrub-arboreal species and germinated seeds differed significantly by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P <= 0.05) between sites. The dominance of pioneer species in the soil seed bank of the studied forest indicates that the buried seeds can be considered satisfactory for natural regeneration in treefall gaps and clearcut areas. Therefore, in order to maintain a continuous forest succession, when there is predominance of initial and late secondary species, the soil seed bank is not satisfactory. In this situation, the management of the seedlings stock is required to sustain the natural regeneration.

Reciprocal interactions and adjustments between fluvial landforms and vegetation dynamics in river corridors: A review of complementary approaches	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Until recently, one-way relationships between flow dynamics, geomorphology and plant ecology were considered dominantly when studying the functioning of river systems, whereby fluvial landforms and hydrogeomorphic processes drive the evolution of riparian plant communities. However, biological communities may significantly control geomorphic processes and have strong impacts on landform dynamics. In order to fully identify the processes linked to river dynamics (changes in time and space of fluvial landforms and associated plant communities), conceptual multidisciplinary progress is clearly needed. To understand the mutual interactions and feedbacks between fluvial landforms and vegetation community dynamics, this paper presents a detailed literature review of fluvial geomorphology, riparian plant ecology and hydraulic engineering knowledge. The historical and recent development of ecological plant succession theory toward the integration of hydrogeomorphic disturbances is discussed as well as the integration of vegetation within geomorphology as a significant landform control factor, incorporating both hydrogeomorphic controls on riparian vegetation dynamics and mechanical impacts of vegetation structures on flow properties and sediment dynamics. Recent progress in ecology, hydraulic engineering and fluvial geomorphology emphasises interdependence between biological and physical forms and processes. Based on this literature review, a 'fluvial biogeomorphic succession' concept is proposed to link fluvial landform and riparian vegetation community evolution within a bi-directional model. The succession of fluvial landforms and associated vegetation communities is composed of four main critical phases that represent a shift in the relative dominance of hydrogeomorphic and ecological processes as a response to biostabilisation and passive bioconstruction processes. The positive feedbacks associated with this shift lead to the development of characteristic biogeomorphic structures such as vegetated banks, islands or floodplains, which are moderated by the biogeomorphic functional roles of 'ecosystem engineers' that induce or reinforce the positive feedbacks. This fluvial biogeomorphic succession concept relates the natural Darwinian selection and ecological succession theories to fluvial geomorphology. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Soil vs. canopy seed storage and plant species coexistence in species-rich Australian shrublands	ECOLOGY												The fire-prone shrublands of southwestern Australia are renowned for their high plant species diversity and prominence of canopy seed storage (serotiny). We compared species richness, abundance, and life history attributes for soil and canopy seed banks in relation to extant vegetation among four sites with different substrate conditions and high species turnover (50-80%) to identify whether this unusual community-level organization of seed storage might contribute to maintenance of high species richness. Soil seed bank (SSB) densities were low to moderate (233-1435 seeds/m(2)) compared with densities for other Mediterranean-type vegetation and were lowest for sites with highest canopy seed bank (CSB) species richness and lowest nutrient availability, but not richness or abundance of resprouters. Annuals were infrequent in the lowest nutrient sites, but there was no evidence that small SSB size was due to low seed inputs or a trade-off between seed production /storage and seed size in response to low nutrient availability. Sorensen's similarity between SSB and extant vegetation was 26-43% but increased to 54-57% when the CSB was included, representing levels higher than reported for most other ecosystems. Resprouting species were well represented in both the SSB and CSB, and there was no evidence for lower seed production in resprouters than in non-sprouters overall. The SSB and CSB held no species in common and were characterized by markedly different seed dispersal attributes, with winged or small seeds in the CSB and seeds dispersed by ants, birds, and wind (though none with wings) in the SSB. There was no evidence of spatial differentiation in the distribution of seeds of SSB species between vegetated and open microsites that might facilitate species coexistence, but most woody non-sprouters showed aggregation at scales of 1-2 m, implying limited seed dispersal. High similarity between overall seed bank (SSB + CSB) and extant species composition, high number of resprouting species, and seed dispersal processes before (SSB) and after fire (CSB) leading to differential spatial aggregation of postfire recruits from the two seed bank types may buffer species composition against rapid change and provide a mechanism for maintaining species coexistence at the local scale.

J	Zhao, WZ; Zhang, ZH; Li, QY				Zhao, Wenzhi; Zhang, Zhihui; Li, Qiuyan			Growth and reproduction of Sophora moorcroftiana responding to altitude and sand burial in the middle Tibet	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Sophora moorcroftiana, an endemic leguminous shrub in Tibet, is found in valleys, slopes, terraces from 3,000 to 3,900 m above sea level along the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. S. moorcroftiana is more tolerant of sand burial than other species in the valleys and is regarded as an ideal species for studying acclimatization to climatic factors. Stem basal diameter showed decline as altitude increased from 3,039 to 3,928 m in the Yarlung Zangbo River valley. Population density increased with the rise of altitude. However, seed bank density, seed germination and seed weight of S. moorcroftiana did not change with changing elevation. Plants responded to altitude variances with remarkable sensitivities. Stem basal diameter size declined along the vertical gradient between plateau and mountainside. Both in alpine and plateau areas, plants similarly adapted growth to altitude, but displayed different responses with respect to reproductive parameters, such as seed bank density, dry weight of seed, seed germination, seedling density and sapling density. Sand accretion remarkably reduced seed bank density and seedling density of the total population of S. moorcroftiana, but could promote shoot sprouting and shoot growing on the individual scale that stimulated the overall development of the population. The results suggested that this particular foredune species did not merely tolerate sand burial, but actually responded positively to sand accumulation.																	0943-0105					SEP	2007	53	1					11	17		10.1007/s00254-006-0613-6							WOS:000248930300002						
J	Gastaldello, P; Ruel, JC; Lussier, JM				Gastaldello, Pierre; Ruel, Jean-Claude; Lussier, Jean-Martin			Delay in production of poor quality resinous yellow betula : study of the success of regeneration installation	FORESTRY CHRONICLE												The abundance of poor quality stands in the North American hardwood and mixedwood forests poses important regeneration challenges. These stands have an open canopy with a well-developed shrub layer dominated by non-commercial species. The present study aims at testing the efficiency of a natural regeneration approach using a combination of brushing and spot scarification in the cleared strips. Four high-graded stands from the mixedwood zone in Quebec were selected and strips were cleared with a brush saw. Four microsite types created by the scarification were studied: 1-m and 2-m wide pockets, mounds and undisturbed forest floor. The amount of dispersed yellow birch seeds was adequate for two out of the three years of the study. Yellow birch establishment was in phase with seed years and was better on disturbed microsites. Best establishment was observed in seed spots and light conditions in these microsites after three years were better than on mounds or undisturbed ground. On the latter two, survival will likely be impaired by the poor light conditions. Seed spots remain receptive three years after scarification. Softwood regeneration was poor due to a lack of seed trees. The study has shown that seed tree abundance remains sufficient for natural regeneration even in these open stands. It also showed a very rapid regrowth of competing vegetation when root systems and seed banks were not removed by site preparation.																	0015-7546					SEP-OCT	2007	83	5					742	753		10.5558/tfc83742-5							WOS:000250253100031						
J	Gurnell, AM				Gurnell, Angela M.			Analogies between mineral sediment and vegetative particle dynamics in fluvial systems	GEOMORPHOLOGY					26th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium on Geomorphology and Ecosystems	2005	Buffalo, NY					Riparian vegetation fragments and propagules form part of the organic sediment load of rivers. This review paper draws analogies between the transfer of these vegetative particles and that of mineral sediment within river systems. Whole plants, vegetation fragments and propagules are delivered to rivers by physical processes but the timing of seed release and the morphological characteristics of the plants moderate delivery. The transport and deposition of plant material is partly controlled by flow patterns but is also influenced by the buoyancy and morphology of the plant material. Once deposited, the vegetative fragments, propagules and the plants that develop from them can have significant local effects on flow hydraulics and sediment erodibility, producing complex assemblages of physical features. Aggregate vegetative particles are identified as being particularly important in accelerating vegetation colonisation of exposed river sediments, driving landform development and supporting the rapid development of a diverse cover of plants. The geomorphological significance of interactions between vegetative particles and fluvial processes is illustrated at different spatial scales. At the catchment scale, ribbons of mineral and vegetative particles are transferred downstream with inputs continuously supplied throughout the river's course. Individual particles experience phases of mobilisation, transport and deposition. As a result, along larger rivers, down-river changes are typically seen in the size and type of mineral sediment and vegetative particles, and also the species composition of the vegetative particles. Coupled with downstream changes in hydroclimatological conditions within a river's active zone, marked downstream changes in interactions between fluvial processes, vegetation propagules and landforms can result. At the patch scale individual vegetative particles (particularly aggregate particles) deposited on exposed riverine sediments create local hydraulic complexity that induces the scour and deposition of sediment and further plant propagules, resulting in a suite of distinctive landforms which may support many plant species. Within individual reaches, patch-scale interactions between mineral sediment and vegetative particles are moderated or sieved by the form of the reach and its flow patterns, so that the integration of patch-scale effects can support the development of different landforms in different locations.

J	Song, M; Ko, K				Song, Mira; Ko, Kisung			Stable expression of anti-cancer monoclonal antibody in transgenic plants through subsequent generation	KOREAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Recent plant biotechnology and advanced molecular immunology have established plant biopharming system as an alternative way to produce immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies. This plant production system is considered to have several advantages in safety and economical issues compared to other production systems. In this study, we confirmed stable gene insertion and expression of anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb CO17-1A) in transgenic plants through subsequent generation. T-3 and T-4 generation of transgenic seeds were obtained by self-fertilization of homozygous transgenic line of T-2 and T-3 generation, respectively. T3 and T-4 seedlings showed 100% of germination and survival rate in MS media containing kanamycin whereas non-transgenic seedlings did not survive. PCR analysis showed that stable gene insertion of heavy and light chains of mAb CO17-1A in T-3 and T-4 transgenic plants. Immunoblot with densitometric analysis confirmed stable expression of mAb CO17-1A in both T-3 and T-4 transgenic plants. These results suggested that transgenes and expression of anti-cancer mAb CO17-1A are stably transferred and expressed in transgenic plants through subsequent generation by self fertilization, which is applicable to generate seed bank of homozygous transgenic line.																	1226-8763					SEP	2007	25	3					185	190									WOS:000254755100004

Survival of microscopic stages of a perennial kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) from the center and the southern extreme of its range in the Northern Hemisphere after exposure to simulated El Nino stress	MARINE BIOLOGY												Many organisms survive stressful conditions through a tolerant life history stage. The life history known as the alternation of generations is typical of temperate kelps, producing diploid macroscopic stages, and both haploid and diploid microscopic stages, with the haploid stages thought to be stress tolerant. The survival of microscopic stages of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera during El Nino has been suggested, yet has never been tested. This mechanism could be critical for population persistence, particularly at the southern limit of the range in the Northern Hemisphere, which is greatly impacted by El Nino conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine if microscopic stages of giant kelp could survive and recover from El Nino-type conditions and whether those from a population near its southern limit were more tolerant than a population at the center of its range. Microscopic stages were exposed to a laboratory simulation of potential El Nino conditions (high temperature, with and without light and nitrate) for 8 weeks and then allowed to recover at optimal conditions (low temperature and high nitrate) for 8 weeks, while controls were left at optimal conditions the entire 16 weeks test period. Haploid developmental stages from both populations survived and recovered from stressful conditions with no population level effect, suggesting haploid stress-tolerance may be widespread. The more advanced the developmental stage, and the presence of nitrate, resulted in significantly greater recovery for haploids. Yet, none of these stages were able to go on to produce sporophytes, whereas all controls did. There was a large population-level effect for diploids, however, with only microscopic diploid stages (embryonic sporophytes) from the southern-limit population recovering from El Nino simulated stress, suggesting ecotypic adaptation for microscopic sporophytes. Diploid recovery was significantly greater with light. We propose that the diploid stage is the most likely to survive and recover after El Nino conditions, as it would avoid obligate egg and sperm encounters after the stress period. The survivorship of the microscopic diploid in a seed bank analogue may be how the isolated southern-limit populations are able to recover after mass disappearance during El Nino.

An identification key for oospores of the extant charophytes of New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Oospore characteristics are described for charophyte species in New Zealand and a simple key to species is presented, based on consistent oospore features. Oospore dimensions measured using a light microscope and an image analysis system showed that some taxa could be distinguished on size. The ornamentation on the outer wall of oospores was described from both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and was particularly useful for distinguishing Nitella species, while striae number and basal features were helpful in identifying the remaining genera. Species oospore ornamentation is compared with the findings of previous workers and the need for revision of some species in New Zealand is raised. Taxonomic uncertainties involve New Zealand records for Nitella cristata, whereas intraspecific variations in oospore ornamentation within N. hookeri and N. pseudoflabellata indicate that additional taxa should be recognised.																	0028-825X					SEP	2007	45	3					463	476									WOS:000250475800002						
J	Hopfensperger, KN				Hopfensperger, Kristine N.			A review of similarity between seed bank and standing vegetation across ecosystems	OIKOS												The relationship between above and belowground species composition has been researched in forests, grasslands, and wetlands to understand what mechanisms control community composition. I thoroughly reviewed 108 articles published between 1945 and 2006 that summarized and provided specific values on similarities between above and belowground communities to identify common trends among ecosystems. Using Sorenson's index of similarity, I found that standing vegetation and its associated seed bank was the least similar in forest ecosystems, most similar in grasslands, and of intermediate similarity in wetlands. I also discovered that species richness was not related to seed bank - vegetation similarity in any of the three ecosystems. Disturbances were a common mechanism driving community composition in all ecosystems, where similarity decreased with time since disturbance in forest and wetland ecosystems and increased with time since disturbance in grasslands. Knowing the relationships between seed bank and standing vegetation may help conservationists to manage against exotic species, plan for community responses to disturbances, restore diversity, and better understand the resilience of an ecosystem.																	0030-1299					SEP	2007	116	9					1438	1448		10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15818.x							WOS:000249195000002

Seed germination of agricultural weeds is promoted by the butenolide 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one under laboratory and field conditions	PLANT AND SOIL												Here we report that a synthesised form of a naturally occurring chemical (a butenolide, 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one) found in smoke can stimulate seedling emergence of the economically important weed species Avena fatua L. (Poaceae), Arctotheca calendula (L.) Levyns (Asteraceae), Brassica tournefortii Gouan (Brassicaceae), and Raphanus raphanistrum L. (Brassicaceae) under field conditions at rates equivalent to 2-20 g/ha a.i. The butenolide also stimulates germination of freshly collected seeds from wild populations of these species, as well as those of Sisymbrium orientale L. (Brassicaceae), Hordeum leporinum Link (Poaceae) and Echium plantagineum L. (Boraginaceae) under laboratory conditions, consistently greater than that of smoke water. Experiments using B. tournefortii seeds collected from several locations across Western Australia and in different growing seasons found that these factors significantly influence the butenolide response, implying a role of the maternal environment in seed germination/dormancy characteristics. This research highlights the potential of butenolide as an agent for broad acre weed control and land restoration.

The quantity, quality and vertical distribution of seeds were quantified under ploughed or unploughed treatment at community level. We also focussed on a typical semi-aquatic species, Damasonium alisma, to investigate the impact of ploughing at population level. We used two complementary techniques to study seed banks: hand sorting and seedling emergence. We found that species richness of seeds, seed abundance and germination ability were strongly affected by ploughing at community level. Concerning D. alisma, most of the seeds (56%) were stored in the two deepest soil layers among the four considered in ploughed pools. Moreover, the germination rate was higher for buried seeds (84%) than for seeds collected at the surface (33.6%). These patterns were almost inverted in unploughed pools. Our results agree with the temporal storage effect generally suggested to describe the seed bank property of plant communities. But in addition, we showed that ploughing induces a spatial storage effect in accumulating species and individuals in the seed banks that favourably influence community dynamics. We conclude that, in contrast to what is usually thought, ploughing disturbance can be of benefit for such ephemeral wetland vegetation.																	1385-0237					SEP	2007	192	1					45	53		10.1007/s11258-006-9225-1							WOS:000249204100004						
J	Kolehmainen, J; Mutikainen, P				Kolehmainen, Johanna; Mutikainen, Pia			Population stage structure, survival and recruitment in the endangered East African forest herb Saintpaulia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Climatic seasonality, local habitat quality, and edge effects created by forest fragmentation due to human activity may affect the performance of endangered rain forest under-story herbs. Viability and seasonal dynamics of the populations of the endangered Saintpaidia confusa, S. difficilis, and S. grotei were studied in a protected seasonal submontane forest in NE Tanzania by examining plant life-history traits, population stage structure, and the effects of habitat quality on plant performance. The population stage structures were of the dynamic type. There was a lower frequency of seedlings (57.9%) and higher frequency of juvenile (13.3%) and adult plants (28.8%) in S. confusa than in S. difficilis (74%, 10.7% and 15.3%, respectively). Seedling, recruitment occurred from May to August with an average of 54, 103 and 38 emerged seedlings per 1 m(2) study plot (S. confusa. S. difficilis, and S. grotei, respectively). Presence of the seed bank was also an indication of the regeneration potential of the populations. Mortality was high during the dry and hot season from December to March. Survival was lowest in juvenile plants, higher in sterile adult plants and the highest in fertile adult plants. Because survival was the lowest on dry substrates under open canopy, our data suggest that forest fragmentation, by reducing shade and humidity, will increase mortality in Saintpaulia. Furthermore, since the mortality was highest in seedlings and juveniles, forest fragmentation is likely to impede the regeneration of the Saintpaulia populations.																	1385-0237					SEP	2007	192	1					85	95		10.1007/s11258-006-9228-y							WOS:000249204100007

RESTORATION ECOLOGY												In the Loess Plateau, China, arable cultivation of slope lands is common and associated with serious soil erosion. Planting trees or grass may control erosion, but planted species may consume more soil water and can threaten long-term ecosystem sustainability. Natural vegetation succession is an alternative ecological solution to restore degraded land, but there is a time cost, given that the establishment of natural vegetation, adequate to prevent soil erosion, is a longer process than planting. The aims of this study were to identify the environmental factors controlling the type of vegetation established on abandoned cropland and to identify candidate species that might be sown soon after abandonment to accelerate vegetation succession and establishment of natural vegetation to prevent soil erosion. A field survey of thirty-three 2 x 2-m plots was carried out in July 2003, recording age since abandonment, vegetation cover, and frequency of species together with major environmental and soil variables. Data were analyzed using correspondence analysis, classification tree analysis, and species response curves. Four vegetation types were identified and the data analysis confirmed the importance of time since abandonment, total P, and soil water in controlling the type of vegetation established. Among the dominant species in the three late-successional vegetation types, the most appropriate candidates for accelerating and directing vegetation succession were King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum) and Lespedeza davurica (Leguminosae). These species possess combinations of the following characteristics: tolerance of low water and nutrient availability, fibrous root system and strong lateral vegetative spread, and a persistent seed bank.

Because achenes of A. nemorosa are naturally dispersed when they are green, we tested the hypothesis that seeds may not be fully desiccation tolerant and storable at the time of natural dispersal, and that a post-harvest treatment could increase the proportion of desiccation-tolerant seeds. Achenes harvested at the point of natural dispersal in late May in 2003 and 2004 were either placed immediately on 1% water agar at 20 degrees C ('laboratory' treatment), or placed in nylon sachets and buried in leaf litter among plants growing in the wild ('field' treatment). Samples were withdrawn at intervals over a period of 168 d and tested for desiccation tolerance (drying to 0.059g H(2)O(gDW)(-1)) and longevity (controlled ageing at 60% relative humidity and 45 degrees C). An initial increase, followed by a decline, in the proportion of seeds surviving desiccation and in the longevity of both laboratory- and field-treated samples coincided with the development of embryos from globular to heart and then torpedo-shaped. Developmental arrest was not required for the acquisition of desiccation tolerance, and continued growth and development of the embryo resulted in a loss of desiccation tolerance, similar to that seen in orthodox seeds upon radicle emergence. Furthermore, while A. nemorosa seeds, like many from the Ranunculaceae family, might be described as having morphological or morphophysiological dormancy, this lack of developmental arrest does not fit with the usual concept of dormancy. The implications of these results for the classification systems of seed-storage behaviour and dormancy, and for the long-term conservation of seeds of A. nemorosa, are discussed.

Soil propagule bank samples were collected in May 2003, and depositional samples were collected subsequently over four consecutive 4-month periods between June 2003 and October 2004. The samples were subjected to three emergence trials under drained, waterlogged and submerged conditions. Significantly more seedlings germinated in the drained than waterlogged trial, and waterlogged than submerged trials. Drained, waterlogged and submerged trials identified 186, 76 and 37 species, respectively. Six species identified in the waterlogged trials were not identified in the drained trials, and five species in the submerged trials were not found in the drained trials. Submerged trials added two species to the drained and waterlogged results. Application of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to average species abundance data, for the sampled hydrological habitats (bed, bank face, bank top) within the soil propagule bank and four depositional data sets, generated different results for the three trials. The drained treatment revealed significant differences between sites, seasons and hydrological habitats, whereas the waterlogged and submerged treatments presented an increasingly homogeneous view of the samples. Our results confirm other propagule bank emergence comparisons and extend them to depositional samples, demonstrating that the strong environmental sieves imposed by waterlogging and submergence restrict emergence of numerous terrestrial, wetland and even some aquatic species that were successfully identified using the drained conditions.

J	Rose, RJ				Rose, R. J.			The effects of hybridization on the small-scale variation in seed-bank composition of a rare plant species, Erica ciliaris L.	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The size and composition of the seed bank of a rare species (Erica ciliaris L.) was analysed. E ciliaris hybridizes with a common relative in southern England (Erica tetralix). The seed banks of these co-occurring species were measured at a number of sites with a range of vegetation types and different management histories. Additional sets of samples were taken from forestry plantations on former heathland sites, where these species were known to occur. Relatively few hybrid seedlings were found in any of the seed-bank samples, even though their vegetative abundance within the sampling areas was equal to that of the pure plants. However, the abundance in the vegetation of the two pure species was reflected in the seed-bank size on each of the vegetation types, both with and without burning management. The seed banks from the forestry plantations show that the numbers of seeds of both E tetralix and the hybrid were depleted, but that the seed bank of E. ciliaris was not significantly different from that of open heathland seed banks. The long-lived nature of the seed bank indicates that there are opportunities for habitat restoration on former heathland sites.

J	Benvenuti, S				Benvenuti, Stefano			Natural weed seed burial: effect of soil texture, rain and seed characteristics	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Trials were carried out to investigate natural weed seed burial in a no-till agricultural system. With this aim, 30 important weed species were selected to explore if, and to what extent, seed vertical movement is conditioned by soil texture, cumulative rainfall or by seed characteristics. Without soil tillage, the vertical position of the seeds was only a few millimetres below the surface, but it was dependent on soil texture. Seed burial was much slower (and to lesser depths) in clay soils than in sandy soils. Seeds reached greater depths after 1 year in sandy soil (10% > 6 mm) than in clay soils (2% > 6mm), Burial dynamics were also influenced by rainfall and seed weight. The amount of rain necessary to halve weed seeds observable on the soil surface was a function of the soil texture and seed weight; linear regressions between total rainfall amounts and seed weight showed that the slope of the relationship increased as the sand component of the soil decreased (21.1, 35.4 and 39.4 in sandy, loam and silty-clay soil, respectively). A polynomial regression, carried out in sandy soil, between 1000-seed weight and their burial capacity showed an inverse relation (P > 0.05) between these two parameters. Seed shape and coat microsculpture also influenced movement, but only minimally.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				SEP	2007	17	3					211	219		10.1017/S0960258507782752							WOS:000249893000007

Secondary dormancy in Diplotaxis erucoides: a possible adaptative strategy as an annual weed	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The germination of stored Diplotaxis erucoides seed was studied under controlled conditions of temperature and light by conducting germination tests over three years after collection. The D. erucoides seed was not dormant at harvest, but secondary dormancy appeared during storage as indicated by reduced germination 12 months after collection (from 92% down to 39%). This could be overcome by prolonged storage or by the use of gibberellic acid. Such shifts between dormancy and non-dormancy can be interpreted in terms of the soil seed bank dynamics in relation to intraspecific competition and/or with its adaptation as an annual weed in periodically disturbed soil in cultivated areas.																	1695-971X					SEP	2007	5	3					402	406									WOS:000249292600018

Tillage and soybean canopy effects on common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) emergence	WEED SCIENCE												Field experiments were conducted in Pendleton, SC, in 2004 and 2005, to determine the influence of tillage with or without soybean on common cocklebur emergence. Treatments included no-till/no soybean (NTNS), no-till plus soybean (NTS), tillage/no soybean (TNS), and tillage plus soybean (TS). Emergence was monitored from an artificial seed bank in 2004 and a natural seed bank in 2005. Overall, common cocklebur emerged from early May through late October and presented multiple emergence. In no-till plots with or without soybean, initial emergence was delayed 7 d in both years. In TNS plots, major emergence (daily emergence > mean emergence plus standard deviation) of common cocklebur occurred from early May to late July. In NTNS plots, major emergence occurred from late May through late August. No-till reduced total common cocklebur emergence by 59 to 69% compared with tillage. At the V5 to V6 soybean growth stage, the daily soil thermal fluctuation at 2.5 cm soil depth diminished from approximately 15 to 5 C and reduced common cocklebur emergence by 84 to 91% for the rest of the growing season. Common cocklebur emergence was higher when the mean soil temperature was > 15 C, and the daily thermal fluctuation was > 7.5 C. This study suggests that strategies that promote early crop canopy development and minimum tillage should reduce common cocklebur emergence.

Factors affecting seed germination of perennial wall rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) in southern Australia	WEED SCIENCE												Germination response of perennial wall rocket to temperature, light, osmotic potential, and depth of burial emergence was evaluated under controlled environmental conditions. The effect of seed burial depth on seedling recruitment in the field was also investigated at Roseworthy, South Australia. Under optimal conditions (30 C, light/dark) germination of perennial wall rocket was rapid, with 90% of seeds germinating within 48 h of imbibition. Germination was reduced (20%) at lower, suboptimal temperatures (10 to 20 C) when seeds of perennial wall rocket were exposed to light. Germination declined with increasing osmotic potential and was completely inhibited at osmotic potentials of - 1.5 MPa. Perennial wall rocket emergence was greatest from seeds placed on the soil surface, but some seedlings (< 10%) emerged from a depth of 0.5 to 2 cm. Under both field and growth-cabinet conditions, the greatest seedling emergence of perennial wall rocket occurred from seed present on the soil surface; however, the level of absolute recruitment from the seed bank was much lower (< 5%). Information gained from this study will further improve our understanding of the germination behavior of perennial wall rocket and contribute to developing sustainable strategies for its control.

Influence of weed management practices and crop rotation on glyphosate-resistant horseweed population dynamics and crop yield	WEED SCIENCE												Horseweed is an increasingly problematic weed in soybean because of the frequent occurrence of glyphosate-resistant (GR) biotypes. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of crop rotation, winter wheat cover crops (WWCC), residual nonglyphosate herbicides, and preplant herbicide application timing on the population dynamics of GR horseweed and crop yield. A field study was conducted at a site with a moderate infestation of GR horseweed (approximately 1 plant m(-2)) with crop rotation (soybean-corn or soybean-soybean) as main plots and management systems as subplots. Management systems were evaluated by quantifying horseweed plant density, seedbank density, and crop yield. Crop rotation did not influence in-field horseweed or seedbank densities at any data census timing. Preplant herbicides applied in the spring were more effective at reducing horseweed plant densities than when applied in the previous fall. Spring-applied, residual herbicide systems were the most effective at reducing season long horseweed densities and protecting crop yield because horseweed in this region behaves primarily as a summer annual weed. Horseweed seedbank densities declined rapidly in the soil by an average of 76% for all systems over the first 10 mo before new seed rain. Despite rapid decline in total seedbank density, seed for GR biotypes remained in the seedbank for at least 2 yr. Therefore, to reduce the presence of GR horseweed biotypes in a local no-till weed floral integrated weed management (IWM) systems should be developed to reduce total horseweed populations based on the knowledge that seed for GR biotypes are as persistent in the seed bank as glyphosate-sensitive (GS) biotypes.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				SEP-OCT	2007	55	5					508	516		10.1614/WS-06-187.1							WOS:000249169700017

Cropping systems alter weed seed banks in Pacific Northwest semi-arid wheat region	CROP PROTECTION												Arable land weed seed banks are dynamic and reflect cropping history, current management, and environment. Changes in crop rotation and tillage system can alter weed seed density and species composition. In the semi-arid region of the Pacific Northwest, USA, no-till spring cropping is being studied as an alternative to the traditional winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/dust-mulch fallow (WWF) rotation. Weed seed bank density and species composition were assessed during the first 6 years of an ongoing cropping system study comparing WWF with three no-till rotations; spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/chemical fallow (SWF), continuous spring wheat (CSW), and spring wheat/spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (SWSB). Soil cores were collected at depths of 0-8, 8-15, and 15-23 cm in all plots during August each year following crop harvest. Weed seeds were washed from the soil, dried, and germinated in a glasshouse. Weed species most associated with the 0-8 cm depth was Bromus tectorum L., the major winter annual grass weed in WWF. Species most associated with 8-15 cm depth was Chenopodium leptophyllum (Moq.) Nut. ex S. Wats, a native warm season broadleaf weed that may have long seed bank persistence. An initial high density of B. tectorum was reduced with no-till spring crops and in WWF with intensive management strategies. In comparison an initial low weed seed density of R tectorum remained low with no-till but increased in WWF with less management. Broadleaf weed species did not become management problems in no-till; however, seed bank weed shifts occurred where winter annual broadleaf species remained following reduction of high densities of R tectorum. Summer annual broadleaf weed seeds such as C leptophyllum and Salsola tragus L. were present but not at high densities. Summer annual grass weed seeds were not present and are not typical in this region. In this research, no-till spring cereal based systems did not result in an increase in total seed density at the soil surface. Results front this research show that no-till spring crop rotations are effective at controlling winter annual grass weeds as well as broadleaf weeds normally associated with WWF.

J	Steinhardt, T; Selig, U				Steinhardt, Tim; Selig, Uwe			Spatial distribution patterns and relationship between recent vegetation and diaspore bank of a brackish coastal lagoon on the southern Baltic Sea	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Submerged vegetation and the diaspore bank were investigated in the shallow brackish lagoon Salzhaff (southern Baltic Sea). The distribution, density and coverage of vegetation and diaspores were analysed at seven water depths along five transects. The submerged vegetation was dominated by the angiosperms Zostera marina, Zannichellia palustris and Potamogeton pectinatus and its depth limit varied between 2.5 and 4 m. The vegetation varied along the nutrient and Secchi depth gradient in the lagoon: charophytes were absent in the inner part of the lagoon and the depth limit of the submerged vegetation was lower than in the outer part. In contrast to the vegetation, oospores of charophytes dominated the diaspore bank independent of location and water depth on all transects. Diaspores of all recent macrophytes, except Zostera noltii, were found in the sediment surface layer. The species composition of the diaspore bank (Bray-Curtis similarity) showed differences both between wave-exposed and sheltered parts of the lagoon as well as along the nutrient and Secchi depth gradient. Oospore density in the sediment and the vegetation cover was correlated in Toypella nidifica, Zostera marina, Ruppia cirrhosa and Zannichellia palustris. The distribution of charophyte oospores is characterised by translocation to deeper areas, whereas seeds of Z. marina and R. cirrhosa were accumulated in vegetation stands. Furthermore, diaspore deposition of Z. palustris. R. cirrhosa, Chara baltica and T. nidifica depended on wave exposure. Zannichellia palustris showed the most wide-ranging generative recolonisation potential of all macrophytes in the lagoon. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to determine optimal conditions and effective methods for uniform, rapid, and high-percent germination, the effects of light, scarification, and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) were tested on seed germination of eight Pedicularis species from nine sites in the northwestern Yunnan Province of China. There were some differences in germination characteristics among the tested species. Seed germination of some species was promoted by light. but not in others. Wet-habitat species generally had positive photoblastic responses. For many species, scarification was effective to promote seed germination, but neither 100 nor 500 mg center dot L-1 GA(3) had consistent promoting effects.

Detecting impacts and setting restoration targets in arid-zone rivers: aquatic micro-invertebrate responses to reduced floodplain inundation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Water extraction from arid-zone rivers increases the time between floods across their floodplain wetlands. Less frequent flooding in Australian arid-zone rivers has impaired waterbird and fish breeding, killed riparian vegetation and diminished invertebrate and macrophyte communities. Restoration currently focuses on reinstating floods to rejuvenate floodplain wetlands, yet indicators to measure the success of this are poorly developed. 2. We explored the application of criteria for ecologically successful river restoration to potential restoration of floodplain wetlands on the Darling River, arid-zone Australia. Using emergence of micro-invertebrates from resting eggs as an indicator, we compared responses of taxa richness, densities and community composition in floodplain lakes with different inundation histories. 3. Increased drying of floodplain lakes reduced the number of micro-invertebrate taxa. Several key taxa were absent and faunal densities (particularly cladocerans) were reduced when the duration of drying increased from 6 to 20 years. 4. A conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms by which restoration of flooding regime could achieve the target of preserving micro-invertebrate community resilience predicts that reducing the dry period between floods will minimize losses of viable resting eggs. Protection of this 'egg bank' permits a boom in micro-invertebrates after flooding, promoting successful recruitment by native fish and waterbirds. 5. Synthesis and applications. In arid-zone rivers, micro-invertebrate densities and community composition are useful indicators of the impact of reduced flooding as a result of water extraction. Critical to successful native fish recruitment as their first feed and as prey for waterbirds, micro-invertebrates are a potential early indicator of responses by higher trophic levels. Taxon richness, density and key taxa present after flooding, all indicators of resilience, can be incorporated into targets for arid-zone river restoration. For example, one restoration target may be microcrustacean densities between 100 and 1000 L-1 within 2-3 weeks after spring flooding. These criteria can be applied to measure the ecological success of restoration projects seeking to recover natural flood regimes. Given the high economic cost of water in arid zones, convincing demonstrations of the ecological success of environmental water allocations are crucial.																	0021-8901					AUG	2007	44	4					823	832		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01298.x							WOS:000247667100012

Local above-ground persistence of vascular plants: Life-history trade-offs and environmental constraints	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE					48th Symposium of the International-Association-for-Vegetation-Science	JUL 24-29, 2005	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Int Assoc Vegetat Sci				Questions: 1. Which plant traits and habitat characteristics best explain local above-ground persistence of vascular plant species and 2. Is there a trade-off between local above-ground persistence and the ability for seed dispersal and below-ground persistence in the soil seed bank? Locations: 845 long-term permanent plots in terrestrial habitats across the Netherlands. Methods: We analysed the local above-ground persistence of vascular plants in permanent plots (monitored once a year for ca. 16 year) with respect to functional traits and habitat preferences using survival statistics (Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox' regression). These methods account for censored data and are rarely used in vegetation ecology. Results: Local above-ground persistence is determined by both functional traits (especially the ability to form long-lived clonal connections) and habitat preferences (especially nutrient requirements). Above-ground persistence is negatively related to the ability for dispersal by wind and to the ability to accumulate a long-term persistent soil seed bank ('dispersal through time') and is positively related to the ability for dispersal by water. Conclusions: Most species have a half-life expectation over 15 years. which may contribute to time lags after changes 'in habitat quality or -configuration ('extinction debt'). There is evidence for a trade-off relationship between local aboveground persistence and below-ground seed persistence, while the relationship with dispersal in space is vector specific. The rate of species turnover increases with productivity.

Riparian hydroecology: A coupled model of the observed interactions between groundwater flow and meadow vegetation patterning	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Stream incision is altering the hydroecology of riparian areas worldwide. In the Last Chance watershed in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, logging, overgrazing, and road/ railroad construction have caused stream incision, which resulted in drainage of riparian meadow sediments and a succession from native wet meadow vegetation to sagebrush and dryland grasses. Restoration efforts have been initiated to reestablish the ecosystem function of these systems. Original field data including stream stage records, water table hydrographs, sediment hydraulic properties, topographic transects, and aerial imagery of vegetation patterning were used to develop a model of an archetype meadow. Hydrologic behavior was simulated with a finite element model of variably saturated groundwater flow. This model was coupled to an empirical, time-dependent, vegetation threshold relationship between vegetation type and depth to the water table. This was a two-way coupling requiring an iterative approach because water table depth is a determinant of vegetation type, yet the vegetation regime influences water table depth through evapotranspiration. The hydrology and vegetation patterns were analyzed under pristine, degraded (incised), and restored conditions. For the case of deep streambed incision, our hydroecological model predicts the observed shift from mesic (wetter) to xeric (drier) vegetation communities and reproduces their imaged longitudinal zonation. This patterning is explained as a response to groundwater drainage to the stream, which creates dry zones with xeric vegetation adjacent to the stream, while preserving sufficient moisture at the margins of the meadow to support holdout populations of mesic vegetation. The model further predicts the reestablishment of meadow vegetation when the incised channel is filled and a new shallow channel is restored. The coupling of a near-surface hydrologic model to a vegetation response model may be used to design stream restoration projects by predicting vegetation patterning.

J	Isselin-Nondedeu, F; Bedecarrats, A				Isselin-Nondedeu, Francis; Bedecarrats, Alain			Soil microtopographies shaped by plants and cattle facilitate seed bank formation on alpine ski trails	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												It has proved difficult to efficiently restore vegetation of alpine ski trails. Main causes are seed runoff and the lack of soil seed banks and microsites for plant recruitment. A previous study conducted on ski trails in the French Alps gave rise to the effect of vegetation cover and artificial hoof prints in soil to decrease the seed runoff. in this study, we hypothesized that this effect leads to the formation of soil seed bank. Soil samples have been collected in different microtopographies: mounds at the upslope side of plant growing on ski slope, cows' hoof prints, and also in the bare soil at the periphery. The seed bank composition was determined by a germination method, then the number of germinable seeds was put in relation to the microtopographies. Results showed that both seedling and species number were twice as high in these microtopographies as in adjacent bare soil. As indicated by high similarity values, species that formed the seed bank were mostly recruited from the standing vegetation of ski trails. The analyses of dispersal characteristics of the species revealed that the flattest seeds remained on slope, whereas the roundest were almost found in the mounds. We discussed the engineering role of plants and the disturbance by cows in aiding seeding success. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrochory as a determinant of genetic distribution of seeds within Hibiscus mosmeutos (Malvaceae) populations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed dispersal is a major determinant of the spatial genetic structure of plant populations. In this study, we evaluated the role of distinct hydrologic regimes in determining the spatial genetic structure of the seed bank of the wetland plant Hibiscus moscheutos. We analyzed seeds in surface soil samples collected in the autumn and the following spring by determining their allozyme genotypes and estimated the pattern in seed movements during flooding. We selected study sites in nomidal and tidal wetlands with different flooding regimes. One nontidal site had no flooding, while the second nontidal site was inundated for most of the year. One tidal wetland site flooded with almost every tide, and a second tidal site was inundated at moderate frequency. Genetic makeup of the seed bank at the nonflooded site changed little between seasons. Secondary seed dispersal altered absolute allele frequencies at the other three sites, with the greatest change occurring at the two tidally influenced sites. This study demonstrates that secondary hydrochory influences the genetic composition of the seed bank and that hydrologic conditions play an important role in determining the local patterns in seed movements.

Seed banks in diked and undiked great lakes coastal wetlands	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Many Great Lakes coastal wetlands have been impounded (diked) to provide protection from flooding and to manipulate water levels for vegetation management. Dikes change the hydrological regime by isolating the coastal wetland from natural lake processes. We evaluated the seed bank composition of seven pairs of diked and undiked coastal wetlands in Green Bay (Lake Michigan) and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) to assess the effects of dikes on vegetation dynamics. We also compared soil pH, organic matter, total N, P and K between diked and undiked wetlands. On average, substrates of diked wetlands contained almost three times as many seeds as in undiked wetlands and approximately 20% more species. Seed banks of diked wetlands contained greater numbers of seeds from mudflat aquatic species, whereas seed banks of undiked wetlands yielded greater numbers of seeds from sandy/shoreline species. Diked wetland soils were more acidic, had higher organic matter content, and higher total N, P and K levels compared with soils in undiked wetlands. Our results suggest that diked wetlands may be "traps" for high levels of nutrients, organic matter and seeds. At the sites in this study, construction of dikes appears to have transformed coastal wetlands into systems that function more like inland wetlands.																	0003-0031					JUL	2007	158	1					191	205		10.1674/0003-0031(2007)158[191:SBIDAU]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000248327800017

A critique and meta-analysis of seed addition experiments	AMERICAN NATURALIST												We examine the relative importance of processes that underlie plant population abundance and distribution. Two opposing views dominate the field. One posits that the ability to establish at a site is determined by the availability of suitable microsites (establishment limitation), while the second asserts that recruitment is limited by the availability of seeds (seed limitation). An underlying problem is that establishment and seed limitation are typically viewed as mutually exclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of seed addition experiments to assess the relative strength of establishment and seed limitation to seedling recruitment. We asked (1) To what degree are populations seed and establishment limited? (2) Under what conditions (e. g., habitats and life- history traits) are species more or less limited by each? (3) How can seed addition studies be better designed to enhance our understanding of plant recruitment? We found that, in keeping with previous studies, most species are seed limited. However, the effects of seed addition are typically small, and most added seeds fail to recruit to the seedling stage. As a result, establishment limitation is stronger than seed limitation. Seed limitation was greater for large-seeded species, species in disturbed microsites, and species with relatively short-lived seed banks. Most seed addition experiments cannot assess the relationship between number of seeds added and number of subsequent recruits.

Seeds and seed coats were numerous in Tategami, where the annual type of Z marina grows. In contrast, seeds were scarce in Hamajima, where the perennial type of Z marina grows. Bottom sediment was sampled with sediment cores at Tategami in November 2004 and March 2005 to examine density and depth distribution of the seeds. Seeds were found as deep as 8 cm, but no deeper. On the other hand, empty seed coats were found as deep as 16 cm in both months. In the upper layers of the sediment to a depth of 8 cm, the average number of seed coats was 7960 2997 m(-2) in November and 16,318 2922 m(-2) in March. Deeper than 8 cm, the number of seed coats gradually decreased owing to decomposition, and none was found below 16 cm. We used the density of reproductive shoots and number of seeds per spadix in Tategami to estimate the fate of seeds and seed coats of the annual type of Z marina in bottom sediments: out of the 6000 seeds m(-2) produced annually, 72% disappears from the stand and 28% is buried locally. The density and distribution of Z marina seeds are among the most important factors in maintenance and propagation of the annual population at Tategami. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Seedling emergence and survival of Warea carteri (Brassicaceae), an endangered annual herb of the Florida scrub	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Seedling emergence and survival to flowering are critical processes in the life history of annual plants. We evaluated the importance of year and habitat on seedling emergence and the effects of year, habitat, timing of seedling emergence, and seedling density on survival of Warea carteri Small, an annual mustard endemic to Florida scrub. We tagged 1329 seedlings in 78 permanent 0.25 m(2) quadrats in two habitats (scrub and disturbed) between 1999 and 2002 and followed seedlings monthly. Most (> 80%) seedling emergence occurred between September and December. Emergence peaked 2 months earlier and was more variable in disturbed sites than in scrub. Seedling survival among years ranged from 3.5% to 12.0%. Seedling density varied from I to 75 per 0.25 m(2) quadrat, with an overall median of 6.0. Survival was not density dependent. Median age at flowering ranged from 11.7 to 15.2 months, with late season recruits most likely to survive to flowering. Warea carteri recruits like a winter annual but flowers like a summer annual. Its delayed germination and a 12-15 month life span contribute to population cycling. Complete reproductive failure in unfavorable years, high seed production in favorable years, low rates of seed germination, and a persistent seed bank are consistent with predictions for an annual species in a variable habitat.

EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS					2nd International Conference on Wood in World Rivers	AUG, 2006	Univ Stirling, Stirling, SCOTLAND		Univ Stirling			This paper investigates temporal variations in the abundance, species composition and richness, and spatial distribution of plant propagules stored on river-beds. Samples of the surface layers of river-bed sediments were obtained from two reaches of the River Frome, Dorset, UK, and one reach of the River Tern, Shropshire, UK. Samples were taken from the same bed locations on four occasions spaced at approximately four monthly intervals. Following greenhouse germination trials, 11384 viable propagules of 105 species were identified in 192 channel bed samples. On average, 32% of the species found in the propagule samples were not present in the channel and riparian vegetation. Most of these additional species were wetland and terrestrial rather than aquatic species. The number of species and density of propagules stored on the river-bed varied through time and between reaches. These findings indicate that the channel bed is a dynamic store for viable propagules, including a large proportion of species that are not found locally. These propagules are available for redistribution across river-banks and floodplains during high river flows. Propagules were preferentially stored within particular bed habitats. On the Tern, the most retentive habitats were close to the channel margins and adjacent to riparian vegetation and trees. On the Frome, stands of emergent vegetation along the channel margin were the most retentive habitat, and were also associated with trapping of finer sediment and organic matter. This habitat provides an aggrading environment at the bank toe that could potentially offer germination sites for the non-aquatic propagules that are stored. Germination and growth of wetland and terrestrial plants during bank profile aggradation and lateral extension would provide root reinforcement and flow resistance across the changing bank profile. The preferential accumulation of sediment and species-rich propagates around stands of marginal emergent vegetation is indicative of a subtle coupling of geomorphological and ecological systems.

Dynamics of soil physical and chemical properties and vegetation succession characteristics during grassland desertification under sheep grazing in an agro-pastoral transition zone in northern China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A number of field experiments were conducted from 1986 to 2003 to investigate the dynamics of soil physical and chemical properties as well as vegetation succession characteristics during the grassland desertification process under sheep grazing. Results indicate that fine silt (0.01-0.001 mm) removal and medium sand (0.5-0.25 mm) increase occurred early in the desertification process resulting in coarser surface soil. The fine sand (0.25-0.05 mm) was the major (33.7-68.4%) soil fractions element throughout the process. Changes in soil fractions were associated with a decline in soil fertility as the natural grassland shifted to a desertified landscape. The organic matter concentration decreased significantly by 94%, 89% and 69%, respectively, in the 0-5, 5-10 and 10-30cm soil layers. The desertification effects on total soil N followed the same trend as the organic matter. Total soil P and K concentrations decreased only slightly and were consistent early in the desertification process. Soil bulk density increased companied with the decline of soil porosity and compaction as the desertification process continued. Species diversity declined both in the plant community and the soil seed bank, and species richness decreased by 56%. Three successional stages were identified, with bunchgrass communities being the first, followed by the growth of rhizomous grasses, and then sandy species and annual plant communities. In conclusion, grassland desertification was accompanied by severe soil erosion, soil nutrition decline and species diversity losses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial patterns and chemical characteristics of root biomass in ecosystems of the Patagonian Monte disturbed by grazing	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We hypothesized that the reduction in perennial-grass cover induced by grazing in shrublands would be associated with a reduction in fine-root biomass in the upper soil, an increase in the spatial heterogeneity of root biomass, and an increase in N and total phenolics concentrations in fine-root biomass. We analysed the spatial distribution of fine-, intermediate-, and thick-root biomass and the N and total phenolics concentrations in fine roots in sites with different aboveground-plant cover induced by grazing disturbance in the Patagonian Monte. We selected sampling sites varying in the distance to the watering point, the time since sheep grazing exclusion, and historical sheep stocking rates/paddock characteristics. Sites excluded from grazing and those far to the watering point showed the highest perennial-grass cover. Tall- and dwarf-shrub cover did not differ among sites. Fine-, intermediate-, and thick-root biomass and the chemistry of fine roots did not strongly differ among sites. At all sites, N concentration in fine roots was similar to that measured in tall shrubs while total phenolics concentration in fine roots fell within the range of that assessed for perennial grasses and tall shrubs. Results on N concentration would indicate that fine roots of tall shrubs are a main component of the bulk fine-root pool supporting previous evidence that life form shifts resulting from grazing has little effect on the root biomass and chemistry in the upper soil of rangelands.

Abundance and spatial patterning of coexisting perennial grasses in grazed shrublands of the Patagonian Monte	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We analysed the density, bunch size, and spatial patterning in relation to the shrubby matrix of the three dominant perennial grasses of the Patagonian Monte with different functional traits related to resource acquisition/conservation, mesophytism/xerophytism, and reproductive strategy. Field sampling was carried out at grazed (low and high grazing pressure) and excluded from grazing (15 years) sites. Grazing disturbance did not change the cover of the shrubby matrix but modified its spatial structure leading to increased density and reduced diameter of shrub patches. Changes in the abundance of perennial grass species among sites may be primarily attributed to a high direct effect of grazing on the species with the most mesophytic and acquisitive traits (N-rich green tissues, high leaf production, and low lignin concentration in leaves). Under grazing exclusion, this species was the most associated with shrub patches. The other perennial grass species either did not reduce or increased their abundance with grazing. The species with a mix of mesophytic and xerophytic traits was found with high frequency at inter-patch microsites. The most xerophytic and conservative species occupied vacant microsites either between shrub patches or at shrub-patch centres. However, the three species were increasingly concentrated under shrub canopies with increasing grazing pressure. This fact stresses the importance of shrub patches as biotic refuges for perennial grasses with low anti-herbivore defences. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mechanisms and consequences of seed bank formation in wild sunflowers (Helianthus annuus)	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Seed banks are important to many plant populations, yet we lack clear understanding of how environmental factors promote seed bank formation. We experimentally varied seed density, and soil disturbance size and timing, to examine the formation of seed banks and the resulting population dynamics in wild annual sunflowers (Helianthus annuus). Seed density treatments reflected the expected increase in seed production of individual wild sunflowers due to hybridization with Bt-transgenic crop sunflowers. Soil disturbances of two sizes (large and small) were applied either before or after seed dispersal. We followed the experimental plots for 2(1)/(2) years measuring seedling emergence, seeds in the soil, and reproduction, while preventing additional seed input. We assessed seed bank formation by the numbers of emergent seedlings and seeds in the soil. 2 Soil disturbances, regardless of timing, were required for successful germination and reproduction of wild sunflowers. Large disturbances resulted in greater seedling emergence and reproduction than small disturbances. Reproduction on small disturbance plots was low, due to low seedling survival. Higher seed density resulted in more seedlings only in large-disturbance plots. 3 Post-dispersal disturbances led to significant seed bank formation. This effect was greater for large, post-dispersal disturbances. Higher seed density increased seed bank size only in the presence of large, post-dispersal disturbances. 4 Negative density-dependence in seedling mortality and reproduction meant that there was no effect of the high seed density treatment on reproduction. Thus the positive effects of increased seed bank size on population growth were tempered by density-dependence. To assess fully the impact of seed banks on population growth, studies should continue beyond the seedling stage. 5 Our results suggest increased seed production of individual sunflowers resulting from crop transgenes would be unlikely to increase population growth on the scale of small patches. Increased seed production could result in dispersal of seeds across larger areas, and thus could lead to larger seed banks in disturbed environments and an increased prevalence of sunflowers across the landscape. These results are relevant to other annual species, especially those with transgenic crop relatives.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				JUL	2007	95	4					851	864		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01254.x							WOS:000247320100026						
J	Li, JH; Fang, XW; Jia, JJ; Wang, G				Li, Jin-Hua; Fang, Xiang-Wen; Jia, Ju-Jie; Wang, Gang			Effect of legume species introduction to early abandoned field on vegetation development	PLANT ECOLOGY												One of the most important areas in ecology is to elucidate the factors that drive succession in ecosystems. The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of legume species (Medicago sativa, Melilotus suaveolens and Astragalus adsurgens) introduction to abandoned arable land on vegetation development in the Loess Plateau, China. Results from our study showed that addition of legume species strongly affected the composition of recently abandoned-field vegetation. Legume species were effective at reducing the number and dominance of natural colonizers (mainly weeds from the seed bank). The introduction of legume species into newly abandoned fields maintained high total cover and above-ground biomass and could improve soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. However, the effects of the treatments were species-specific. Melilotus suaveolens turned out to be severely suppressive to natural colonizers (weed species). Also, Melilotus suaveolens-adding maintained the highest cover and above-ground biomass and was helpful to improve later succession species, e.g. Stipa breviflora and Astragalus polycladus, to invade and establish. Medicago sativa-adding was superior in enhancing the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. The present results suggested that addition of legume species with greater cover and biomass strongly suppressed the dominance of the weedy species in early succession and the course of old-field succession may be accelerated by introduction of legume species at least temporarily. However, the experimental period was too short to assess to what extent succession may be affected in the longer term.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				JUL	2007	191	1					1	9		10.1007/s11258-006-9209-1							WOS:000247195000001

Postfire invasion potential of rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea)	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												North American sagebrush steppe communities have been transformed by the introduction of invasive annual grasses and subsequent increase in fire size and frequency. We examined the effects of wildfires and environmental conditions on the ability of rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea L.), a perennial Eurasian composite, to invade degraded sagebrush steppe communities, largely dominated by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). Recruitment of rush skeletonweed from seed and root buds was investigated on 11 burned and unburned plot pairs on Idaho's Snake River Plain following summer 2003 wildfires. Emergence from soil seedbanks was similar on burned and unburned plots in 2003 and 2004 (P = 0.37). Soils from recently burned plots (P = 0.05) and sterilized field soil (P < 0.01) supported greater emergence than did unburned field soils when rush skeletonweed seeds were mixed into the soils in the laboratory. These decreases may indicate susceptibility of this exotic invasive to soil pathogens present in field soils. Seeds in bags placed on field soil in late October 2003 reached peak germination by mid-January 2004 during a wet period; 1% remained viable by August 2004. Seedling emergence from sown plots or the native seedbank and establishment of new rosettes from root sprouts in 2003-2005 indicate that seed germination of rush skeletonweed on the Snake River Plain may be facultative, occurring in fall or spring if soil moisture is adequate, although many germinants may not survive. Stand development results primarily from root sprouting. Establishment from seed is episodic but provides for dispersal, with increasing fire frequency and size expanding the areas of disturbance available for new invasions.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				JUL	2007	60	4					386	394									WOS:000248348000006

Population dynamics of broadleaf weeds in turfgrass as influenced by chemical and biological control methods	WEED SCIENCE												A 3-yr field study was conducted to determine the effect of a biological control agent, Sclerotinia minor Jagger, and a common herbicide, Killex, on the population dynamics of dandelion and other broadleaf species and on the dandelion seed bank. Treatments were applied as one spring, one early autumn, or a spring plus an early autumn treatment per year. The response of the dandelion Population to a spring herbicide treatment was similar to two applications per year (spring and early autumn). Significantly less dandelion control Occurred after the first early autumn application of the herbicide. Two weeks after application, spring or early autumn treatments with S. minor were equally effective in Suppressing dandelions. In the second year of the two applications per year of S. minor treatment, weed control was equivalent to the herbicide. By the third year of the one spring application of S. minor, weed control was equivalent to the herbicide. Generally over the study period, the early autumn application of S. minor was less effective than the spring or the spring and early autumn applications. The S. minor treatments significantly reduced the dandelion seed bank, and this effect was not significantly different from the Killex herbicide treatment. The rate, frequency, and seasonal tinting of application had no effect on the dandelion seed-bank size, but terminating the application would gradually replenish the seed bank. Populations of white clover, broadleaf plantain, birdsfoot trefoil, and common ragweed were similarly suppressed by either the S. minor or the herbicide treatments. Yellow woodsorrel significantly increased after 1yr of herbicide treatment compared with the S. minor and untreated control treatments, indicating a possible weed species shift. Turf quality was improved because Of the herbicide and S. minor treatments, but grass injury and smooth crabgrass invasion were recorded in 17% of herbicide-treated plots.

These strategies included a POST broad-spectrum herbicide applied at recommended or reduced rates and use of a computer decision aid to select the POST herbicide having the greatest net return (economic threshold approach) based on weed populations before treatment or seed-bank estimates. Four years after study initiation, increased weed populations were observed only in the nontreated control. The reduced rate and economic threshold approaches did not lead to increased weed seed banks compared with the recommended rate of a broad-spectrum herbicide. Reductions in herbicide rate were more effective than the use of economic thresholds for reducing the risk of environmental impact in corn and soybeans. Weed populations in this study were generally above threshold levels, and herbicides selected by the computer decision aid tended to be older, less-expensive herbicides with high use rates. Recommendations by the computer decision aid were generally more effective and more profitable when based on weed populations before treatment than when based on seedbank estimates.																	0890-037X					JUL-SEP	2007	21	3					647	655		10.1614/WT-06-135.1							WOS:000250352500014

Roadside foraging by kangaroo rats in a grazed short-grass prairie landscape	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												We used live-trapping and foraging experiments to describe use of roadside vegetation by kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii) in short-grass prairie in Colorado, and to determine whether this species perception of predation risk differed between roadside habitats, where predators were expected to be most active, and locations 120 m into adjacent grazed pastures. Giving-up densities (GUDs) were measured in paired seed trays placed beneath saltbust (Atriplex canescens) shrubs and in the open, 3 m from shrubs along transects in roadside and pasture locations. Trials were conducted on nights with a partial (1st-quarter), full, and new moon to assess how intensity of risk affected microhabitat use. Kangaroo rats were much more abundant in areas with saltbust cover than in grazed prairie, and were 4-6 times more numerous along roadsides in saltbust areas than in other locations. On dark nights and in pasture locations, foraging rates of kangaroo rats were similar in shrub trays and open trays. The fewest seeds were removed (i.e., GUDs were highest), however, in open trays along roads on moonlit nights, suggesting that kangaroo rats recognized potential risks associated with roadsides on bright nights. The high numbers of kangaroo rats along roads suggest that benefits associated with these habitats (ease of digging, dust bathing, higher soil seed banks) exceed the costs associated with higher risk of mortality from predators and vehicles. Our results demonstrate how foraging decisions differ depending on the spatial and temporal contexts in which behaviors are measured, and underscore the potential value of less common habitats such as road margins for increasing landscape-scale diversity and wildlife habitat in grazed grasslands.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				JUL	2007	67	3					368	377		10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[368:RFBKRI]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000250161600005

I used a series of fenced plots (settle of which excluded rodents) to demonstrate that heteromyids at a western Nevada study site can measurably reduce seed banks and subsequent seedling establishment of Salsola paulsenii, all introduced invasive weed that has become it significant problem over much of the desert Southwest. The frequency of S. paulsenii seedlings ill both 2004 and 2005 was significantly greater around the. interior perimeters of plots that permitted access by rodents than in plots that excluded rodents. Density of S. paulsenii seedlings was significantly greater inside than outside rodent exclusion plots, but there was no shell difference ill seedling density Inside versus outside plots that permitted rodent access. Salsola paulsenii has such a conspicuous presence ill many desert environments that the effect of rodents in reducing its abundance may not be visually apparent; however; rodents may still ameliorate competitive effects of this weed oil coexisting plants. Heteromyid rodents disperse seeds through caching, and chew also consume them. Caching may enhance establishment of native plant seedlings, but is unlikely to benefit exoties such as S. paulsenii..																	1527-0904					JUL	2007	67	3					378	383		10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[378:DRRSRO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000250161600006						
J	Naaf, T; Wulf, M				Naaf, Tobias; Wulf, Monika			Effects of gap size, light and herbivory on the herb layer vegetation in European beech forest gaps	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding the mechanisms that control vegetation development beneath canopy gaps is of major importance for a nature-based management of European beech forests. We studied the herb layer vegetation beneath 56 canopy gaps of various sizes (116-1410m(2)) in near-natural beech forest stands of the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, Germany. Three objectives were pursued: (i) to compare the patterns of species number and species composition caused by different gap sizes and light conditions with those found in North America, (ii) to investigate the impact of herbivory by ungulates on gap vegetation and (iii) to assess establishment from a persistent seed bank and zoochorous seed dispersal as potential pathways for gap colonisation. Herbivory intensity was determined for each gap as the proportion of browsed terminal shoots of beech saplings. The mean Ellenberg indicator value for light was used as a measure for light availability in gaps. The data were analysed by a variation partitioning approach using multiple regression and redundancy analysis. Species number increased with gap size and light availability. Herbivory caused a reduction of competition by tree regeneration and was therefore responsible for higher species numbers, too. Species composition was relatively homogenous but significantly determined by gap size, light availability and herbivory. With more favourable light conditions, an increasing proportion of generalist species occurred within gaps. By means of two dispersal traits, it is shown that these species may use both pathways, a persistent seed bank or transportation by ungulates, to colonise gaps. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Damage potential of an introduced biological control agent Agonosoma trilineatum (F.) on bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifofia L.)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The seed-feeding jewel bug, Agonosoma trilineatum (F.), is an introduced biological control agent for bellyache bush, Jatropha gossypiifolia L. To quantify the damage potential of this agent, shadehouse experiments were conducted with individual bellyache bush plants exposed to a range of jewel bug densities (0, 6 or 24 jewel bugs/plant). The level of abortion of both immature and mature seed capsules and impacts on seed weight and seed viability were recorded in an initial short-term study. The ability of the jewel bug to survive and cause sustained damage was then investigated by measuring seed production, the survival of adults and nymph density across three 6-month cycles. The level of seed capsule abortion caused by the jewel bug was significantly affected by the maturity status of capsules and the density of insects present. Immature capsules were most susceptible and capsule abortion increased with jewel bug density. Similarly, on average, the insects reduced the viability of bellyache bush seeds by 79% and 89% at low and high densities, respectively. However, sustaining jewel bug populations for prolonged periods proved difficult. Adult survival at the end of three 6-month cycles averaged 11% and associated reductions in viable seed production ranged between 55% and 77%. These results suggest that the jewel bug has the potential to reduce the number of viable seeds entering the soil seed bank provided populations can be established and maintained at sufficiently high densities.

We examined whether the resumption of mowing can reverse these effects, and if so, which mechanisms are responsible for community change; we also tested whether restoration success depends on the duration since abandonment. Experimental mowing was applied to 15 montane fen meadows of NE Switzerland that had been abandoned for 4-35 years. After two years of mowing, plant species richness was 11 % higher in mown plots (2 m(2)) than in fallow plots, approaching levels of neighbouring continuously managed fen meadows. In particular, experimental mowing significantly increased the number of fen indicator species (+15 %) as well as herbs and woody species (seedlings and saplings), while grass, sedge and rush species richness was not affected. Mowing had little effect on aboveground biomass, but strongly reduced litter mass (-50%) and canopy height (-20%). Seedling densities of two common species showed opposite responses to mowing: they increased in Carex davalliana and decreased in Succisa pratensis, approaching values of continuously mown fen meadows. Duration since abandonment had no significant effect on any of the variables. Our results demonstrate a rapid recovery of montane fen plant communities irrespective of the duration since abandonment (up to 35 years). We conclude that the restoration of pre-fallow plant community composition is likely to be successful if site conditions (hydrology, nutrient status) remain intact and if common habitat specialists are still present in the vegetation and/or seed bank.																	0253-1453					JUN	2007	117	1					1	13		10.1007/s00035-007-0743-9							WOS:000248182000001

The soil seed bank of a montane meadow: consequences of conifer encroachment and implications for restoration	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												We examined changes in the soil seed bank associated with conifer encroachment of montane meadows in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. We asked whether, and over what period of time, meadow species maintain viable seeds in the soil, and by implication, whether the seed bank can contribute to restoration if conifers are removed. Seed bank composition, ground vegetation, and forest age structure were quantified for 209 samples representing a chronosequence of open meadow, young forest (< 75 years), and old forest (95 to > 200 years). The seed bank was substantial (44 taxa and 2332 germinants/ m(2)), but dominated by native ruderals (16 species comprising 71% of germinants). Greater than 70% of meadow species were absent from the seed bank. Thirteen meadow species accounted for 21% of all germinants, but most of these were the dominant sedge, Carex pensylvanica Lam.. Seed density, richness, and composition showed weak relationships to forest age, and little resemblance to the ground vegetation, which changed markedly with forest development. Our results suggest that there is limited potential for recovery of most meadow species via the seed bank. Natural reestablishment of these species will require seed dispersal or gradual vegetative spread from existing openings, but competitive interactions with ruderal or forest species may limit recruitment or recovery.																	0008-4026					JUN	2007	85	6					557	569		10.1139/B07-051							WOS:000248571700005

Urban plants as genetic reservoirs or threats to the integrity of bushland plant populations	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Remnant plants in urban fringes and native plants in gardens have the potential to contribute to the conservation of threatened plants by increasing genetic diversity, effective size of populations, and levels of genetic connectedness. But they also pose a threat through the disruption of locally adapted gene pools. At Hyams Beach, New South Wales, Australia, four bushland stands of the rare shrub, Grevillea macleayana McGillivray, surround an urban area containing remnant and cultivated specimens of this species. Numbers of inflorescences per plant, fruits per plant, and visits by pollinators were similar for plants in urban gardens and bushland. Urban plants represented a substantial but complex genetic resource, displaying more genetic diversity than bushland plants judged by H-c, numbers of alleles per locus, and number of private alleles. Of 27 private alleles in urban plants, 17 occurred in a set of 19 exotic plant. Excluding the exotic plants, all five stands displayed a moderate differentiation (F-ST = 0.14 +/- 0.02), although the urban remnants clustered with two of the bushland stands. These patterns may be explained by high levels of selfing and inbreeding in this species and by long-distance dispersal (several seeds in the urban stand were fathered by plants in other stands). Genetic leakage (gene flow) from exotic plants to 321 seeds on surrounding remnant or bushland plants has not occurred. Our results demonstrate the conservation value of this group of urban plants, which are viable, productive, genetically diverse, and interconnected with bushland plants. Gene flow has apparently not yet led to genetic contamination of bushland populations, but high levels of inbreeding would make this a rare event and difficult to detect. Remnant plants in urban gardens could successfully contribute to recovery plans for endangered and vulnerable species.

Soil desiccation occurrence an its impact on forest vegetation in the Loess Plateau of China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Soil desiccation is a major issue limiting development and sustainability of forest vegetation in the Loess Plateau of China. Better understanding of the mechanisms of soil desiccation in the Loess Plateau can help scientists and forest managers improve vegetation management practices. The and soil layer is the ecological aftermath of intense soil desiccation due to disturbed plant succession and soil water reduction. The formation and types of and soil layer in the Loess Plateau were investigated to determine major causes of soil desiccation and its impact on forest vegetation. The negative effects of soil desiccation on the ecological environment and forest vegetation mainly include drying microclimate, degrading soil quality, poor vegetation growth, difficult forest renewal from natural seed banks, making it even more difficult to reforest forest lands and grasslands following plant senescence. Low precipitation, high evaporation, soil and water losses, improper selection of vegetation types, and too high population density of trees are probably the major reasons for the and soil layer. Proper selection of vegetation types, adjusting tree density and other management practices can reduce the negative effects of the and soil layer on forest vegetation.																	1350-4509					JUN	2007	14	3					299	306		10.1080/13504500709469730							WOS:000247415300009

Distinguishing between persistence and dormancy in soil seed banks of three shrub species from fire-prone southeastern Australia	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Is primary dormancy required for seed bank persistence of Leucopogon species? How does the distinction between dormancy and persistence affect our understanding of seed bank dynamics in fire-prone regions? Location: Sclerophyllous plant communities, Sydney region, southeastern Australia. Methods: Seed bank longevity of three morphophysiologically dormant species was ascertained using seed burial trials. Seeds of each species were buried in situ in replicate mesh bags and retrieved annually over three years. Laboratory germination trials and embryo growth measurements over time were used to establish in which order each component of dormancy was overcome, and whether seed banks persisted after the loss of primary dormancy. Results: All species had long-term persistent seed banks, with estimated half-lives between 3.5 and 5.5 years. Physiological dormancy was broken by stratification prior to embryo growth, during the first year of burial. Seeds were able to germinate after retrieval, in light and at warm temperatures. Only low levels of germination occurred in situ over three years of burial, and did not increase over time. During germination trials, embryos remained underdeveloped unless seeds germinated, indicating that seeds were committed to germination once embryo growth was initiated. Conclusions: Long-lived seed banks are an important trait of plants from fire-prone communities, but cues observed to promote germination in situ are not necessarily the ones that break dormancy. A failure to distinguish between these two factors can divert attention away from mechanisms actually controlling dormancy and seed bank dynamics.

J	Vila, M; Gimeno, I				Vila, Montserrat; Gimeno, Isabel			Does invasion by an alien plant species affect the soil seed bank?	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: How does invasion affect old-field seed bank species richness, composition and density? How consistent are these effects across sites? Does the soil seed bank match vegetation structure in old-fields? Location: Menorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, western Mediterranean basin. Methods: We monitored seed germination in soils from old-fields that were both uninvaded and invaded (legacy effect) by the annual geophyte Oxalis pes-caprae. We also added O. pes-caprae bulbs to uninvaded soils to test O. pes-caprae interference with seedling emergence (competitive effect). We compared species composition in the seed bank with that of the vegetation. Results: Species richness in the seed bank and in the vegetation was not significantly different between invaded and uninvaded areas. Uninvaded areas did not have larger seed banks than invaded areas. More seedlings, especially of geophytes, emerged when O. pes-caprae bulbs were added to the soil. Species similarity between invaded and uninvaded areas was higher in the seed bank (74%) than in the vegetation (49%). Differences in species composition were as important as differences among sites. The degree of species similarity between the seed bank and the vegetation was very low (17%). Conclusions: Despite invasion by O. pes-caprae not affecting species richness, the variation in the seed bank species composition in invaded and uninvaded areas, and the differences between the seed bank and the mature vegetation, highlights that even if the invader could be eradicated the vegetation could not be restored back to the exact composition as found in uninvaded areas.

Location: Lake Kraenepoel, western Belgium. Methods: We compared density, species composition and observed and rarefactioned species richness of the seedling community emerging on a soft water lake bed exposed after drainage with the seedling community germinating in the laboratory from random soil samples in the same plots. Results: Seedling density did not differ between the two methods and there was a significant correlation between seedling density on the exposed lake bed and in the soil samples. This indicates that future seedling density can be reliably predicted based on soil sampling, in particular for the most abundant species. The most frequently occurring and abundant species among the seedlings in the soil samples were also the most frequent and abundant species germinating on the exposed lake bed. In contrast, species richness was much higher on the exposed lake bed than in the soil samples, and this difference was still significant for annual species after correction for differences in sampling intensity by rarefaction. We found no correlation between the number of species retrieved by the two methods. Although seedlings of rare and target species emerged on the lake bed, random soil sampling clearly failed to detect seeds of most of these species. Conclusions: Random soil sampling at a commonly used intensity and using the standard germination conditions can accurately predict future total seedling density and the density of the most abundant species. However, the method is not reliable for predicting the probability of establishment of populations of uncommon species. When executing a seed bank study, sampling intensity and germination conditions need to be adapted to the nature and the level of detail of the research question to be answered.

Seed bank dynamics of two obligate seeders, Cistus monspeliensis and Rosmarinus officinalis, in relation to time since fire	PLANT ECOLOGY												Many species in Mediterranean-type ecosystems regenerate after fire by seed germination from soil seed banks. Seed bank dynamics of two of those obligate seeders, Cistus monspeliensis and Rosmarinus officinalis, were investigated in relation to stand age since fire in southwestern Portugal. Soil seed density, annual seed input, annual seed losses through germination and seed persistence were compared between species at stands differing in age since fire (5, 10 and 35 years). Soil seed density and seed input increased over the first decade after fire and were lowest at 35-year-old stands for C. monspeliensis. In R. officinalis, few seeds were produced and found in the soil at early stages, and maximum seed input and soil seed density were attained at 35-year-old stands. Soil seed density was mostly driven by seed production in both species, which is largely dependent on plant traits and population dynamics related to fire. Overall, stand age since fire had a negligible effect on seed germination, seed persistence and viability. Ten to 39% of buried seeds were not recovered after 1 year, and viability of seeds recovered was 97-100% for C. monspeliensis and only 0-3% for R. officinalis. Variation in plant traits within the seeder syndrome was evidenced by this study. R. officinalis evidenced lower seed persistence, lower proportion of viable seed produced and lower density of viable soil seed than C. monspeliensis at any stage after fire. R. officinalis is expected to depend largely on previous year seed production for population replacement after fire.

Spatial variability of the soil seed bank in a heterogeneous ephemeral wetland system in semi-arid Australia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks are an important component of plant community diversity in ephemeral wetlands, allowing many species to persist through unpredictable periods of flood and drought. Spatial variation of extant vegetation in such habitats commonly reflects patterns of flood history and often varies predictably between broadly differing hydro-geomorphic habitat types. Here we investigate whether spatial variation of soil seed banks is similarly controlled by fluvial processes at this scale. Results are presented from a seedling emergence trial using samples collected from a range of habitat types, and at different scales within these, in the ephemeral Narran Lakes system in semi-arid Australia. Composition and structure of soil seed banks varied significantly between habitat types reflecting broad differences in flood frequency. As predicted, germinable seed abundance was found to be highest in intermediately flooded habitats. Variability in soil seed bank composition at a local scale was also found to be influenced by hydrology with greater spatial heterogeneity evident in the river channel as well as amongst the least frequently inundated riparian and floodplain habitats.

J	Hesse, E; Rees, M; Muller-Scharer, H				Hesse, Elze; Rees, Mark; Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz			Seed bank persistence of clonal weeds in contrasting habitats: implications for control	PLANT ECOLOGY												The ability of weeds to form a seed bank is important for their population dynamics and management because it provides a refuge enabling reinvasion after established target plants have died. However, knowledge of the differential seed behaviour of individual species over multiple years and varying environmental conditions is surprisingly rare but necessary for effective control of diverse weed populations. We established a seed burial experiment in alpine habitats differing in management regime (i.e., forest, hay meadow and pasture) to determine whether seeds of the unpalatable perennial weeds, Veratrum album (white hellebore) and Gentiana lutea (yellow gentian) were able to delay germination and remain viable over 3 years. Our study shows that both species formed a short-term persistent seed bank; in the third-year, the soil seed banks of both species were nearly depleted, having declined to < 5% of their original size. Both species had strikingly different germination strategies: G. lutea seeds mainly germinated in their first-year, whilst the majority of V. album seeds germinated in their second-year. The fraction of dormant G. lutea seeds increased with seed age, indicating that seeds remained viable after forgoing germination in the previous year. Habitat-specific differences in seed germination increased with seed age, with germination fractions being lowest in moist hay meadows. This suggests that the negative effects of anoxic conditions became more pronounced as seeds aged in hay meadows. Conversely, seed dormancy was equal among habitats. The absence of a long-term persistent seed bank has important implications for the management of both nuisance and endangered-plant populations. In the case of V. album and G. lutea, re-colonization of habitats from the seed bank is unlikely after established plants have been removed.

Effects of species richness on resident and target species components in a prairie restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The ecological role of biodiversity in achieving successful restoration has been little explored in restoration ecology. We tested the prediction that we are more likely to create persistent, species-rich plant communities by increasing the number of species sown, and, to some degree, by varying functional group representation, in experimental prairie plantings. There were 12 treatments consisting of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-species mixtures of native perennials representing four functional groups (C-4 grasses, C-3 grasses, nitrogen-fixing species, and late-flowering composites) that predominate within Central Plains tallgrass prairies. In 2000, species were seeded into square plots (6 x 6 m), with five replicates per treatment, on former agricultural land. Annually, we measured total species richness and evenness, target species richness and cover, and richness and cover of resident species (i.e., those emerging from the seed bank). Both target species richness and rate of establishment of target communities were highest in the most species-rich mixtures, but there was no additional benefit for treatments that contained more than eight species. Richness of resident species did not vary with target species richness; however, cover by resident species was lower in the higher target species treatments. Our results, indicating that establishment of species-rich prairie mimics can be enhanced by starting with larger numbers of species at the outset, have implications for grassland restoration in which community biodiversity creation and maintenance are key goals.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				JUN	2007	15	2					189	198		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00203.x							WOS:000246625300004						
J	Tischew, S; Kirmer, A				Tischew, Sabine; Kirmer, Anita			Implementation of basic studies in the ecological restoration of surface-mined land	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												This paper focuses on attempts to encourage a new state of the art in the ecological restoration of surface-mined land in Germany. On most of these sites, the application of traditional recultivation methods often destroys valuable ecological potential by leveling of the surface, ameliorating of nutrient-poor substrates, and seeding or planting of species not suited to the present habitat conditions. Many studies have shown that even highly disturbed ecosystems, such as large mining areas, can regenerate spontaneously over long-term periods. Colonization processes were influenced by the availability of diaspore sources as well as the suitability of sites for establishment. The predictability of succession could be improved by the identification of switch points in successional pathways depending on age and conditions of the sites. Based on the developmental potential, orientation by nature and biodiversity are selected as main targets for priority areas for nature conservation in mining sites. On priority areas restoration measures must be restricted to the use of near-natural methods (e.g., application of fresh, diaspore-rich plant clipping material, dumping of overburden with seed bank and vegetative propagules, seeding of site-specific, local seed mixtures) that are very successful in preventing erosion and accelerating vegetation development. Despite the success of these methods, the transfer of knowledge between scientists, practitioners, and administrative organizations has proved to be insufficient. Therefore, one of the main tasks in ecological restoration must be the inclusion of all stakeholders involved in decision-making processes and the establishment of a network of excellence to enhance the exchange of knowledge.

The results show that (i) 9 species were identified from seed bank in different seasons indicating that plant composition in this area was simple. (ii) The seed density in soil was 222 +/- 10.79 grain/m(2) on average, and showed a seasonal variation range from 132 +/- 8.16 grain/m(2) In summer to 303 +/- 12.70 grain/m(2) in autumn. (iii) The similarity coefficient between soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation was 0.778. (iv) Vertically, seed densities declined with soil depth. 82.4% of total seeds were found in the top 3 cm of soil profile. No active seeds were found in soil profile below 6 cm.

Soil samples were collected four times during the year at 3-month intervals. Seeds from 119 species were identified by germination tests in the soil samples. Density and species richness of seeds of herbaceous plants were greater than woody plants at all five sites throughout the year. Sampling time and site differences had significant effects on the mean number of species and on seed-bank density. Mean number of species per sample increased from February, reached the highest value in May, decreased to the lowest value in August and then increased in November. An exception was in the primary forest, where the highest number of species was found in February. Mean seed-bank density peaked in May at all five sites, and no significant differences were found between densities in February, November and August, except for the primary forest, The peak in seed-bank density in May might be due to dispersal of new seeds of spring-fruiting species combined with persistence of seeds dispersed in previous years. This seasonal variation of individual species was due primarily to differences in species phenology rather than to differences between sites. Four seasonal seed-bank strategies were identified: two transient and two persistent. At all sites, similar numbers of seeds of herbaceous species were found between seasons, but the number of species of trees and shrubs decreased in August.				li, yuhui/Q-1730-2019													0960-2585					JUN	2007	17	2					99	107		10.1017/S0960258507708139							WOS:000247862500004						
J	Jorgensen, T; Hauser, TP; Jorgensen, RB				Jorgensen, Tina; Hauser, Thure Pavlo; Jorgensen, Rikke Bagger			Adventitious presence of other varieties in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) from seed banks and certified seed	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												To obtain information on possible sources of contamination of the seed harvest of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., spp. napus) by other varieties (adventitious presence), we investigated the purity of certified seed lots; the abundance and origin of volunteers; and longevity and origin of seeds in the soil seed-bank. This information was acquired through DNA analysis of volunteers collected in the field and seedlings derived from the soil seed-bank. DNA profiles of the volunteers and seedlings were obtained using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers, and the profiles were compared with ISSR profiles from an assortment of 14 of the most commonly cultivated oilseed rape varieties from 1985 to 2004. This comparison was performed using the assignment program, AFLPOP. The age of the seed bank germinating to become volunteers was assumed from information on previously cultivated oilseed rape varieties at the site and the year of cultivation. The results showed that plants or seeds belonged to varieties cultivated at the site 4-17 years earlier, suggesting a long persistence of volunteer populations. High volunteer frequencies (6%, 29% and 32%) were found in the three oilseed rape fields analysed and, from soil cores, their soil seed-bank was estimated to be 50-100 seeds m(-2). The ISSR analysis of the 14 reference varieties showed that three of the certified seed lots contained other varieties above the allowed threshold. Our findings are discussed in the context of the coexistence between GM (genetically modified) and non-GM oilseed rape, and future levels of seed purity.

Integration of emergence and population dynamic models for long term weed management using wild oat (Avena fatua L.) as an example	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Weed emergence models and weed population models have shown to be important tools for decision making. However, there have been no attempts to integrate a weed emergence model with a population dynamics model to build an improved model with increased predictive capacity. In this paper, a method of integrating both types of model is presented and an application building a mathematical model based on previously reported seedling emergence and population dynamics data to simulate cohort-dependent population dynamics of wild oat is given. Three management scenarios (S-1, S-2, S-3) were considered. In S-1, farmers are not aware of the time of weed emergence make control decisions as a stochastic process. Under S-2, farmers are aware of the time of weed emergence and make decisions considering the time of emergence. The effect of 100% control when 80, 90, 95 and 100% of wild oats had emerged was examined. In S-3 there was "no control". In the absence of control the wild oat population grew in a sigmoid manner and reached an equilibrium density at about 16,000 seeds m(-2) in the soil seed bank. In S-1, simulation resulted in an average population equilibrium at about 13,000 seeds m(-2). This equilibrium position represented only a 19% reduction of the carrying capacity of the system. In S-2, the 95% and 100% emerged weeds, produced population extinction after 16 and 6 years, respectively. In S-2 with 90% and 80% of emerged weeds the carrying capacity of the system was reduced by 95% and 28%, respectively. Scenario S-2 with minimum uncertainty always gave better results than S-1. Integrating simple population models with emergence models would help farmers in long-term decision making for weed management.

Soil seed bank analysis of planted and naturally revegetating thermally-disturbed riparian wetland forests	WETLANDS												Accelerating the reestablishment of a mature, biotic community following a disturbance is a common goal of restoration ecology. In this study, we describe the relative successional status of a recently disturbed riparian seed bank when compared with less recently disturbed and undisturbed systems, and the short-term effects of restoration on seed bank development within the recently disturbed system. The study location, the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the development of wetland seed banks following a severe disturbance, in this case the release of elevated temperature and flow effluent from nuclear reactor operations. To assess the recovery of wetland seed banks over time, we compared seed banks of naturally recovering riparian corridor and swamp delta sites of two different ages since disturbance (nine years and 30 years) with undisturbed forested corridor and swamp sites. To assess the potential effects of restoration efforts (site preparation and planting of seedlings) on seed bank development, we compared seed banks of naturally recovering (unplanted) and planted riparian corridor and swamp delta sites in the more recently disturbed system. We expected total germinants and species richness to be highest in the recently disturbed sites and decline as wetland systems matured. Within recently disturbed sites, we expected planted sites to have higher abundance and richness than unplanted sites. We also expected a greater abundance of woody species in the undisturbed forested sites. The number of germinants differed among the sites, ranging from 748 individuals per m 2 in the undisturbed swamp area to 10,322 individuals per m 2 in the recently disturbed planted swamp delta. When corridor and delta sites within a stream system were combined, the mean number of germinants was greater in the recently disturbed system, intermediate in the 30-year (mid-successional) system, and lowest in the undisturbed system. Seed banks from the recently disturbed and mid-successional sites were more similar in composition than they were to the undisturbed systems. Across all stream systems, riparian corridors had greater mean species richness than swamp deltas, though differences in seed bank abundances were not significant. Sedges and rushes were the predominant life forms in the recently disturbed and mid-successional sites, while undisturbed sites had a greater proportion of herbs and woody seedlings. In addition, there were more germinants from planted sites than from unplanted sites. The dominance by early successional species at recently disturbed planted sites may be an unintended consequence of site preparation treatments, and such potential effects should be recognized and weighed during the development of restoration plans.																	0277-5212					JUN	2007	27	2					211	223		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[211:SSBAOP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000247423000001						
J	Patterson, L; Cooper, DJ				Patterson, Lindsay; Cooper, David J.			The use of hydrologic and ecological indicators for the restoration of drainage ditches and water diversions in a mountain fen, cascade range, California	WETLANDS												An intact hydrologic regime and the presence of peat forming vegetation are critical for the persistence of fen wetlands. Fen restoration projects often focus on reestablishing water tables near the soil surface, with little effort directed toward identifying, historic hydrologic regimes, hydrologic modifications, and the sources of degradation. We used inconsistencies in the modern hydrologic regime and historic hydrologic indicators present in the soil seedbank, vegetation, and organic soil composition to identify areas of Drakesbad Meadow, a mountain fen in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, that had been degraded. A network of ground-water monitoring wells and piezometers were used to identify the hydrologic regime of the 4.7-ha site. The presence of thick organic soils in sites with deep late summer water tables, inconsistencies between species present in the seedbank and the existing vegetation, and the presence of dry meadow species such as Poapratensis and Hordeum brachyantherum in areas with organic soils were used to determine that 2.4 ha of the site was degraded. A drainage ditch within the fen and diversions of the fen's water supply caused by a road outside of the fen were identified as the source of hydrologic modification and degradation. These were restored by blocking the flow of water in the main drainage ditch and by installing a series of channels to allow water to cross the road. Reconnecting flow beneath the road resulted in raising the summer water table from 80 cm below the soil surface to less than 10 cm in areas downslope of the road. The addition of five sheet-metal dams perpendicular to flow in the main drainage ditch resulted in raising the water table to within 10 to 20 cm of the soil surface in areas adjacent to and down gradient of the ditch. Before restoration, average late August water table levels across the entire site were 30 cm below the soil surface, while average post-restoration water table levels were 19 cm. below the soil surface. One year following hydrologic restoration, the percent canopy cover of species indicative of uplands and wet meadows, but not fens including Deschampsia cespitosa, Hordeum brachyantherum, and Poa pratensis decreased compared with pre-restoration years, while the cover of the peat-forming species Carex utriculata, Scirpus microcarpus, and Carex simulata increased. It is clear from our study that fens in this region will not persist under drought-like conditions created by water diversions, yet well-designed restoration projects can be used to restore modified hydrologic regimes and peat-forming vegetation necessary for the persistence of fen wetlands.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2007	27	2					290	304		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[290:TUOHAE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000247423000009						
J	Pastor, J; Aparicio, AM; Gutierrez-Maroto, A; Hernandez, AJ				Pastor, Jesus; Aparicio, Alberto Martin; Gutierrez-Maroto, Antonio; Hernandez, Ana Jesus			Effects of two chelating agents (EDTA and DTPA) on the autochthonous vegetation of a soil polluted with Cu, Zn and Cd	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Chelating agents are thought to be useful for the remediation of metal-polluted soils with adequate organic matter, but the effects of these substances on the plants or seed bank of plant communities that occur in the soils are relatively unknown. In this work, the effects of two chelating substances (EDTA and DTPA) on a wet grassland plant community affected by the presence of the abandoned copper mine "Fernandito" (Garganta de los Montes, Madrid) were compared. A microcosm bioassay (6 months) was designed using the soil's top layer containing the grassland's seed bank. This soil showed a high Cu pollution level, significant contents of Zn and Cd (1120, 190, and 15 ppm, respectively), a pH of 5 and an OM content of 6.2%. The soil was subjected to three different treatments: a) untreated soil (control), b) the addition of I g/kg EDTA, or of c) I g/kg DTPA. The results presented here are those related to the plant cover, species richness, aboveground and subterranean biomass and chemical composition of the most abundant plants. Neither EDTA nor DTPA caused intense negative effects on the plants rather they significantly increased the amount of copper accumulated in aboveground parts and roots. In particular, Agrostis castellana and Corrigiola telephiifolia extracted high amounts of copper when grown in the soil with added EDTA, although they showed some nutritional imbalances (lower P contents). In contrast, lower metal concentrations were detected in plants grown in the DTPA amended soil. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This weed is the progeny either of accidental hybrids between sugar beet (ssp. vulgaris) and wild beet (ssp. maritima), or of bolted sugar beet plants in the case of varieties with low bolting resistance. Because of its proximity to the crop, the weed cannot be eradicated by herbicides in sugar beet crops. With the advent of genetically modified (GM) sugar beet varieties tolerant to non-selective herbicides, weed beet could also become tolerant to these herbicides because the sugar beet and weed beet are interfertile. It is therefore crucial to evaluate and develop cropping systems for managing weed beet. Consequently, we need models quantifying the effects of cropping systems on weed beet dynamics. Because of the seed longevity, the seed bank of weed beet constitutes a key step for these dynamics. The objective of the present work was to develop a model quantifying the effects of tillage, in interaction with soil climate and structure, on the seed bank dynamics and the emergence of weed beet. The model was based on sub-models predicting (a) soil environment (climate, structure) resulting from the cropping system and weather, (b) vertical soil seed distribution after tillage, depending on the tool, the characteristics of the tillage implement and the soil structure; and (c) seed mortality, dormancy germination and pre-emergent growth depending on season, soil environment, seed depth and age. Seed mortality occurs only during autumn; seed dormancy increases during summer and autumn and decreases during winter; it also increases with seed depth. Germination is triggered by rain or tillage and driven by hydrothermal time; pre-emergent shoot elongation increases with thermal time; pre-emergent seedling mortality increases with soil clod size and seed depth. The sub-models for soil environment and seed movements were based on existing models; the weed beet sub-model was developed from our previously published studies and completed here with additional experiments. Simulations were carried out to show how crop rotation and tillage influence weed beet seed bank and emergence in different crops. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Soil seed bank and seedling populations of Hordeum murinum and Cardaria draba in saffron fields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Geostatistical techniques were used to characterize the spatial relationship between Hordeum murinum and Cardaria draba seedling and soil seed bank over the entire growing season of 2004-2005 in three saffron (Crocus sativus) fields, located in Southern Khorasan (33 degrees N latitude, 57 degrees E longitude), Iran. The maps of H. murinum seed bank density corresponded moderately to those seedling density in a and strongly to those in b and c fields. The emergence percentage of C. draba was higher than for H. murinum in all fields. Semivariograms showed spatial autocorrelation in seed bank and seedling populations of H. murinum and C. draba in all fields. Grey-scale field maps of C. draba seed banks corresponded visually to maps of seedling populations and could have been used to target control efforts, but visual correspondence between H. murinum seed bank and seedling maps was poor.

J	Bizoux, JP; Mahy, G				Bizoux, Jean-Philippe; Mahy, Gregory			Within-population genetic structure and clonal diversity of a threatened endemic metallophyte, Viola calaminaria (Violaceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We studied the within-population genetic structure and the clonality extent of Viola calaminaria, a rare endemic species of calamine soils, by means of RAPD markers in two populations (one recent and one ancient) with expected harsh and heterogeneous heavy-metal stress. At a very local scale (0.2-3 m), clonal propagation was detected in both populations, but the levels of clonal diversity were high (number of genets/number of ramets sampled = 0.9 [recent] and 0.76 [ancient]) and the maximal observed extension of the clones was 0.4 m. This indicated that clonality is not, for the species, an important mode of propagation and that clonal growth cannot be interpreted as a strategy for propagating or perpetuating adapted genotypes under harsh ecological constraints. Spatial autocorrelations revealed a significant (P < 0.001) negative value of correlogram slope in the two populations even when a single individual per clone was considered (i.e., analysis at the genet level). We conclude that spatial genetic structure at a very local scale reflects limited gene flow due to restricted seed dispersal rather than variation in clonal pattern in response to environmental heterogeneity. At a larger scale (2-30 m), spatial autocorrelations revealed a positive (P < 0.001) correlation at < 3 m and a random pattern at larger distances for the two populations. This suggested a patchy distribution of the genetically linked individuals associated with a disrupted pattern at a longer distance probably due to gene flow by pollen dispersal and a seed bank effect. The implications for the conservation of V. calaminaria are discussed.																	0002-9122					MAY	2007	94	5					887	895		10.3732/ajb.94.5.887							WOS:000249830400019	21636457

ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Pathogen-seed interactions may involve a race for seed resources, so that seeds that germinate more quickly, mobilizing reserves, will be more likely to escape seed death than slow-germinating seeds. This race-for-survival hypothesis was tested for the North American seed pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda on seeds of the annual grass Bromus tectorum, an invasive plant in North America. In this species, the seed germination rate varies as a function of dormancy status; dormant seeds germinate slowly if at all, whereas non-dormant seeds germinate quickly. Methods Three experimental approaches were utilized: (a) artificial inoculations of mature seeds that varied in primary dormancy status and wounding treatment; (b) naturally inoculated undispersed seeds that varied in primary dormancy status; and (c) naturally inoculated seeds from the carry-over seed bank that varied in degree of secondary dormancy, habitat of origin and seed age. Key Results In all three approaches, seeds that germinated slowly were usually killed by the pathogen, whereas seeds that germinated quickly frequently escaped. Pyrenophora semeniperda reduced B. tectorum seed banks. Populations in drier habitats sustained 50 times more seed mortality than a population in a mesic habitat. Older carry-over seeds experienced 30 % more mortality than younger seeds. Conclusions Given the dramatic levels of seed death and the ability of this pathogen to reduce seed carry-over, it is intriguing to consider whether P. semeniperda could be used to control B. tectorum through direct reduction of its seed bank.																	0305-7364					MAY	2007	99	5					907	914		10.1093/aob/mcm028							WOS:000246120200011	17353206

Br.) and Nitella hyalina (DC.) Ag., in Myall Lake, a shallow lake in New South Wales, Australia, in an attempt to elucidate the factors causing their distribution patterns. The field study was carried out from July 2003 to May 2005 and charophytes were sampled together with bottom sediments at 20 sampling locations in the lake on 13 occasions. Charophyte biomass (0-321 g DW m(-2)) displayed an optimum curve with depth and maximum biomass occurred between 1 and 2.5 m depth. In deeper water, shoots were longer (i.e., around 30 cm at I m depth to 60-90 cm between 2 and 4 m depth). Oospore and antheridia densities were higher in shallower water with a maximum around 80 cm. Plants growing in shallow depths had shorter internodes implying a short life cycle of shoots, and nodal spacing was relatively regular in contrast to its deep water counterparts although spacing tended to increase at locations farther from the apex. The present study also reports that there is an apparent decline in sexual propagule production rates with increasing water depth, further highlighting the different morphological and reproductive acclimations of charophytes in shallow and deep water.

Soil seed banks are a central feature of the ecology of landrace populations of cassava; their existence has consequences for conservation. Seedlings recruited from seed banks are incorporated by farmers into their stocks of clones of this vegetatively propagated crop, transforming pure clonality into a mixed clonal/sexual reproductive system. Soil seed banks, and fanners' responses to them, play an important role in maintaining diversity in populations of cassava landraces. In a study combining genetic and ethnobiological approaches, we showed the following: (i) Recruitment from soil seed banks increased diversity of populations at the local scale. At the level of a field, the presence of plants issued from seeds resulted in significantly greater diversity of genotypes and phenotypes than if only individuals planted by farmers had been present. (ii) Farmers' use of seed banks has enabled indirect 'exchange' of locally adapted cassava germplasm between cultural groups, without requiring that groups actually encountered one another and engaged in social exchange of cultivars. (iii) Farmers have responded to catastrophic crop failure by using seed banks to regenerate stocks of clones. This use of seed banks should enable cassava populations to respond to disasters by an increase of genetic diversity, rather than by a narrowing of the genetic base, often feared in such situations.

Forest cover is therefore often not as stable as it might look. How forest plant communities recovered after agriculture was abandoned allows us to explore some universal questions on how dispersal and environment limit plant species abundance and distribution. All studies looking at the effects of historical land use rely on adequate land use reconstruction. A variety of tools from maps, archival studies, and interviews to field evidence and soil analyses contribute to that. They allow us to distinguish ancient from recent forests and many studies found pronounced differences in forest plant species composition between them. A considerable percentage of our forest flora is associated with ancient forests. These ancient forest plant species (AFS) all have a low colonization capacity, suggesting that dispersal in space (distance related) and time (seed bank related) limit their distribution and abundance. However recent forests generally are suitable for the recruitment of AFS. There is clear evidence that dispersal limitation is more important than recruitment limitation in the distribution of AFS. Dispersal in time, through persistent seed banks, does not play a significant role. Ancient forests are not necessary more species-rich than recent forest, but if diversity is limited to typical forest plant species then ancient forests do have the highest number of plant species, making them highly important for nature conservation. The use of molecular markers, integrated approaches and modelling are all part of the way forward in this field of historical ecology.

J	Venable, DL				Venable, D. Lawrence			Bet hedging in a guild of desert annuals	ECOLOGY												Evolutionary bet hedging encapsulates the counterintuitive idea that organisms evolve traits that reduce short-term reproductive success in favor of longer-term risk reduction. It has been widely investigated theoretically, and many putative examples have been cited including practical ones such as the dormancy involved in microbe and weed persistence. However, long-term data on demographic variation from the actual evolutionarily relevant environments have been unavailable to test for its mechanistic relationship to alleged bet hedging traits. I report an association between delayed germination (a bet hedging trait) and risk using a 22-year data set on demographic variation for 10 species of desert annual plants. Species with greater variation in reproductive success (per capita survival from germination to reproduction x per capita fecundity of survivors) were found to have lower average germination fractions. This provides a definitive test using realistic data oft demographic variance that confirms the life history prediction for bet hedging. I also showed that the species with greater long-term demographic variation tended to be the ones with greater sensitivity of reproductive success to variation among years in growing-season precipitation.																	0012-9658					MAY	2007	88	5					1086	1090		10.1890/06-1495							WOS:000246369900002	17536393

Reducing Euphorbia esula with a combination of sheep grazing and imazapic	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Field studies were conducted in Idaho from 2002 to 2004 to determine whether summer grazing of sheep for I or 2 years before an autumn application of imazapic would enhance control of Euphorbia esula. E. esula, a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, has invaded the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains after its introduction into North America in the early 1880s and caused significant reductions in native plant biomass. Experiments were conducted to determine the impacts of 1 or 2 years of sheep grazing with or without a fall application of imazapic on E. esula and native plant populations. Sheep grazing was designed to remove reproductive parts from E. esula within a 10d grazing period. Imazapic was applied at 210 g ae ha(-1) with 1.25% (v/v) methylated seed oil. One year of sheep grazing did not alter measured vegetation components, but it did result in an increase of grass seed in the soil. Two years of sheep grazing increased the forb and grass cover component, increased the grass seed in the soil, and kept the E. esula seed bank from increasing. Application of imazapic reduced E. esula stem densities and cover and increased native forb cover. The combination of 1 or 2 years of sheep grazing and imazapic did not enhance the control of E. esula. However, 2 years of carefully timed sheep grazing followed with an imazapic application resulted in sustained productivity of plant biomass in the pasture. Because 2 years of sheep grazing prevented an increase in the E. esula seed bank, managers may have a better opportunity to establish desired vegetation in sagebrush steppe ecosystems after removing E. esula with imazapic.

J	Lindborg, R				Lindborg, Regina			Evaluating the distribution of plant life-history traits in relation to current and historical landscape configurations	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 In north European rural landscapes, abandonment of small farms and agricultural intensification have led to a decline in semi-natural grassland, with associated biodiversity loss. Although species richness response to land-use change in rural landscapes is relatively well studied, few have examined its effects on plant species composition over time. 2 In this study, four life-history traits associated with spatiotemporal dispersal were analysed: seed size, seed dispersal attributes (e.g. awns, wings), seed bank persistence and plant longevity (annuals, perennial with and without clonal ability). I investigated how differences in distribution of these traits among plants in semi-natural grasslands are related to current and historical landscape configuration. 3 The distributions of two out of the four investigated traits, longevity and seed bank persistence, were correlated with grassland connectivity and area, whereas seed size and seed dispersal attributes were not. The proportion of short-lived plants was positively associated with current grassland connectivity and grassland area, whereas long-lived species, with and without clonal ability, were unrelated to current grassland connectivity and area. 4 In contrast, short-lived plants were not affected by historical grassland connectivity, but the proportion of long-lived clonal plants was negatively associated with high historical grassland connectivity and large grassland area. In addition, the proportion of species with long persistence in the seed bank was negatively associated with historical grassland connectivity. 5 The result suggests that there are two main strategies to persist in response to landscape fragmentation: either persist in the seed bank or disperse vegetatively. The higher sensitivity to isolation among short-lived plants and plants without clonal ability calls attention to the importance of considering life-history traits to understand plant community dynamics fully over time. In the long term, reduction in historical connectivity and grassland area will thus create a grassland community dominated by clonal long-lived plants and plants with a persistent seed bank. 6 This study shows that both spatial and temporal effects of landscape configuration are important factors structuring local plant species composition in grasslands. The results bring important insights to our understanding of large-scale ecological processes, and are also highly relevant to biodiversity conservation in fragmented agricultural landscapes worldwide.																	0022-0477					MAY	2007	95	3					555	564		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01232.x							WOS:000245693800015

Mortality and recruitment in a lowland tropical rain forest of French Guiana: effects of soil type and species guild	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												A variety of processes have been identified as playing a key role in maintenance of hyper-rich tropical forest, among which ecological sorting caused by niche partitioning challenges stochastic dispersal processes. However, demographic responses to spatio-temporal resource variation that could result in biased species distributions are still little studied. In this paper we investigate from two censuses, c. 15 y apart, of a 12-ha permanent forest sample in French Guiana, how tree recruitment and mortality rates vary among hydrological soil types known to at, feet species habitat preferences and among ecological guilds related to species light requirement. The results indicate that both recruitment and mortality vary significantly with respect to these factors. While the mean instantaneous mortality and recruitment rates are estimated to 0.98 and 0.81%, respectively. pioneer species. canopy trees and hydromorphic bottomland soils depart significantly from these values. In particular, the pioneers, regenerating either from the soil seed bank or from post-opening seed rain, show faster dynamics than other species. These two guilds harbour probabilities of mortality elevated by a factor of 1.9 and 3.2, respectively, and probabilities of recruitment elevated by a factor of 4.9 and 3.1, respectively. Conversely, canopy trees show slower dynamics, with probabilities of mortality and recruitment lowered by a mean factor of about 0.5 with respect to other species. We also observe that trees growing in hydromorphic bottomlands prove to have significantly higher mortality and recruitment probabilities, by a factor of about 2 with respect to those growing in terra firme.

Soil seed bank dynamics in post-fire heathland succession in south-eastern Australia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks can exert a strong influence on the path of vegetation succession following fire, with species varying in their capacity to persist in the seed bank over time, leading to changes in seed bank composition and propagules available for post-fire colonisation.

No significant change was evident in the species richness and density of the germinable soil seed bank, but species composition differed significantly among young (0-6 years since fire), intermediate (10-17 years since fire) and old-aged (24-26 years since fire) sites (using presence/absence data). No significant trend was observed in the similarity between the extant vegetation and the soil seed bank with time since fire. A total of 32% of the species recorded in the soil seed bank were not present in the above-ground vegetation at the same site, which suggests that species requiring fire for germination may be present in the seed bank. Most species present in the extant vegetation were not recorded (63%) or were in very low abundances in the soil seed bank (29%). The mode of regeneration appears to be the major determinant of species absence in the soil seed bank, as 66% of species occurring in the extant vegetation but not in the seed bank have the capacity to regenerate by resprouting. This study shows that a major shift in the successional pathway after fire due to altered seed bank composition is unlikely in this vegetation; most species not recorded in the seed bank are either resprouters (obligate or facultative) or serotinous, suggesting that they will readily regenerate following fire. Unless fire frequencies are high and kill fire-sensitive obligate seeders before they reach maturity, the chance that the soil seed bank could substantially alter vegetation composition within the study area after fire is low. However, it is unclear how successional pathways may alter in response to severe fires with the potential to kill both seeders and resprouters.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				MAY	2007	190	1					1	12		10.1007/s11258-006-9186-4							WOS:000245363200001

Disturbance persistence in managed grasslands: shifts in aboveground community structure and the weed seed bank	PLANT ECOLOGY												The length of time and form in which disturbances persist in systems depends on the intensity and frequency of disturbance and on the abilities of resident species to recover from such events. In grazed grasslands, trampling by large mammalian herbivores can periodically facilitate weed establishment by exposing patches of bare ground but whether an intense soil disturbance event results in a temporary increase in weed abundance or a persistent weed problem remains unclear. In May 2002, cattle trampling following heavy rain caused severe damage to nine-month old, rotationally grazed, cool-season pastures (Midwest USA). In September 2002, we compared the aboveground composition of paddocks (i.e., fenced pasture sections) that were heavily disturbed to those that received no damage. Relative to undisturbed paddocks, forage species relative cover was 17% lower in disturbed paddocks, and weed species and bare ground relative cover was 61% and 100% higher, respectively. By September 2004, paddock types did not differ in all aboveground community components. However, the abundance and species richness of weed seeds in the soil seed bank averaged respectively 82% and 30% higher in disturbed paddocks between 2003 and 2004. These findings indicate that a spatially extensive, intense soil disturbance event may soon become undetectable in components of aboveground pasture structure but can persist as an augmented weed seed bank. Because of high weed seed bank longevity, disturbances to formerly disturbed pastures would likely result in higher weed recruitment, with more species represented, than in those which lack previous disturbance. Disturbance history may thus be a useful predictor of weed community composition following subsequent disturbance. Based on empirical data supporting this proposition, we recommend that grassland managers explicitly incorporate disturbance history into dynamic management planning and do not rely exclusively on aboveground characters to evaluate the invasion status or colonization potential of an area by undesirable plants. We emphasize that the ecological legacies of past soil disturbance events cannot only influence the contemporary patterns and processes of grasslands, but importantly, affect their compositional trajectories following subsequent perturbation.																	1385-0237					MAY	2007	190	1					71	80		10.1007/s11258-006-9191-7							WOS:000245363200006

Understanding the periodicity of seedling emergence and longevity of seeds buried in the soil may help growers devise more efficient strategies to control common groundsel. Studies were conducted to determine the dormancy status of common groundsel seeds over 24 mo, and to describe the effect of tillage and fertilizer on the pattern of seedling emergence and the rate of depletion of seeds from the soil seed bank. Common groundsel seeds were collected (June 2000 and 2002) from sites along a 700-km transect from Kentucky to Michigan (39 degrees 1' and 43 degrees 36'N, respectively). Seeds were cleaned and placed in nylon mesh bags for burial in a common garden. Every month for the following 24 mo, replicate bags from each location were exhumed. Germination was tested under alternating temperatures of 20 and 10 C, for 14 and 10 It day/night, respectively. Germination response at each sampling date was similar regardless of seed source, but differed for the 2000 to 2002 and 2002 to 2004 experiments. Laboratory germination of seeds buried was initially high (98%) and declined rapidly to about 20% by midwinter. Germination increased to about 60% during the second summer, followed by a slow decline to 40% during winter and another rapid decline before the third summer. The rapid declines in germination were preceded by low soil temperatures (< 5 C) and the germination peaks corresponded with periods of high soil temperatures (similar to 20 C). Results suggested that common groundsel follows a cycle of dormancy and nondormancy corresponding to decreases and increases, respectively, in soil temperature. During 2 yr of deep burial in undisturbed soil, 94% of the seeds germinated or died, suggesting that common groundsel seeds may not persist more than a few months in regularly disturbed soils.

J	Maxwell, BD; Smith, RG; Brelsford, M				Maxwell, Bruce D.; Smith, Richard G.; Brelsford, Monica			Wild oat (Avena fatua) seed bank dynamics in transition to organic wheat production systems	WEED SCIENCE												Concern over the consequences of increased weed seed inputs to the soil seed bank during the transition period from conventional to organic production is one obstacle to grower adoption of reduced input and nonchemical weed management strategies. An 11-yr study was established in southwest Montana to investigate the effect of a single pulse of wild oat seeds on subsequent seed bank dynamics. In 1993, wild oat seeds were sown at five densities (0, 20, 80, 320, and 800 seeds m(-2) ) in eight wheat-small grain cropping systems that differed in the number of crops in rotation and fallow periods. Wild oat seed banks were measured each spring from 1994 to 2004 in half of the cropping systems and from 2001 to 2004 in all eight systems. In 1994, seed bank densities in response to the pulse were as much as 11 times higher than controls that received no seeds in 1993. By 1996, after mechanical fallowing of all cropping systems, wild oat seed bank densities were not significantly different from densities in control plots regardless of the size of the initial seed pulse and remained so through 2004. These data suggest that increases in wild oat seed inputs during the organic transition period will have relatively few long-term agronomic effects on the dynamics of wild oat seed banks in these systems. In addition, wild oat seed banks may be constrained by factors other than cropping sequence when herbicides are not used, such as possible density-dependent regulation as a result of increased soil pathogen attack and seed predation.

William			Tillage, cropping system, and soil depth effects on common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis) seed-bank persistence	WEED SCIENCE												A field experiment was conducted in Urbana, IL, from 1997 to 2000 to evaluate the effect that crop, tillage, and soil depth have on common waterhemp seed-bank persistence. A heavy field infestation of common waterhemp (approximately 410 plants m(-2)) was allowed to set seed in 1996 and was not allowed to go to seed after 1996. In 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, the percentage of the original common waterhemp seed bank that remained was 39, 28, 10, and 0.004%, respectively, averaged over tillage treatments. Initially, germination and emergence of common waterhemp was greater in no-till systems. Consequently, the number of remaining seeds was greater in the till treatments compared with no-till in the top 0 to 6 cm of the soil profile. This reduction was in part explained by the higher germination and emergence of common waterhemp in the no-tillage treatments. Tillage increased the seed-bank persistence of common waterhemp in the top 0 to 2 cm of the soil profile in 1997 and the top 0 to 6 cm in 1998. Crop had no effect on common waterhemp emergence or seed-bank persistence. In 200 1, > 10% of the seed germinated that was buried 6 to 20 cm deep compared with 3% for seed 0 to 2 cm deep.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	2007	55	3					235	239		10.1614/WS-06-198							WOS:000246418600007

Cone production in young post-fire Pinus contorta stands in Greater Yellowstone (USA)	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Spatial and temporal variability in cone production may influence post-disturbance succession, yet it is not well understood. We sampled 15-year old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands (n = 16) that regenerated naturally after the 1988 Yellowstone fires and varied in stand density (566-545,200 stems ha(-1)) and elevation to quantify and explain variation in cone production. Among stands, the percentage of trees bearing cones ranged from 10 to 80% and was greater in stands with larger trees and at lower elevations. Mean cone abundance was 3.7 cones tree(-1) (range of 0.10-17.85 cones tree(-1) for the 16 stands) and increased with mean basal diameter and decreasing elevation. The earliest onset of cone production was 1997, and early onset was associated with lower elevations (< 2300 in). Cone density ranged from 1082 to 1,0 15,665 cones ha(-1) among the stands, with most of this variation explained by a positive relationship with stand density. Although scrotinous cones were not expected in such young stands, we observed serotinous cones (albeit infrequently) in five of the 16 stands. Serotinous cones were only recorded at elevations < 2230 in where fire return intervals are relatively short (< 200 years). Among individual trees (n = 320), 33% bore cones, and both cone presence and abundance were positively related to tree basal diameter. Cone production in the young post-fire lodgepole pine stands that regenerated after the 1988 Yellowstone fires is both abundant and spatially variable, and lodgepole pine in this system might produce serotinous cones earlier than reported previously. The abundant canopy seed bank in young post-fire stands suggests substantial resilience of this forested landscape to extensive stand-replacing disturbance. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Floristic inventories were conducted in jack pine plantations which had been established on forest sites after logging and on sites previously utilized for agriculture. These were compared to one another and to inventories conducted in natural forests and on agricultural sites which had not (not yet) been planted with trees (old fields). The vegetation community composition of the sites is analysed using several multivariate techniques. Results show that the flora of plantations on old agricultural fields is markedly different than that of plantations established on sites which were previously forested and that the two types of plantation are unlikely to become floristically the same before the anticipated harvest time. Comparing old and young plantations and old fields in light of natural forests sites, we show that the previous land-use is a key determinant of future compositional differences in plantations. This must be considered when we evaluate the impact of establishing plantations on sites with different land-use histories. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of English ivy (Hedera helix) on seed bank formation and germination	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												English ivy Hedera helix L. is rapidly invading forest ecosystems in the southeastern United States, leading to a decrease in the diversity of native plant species. To determine the underlying mechanism for the loss of diversity and understand the potential for restoration of impacted habitats, we examined whether ivy had a negative effect on seed bank formation and germination. We sampled the seed bank and the summer and fall seed rains in areas with and without ivy. In addition, we determined potential allelopathic effects of ivy on germination of Coreopsis lancelota seeds. The density and species diversity of the seed bank and seed rains were not significantly different between areas with and without ivy. However, ivy led to a marginally significant reduction in the germination rate of C. lancelota seeds. Yet, the effect of ivy on germination only occurred when ivy plants were present. Germination rates did not differ in soil from areas with and without ivy. Our results suggest that native plant communities can regenerate naturally from the seed bank if English ivy were removed.

Spatial heterogeneity in the determinants of woody plant invasion of lowland heath	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: 1. What is the scale and extent of spatial variability in factors affecting Betula invasion of heaths? 2. How much effect does each factor have on within-patch patterns of invasion? 3. How can this understanding aid in managing Ben, la invasions? Location: Lowland heath of southern England. Methods: Determinants of Betula (both B. pubescens and B. pendula) invasion: biomass density, necromass density, mean vegetation height, P-availability, soil water content and total Bettla seed bank density, were measured at two sites on a 5-ha sampling grid. Spatial pattern was assessed using geostatistics. Contributions of each determinant to within-site heterogeneity in predicted Betula seedling densities were estimated by varying variables over their full and interquartile ranges in a statistical model derived from experimental data. Results: Salient spatial trends were revealed: strong autocorrelation over distances of < 50 m for soil factors and more extensive autocorrelation (0 to > 150 m) in vegetation variables and Betula seed bank densities. The latter resulted in single across-site gradients, the former small, distinct patches. All patterns were overlain with variance that was present at distances of < 17.6 m. Variables displaying spatial pattern also accounted for within-site heterogeneity in predicted Betula seedling densities but their relative contribution to this varied between sites. Conclusions: Identifiable spatial autocorrelation in factors controlling patch-scale invasion patterns allows managers to target invasion prone patches, potentially reducing management intensities. Furthermore, management effort may be optimised by spatially de-coupling Betula seed from safe-sites. This plan may adaptable to the management of other weeds and openland ecosystems.

The role of soil seed banks in the restoration of dry acidic dune grassland after burning of Ulex europaeus scrub	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Can the seed bank play a significant role in the restoration of plant communities of dry acidic dune grassland where fire has destroyed Ulex europaeus scrub? Location: Northern French Atlantic coast. Methods: One year after the fire, the seed bank and vegetation were sampled in 1 m x 1 m plots along three transects from the oldest scrub vegetation towards the grassland. Differences in species richness, seed density and contribution of ecological groups in the seed bank and vegetation along the transects wet e analysed. Results: Seed density and species richness in the seed bank decreased significantly from the grassland towards the centre of the scrub vegetation; 50% of the seed bank consisted of cow species of the target plant community, such as Carex arenaria, Aira praecox, Rumex acetosella and Agrostis capillaris. Seeds of these species were also found in the deeper soil layers beneath the oldest scrub vegetation, indicating that they can be considered to be long-term persistent. Beneath the youngest scrub vegetation, seeds of rare satellite target species also occurred. However, no target species were established on the burned site after one year, resulting in a large discrepancy between seed bank and vegetation. Conclusions: Although the seeds present in the soil indicate that restoration of the acidic grassland based on the seed bank is possible, additional management actions such as mowing and soil disturbance may be necessary to restrict resprouting of Ulex and to stimulate the germination of seeds of target species in the deeper soil layers.																	1402-2001					APR	2007	10	1					131	138		10.1658/1402-2001(2007)10[131:TROSSB]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000245934700015						
J	Farnsworth, EJ				Farnsworth, Elizabeth J.			Plant life history traits of rare versus frequent plant taxa of sandplains: Implications for research and management trials	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												I apply a comparative, functional group approach to coastal sandplain grassland taxa in order to examine whether rare plant species share certain aspects of rarity and life history characters that are distinct from their more common, co-occurring congeners in these habitats. I compiled a comparative data set containing 16 variables describing biogeographic distributions, level of imperilment, habitat specialization, vegetative versus sexual reproduction, seed dispersal, and dormancy of 27 closely-related pairs of plant species that contrast in their abundance (infrequent versus common) in coastal sandplain grasslands. Frequent and infrequent species were paired within genera (or closely related genera) and thus distributed equivalently across families to control for phylogenetic bias. Paired comparisons revealed that infrequent species were intrinsically rarer range-wide, and exhibited a narrower range and more habitat specialization than their common relatives. A classification tree distinguished infrequent species from common species on the basis of higher habitat specialization, larger seed size, smaller plant height, less reliance less on vegetative (colonial) reproduction, and tendency toward annual or biennial life history. Research and management steps to reduce competition from larger-satured, colonial, perennial species are recommended for these infrequent species. Basic research involving more species and more data on ecophysiological characters, demography, and competitive interactions are needed to identify critical life history traits that will influence responses to particular management regimes.

Impact of the gall-forming rust fungus Uromycladium tepperianum on the invasive tree Acacia saligna in South Africa: 15 years of monitoring	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Acacia saligna was regarded as the most troublesome invasive alien weed in the Cape Floristic region. The gall-forming rust fungus Uromycladium tepperianum was introduced into South Africa in 1987, and it established throughout the range of the weed. Five populations of the weed were monitored annually from 1991 to 2005. Tree density and stem diameter were recorded in each of four permanent transects at each site. Tree density declined by between 87% and 98% for the period 1991-2005 at these five sites. Average annual mortality rate (+/- SE) of infected trees dying was 18% (+/- 2%) during the same period. Canopy mass and age were determined by destructively sampling trees at 19 sites. Canopy mass at all sites was lower than data published before introduction of U. tepperianum, and the longer since the last major disturbance (fires or clearing operations), the greater the reduction. Average age of trees in these sites was between 2.2 and 6.1 years, despite the last major disturbance being at least 10-20 years previous at 11 of the sites. Pod and seed production were determined, and seed fall calculated, at each of four sites in 2004. These data were compared to the same variables gathered in 1989. Seed fall in 2004 was reduced compared to that recorded earlier. Results show that U. tepperianum remains a highly effective biological control agent against A. saligna in South Africa.

J	Tremlova, K; Munzbergova, Z				Tremlova, Katrina; Muenzbergova, Zuzana			Importance of species traits for species distribution in fragmented landscapes	ECOLOGY												Knowledge of the relationship between species traits and species distribution in fragmented landscapes is important for understanding current distribution patterns and as background information for predictive models of the effect of future landscape changes. The existing studies on the topic suffer from several drawbacks. First, they usually consider only traits related to dispersal ability and not growth. Furthermore, they do not apply phylogenetic corrections, and we thus do not know how considerations of phylogenetic relationships can alter the conclusions. Finally, they usually apply only one technique to calculate habitat isolation, and we do not know how other isolation measures would change the results. We studied the issues using 30 species forming congeneric pairs occurring in fragmented dry grasslands. We measured traits related to dispersal, survival, and growth in the species and recorded distribution of the species in 215 grassland fragments. We show many strong relationships between species traits related to both dispersal and growth and species distribution in the landscape, such as the positive relationship between habitat occupancy and anemochory and negative relationships between habitat occupancy and seed dormancy. The directions of these relationships, however, often change after application of phylogenetic correction. For example, more isolated habitats host species with smaller seeds. After phylogenetic correction, however, they turn out to host species with larger seeds. The conclusions also partly change depending on how we calculate habitat isolation. Specifically, habitat isolation calculated from occupied habitats only has the highest predictive power. This indicates slow dynamics of the species. All the results support the expectation that species traits have a high potential to explain patterns of species distribution in the landscape and that they can be used to build predictive models of species distribution. The specific conclusions are, however, dependent on the technique used, and we should carefully consider this when comparing among different studies. Since different techniques answer slightly different questions, we should attempt to use analyses both with and without phylogenetic correction and explore different isolation measures whenever possible and compare the results.

Seed dispersal and recruitment limitation are barriers to native recolonization of old-fields in western Australia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Native recolonization of abandoned farmland in the wheat-growing region of western Australia is slow to non-existent, even 45 years after abandonment. Instead, old-fields tend to be dominated by non-native annual grasses. The native vegetation in the region is highly fragmented. We predicted that recovery is limited by seed availability and recruitment failure. We compared the seed rain, soil seed bank and extant vegetation of three old-fields and three adjacent native woodland remnants to test our predictions. Seed dispersal limitation was evident at two old-fields: species richness of the native seed in the soil seed bank declined at 50-m increments (i.e. 0 m, 50 m and 100 m) into the old-fields. Species richness of recolonizing native vegetation also declined along this transect. Recruitment limitation was evident at one old-field, probably linked to the few abundant non-native species that dominated the vegetation. These non-natives dominated the seed supply, and tended to germinate more rapidly than the native seeds. In contrast, seed dispersal and recruitment had not limited native recolonization of the third old-field: 91% of the species present in the adjacent remnant had recolonized this old-field. Species richness and abundance of non-natives in the seed supply and extant vegetation were minor compared with that of the other old-fields. Therefore an adequate seed supply of natives, the lack of non-natives and chance natural disturbance events (i.e. cyclone and fire) had probably contributed to this result. Synthesis and applications. Native recolonization of wheatbelt old-fields is contingent upon the unusual coincidence of seed availability, favourable conditions for recruitment and an absence of competitive non-natives. Grasses, annual herbs and Acacia shrubs are dominant among the few native species that have consistently recolonized these old-fields. In most cases, direct seeding and control of non-natives are the minimum requirements for restoration of wheatbelt old-fields to species-rich eucalypt woodlands.

J	Wellstein, C; Otte, A; Waldhardt, R				Wellstein, Camilla; Otte, Annette; Waldhardt, Rainer			Seed bank diversity in mesic grasslands in relation to vegetation type, management and site conditions	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: 1. Do different management types (i.e. hay meadow, silage meadow, meadow-pasture, pasture) have different impact on the size and composition of the seed bank of mesic grassland (Arrhenatheretalia)? 2. How strong is the effect of management on the seed bank in relation to above-ground vegetation, edaphic factors and land-use history? 3. Are there differences in C-S-R plant strategy types and seed longevity under different management regimes? Location: Lahn-Dill Highlands in central-western Germany. Methods: Above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank of 63 plots (at 21 sites) in mesic grasslands were studied. Differences between management types in quantitative seed bank traits and functional characteristics were tested by ANOVA. The impact of management, above-ground vegetation, site conditions and land-use history on seed bank composition were analysed by partial CCA. Results: Management had no significant impact on species richness and density of the seed bank but significantly influenced their floristic composition and functional characteristics. CCA revealed that even after adjustment for soil chemical parameters and above-ground vegetation management still had significant impact on seed bank composition. ANOVA revealed that silage meadows contained higher proportions of R-strategy compared to hay meadows. In contrast, in hay meadows and meadow-pastures proportions of S-strategy were higher than in silage meadows. Conclusions: The type of grassland management has little impact on quantitative seed bank traits. Management types with a high degree of disturbance lead to an increase of species following a ruderal strategy in the seed bank. Irrespective of management type only a limited proportion of characteristic grassland species is likely to re-establish from the seed bank after disappearance from above-ground vegetation.

J	Lopez, RP; Valdivia, S				Lopez, Ramiro Pablo; Valdivia, Sergio			The importance of shrub cover for four cactus species differing in growth form in an Andean semi-desert	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Factors influencing seedling establishment are known to vary between open sites and those protected by plant cover. In many desert regions, protected microhabitats below shrubs are essential for establishment of many cactus species. Very little is known about these factors for Andean cacti and how the importance of vegetation cover varies with cactus species. Are Andean cacti associated more frequently to vegetation cover than to open ground? Are they associated to certain shrub species? Is the distributional pattern in relation to cover similar for different cactus species? In what microhabitat (below or away from shrubs) are cactus seeds more abundant? These questions are addressed for the case of an Andean semi-desert. Location: Semi-arid tropical Andes, La Paz department, Bolivia. Methods: We examined 132 isolated shrubs : 50 cm along a line across two microhabitats: areas below and away from shrubs/trees. Shrub crown size was measured. The among-shrub samples were taken from open spaces contiguous to each of the sampled shrubs. In both microhabitats, all cactus species were recorded. The cardinal direction of the cacti was also registered. Correlation between canopy diameter and number of beneficiaries was evaluated for Prosopis flexuosa. The cactus seed bank in each microhabitat was also studied. Results and Conclusions: The four cactus species found behaved differently in relation to shrub canopies. These distributional differences could be due to differences in growth form. Columnar cacti apparently need the shade of shrubs. Only the columnar species is able to grow near the base of the tallest nurse species. The opuntioid cacti studied seem more facultative: although apparently preferring shrub under-canopies, they are able to establish in open ground. The globose cactus is the most indifferent to the presence of plant cover. These patterns parallel others found in North America. The capacity of different cacti to appear in open spaces could be related to vegetative propagation, and not necessarily to seedling tolerance of heat.

Greater nitrogen and/or phosphorus availability increase plant species' cover and diversity at a High Arctic polar semidesert	POLAR BIOLOGY												Enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition at high latitudes is a circumpolar phenomenon. Low soil phosphorus (P), however, may limit vegetation responses to increased N inputs. From 2000 to 2002, the effects of N at 0, 0.5 (a rate occurring in Greenland and Iceland) and 5 (equivalent to deposition in areas of Europe) g N m(-2) a(-1) and P (0.1 g m(-2) a(-1)) treatments on plant species' cover and diversity were determined at a polar semidesert site (ambient deposition c 0.1 g N m(-2) a(-1) ) in Svalbard (79 degrees N). The largest response was to combined 5 g N plus 1 g P m(-2) a(-1), where cover of Saxifraga oppositifolia increased c fourfold, density of Salix polaris leaves c ninefold, seedlings of several 'new' species (Draba oxycarpa, Saxifraga caespitosa, Sagina nivalis) were established and 'immigration' of Bryum arcticum and 'extinction' of Schistidium apocarpum were observed. There were fewer, less pronounced, effects on the plant community at 0.5 g N m(-2) a(-1). Low P availability did indeed appear to restrict vegetation response to N. There was a trend for plant species' richness and diversity to increase with 1 g P m(-2) a(-1) at 0 and 0.5 g N m(-2) a(-1) , but not at 5 g N m(-2). Plant species showed individualistic responses so that generalisation by functional type was not possible. Such increased colonisation by moss species of bare soil, and greater densities of previously unrecorded angiosperm seedlings, are not usually observed in more closed (subarctic) tundra as a response to N and P additions. These changes are likely to influence significantly nutrient cycles, whole system carbon budgets and surface energy and water balances.																	0722-4060					APR	2007	30	5					559	570		10.1007/s00300-006-0213-7							WOS:000244753300004

Effect of reproductive modes and environmental heterogeneity in the population dynamics of a geographically widespread clonal desert cactus	POPULATION ECOLOGY												The dynamics of plant populations in arid environments are largely affected by the unpredictable environmental conditions and are fine-tuned by biotic factors, such as modes of recruitment. A single species must cope with both spatial and temporal heterogeneity that trigger pulses of sexual and clonal establishment throughout its distributional range. We studied two populations of the clonal, purple prickly pear cactus, Opuntia macrocentra, in order to contrast the factors responsible for the population dynamics of a common, widely distributed species. The study sites were located in protected areas that correspond to extreme latitudinal locations for this species within the Chihuahuan Desert. We studied both populations for four consecutive years and determined the demographic consequences of environmental variability and the mode of reproduction using matrix population models, life table response experiments (LTREs), and loop and perturbation analyses. Although both populations seemed fairly stable (population growth rate, lambda-1), different demographic parameters and different life cycle routes were responsible for this stability in each population. In the southernmost population (MBR) LTRE and loop and elasticity analyses showed that stasis is the demographic process with the highest contributions to lambda, followed by sexual reproduction, and clonal propagation contributed the least. The northern population (CR) had both higher elasticities and larger contributions of stasis, followed by clonal propagation and sexual recruitment. Loop analysis also showed that individuals in CR have more paths to complete a life cycle than those in MBR. As a consequence, each population differed in life history traits (e.g., size class structure, size at sexual maturity, and reproductive value). Numerical perturbation analyses showed a small effect of the seed bank on the lambda of both populations, while the transition from seeds to seedlings had an important effect mainly in the northern population. Clonal propagation (higher survival and higher contributions to vital rates) seems to be more important for maintaining populations over long time periods than sexual reproduction.

Effects of exotic grasses on soil seed banks in southeastern Arizona grasslands	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												At the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch, an ungrazed grassland preserve in southeastern Arizona, soil seed banks were sampled in June, August, and October 2002 and June 2003. Wildfire had previously burned 90% of the research ranch in May 2002. Seed density and species richness in burned native grassland (2 plots) were compared to those in burned exotic, grassland (2 plots). Averaged over 4 sample dates, seed densities were as follows: burned native grassland, 591 +/- 243.1 seeds center dot m(-2) and 784 +/- 334.9 seeds. m(-2); burned exotic grassland, 501 +/- 198.9 seeds center dot m-2 and 196 +/- 123.8 seeds center dot m(-2). Species richness in the seed bank, also averaged over 4 sample dates, was as follows: burned native grassland, 16.3 +/- 1.7 species. m(-2) and 19.5 +/- 1.0 species. m-2; burned exotic grassland, 12.0 +/- 3.4 species - m(-2) and 11.06 +/- 2.5 species - m-2. The seed bank of burned exotic grassland contained significantly fewer seeds and species than that of burned native grassland. In addition, the seed bank in burned exotic grassland comprised mainly exotic grasses, whereas annual and perennial herbs, most of them native, dominated the seed bank of burned native grassland. Of the 50 species detected in soil samples, only 20 had a persistent seed bank, and only 1 of these was a native perennial bunchgrass. The preponderance of transient species means that eradication of exotic grasses most be followed by reseeding of native grasses and herbs, perhaps repeatedly, if native grassland is to replace exotic grassland.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				APR	2007	67	2					206	218		10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[206:EOEGOS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000247995000004

Construction and evaluation of ALOMYSYS modelling the effects of cropping systems on the blackgrass life-cycle: From seedling to seed production	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) is an annual weed frequently found in winter crops and increasingly tolerant to herbicides. To manage this weed with less or no herbicides, the model ALOMYSYS was developed to quantify the effects of cropping systems on the demography of blackgrass. The sub-model for seed survival, dormancy, germination and pre-emergent growth was described in a previous paper. This paper presents the sub-model quantifying seedling survival, tillering, heading, flowering and seed production, as a function of the weed emergence date and density (predicted by the seed bank sub-model), the crops grown in the field, the cultivation techniques used to manage the crop (tillage, sowing, herbicides, nitrogen, harvest) and the climate (temperature, rainfall). The sub-model is based on the annual life-cycle of blackgrass; the relationship between the various life-stages depends on the model input variables and on the characteristics of the weed population (e.g. tillering decreases with weed density, herbicide efficacy decreases with plant stage and density, etc.). The equations describing the life-stages and processes were deduced from previous greenhouse experiments and field trials. The resulting model was evaluated by comparing the simulations to independent field observations. This validation showed the model to accurately predict weed stages for a given year as well as the dynamics over the years, in contrasted cropping systems. The model can thus be used to evaluate and design new cropping systems for integrated crop protection. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lamour, A; Lotz, LAP				Lamour, Angelique; Lotz, Lambertus A. P.			The importance of tillage depth in relation to seedling emergence in stale seedbeds	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Stale seedbeds can be used in arable farming to reduce the density of weeds in the crop. This type of tillage before crop sowing can contribute to a successful weed management in systems where no herbicides are used, e.g. organic farming. The population dynamics of weeds in response to stale seedbeds is, however, hardly understood, and therefore possibly not optimised. The relevance of tillage depth in relation to seedling emergence is explored with a simple, deterministic model. We systematically examined the effect of seedling emergence and subsequent weed control on weed population dynamics, starting by considering the seed bank as one soil layer, and continued by considering a depth-structured seed bank. Whether the widely used tillage regime consisting of shallow tillage, again shallow tillage, and ultimately deep tillage, is preferred above the regime we propose (i.e. deep, shallow and ultimately shallow tillage) depends on the proportion emergence specific for each soil layer, the proportion of seeds that is moved from one layer to the other, and the seed distribution in the soil. A case study based on characteristics of the population dynamics of the weed Polygonum persicaria showed that the proposed tillage regime could give reductions in weed density of up to 32% compared to the conventional tillage regime of stale seedbeds. The tillage regime that we propose requires techniques that restrict soil compaction to fixed traffic lanes, giving large zones favourable for crop growth. Because of ongoing processes in precision farming technology with respect to controlled traffic systems, this regime has realistic opportunities to become widely used in the future..

ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Since the beginning of the 20th century, the concepts of ecotones, ecoclines and edge effects have been discussed from a theoretical point of view. However, there have been very few experimental tests of these ideas, which are sometimes radically different. This study presents data from field experimental researches and determines the status of transitions between cereal fields and grazed grasslands. Five study sites were chosen in Southern France because they were included in agri-environmental schemes aimed at conserving arable weeds and dry grassland species. In total, 128 quadrats of 1 m(2) were sampled on replicated transects running through transition zones. There was no significant increase of species-richness but there were changes in the botanical composition from cereal fields to grassland. These experimental results confirmed the opinion of Van der Maarel, E. (1990. Ecotones and ecoclines are different. J. Veg. Sci. 1, 135-138) that an ecotone is poorer in species than the adjacent ecosystems, as only a few species can adapt to the typical environmental factors in this zone. The transition zones studied rather reflected an edge effect than a real ecotone following the definition of Odum, E.P. (1971. Fundamentals of Ecology, 3e ed. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphie). in our case, when the transition zone between the two adjacent ecosystems is managed as a "constraint ecotone" following Vanpeene-Bruhier's, S. (1998.

J	Gleadow, RM; Narayan, I				Gleadow, Roslyn M.; Narayan, Indira			Temperature thresholds for germination and survival of Pittosporum undulatum: implications for management by fire	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												One consequence of human-induced changes in fire regimes has been the invasion of fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems by weeds from more mesic habitats. In southern Australia, the tree Pittosporum undulaturn Vent. has established in new areas, causing a serious reduction in floristic and structural diversity. Pittosporum undulatum has a high competitive ability and creates an environment that favours its own progeny at the expense of other species, making control difficult. We tested the hypothesis that fire effectively disrupts this invasion cycle by (1) eliminating the soil and canopy seed bank, (2) reducing the competitive ability of adults, and (3) minimising the number of sites favourable to invasion. To test this, the ability of P. undulatum to re-establish after a prescribed burn was estimated in a field study. The field data were then compared with the experimentally determined sensitivity of seeds and seedlings to elevated temperatures. The experimentally determined combination of temperatures and exposure time required for seed mortality (90-120 degrees C, depending on duration) was such that most seed stored in the canopy would be killed by prescribed burning. In addition, 90% of seedlings (ca. 0.4 m tall) were killed when heated to 180 degrees C for S-10 min in the laboratory, consistent with the observed 100% seedling mortality in the burnt plots. Of the adult trees, 20% resprouted within 6 months of the fire. We conclude that the temperatures associated with wildfires are sufficient to act as a circuit breaker on the invasion cycle allowing other control measures, such as poisoning and weeding to be employed to greater effect.

J	Mace, K; Morlon, P; Munier-Jolain, N; Quere, L				Mace, Karen; Morlon, Pierre; Munier-Jolain, Nicolas; Quere, Lionel			Time scales as a factor in decision-making by French farmers on weed management in annual crops	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												The aim of this research was to improve the advice given by extension institutions to French farmers and to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for weed control that would match the practical approach adopted by farmers. Farmers running 15 farms with different farming systems in different regions completed comprehensive interviews which allowed them to explain how they deal with weeds. We built temporal diagrams for crop management sequences and decision making. This paper describes the basic framework common to all the farmers interviewed. Each farmer employed pre-established weed control programmes. When designing these programmes, farmers integrated different time scales: the current year, the rotation, and the long term. In the short term, they considered the risks of yield losses and/or lower harvest quality plus harvesting difficulties. In the medium term, they anticipated the risk of finding a weed species in another crop of the rotation where control would be difficult or costly, weighing the risks of yield loss against the cost and effectiveness of solutions, not only in the current crop but also in subsequent crops, so that once again, the rotation was the central focus of weed control. In the long term, their main aim was to limit the soil seed bank to an acceptable level. The farmers interviewed stated that they would continue to implement a weed control programme that they deemed satisfactory as long as no new problem appeared, and until they could learn about more effective technical solutions. When designing a DSS that will ensure successful, more sustainable weed management practices, it is crucial to take account of both the complexity of the decision-making process and the multicriteria nature of decision making.

J	Gruber, S; Claupein, W				Gruber, Sabine; Claupein, Wilhelm			Fecundity of volunteer oilseed rape and estimation of potential gene dispersal by a practice-related model	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Oilseed rape volunteers were able to flower and to set seed in winter wheat and winter barley. The flowering period of the volunteers coincided with the flowering of related wild species which are potential crossing partners, but there was only a short period of synchrony with the flowering period of the sown oilseed rape. Consequently, cross-pollination of volunteers with wild species and sown oilseed rape can potentially occur, even if the number of fertile hybrid offspring is predicted to be small. The number of seeds/volunteer in cereal crops was about 10% of the usual seed number of sown oilseed rape. There were several factors causing this loss, particularly hares which heavily damaged volunteer oilseed rape in cereals. A maximum of 1 GM seed/m(2) returned to the soil seed bank from oilseed rape volunteers in winter cereals. The seed productivity of oilseed rape volunteers in sown oilseed rape reached 45% of the sown oilseed rape crop. In a low-risk scenario (low volunteer density, low seed persistence), less than 0.1 GM seed/m(2) returned to the soil seed bank. In a high-risk scenario (high volunteer density, high seed persistence), 519 GM seeds set by volunteers would replenish the soil seed bank. As a result of outcrossing an additional 0.4 GM seeds (low-risk: low ourcrossing rate, low seed persistence) or 339 GM seeds (high-risk: high outcrossing rate, high seed persistence) set by conventionally bred oilseed rape would also enter the soil seed bank. The EU legislation limit for defining crop seeds as non-GM of 0.9% GM content, would be exceeded in both scenarios, but the low-risk scenario was only shortly beyond the threshold. The number of seeds entering the soil seed bank in high risk-situations can be reduced by measures to reduce seed persistence, such as delayed post-harvest tillage. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Wallace			Seed banks of an Arizona Pinus ponderosa landscape: responses to environmental gradients and fire cues	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												We measured soil seed banks in 102 plots within a 110 000 ha Arizona Pinus ponderosa landscape, determined seed-bank responses to fire cues and tree canopy types (open or densely treed patches), compared seed-bank composition among ecosystem types, and assessed the utility of seed banks for ecological restoration. Liquid smoke was associated with increased community-level emergence from seed banks in greenhouse experiments, whereas heating to 100 degrees C had minimal effect and charred P. ponderosa wood decreased emergence. We detected 103 species in seed-bank samples and 280 species in aboveground vegetation. Erigeron divergens was the commonest seed-bank species; with the exception of Gnaphalium exil folium, species detected in seed banks also occurred above ground. Although a dry, sandy-textured black-cinder ecosystem exhibited the greatest seed density, seed-bank composition was more ecosystem-specific than was seed density. Native graminoids (e.g., Carex geophila and Muhlenbergia montana) were common in seed banks, whereas perennial forbs were sparse, particularly under dense tree canopies. Our results suggest that (i) smoke may increase emergence from seed banks in these forests, (ii) seed banks can assist establishment of major graminoids but not forbs during ecological restoration, and (iii) seed-bank composition is partly ecosystem-specific across the landscape.																	0045-5067					MAR	2007	37	3					552	567		10.1139/X06-255							WOS:000248083800005

Seed morphology, germination phenology, and capacity to form a seed bank in six herbaceous layer Apiaceae species of the Eastern Deciduous Forest	CASTANEA												We compared seed mass, seed morphology, and long-term germination phenology of three monocarpic (M) and three polycarpic (P) Apiaceae species of the herbaceous layer of the Eastern Deciduous Forest. Seeds (mericarps) of the six species differed considerably in mass, shape, and ornamentation.

Germination peaks occurred in the first or second spring following sowing. Germination of a few seeds was delayed until the sixth year. Regardless of seed mass or morphology, each species has the potential to form a (modified) Type III or (modified) Type IV persistent soil seed bank. Occurrence of a germination peak in the first or in the second year following seed maturity was related to time of dispersal in autumn and to type of seed dormancy.																	0008-7475					MAR	2007	72	1					8	14		10.2179/0008-7475(2007)72[8:SMGPAC]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000245225100002

In this paper, we present a conceptual framework as an attempt to understand how the different environmental factors affect dormancy in weed seed banks in soil. We also present examples showing how these concepts could be used to develop quantitative models to predict dormancy loss in summer annual weed species and discuss how predictions derived from these models could be used to maximise the effect of weed control techniques.

Spatially variable patterns of wild oat emergence in eastern Washington	CROP PROTECTION					4th International Weed Science Congress	JUN, 2004	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA					Wild oat is one of the most economically important and widely distributed weed species in eastern Washington. The timing of wild oat control in this region is affected by the extreme topographical diversity. The objective of this research was to assess the influence of landscape diversity on the pattern of wild oat emergence. Wild oat emergence was monitored at five landscape positions along a north/south transect. The timing of emergence across the landscape tended to follow the distribution of solar radiation, such that wild oats emerged earlier at landscape positions with greater solar radiation and thus, higher soil temperatures. The time to reach 25% of maximum emergence was reached on average 17 days earlier at south-compared to north-facing landscape positions. This difference was maintained over the course of the emergence period. These results show that site properties, such as slope, aspect, and elevation, affect the thermal and hydric conditions in the soil seed bank and can cause site-specific patterns of wild oat emergence.

The role of biological control in managing parasitic weeds	CROP PROTECTION					4th International Weed Science Congress	JUN, 2004	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA					In contrast to normal weeds, parasitic plants inflict fitness costs by withdrawing water, minerals, and photosynthates from the host. Host-derived material is mainly transferred through straw-like intrusions into the host's vascular tissue. Theoretically, resources are unlimited for parasitic weeds unless the host is killed. Frequent occurrence of host crops in agro-ecosystems results in favourable reproduction conditions for parasitic angiosperms, which makes them competitive species. Since parasitic weeds have similar nutritional requirements as their hosts, the damage inflicted by a parasitic plant is often directly proportional to its biomass. Agriculturally important genera are Cuscuta, Alectra, Orobanche, and Striga attacking principal crops like cereals, legumes, and vegetables. Cuscuta species occur nearly worldwide, while the geographical distribution of the economically important species of Alectra and Striga is centred in Africa, but they also occur in parts of India and China. Crop damaging Orobanche species are found in the Mediterranean region, in South and East Europe, and West Asia. Both Orobanche and Striga are likely to spread with host distribution, density, and climatic change. Contrary to normal weeds, most of the damage to the host is done before the parasitic weed emerges above the soil. Therefore, control methods should focus on reducing soil seed bank and interfere with the parasite's early developmental stages. Because of the close interconnection between the parasitic weed and its host, herbicidal control is difficult since herbicides cannot selectively distinguish between the species. The high specificity of many organisms (fungi, bacteria, arthropods), feeding exclusively on selected hosts, in our case parasitic weeds, can be considered an advantage because these organisms may work as biocontrol agents where other weed control options have failed.

Integrated approaches to managing weeds in spring-sown crops in western Canada	CROP PROTECTION					4th International Weed Science Congress	JUN, 2004	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA					In western Canada, the move to integrated weed management (IWM) with reduced dependence on herbicides is being driven by low crop prices, weed resistance to herbicides, and environmental concerns. A rational step when implementing IWN is to determine if herbicide application is required in the first place. Crop yield loss models have been developed to assist with this decision. However, the weed economic threshold will be influenced considerably by management practices. Field studies showed that enhancing crop competitiveness through planting competitive varieties at relatively high seeding rates and through strategic fertilizer placement including sub-surface banded or point-injected nitrogen can reduce the impact of weeds on crop yield and the amount of weed seed entering the soil seed bank. Enhancing crop competitiveness also improved herbicide performance, especially when herbicides were applied at reduced doses. The inclusion of an early-cut silage crop in a rotation dramatically reduced wild oat (Avena fatua L.) populations in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) while growing sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis ( L.) Lam) as a green manure in rotation with cereal and oilseed crops showed tremendous potential to suppress weeds. Other studies demonstrated that weed management should not be considered in isolation since it can influence the severity of alternative pests, for example, damage due to Delia spp. in canola (Brassica napus L.). Further studies are required to examine the cumulative long-term effects of integrating the various weed management practices on all components of the crop ecosystem including weeds, diseases and insects.

C. Gregory et Valls is endemic in the West-central region of Brazil, occurring in areas endangered by human actions. The establishment of in vitro preservation methods for wild species of Arachis is an alternative to seed banks for germplasm storage, multiplication and distribution. The risk of genetic changes induced by tissue culture and the monitoring of the genetic stability of the biological material before, during and after storage must be considered in the context of conservation. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting were used to evaluate the genetic stability of in vitro plants originated from cotyledons and embryo axes of A. retusa. Cotyledons originated shoots through direct organogenesis and embryo axes displayed multishoot formation induced by 110 mmol/L and 8.8 mmol/L BAP, respectively. Ninety genomic regions (loci) generated from RAPD and 372 from AFLP analyses were evaluated. All amplified fragments detected by both techniques in plants derived from the two explant types were monomorphic. The results indicate that the recovered shoots are genetically stable at the assessed genomic regions.

J	Syphard, AD; Clarke, KC; Franklin, J				Syphard, Alexandra D.; Clarke, Keith C.; Franklin, Janet			Simulating fire frequency and urban growth in southern California coastal shrublands, USA	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Fire is an important natural disturbance in the Mediterranean-climate coastal shrublands of southern California. However, anthropogenic ignitions have increased fire frequency to the point that it threatens the persistence of some shrub species and favors the expansion of exotic annual grasses. Because human settlement is a primary driver of increased ignitions, we integrated a landscape model of disturbance and succession (LANDIS) with an urban growth model (UGM) to simulate the combined effects of urban development and high fire frequency on the distribution of coastal shrublands. We tested whether urban development would contribute to an expansion of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and/or change in average fire return intervals and compared the relative impacts of direct habitat loss and altered fire regimes on functional vegetation types. We also evaluated two methods of integrating the simulation models. The development pattern predicted by the UGM was predominantly aggregated, which minimized the expansion of the WUI and increase in fire frequency, suggesting that fire risk may be higher at intermediate levels of urbanization due to the spatial arrangement of ignition sources and fuel. The comparison of model coupling methods illustrated how cumulative effects of repeated fires may occur gradually as urban development expands across the landscape. Coastal sage scrub species and resprouting chaparral were more susceptible to direct habitat loss, but increased fire frequency was more of a concern to obligate seeder species that germinate from a persistent seed bank. Simulating different scenarios of fire frequency and urban growth within one modeling framework can help managers locate areas of highest risk and determine which vegetation types are most vulnerable to direct habitat loss, altered fire regimes, or both.

J	Myster, RW				Myster, Randall W.			Early successional pattern and process after sugarcane, banana, and pasture cultivation in Ecuador	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Six large permanent vegetation plots, located at the Maquipucuna Reserve near Quito, Ecuador, were sampled annually for the first five years after abandonment. In addition, seed rain and seed bank were collected and other seeds and seedlings were set out in these same sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) plantations, banana (Musa sp.) plantations, and pastures (planted in Setaria sphacelata). All three field-types were dominated by their resident main species which continued to dominate in the pastures after five years. For banana and sugarcane fields, ferns were a significant part of the plant cover, and in all fields, woody plant cover increased slowly and monotonically. Sugarcane had the most complex fields with higher total cover, species richness, total stems, and stem height than both banana and pasture. Total basal area, however, was similar between sugarcane and banana. Sugarcane fields had twice the number of dispersed seeds as banana fields and 20 times the number of dispersed seeds as pastures. The number of seeds in the seed bank was low everywhere, and there were several species that were found both in the seed rain and the seed bank among field-types. Most tree seeds were lost to predation, and more seeds were lost to fungus in sugarcane fields than in other fields. All planted tree seedlings died in the pasture, but there was 25% survival in banana fields and 15% survival in sugarcane fields. In summary, vegetation pattern differed greatly among the three field types, and successional mechanisms responded differently depending on the tree seed and seedling species and on field type. In general, pasture results were most unique compared with those in sugarcane and banana fields.																	0028-825X					MAR	2007	45	1					101	110									WOS:000246252500008

Variation in Capsella (shepherd's purse): an example of intraspecific functional diversity	PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM												The extent of functional trait diversity is quantified for 157 different Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) medic (shepherd's purse) accessions. These individuals encompass replicate progeny generated from seed of 53 different Capsella maternal lines' that were isolated at random as they emerged from soil cores (used to estimate baseline seed bank numbers and weed diversity) at 34 different arable sites across the United Kingdom. The replicate progeny were subject to ex situ characterisation for traits determining life history and architecture. Seven leaf-type classes were identified and representative parents of each leaf type were distinguishable using four different simple sequence repeat markers. Life-history traits were only loosely associated with leaf shape, and cluster analysis grouped the accessions into three broad types: small plants that flowered early with intermediate reproductive output; large plants, with intermediate time to flowering and a high reproductive output; late-flowering plants, of intermediate size and low reproductive output. The most common leaf-type variants (83% of accessions) demonstrated a short time to flowering (ca. 70 days), while rarer variants included those that flowered after 140 days, accumulated more nitrogen and produced less seed: possibly representing advantageous and disadvantageous traits (respectively), in modern arable rotations. A wide trait variation was therefore found in Capsella bursa-pastoris despite decades of agricultural intensification, the range of time to-flowering for C. bursa-pastoris being as broad the mean flowering times of the commoner annual and winter annual arable species. We propose the use of traits, rather than species, as the accounting unit to quantify functional biodiversity in arable systems.

Seed germination in a narrow endemic species (Telekia speciosissima, Asteraceae): Implications for ex situ conservation	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Telekia speciosissima is an endemic chasmophyte of limestone and dolomite boulders in the Lombardy Prealps. It is included in the Italian Red List as a low-risk species. Seed germination dynamics of this plant were studied with the aim of producing germination protocols to use in ex situ conservation and recovery projects. Cold stratification and light requirements were investigated as potential factors improving seed germination. Seed samples were therefore stratified at 6 - 10 degrees C during 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 180 days and then tested at higher temperature in continuous darkness or in a light/dark regime. Germination tests showed that seed dormancy was broken by cold stratification, while light promoted germination itself. These two factors strongly influenced germination dynamics and parameters. The highest germination percentage (91.8%) was attained after 90 days of cold stratification before testing seeds in light condition. However, a decrease in germination percentages occurred after a stratification of 150 days. An interpretation of these results is given according to the biological and ecological characters of the species, especially with respect to the need for establishing a transient seed bank.

J	Kiehl, K; Pfadenhauer, J				Kiehl, Kathrin; Pfadenhauer, Joerg			Establishment and persistence of target species in newly created calcareous grasslands on former arable fields	PLANT ECOLOGY												The effects of different restoration measures and management variants on the vegetation development of newly created calcareous grasslands were studied in southern Germany from 1993 to 2002. In 1993, fresh seed-containing hay from a nature reserve with ancient calcareous grasslands was transferred onto ex-arable fields with and without topsoil removal. Nine years after start of the restoration, the standing crop was lower and the cover of bare soil was higher on topsoil-removal sites than on sites without soil removal. Topsoil removal had a positive effect on the proportion of target species (class Festuco-Brometea), because the number and cover of productive meadow species (class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea) were reduced. Persistence of hay-transfer species and the number of newly colonizing target species were highest on topsoil-removal sites. On plots with and without soil removal, species richness and the number of target species increased quickly after hay transfer and were always higher on hay-transfer plots than on plots that had not received hay in 1993. In 2002, differences induced by hay transfer were still much more pronounced than differences between management regimes. Management by mowing, however, led to higher species richness, a greater number of target species and a lower number of ruderals in comparison to no management on restoration fields without soil removal. A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indicated that vegetation composition of the hay-transfer plots of the restoration fields still differed from the vegetation of ancient grasslands in the nature reserve. Vegetation of an ex-arable field in the nature reserve (last ploughed in 1959) showed an intermediate successional stage. In general our results indicate that the transfer of autochthonous hay is an efficient method for the restoration of species-rich vegetation, which allows not only quick establishment but also long-term persistence of target species.																	1385-0237					MAR	2007	189	1					31	48		10.1007/s11258-006-9164-x							WOS:000244187800003

This study examined patterns of the seed bank along a water depth gradient in three vegetation types (submerged zone, floating-leaved zone, and emergent zone) of a subtropical lakeshore marsh, Longgan Lake, China. Submerged zone is the deepest water and never exposed its soil to air, and was dominant by submerged species; floating-leaved zone is waterlogged soil even during drawdown and was dominant by Nelumbo nucifera; emergent zone is rarely exceeded 1 m water depth during the wet season (summer and autumn), and the marsh soil was usually exposed to air during drawdown (winter and spring), and is dominant by Zizania latifolia, Polygonum hydropiper and Scirpus yagara. It was found that many species were ubiquitous in the seed bank. Frequency of distribution and densities of the dominant species, however, varied significantly from zone to zone. A total of 22 species was recorded in submerged zone, 20 in floating-leaved zone, and 29 in emergent zone. Germinated seedling density was 1,580, 8,994 and 20,424 seedlings m(2) in submerged zone, floating-leaved zone, and emergent zone, respectively. Submerged and floating-leaved species were significantly abundant in the submerged zone, while the emergent species were found predominantly in the emergent zone. A fern species, Ceratopsis pterioides, was the most abundant seedling in seed banks from all three zones. A TWINSPAN dendrogram and CCA ordination diagram clearly showed separation of species among sites with the emergent zone being well separated from the submerged zone and floating-leaved zone, thus revealing marked zonal patterns in species distributions in the seed bank. This pattern of zonation reflected the pattern in the standing vegetation.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				MAR	2007	189	1					127	137		10.1007/s11258-006-9170-z							WOS:000244187800010

Part II: Topsoiling, species selection, and hydroseeding	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Erosion is one of the main problems in roadfill restoration. Revegetation is widely used as a method to reduce erosion rates, and it is often carried out through hydroseeding. In semiarid Mediterranean conditions, this approach to revegetation often produces poor results due to climatic limitations. We evaluated whether (1) spreading topsoil and (2) hydroseeding with local rather than commercial species mixtures could improve the vegetative cover of roadfills. The study was carried out in 24 plots over a 20-month period. At the end of the study, vegetation cover was higher in topsoiled plots (38.8%) than in nontopsoiled plots (21.5%). Locally selected species produced higher vegetative cover (61.1%) than did standard commercial species (52.2%). After 20 months, the erosion index was not different among any treatment probably due to the low sensitivity of this variable. These results suggest that amendment of soils through the addition of topsoil is an important technique in roadfill revegetation in Mediterranean environments. Additionally, hydroseeding with local species will produce better vegetative cover on roadfills than does hydroseeding with available commercial species.

Temporal responses of propagule banks during ecological restoration in the United Kingdom	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Successful ecological restoration is expected to be accompanied by change in the propagule bank. We tested for temporal change in the soil propagule bank at two Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum)-infested sites in the United Kingdom (acid grassland and heathland), each with replicate experiments. A combination of bracken control (cutting, spraying, and combinations) and vegetation restoration treatments (seeding, fertilizer, harrowing) were applied. Soil propagule banks were sampled in 1998, 4-5 years after the start, and in 2003 after a further 5 years. We used univariate and multivariate statistical methods to investigate the response of the propagule bank to experimental treatment in space and time. Few effects were found in 1998, but after a further 5 years, the propagule bank size and composition changed significantly, implying that propagule bank development lags behind vegetation development. The effect of treatment on the propagule bank differed within sites. Thus, ecosystem development is occurring at different speeds and directions even in closely adjacent areas. Coupling between the propagule bank and vegetation changed between sampling times with either some new coupling or decoupling. At both sites, the propagule bank contained propagules of the target community and thus propagule bank development during restoration provides increased potential for vegetation recovery. However, it can take a considerable time for management effects to be detected in the propagule bank. Moreover, the effect or speed of effect is spatially variable. Continuing application of restoration treatments is recommended at heathland where there is a deep bracken litter layer.

An alternative reforestation technique using pioneer shrubs as nurse-plants for Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata was tested in exclosures in northern Ethiopia. Seedlings were planted in three different microhabitats, and their survival was monitored. The microhabitats were bare soil patches between shrubs, patches under the dominant shrub Acacia etbaica, and patches under Euclea racemosa, an evergreen shrub, which supports the majority of naturally established Olea recruits. The ability of shrubs to offer protection against browsing goats was tested experimentally. Controlled shading was used to determine whether solar irradiation causes seedling mortality in environments without water stress. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA), and one-way ANOVA. Olea survival was significantly higher and shoot damage by goats was lower when planted under shrub cover compared to bare soil patches, particularly under Euclea canopies, although high shade levels reduced seedling performance. Reduction of solar radiation by shrub canopies and thus control of soil-water evaporation and seedling transpiration most likely controlled the observed facilitation. Planting under shrubs may increase seedling survival and assist regeneration of dry Afromontane vegetation. Preserving pioneers also reduces soil erosion and conserves biodiversity. Excluding livestock is essential for Olea woodland restoration and allows persistent but morphologically modified Olea shrubs to develop vigorous regrowth. Facilitative processes are guiding principles for assisted forest restoration, but above-average rains may be critical to restore higher biomass levels in semiarid areas.

J	Davis, AS				Davis, Adam S.			Nitrogen fertilizer and crop residue effects on seed mortality and germination of eight annual weed species	WEED SCIENCE												Weed seed persistence in the soil seedbank is central to weed population dynamics; however, limited knowledge of mechanisms regulating seed survival in soil remains an obstacle to developing seed-bank management practices. Weed seeds are rich in carbon and nitrogen, and therefore may represent an important nutritional resource to soil microbes. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that weed seed mortality due to microbial predation is limited by soil inorganic N availability and soil C:N ratio. A factorial of N fertilizer rate (0, 14, and 28 mg N kg soil(-1)) and corn stover addition rate (0 and 3,000 mg stover kg soil(-1)) was applied to bioassay units containing Illinois field soil (silt loam, 3.8% organic carbon) and seeds of one of eight annual weed species common to Illinois field crops: giant foxtail, green foxtaill yellow foxtail, wooly cupgrass, giant ragweed, redroot pigweed, velvetleaf, and Venice mallow. Seeds were incubated for 2 mo, after which they were recovered from the soil and tested for viability. Only three of the eight species, velvetleaf, giant ragweed, and wooly cupgrass, responded to the experimental treatments. Velvetleaf seed mortality was 40% lower in the corn stover-amended treatment than in the unamended treatment. Both giant ragweed and wooly cupgrass showed a more complex interaction between N fertilizer and corn stover treatments. Path analysis supported the hypothesis that the influence of soil N on seed mortality in velvetleaf was because of the direct effect of soil N on microbial predation of velvetleaf seeds, whereas for giant ragweed and wooly cupgrass, the effect on seed mortality appeared to be mediated through soil N effects oil germination. Mechanisms underlying soil N fertility effects on weed seed mortality appear to be species-specific. Future investigations of this phenomenon should include quantitative measures of seed coat composition and quality.

Lawrence			Bet hedging via seed banking in desert evening primroses (Oenothera, Onagraceae): Demographic evidence from natural populations	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Bet hedging is one solution to the problem of an unpredictably variable environment: fitness in the average environment is sacrificed in favor of lower variation in fitness if this leads to higher long-run stochastic mean fitness. While bet hedging is an important concept in evolutionary ecology, empirical evidence that it occurs is scant. Here we evaluate whether bet hedging occurs via seed banking in natural populations of two species of desert evening primroses (Oenothera, Onagraceae), one annual and one perennial. Four years of data on plants and 3 years of data on seeds yielded two transitions for the entire life cycle. One year was exceptionally dry, leading to reproductive failure in the sample areas, and the other was above average in precipitation, leading to reproductive success in four of five populations. Stochastic simulations of population growth revealed patterns indicative of bet hedging via seed banking, particularly in the annual populations: variance in fitness and fitness in the average environment were lower with seed banking than without, whereas long-run stochastic mean fitness was higher with seed banking than without across a wide range of probabilities of the wet year. This represents a novel, unusually rigorous demonstration of bet hedging from field data.

Eight treatments consisting of combinations of peat moss, seeding, fertilizer, snow fencing, and microrelief alteration were installed to improve the growth conditions on three gravel pits and two gravel pads ranging from predominantly tundra to predominantly boreal forest ecosystems. Plant-related assessments of the treatments (density, frequency, and cover) were made after the first and second growing seasons. Twenty-six species of plants were considered to be successful colonizers by at least one of the following criteria: > 2% cover, > 20% frequency, or > 10 stems m(-2). Androsace septentrionalis L., Carex L. spp., and Dryas integrifolia Vah1 were the only taxa to meet all three criteria in both years. Differences related to the sites (i.e., seed bank, seed source, and substrate conditions) were greater than treatment differences. At three of the sites, seeded treatments had significantly more seedlings than the non-seeded treatments. These three sites were species-poor prior to revegetation testing and were dominated by the seeded species. The other two sites were dominated by species from the seed bank or from seed rain. Total seedling density on seeded plots increased by 17% compared to the controls while cover did not increase appreciably in the short term. Six native species were tested and three (Anemone multifida Poir., Hedysarum mackenzei Richards., and Linum leivisii Pursh) considered suitable for future use, adding to those tested by Firlotte (1998) in the Churchill region. It was determined that seed bank and potential for seed rain had a major influence on the success of seeding as opposed to substrate improvements alone.																	1523-0430					FEB	2007	39	1					16	24		10.1657/1523-0430(2007)39[16:SRPOGH]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000244658600004

Seed banks in plant conservation: Case study of Santa Cruz tarplant restoration	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Although conservation and restoration practitioners have focused on maximizing above-ground population size and seed set of rare plants, a clear understanding of seed bank dynamics is crucial to managing these species. Santa Cruz tarplant (Holocarpha macradenia) is a threatened annual forb restricted to coastal prairie habitats in central California. Holocarpha produces disk achenes germinating within a year of production and ray achenes forming a persistent seed bank. We constructed both deterministic and stochastic demographic models for a restored Holocarpha population, using demographic rates measured separately for unmanipulated plants and plants growing in plots where vegetation was clipped. The deterministic models indicated that regardless of germination from the seed bank, the population would decline without clipping or similar treatments that enhance survival and reproductive output. Deterministic models showed only a slight positive effect of increased ray seed germination rates on population growth, which would need to be balanced against a potential loss of buffering against environmental variation as the dormant seed bank was reduced. Our stochastic simulations suggested that extinction risk for Holocarpha populations would be minimized by intermediate levels of ray seed germination. Thus, managers should focus on improving the performance of aboveground plants before considering actions to stimulate germination, since the former will yield a greater increase in deterministic population growth and not sacrifice any buffering effect of the seed bank. This case study emphasizes the importance of considering dormant seeds and seed banks in designing successful restoration and management strategies for plant species at risk of extinction.

Derivation and characterization of cholesterol-independent non-GS NS0 cell lines for production of recombinant antibodies	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING												Presented is an antibody production platform based on the fed-batch culture of recombinant NSO-derived cell lines. NSO host cells, obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, UK, Part No. 85110503), were first adapted to grow in a protein-free; cholesterol-free medium. The resulting host cell line was designated NS0-PFCF (protein-free, cholesterol-free). The five production cell lines presented here were generated using a common protocol consisting of transfection by electroporation and subcloning. The NS0-PFCF host cell line was transfected using a single expression vector contain ing the Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (gpt), and the antibody heavy and light chain genes driven by the CMV promoter. The five cell lines were chosen after one to three rounds of iterative subclon ing, which resulted in a 19-64% increase in antibody productivity when four mother-daughter cell pairs were cultured in a fed-batch bioreactor process. The production cell lines were genetically characterized to determine antibody gene integrity, nucleotide sequences, copy number, and the number of insertion sites in the NS0 cell genome. Genetic characterization data indicate that each of the five production cell lines, has a single stably integrated copy of the antibody expression vector, and that the antibody genes are correctly expressed. Stability of antibody production was evaluated for three of the five cell lines by comparing the early stage seed bank with the Working Cell Bank (WCB). Antibody productivity was shown to be stable in two of three cell lines evaluated; while one of the cell lines exhibited a 20% drop in productivity after passaging for approximately 4 weeks. These five NSO-derived production cell lines were successfully cultured to produce antibodies with acceptable product quality attributes in a standardized fed-batch bior- eactor process, consistently achieving an average specific productivity of 20-60 pg/cell-day, and a volumetric productivity exceeding 120. mg/L-day (Burky et al., 2006),. In contrast to the commonly available NSO host cell line, which requires serum and cholesterol for growth; and the commonly used expression vector system, which uses a proprietary glutamine synthetase selection marker (GS-NSO), these NSO cells are cholesterol-independent, grow well in a protein-free medium, use a non-proprietary selection marker, and do not require gene amplification for productivity improvement: These characteristics are advantageous for use of this NSO cell line platform for manufacturing therapeutic antibodies.																	0006-3592					FEB 1	2007	96	2					294	306		10.1002/bit.21099							WOS:000243449100010	16897745

To estimate the potential of soil seed banks for genetic restoration of the species, we used 10 microsatellite markers to analyze the genetic variation in adults and in seedlings that emerged from soil seed banks. About 187 leaf samples from the cultured stocks that were collected in 17 adult subpopulations in 1995 and 2000 and from three subpopulations that were newly discovered in 2002 were analyzed. As a result, only 18 genets could be identified, suggesting that clonal diversity of the adult population had already become extremely low. Genetic tests were performed on 430 seedlings from seed banks at six locations of natural lakeshores and three of the restoration sites that were artificially constructed in an attempt to assign them to the remnant adult population; many of the seedlings showed genetic variation different from the adults. Furthermore, the seedlings preserved seven alleles that had been lost from remnant adults. However, they had lower average numbers of alleles and heterozygosity levels (NA = 1.5-3.1, H (E) = 0.146-0.487) than the remnant adults (NA = 3.5, H (E) = 0.539) and showed high inbreeding coefficients, suggesting that the seed banks were produced by inbreeding. Thus, although the seed banks had a certain potential to restore genetic diversity, the fitness reduction in seed banks caused by inbreeding could affect the success of restoration based on seed banks.

J	Morzaria-Luna, HN; Zedler, JB				Morzaria-Luna, Hem Nalini; Zedler, Joy B.			Does seed availability limit plant establishment during salt marsh restoration?	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Patterns of seed dispersal and seed bank accumulation need to be known to predict the species that will recruit into restoration sites versus those that must be introduced. We assessed the temporal and spatial patterns of seed availability and seed accumulation on the salt marsh plain of an 8-ha restoration site, based on seedlings that emerged from tidal material, wrack, rabbit pellets, and soil samples (in controlled experiments). We compared results from the first 3 yr of restoration (2000-2002) with results from a 5-yr-old restoration and an extant marsh, all within Tijuana Estuary, California. Seed dispersal was limited for most marsh plain species. Tidal dispersal occurred mainly in winter; seedling density and richness were highest with high spring tides and after fruiting of the dominant species, Sarcocornia pacifica (> 90% of emergent seedlings). S. pacifica was also common in the seedlings that emerged from soil seed banks (up to 63%) and wrack (60%), while other species common in the vegetation were present at much lower densities. Seed bank accumulation in restored sites was low and few species were abundant. Seedlings that emerged from soil samples from the youngest restoration were mostly invasive exotics (64%), those of the 5-yr restoration were mostly S. pacifica (63%), and those from the nearby extant marsh were mostly Triglochin concinna (70%), despite more diverse vegetation. No salt marsh seedlings emerged from rabbit pellets; all were invasives (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum and Carpobrotus edulis). Emerging seedlings were much sparser in soil from the younger restoration than from the 5-yr restoration and the extant site (32.9 +/- 5.7 < 4642.2 +/- 1131.5 and 4689.3 +/- 359.3 seedlings m(-2), respectively). Because dispersal is limited for most species, restoring diverse vegetation will require seeding or planting. Natural recruitment could be facilitated by completing restoration by early winter, when seeds of native plants have maximum tidal dispersal.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				FEB	2007	30	1					12	25		10.1007/BF02782963							WOS:000245134200003						
J	Yu, SL; Sternberg, M; Kutiel, P; Chen, HW				Yu, Shunli; Sternberg, Marcelo; Kutiel, Pua; Chen, Hongwei			Seed mass, shape, and persistence in the soil seed bank of Israeli coastal sand dune flora	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: Are seed mass and shape related to persistence in the soil seed bank among 54 species of the Israeli flora? Search method: Persistence was determined by soil seed bank investigations in which the fraction of non-germinated viable seeds was regarded as the persistent soil seed bank. When seedling emergence had ceased but before new seeds were shed, all soil from the upper 5 cm of 120 quadrats was removed to the laboratory. At that time, the seeds sampled were those from previous seed rains. Data description: Plant species with persistent and transient seeds were widely scattered across the range of seed mass or dimension and variances. A significant relationship was found between seed mass (or dimension) and seed persistence with persistent seeds tending to have larger mass. However, no significant relationship was found between seed shape and seed persistence. Species with persistent seeds had significantly higher seed mass than those with transient seeds (one-tailed t-test = 1.68, n = 48, P = 0.007), but there was no significant difference in shape between them (one-tailed t-test = 1.68, n = 48, P = 0.076; t-test = 1.68, n = 45, P = 0.124). Species with persistent seeds yielded significantly higher seed dimensions than those with transient seeds (one-tailed t-test = 1.95, n = 48, P = 0.029). In this study, there was no threshold in seed mass (or dimension) and shape that distinguished transient from persistent seeds. Conclusions: Species with persistent seeds have significantly larger seeds than species with transient seeds. However, species with small and/or round persistent seeds were relatively common. The underlying mechanism proposed for the observed pattern is a high proportion of large-seeded, persistent species with hard seed coat dormancy and abundant litter on the surface of the soil. Data from all eight floras studied to date suggest that significant differences in climate may determine diverse patterns in the relationships between seed mass and shape and persistence. Small and compact seeds are likely to occur in soil seed banks in humid climates, whereas large-seeded species with persistent seed banks are more likely to be abundant in arid climates. In addition, the importance of the spatial scale of investigations (or the range of habitats) is emphasized for studying the relationships between seed mass and shape and persistence.																	1522-0613					FEB	2007	9	2					325	340									WOS:000245084600008						
J	Dostal, P				Dostal, P.			Population dynamics of annuals in perennial grassland controlled by ants and environmental stochasticity	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: In a system of five annual plant species restricted to nest-mounds of the ant Lasius flavus in a perennial grassland: 1. Are the population dynamics influenced by ant disturbance? 2. Is the survival of the annuals at the scale of the whole grassland possible under the observed conditions of disturbance dynamics? 3. Which phases in the annuals' life cycle and patch types contribute most to population growth? Location: Borec hill, northern Czechia, 50 degrees 31' N, 13 degrees 59' E, 446 m a.s.l. Methods: Local population dynamics of the annuals were analysed separately for five patch types that differed in the proportion of bare soil. Vitality rates were assessed directly in the field, but also in a garden experiment, during 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Population dynamics at the scale of the whole grassland was analysed with a megamatrix approach, combining patch dynamics of the nest-mounds with patch-specific population dynamics. Contributions of different phases and patch types to growth rate were estimated by elasticity analysis. Results: Nest-mounds differed in the percentage of bare soil. Increasing moss cover significantly reduced germination and seed production of all studied annuals and decreased their population growth rates (lambda). Although successional processes dominated over ant disturbance, populations of all species could survive well (lambda >> 1) in the grassland according to the 2000-2001 megamatrix dynamics. Based on the dynamics from the following period, two species would not survive in a long-term perspective due to random environmental variation. Whereas the A-A transition (adult plants originating from adults of the previous year) had the highest elasticity under open conditions and 'good period' demography, the importance of persistent seeds increased under reverse conditions. This, however, differed among species. Conclusions: Ant-disturbance was shown to be critical for the population survival of five annual species in the studied grassland. The fate of the annual populations in the grassland system also depends on random environmental variation, which may override the effect of ant activity.

J	Azcarate, FM; Peco, B				Azcarate, F. M.; Peco, Begona			Harvester ants (Messor barbarus) as disturbance agents in Mediterranean grasslands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: 1. Do disturbances by harvester ants (Messor barbarus L.) affect soil properties? 2. Do they alter seed distribution? 3. Do they show a different species composition? 4 Are these changes related to seed size (length and weight)? Location: Mediterranean grasslands in central Spain, near Madrid. Methods: We recorded autumn seed banks and spring vegetation in middens, trunk trails and controls. Soil properties were also measured in middens and controls. The effect of seed weight and length was analysed after transforming data into phylogenetically independent contrasts. Results: Soil under middens is more silty and higher in potassium, organic matter and pH. Seed density and seed bank species richness increased greatly in middens, while vegetation species richness was significantly lower in comparison to control samples. Abundance changes in this disturbance type were positively correlated with seed weight, both in seed bank and vegetation. In contrast, we only detected a slight increase in bare ground on foraging trunk trails, with no clear effects on seed bank and vegetation composition. Conclusions: Midden development is a mechanism that generates heterogeneity which favours the survival of certain large-seeded species mainly predated by ants in Mediterranean grasslands. This effect may partially neutralize the dominance of small seeded species expected from the seed predation process.

J	Robertson, HA; James, KR				Robertson, Hugh A.; James, Kimberley R.			Plant establishment from the seed bank of a degraded floodplain wetland: a comparison of two alternative management scenarios	PLANT ECOLOGY												There has been little research examining the soil seed banks of degraded floodplain wetlands and their contribution to wetland rehabilitation in Australia. Our aim was to assess the establishment of plants from the seed bank that may occur following the delivery of an environmental water allocation to Kanyapella Basin, a 2950 ha wetland located on the floodplain of the Goulburn and Murray Rivers in northern Victoria, Australia. Two hypothetical water regimes were investigated (flooded and dry) in a glasshouse experiment, where plants were left to establish from the seed bank over a period of 124 days. Differences in the establishment of plants from the seed bank indicated that the return of a flooding regime is likely to have a significant effect on the composition of the wetland vegetation. Mapping of the distribution of plant species indicated that propagules were highly dispersed across the wetland for the majority of taxa, in contrast to the localised distribution of many of the plant species represented in the extant vegetation. Inundation favoured the establishment of native wetland and floodplain plants, although many areas of Kanyapella Basin that are currently 'weed-free' have the potential to become colonised and potentially dominated by introduced plants if the wetland is not managed appropriately. Overall, results supported the aim of management to reestablish a wetting and drying regime through use of an environmental water allocation. This study presents a significant example of the application of seed bank investigations in wetland ecology and management.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				FEB	2007	188	2					145	164		10.1007/s11258-006-9153-0							WOS:000243399000003						
J	Porter, JL; Kingsford, RT; Brock, MA				Porter, John L.; Kingsford, Richard T.; Brock, Margaret A.			Seed banks in arid wetlands with contrasting flooding, salinity and turbidity regimes	PLANT ECOLOGY												Aquatic plant communities in arid zone wetlands underpin diverse fauna populations and ecosystem functions yet are relatively poorly known. Erratic flooding, drying, salinity and turbidity regimes contribute to habitat complexity, creating high spatial and temporal variability that supports high biodiversity. We compared seed bank density, species richness and community composition of aquatic plants (submergent, floating-leaved and emergent) among nine Australian arid zone wetlands. Germinable seed banks from wetlands within the Paroo and Bulloo River catchments were examined at nested scales (site, wetland, wetland type) using natural flooding and salinity regimes as factors with nondormant seed density and species richness as response variables. Salinity explained most of the variance in seed density (95%) and species richness (68%), with flooding accounting for 5% of variance in seed density and 32% in species richness. Salinity-flooding interactions were significant but explained only a trivial portion of the variance (< 1%). Mean seed densities in wetlands ranged from 40 to 18,760 m(-2) and were highest in wetlands with intermediate levels of salinity and flooding. Variability of densities was high (CVs 0.61-2.66), particularly in saline temporary and fresh permanent wetlands. Below salinities of c. 30 g l(-1) TDS, seed density was negatively correlated to turbidity and connectivity. Total species richness of wetlands (6-27) was negatively correlated to salinity, pH and riverine connectivity. A total of 40 species germinated, comprising submergent (15 species), floating-leaved or amphibious (17 species), emergent (6 species) and terrestrial (6 species) groups. Charophytes were particularly important with 10 species (five Chara spp., four Nitella spp. and Lamprothamnium macropogon), accounting for 68% of total abundance. Saline temporary wetlands were dominated by Ruppia tuberosa, Lamprothamnium macropogon and Lepilaena preissii. Variable flooding and drying regimes profoundly altered water quality including salinity and turbidity, producing distinctive aquatic plant communities as reflected by their seed banks. This reinforces the importance of hydrology in shaping aquatic biological communities in arid systems.

Field weed population dynamics: a review of model approaches and applications	WEED RESEARCH												Mathematical modelling is a commonly used tool for studying the long-term dynamics of weed populations in agriculture. This was reflected in our review by the large number of scientific papers (134 original publications) and the continuing need to gain an overview over this fast developing field (20 previous review papers were found). In this article, we provide a more comprehensive review than earlier seen, striving to include all relevant publications. Thus, we cover models of the population dynamics of 60 weed species in 40 crops. An online, accompanying database provides an indexed bibliography. Despite the large variation in crops, weeds and geography, the models were surprisingly similar in their approach: structured around the weed life cycle, excluding environmental factors and giving little attention to validation or even documentation of model construction. In addition, their application was similar, limited mostly to strategic decision making. We hope that the overview provided by this review will inspire weed modellers and that it will serve as a basis for discussion and as a frame of reference when we proceed to advance the modelling of weed populations to a new level, developing new approaches and tackling new application domains.

J	Glasgow, LS; Matlack, GR				Glasgow, Lance S.; Matlack, Glenn R.			Prescribed burning and understory composition in a temperate deciduous forest, Ohio, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Since the advent of widespread suppression in the mid-20th century, fire has been relatively rare in deciduous forests of the eastern United States. However, widespread prescribed burning has recently been proposed as a management tool to favor oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration. To examine the potential effects of fire introduction on the understory community, we experimentally burned small plots and simulated aspects of fire at a forested site in southeastern Ohio. Treatments included two burn intensities, litter removal, increased soil pH, and a control. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in two landscape positions (dry upland and moist lowland) and two canopy conditions (gap, no gap). Post-fire vegetation was identified to species, and stems were counted 1, 3, and 14 months after burning. Community composition was more strongly affected by fire in upland plots than in lowlands, but was not affected by canopy openness. Both cool and hot bums reduced post-fire seedling emergence of Acer rubrum, a common overstory tree. Hot burns facilitated germination of Vitis spp., Rhus glabra, and Phytolacca americana, species common in disturbed habitats, and increased graminoid abundance. Cool burns and litter removal facilitated germination of Erechtites hieracifolia and Liriodendron tulipifera suggesting that litter removal is the mechanism by which fire favors colonization. These results suggest that fire applied frequently in the Central Hardwoods Region would cause compositional shifts to graminoids and disturbance-adapted forbs by increasing germination from the seed bank. Fire did not favor species with dormant underground buds, as studies in other ecosystems would suggest. Vegetational responses were noticeably weaker in the second year after burning, indicating that a single fire has only a short-term effect. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a 3-year field observation on seed rain, seed loss and natural regeneration of Castanopsis fargesii Franch., a dominant tree species in evergreen broad-leaved forests in Dujiangyan, southwestern China. The results showed that: (1) there were marked differences in (mature) seed production between mast (733,700 seeds in 2001) and regular (51,200 and 195,600 seeds in 2002 and 2003, respectively) years for C fargesii. (2) Most seeds were dispersed in leaf litter, humus and 0-2 cm depth soil in seed bank. (3) Frequency distributions of both DBH and height indicated that C. fargesii had a relatively stable population. (4) Seed rain, seed ground density, seed loss, and leaf fall were highly dynamic and certain quantity of seeds were preserved on the ground for a prolonged time due to predator satiation in both the mast and regular years so that the continuous presence of seed bank and seedling recruitments in situ became possible. Both longer time observations and manipulative experiments should be carried out to better understand the roles of seed dispersal and regeneration process in the ecosystem performance.

RESTORING BARRENS SHRUBLANDS: DECREASING FIRE HAZARD AND IMPROVING RARE PLANT HABITAT	23RD TALL TIMBERS FIRE ECOLOGY CONFERENCE: FIRE IN GRASSLAND AND SHRUBLAND ECOSYSTEMS	Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference Proceedings				23rd Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference	OCT 17-20, 2005	Bartlesville, OK	Tall Timbers Res Stn, Joint Fire Sci Program, Nat Conservancy, Rangeland Ecol & Management Program, Oklahoma State Univ, SE Fire Ecol Partnership, USDI Bur Land Management, USDI Natl Pk Serv, US Fish & Wildlife Serv, USDA Forest Serv, Assoc Fire Ecol, Natl Interagency Prescribed Fire Training Ctr, Soc Range Management, Oklahoma Chapter, Soc Range Management				The coastal sandplain of southeastern New England is characterized by a complex of xeric, fire-prone shrubland and open woodland communities. Also known as barrens, these landscapes supported frequent fires until recently when suppression efforts became effective. Currently, shrubland components are increasingly being lost through succession to closed woodlands. Within our study area-the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest (MFCSF) on the island of Martha's Vineyard-heathlands and scrub oak (bear oak [Quercus ilicifolia] and dwarf chinkapin oak [Q. prinoides]) shrublands are declining while oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands (and less frequently pitch pine [Pinus rigida] forests) increase in area. The MFCSF, with 11 rare plant species, has one of the highest concentrations of rare plants in the coastal region. Our goal was to determine if management (including thinning, brushcutting, grazing, pile burning, and broadcast prescribed burning) can be used both to reduce fire hazard and create rare plant habitat. Species composition was largely unchanged by treatments, as many species resprouted. However, following fuel treatments, new occurrences of two rare species and several grassland-associated species were found where bare soil was created. Grassland associates colonized plots with lower duff depths and greater lichen cover than plots lacking these species. Grazing increased establishment of nonnative species, although most did not persist past the first growing season. Treatments reduced fine (1- and 10-h time lag) fuel loads >50% from averages of 32 t/ha and 23 t/ha in scrub oak and pitch pine, respectively. In scrub oak, treatments reduced shrub fuel depths >75% (from 1.3 to 0.3 m). In untreated plots (under moderate midflame wind speeds of 5.8 km/h and humidities of 65%), rates of spread of research burns were >4.6 m/min and flame lengths were >2 m. Under similar burning conditions in treated plots, flame lengths were <0.6 m and rates of spread <2.1 m/min. Initial results suggest that treatments created rare plant habitat and reduced fire hazard without adversely impacting native shrub communities.																	0082-1527						2007		23					73	82									WOS:000274198800016

Many of the vegetative forms that have evolved over time, and which are uniquely Australian, rely on fire to complete one or more stages of their life cycle. In recent years, changes to the natural fire regimes and the introduction of many new plants throughout Australia have led to changes in ecosystem functioning and species composition in many Australian shrubland areas. Research was undertaken to determine if regular low-intensity burning of urban shrubland areas can assist in the rehabilitation of native species by imposing a fire regime that will increase their abundance and diversity and decrease the abundance and diversity of invasive weed species. To test this hypothesis, sampling was undertaken over an 18-mo period in eight sites with four differing fire histories-3, 6, 8, and 10 y since the last fire. Within each of these sites, species presence and abundance were analyzed along two 100-m transects. Seed bank samples were also taken at these sites. Seeds within these samples were exposed to temperatures and smoke products present in a low-intensity burn and then germinated to determine the species composition of the next generation. Nutrient levels were measured to determine if any changes in species composition could be explained by elevated nutrient levels rather than by a specific fire regime. The results from this study indicate that there is a peak in native abundance and diversity with an associated decrease in exotic abundance and diversity approximately 6 y after a low-intensity burn. There was no significant difference found in nutrient levels between sites, indicating that elevated nutrient levels did not play a role in the differences in vegetation composition. Seed germination showed significant variation in sites with different fire histories, demonstrating that time since last fire plays an important role in the species composition of the next generation of vegetation post-fire. This conclusion has many applications in the management of urban shrubland areas throughout the Sydney region. Determining the optimal frequency and intensity of fires in these areas provides much needed information for determining the best possible burning regimes for the ecology of native species.																	0082-1527						2007		23					251	251									WOS:000274198800055						
J	Sanchez, AM; Peco, B				Sanchez, Ana M.; Peco, Begona			Lack of recruitment in Lavandula stoechas subsp pedunculata: a case of safe-site limitation	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Lauandula stoechas subsp. pedunculata regeneration depends exclusively on the establishment of new individuals. Seed availability and seedling emergence and survival are therefore critical life stages and processes for species regeneration. in this study, seedling emergence and survival was monitored for two years in the scrub, both in clearings and adjacent to adult plants, and the surrounding perennial grassland, at 1, 3 and 5 m from the scrub. Soil seed bank spatial distribution was also studied for one year in the same two habitats, using the same sampling design. Soil seed availability in the scrub is high regardless of the distance from the adult individuals. On the contrary, the adjacent grassland shows a drastic fall in seed density, and almost no seedlings were observed there. In the scrub, seedling density was negatively related to distance from the three nearest adult plants in the clearings, and positively related to adult plant size beneath the adult Lavandula plants. There was also a negative relationship between seedling density and the percentage of bare soil. Only one seedling survived the first drought period, with no detection of effects of either position with respect to adult individuals or seedling density. We hypothesized that the study populations suffer a lack of appropriate safe sites within the scrubland while in the adjacent perennial grassland, observed low seed availability was added to safe-site limitation. That results in a lack of successful seedling establishments and a poor expansion potential of Lauandula scrublands, whose edges remain static in the short and medium term. As found in other Mediterranean scrubland, recruitment may only occur in years with particularly favourable weather, under disturbance regimes that increase seedling survival probability or when external dispersal agents increased seed availability in adequate places for Lavandula establishment.

Comparison of vegetation and soil properties under trees of 200 different woody species in the arboretum was conducted, and the results were evaluated from an allelopathic viewpoint. Differences in existing vegetation surrounding tree trunks were similar to that in emergence/growth from soil seed banks of the same areas, suggesting species-depending allelopathic influences of the trees. Most coniferous species were categorized to the most inhibitory group, as compared with broadleaf species. The most promotive group only consisted of broadleaf species. Growth of test plant (lettuce) differed greatly, ranging form 0 mg to 358 mg/pot in dry weight, depending on the tree species/soil association. Soil pH and soil water EC also varied widely between 3.7 and 7.7, and between 0.06 mS and mS/cm, respectively. The tendencies found for the arboretum trees coincided with those for tree species tested in a forest. On an average, growth of lettuce plants and soil pH for coniferous species. These results suggest that substances consecutively egressing into stem flow contribute to large variations in vegetation, that soil properties are specific to taxonomic groups, and at least in coniferous trees, substances which can lower soil pH appear to be the cause of growth inhibitory activities.																			978-1-57808-446-3				2007							285	+									WOS:000248512100018

Agroecosystem management for rare species of Paysonia (Brassicaceae): Integrating their seed ecology and life cycle with cropping regimens in a changing climate	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Dormancy break and germination of seeds are governed by climatic cues, and predicted changes in climate may impact the ecology and conservation of species. Paysonia perforata and P. stonensis are rare brassicaceous winter annuals occurring primarily in fields on floodplains, where corn or soybeans are recommended for habitat maintenance. We tested the effects of precipitation, based on two predictions of changes in climate, on seed germination in these two species and placed the results into a management framework. Seeds of both species, collected during peak dispersal in late April/early May, were given various periods of light (or darkness) followed by darkness (or light) at summer temperatures before placement in darkness during late summer/early autumn in both laboratory and field. The light requirement was met earliest at 10 wk (mid-July) on alternating wet/ dry substrate (simulating current climatic conditions). However, seeds of P. perforata and P. stonensis were photostimulated earliest at 2 wk (mid-May) and 6 wk (mid-June), respectively, on a continuously moist substrate (simulating predicted future conditions). The soil seed bank could be depleted if plowing coincides with photostimulation of seeds. Fields should be prepared after dispersal but before seeds are photostimulated and harvesting completed before seed germination in early September. Because seeds are highly photostimulated in late summer, disturbance from harvesting must be low to prevent burial. Cultivation of soybean, particularly for forage, is better matched to the seed biology and life cycle of Paysonia than that of corn under current and predicted climates.																	0002-9122					JAN	2007	94	1					102	110		10.3732/ajb.94.1.102							WOS:000243896700014	21642212

Many of these herbaceous communities may be threatened by invading trees and shrubs. We investigated changes in vegetative communities between 1994 and 2001 and the impact of woody encroachment upon herbaceous wetland communities in a southern Appalachian wetland complex in western North Carolina. We conducted a quantitative investigation of herbaceous, shrub and tree vegetation in forested and unforested fen and floodplain wetland sites. Additionally, soil chemistry, water level and precipitation data were collected. We found that woody encroachment was the strongest predictor of diminished herbaceous wetland communities, while water levels had the strongest positive relationship with herbaceous coverage.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of sexual reproduction of the perennial Salix gordejevii in the revegetation of active dunes. Methods Seedling emergence and establishment of S. gordejevii were examined both in controlled experiments (germination at different burial depths with different watering regimes) and in field observations in three dune slacks. The reproductive phenology and soil seed bank of S. gordejevii, the dynamics of soil moisture, the groundwater table and the landform level of three dune slacks were monitored. Key Results Seeds of S. gordejevii began maturation on 1 May, and seed dispersal lasted from 8 May to 20 May. Seeds on the soil surface germinated significantly faster than those buried in soil (P < 0.05). Seedling emergence was negatively correlated with landform level. When most seedlings emerged, there was a significantly positive correlation between soil moisture and seedling emergence (P < 0.01). Rainfall was negatively correlated with seedling emergence. Seedling establishment was significantly and positively correlated with seedling emergence (P < 0.05), and 72.3 % of the emergent seedlings were established at the end of the growing season. These results indicated that (a) seeds matured and dispersed before the rainy season; (b) seeds germinated as soon as they contacted a moist surface and relied more on soil moisture than on rainfall; and (c) more seedlings emerged at lower sampling points in dune slacks. Conclusions In natural conditions, restoration of active sand dune fields generally commences with revegetation of dune slacks where sexual reproduction of perennials contributes greatly to species encroachment and colonization and hence plays an important role in restoration of active dune fields. Furthermore, aeolian erosion in dune slacks, leading to good soil moisture, facilitates seed germination, seedling emergence and establishment of S. gordejevii.																	0305-7364	1095-8290				JAN	2007	99	1					19	28		10.1093/aob/mcl228							WOS:000244181400003	17085475

Vegetative regeneration is widely recognized as the main mode of reproduction in the adventive regions. However, the contribution of sexual reproduction to the success of these invasive species has only been detailed for the British Isles. An examination was made as to how hybridization may influence the sexual reproduction of the complex in Belgium and to determine how it may contribute to the dispersal of the species. Methods Studies were made of floral biology, reproductive success, seed rain, seed bank, germination capacity, seedling survival and dispersal capacity in order to characterize the reproductive biology of the species. Moreover, chromosome counts and flow cytometry were used to assess the hybrid status of seedlings produced by sexual reproduction. Key Results In the area investigated, extensive sexual reproduction by hybridization within the complex, including one horticultural species, was demonstrated. A small percentage of seeds may be dispersed outside the maternal clone (> 16 m) allowing the formation of genetically differentiated individuals. Seed germination was possible even after a winter cold period. Conclusions The extensive sexual reproduction by hybridization could further contribute to the dramatic invasive success of knotweeds in Belgium and should not be underestimated when considering control and management measures.

Cone differentiation and the early flowering of this species in comparison to other native Spanish species, are traits considered as adaptations to postfire regeneration. The high recurrence of fires promotes a high increase in young and immature pine stands with low capability of regeneration. In this study, silvicultural treatments such as thinning and pruning were carried out 5 years after fire in eleven years old P. halepensis stands located in dry and semi-arid sites in SE Spain. The formation of male and female strobili, production of serotinous grey, mature brown and new green cones were recorded six years after treatments. Seed production and germination percentage were also tested. Results showed acceleration in cone and viable seed production in thinned plots, with some differences between sites being recorded. Serotinous cone production also increased as a result of this treatment.

J	Shibayama, Y; Kadono, Y				Shibayama, Yuki; Kadono, Yasuro			Reproductive success and genetic structure of populations of the heterostylous aquatic plant Nymphoides indica (L.) Kuntze (Menyanthaceae)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Differences in the reproductive mode (sexual and vegetative reproduction) between populations of a species may produce diverse patterns of genetic structure within and among populations. We analyzed the clonal diversity of populations of a heterostylous plant (Nymphoides indica (L.) Kuntze) having different floral morph ratios in the Higashi-harima area of Japan. The number of MLGs (multilocus genotypes) in populations with equal floral morph ratios was significantly higher than that among populations with biased floral morph ratios and among monomorphic populations. Populations with equal floral morph ratios followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A dispersal distance of 0-4.2 km was significantly correlated with Nei's genetic distance, supporting a stepping-stone model of dispersal. Four rare MLGs were included in populations with equal floral morph ratios, distributed among neighboring populations. We concluded that clonal diversity of N. indica in the Higashi-harima area is maintained by the success of seed production and establishment of seedlings, and by the proximate occurrence of habitats around the populations where successful sexual reproduction occurs.

Lucerne, phalaris, and wallaby grass in short-term pasture phases in two eastern Australian wheatbelt environments. 2. Effect of perennial density and species on subterranean clover populations and the relative success of 3 clover cultivars of different maturity	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The effect of the density of 3 perennial species, phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.), wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia richardsonii Kunth), and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), on seed set, regeneration, and the relative competitiveness of 3 cultivars of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) was examined in 2 environments in the south-eastern Australian wheatbelt. Seed yields of subterranean clover were inversely related to perennial density at both sites over the first 2 years, the relationship varying with perennial species. Phalaris depressed the seed yield of clover more than lucerne and wallaby grass in the second and third year at equivalent densities. Clover seed yield was positively related to clover herbage yield in late spring at both sites, and inversely related to perennial herbage yield. Clover seed yield displayed an increasing linear relationship with the proportion of light reaching the clover understorey in spring, which in turn was inversely related to perennial density and perennial herbage yield. Clover seedling regeneration in mixed swards in autumn was positively related to the size of the summer seed bank, but negatively related to perennial density. Clover seedling survival following a premature germination at Kamarah was inversely correlated to the density of phalaris and lucerne in the sward. The relative competitiveness of the 3 subterranean clover cultivars varied between sites, with climatic conditions (rainfall and growing-season length) having a greater effect on the relative cultivar performance than companion perennial species or density. The later maturing subterranean clover cv. Goulburn became the dominant cultivar at the wetter site, constituting 72% of the seed bank, but declined to only 3-8% of the seed bank at the drier site. The proportion of the early flowering cultivar Dalkeith in the seed bank increased over time at the drier site and was highest (53%) in plots with the highest perennial density. We concluded that although perennial pasture species will depress clover seed yield and subsequent regeneration, these effects could be minimised by reducing perennial densities and exploiting variations in competitiveness between perennial species as identified in this study. Sowing earlier maturing subterranean clover cultivars would only be an advantage in increasing clover content in low-rainfall environments. The findings suggest that clover seed reserves and regeneration could also be increased by using grazing management to reduce the level of shading of clover by perennials, a factor associated with reduced clover seed yield.

Analysis of seed-bank data confirms suitability of international seed-storage standards for the Australian flora	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The suitability of applying international standards for long-term seed storage to the Australian. ora was examined by reviewing seed-storage data from the Western Australian Threatened Flora Seed Centre. The 375 collections examined represented 176 taxa from 44 genera and 16 families. A high proportion of collections, representative of some of the most common genera in Australia, maintained viability in the short (< 5 years) and medium (5-12 years) term. Declines in germination were evident for a small number of collections, representing 10 taxa, stored for 5 - 12 years. However, many of the declines were collection-specific and other collections of the same taxon did not decline. Five taxa showing germination declines were represented by a single collection so it was not possible to determine whether the germination decline was directly related to the taxa, storage conditions or to other factors. Only the closely related Stylidium coroniforme and S. amabile exhibited germination declines in all collections, but cut tests of seeds remaining from germination testing indicated that viability of the collections had not declined, just the proportion to germinate; for these species a change in germination conditions is a more likely explanation for the reduction in germination. The results illustrate the successful application of these seed-storage standards to threatened. ora in Western Australia and highlight their suitability for the Australian. ora.

The sediments of two areas in Thegoa Lagoon (Murray - Darling Basin), one area grazed by sheep when dry and the other ungrazed, were examined. The objective of the study was to determine whether and how the (1) germinable seed bank and (2) final plant communities differ between the grazed and ungrazed areas. The seed banks were subjected to one of the following three water depths: 5 cm above the surface of the water, 5 cm below the surface and 50 cm below the surface. The composition of the seed bank was determined by using the seedling-emergence technique for 12 weeks, with seedlings removed every 2 weeks. The final plant communities were determined at 12 weeks without removing seedlings. The seed bank from the grazed area had a significantly lower seed density (5600 +/- 593 seedsm(-2)) and species richness (7 species) than the ungrazed area (37 683 +/- 4492 seeds m(-2), 16 species) (ANOVA: F-1,F-10 = 50.16, P < 0.0001). The floristic composition of the seed bank was also significantly different between the areas (NPMANOVA: F-1,F-10 = 15.44, P=0.0032). Glinus lotoides was in higher abundance in the grazed area and Alternanthera denticulata, Persicaria lapathifolium, Polygonum plebium, Typha domingensis and Centipeda cunninghamii in the ungrazed area. Similarly, the final communities derived from the grazed and ungrazed areas were significantly different from each other (NPMANOVA: F-1,F-10 = 15.53, P = 0.0032). Greater numbers of Centipeda cunninghamii were present in the community from the grazed area and Alternanthera denticulata and Cuscuta campestris were present in larger numbers in the community from the ungrazed area. Water depth also had an impact on germination; no germination occurred in seed banks flooded to 50 cm and one Typha domingensis seedling was observed in a sample flooded to 5 cm. These results showed that grazing reduces the density and species richness of the seed bank and in turn changes the plant communities derived from the seed bank; however, if grazing is removed pest plants such as Cuscuta campestris may require control. In addition, managed drawdown or water-level fluctuations are important in exposing wetland sediments and allowing for species to recruit from the seed bank.																	0067-1924						2007	55	2					103	109		10.1071/BT04137							WOS:000244949800002

Integrating demography and fire management: an example from Florida scrub	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY					Symposium on Advances in Plant Conservation Biology - Implications for Management and Restoration	OCT 25-27, 2005	Perth, AUSTRALIA					In this work, I have used life-history and demographic data to define fire return intervals for several types of Florida scrub, a xeric shrubland where fire is the dominant ecological disturbance but where fire suppression is a major issue. The datasets combine chronosequence and longitudinal approaches at community and population levels. Resprouting shrubs, which dominate most types of Florida scrub, recover rapidly after fires (although their limits under frequent fires are not well known) and also increasingly dominate long-unburned areas. These dominant shrubs can prosper over a range of fire return intervals. Obligate-seeding scrub plants, which often have persistent seed banks, can be eliminated by frequent fire but often decline with infrequent fire. Population viability analyses of habitat specialists offer more precision in suggesting ranges of appropriate fire return intervals. For two types of Florida scrub (rosemary scrub and oak-hickory scrub), plant-population viability analyses narrow the interval and suggest more frequent fires than do previous recommendations, at intervals of 15-30 and 5-12 years, respectively. Variation in fire regimes in time and space (pyrodiversity) is recommended as a bet-hedging fire-management strategy and to allow co-existence of species with disparate life histories.																	0067-1924						2007	55	3					261	272		10.1071/BT06020							WOS:000246571400008

Conservation biology of banksias: insights from natural history to simulation modelling	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY					Symposium on Advances in Plant Conservation Biology - Implications for Management and Restoration	OCT 25-27, 2005	Perth, AUSTRALIA					We have studied the ecology and conservation requirements of Banksia species in the species-rich sandplains of south-western Australia for 25 years. Loss of habitat through land-clearing has had the greatest impact on their conservation status over the last 50 years. Ascertaining optimal conditions for conservation management in bushland requires detailed knowledge of the species under consideration, including demographic attributes, fire regime, growing conditions and interactions with other species. Where populations have been fragmented, seed production per plant has also fallen. The group most vulnerable to the vagaries of fire, disease, pests, weeds and climate change are the non-sprouters, rather than the resprouters, with population extinction so far confined to non-sprouting species. Recent short-interval fires (< 8 years) appear to have had little impact at the landscape scale, possibly because they are rare and patchy. Fire intervals exceeding 25-50 years can also lead to local extinction. Up to 200 viable seeds are required for parent replacement in Banksia hookeriana when growing conditions are poor (low post-fire rainfall, commercial flower harvesting) and seed banks of this size can take up to 12 years to be reached. Seed production is rarely limited by pollinators, but interannual seasonal effects and resource availability are important. Genetic diversity of the seed store is quickly restored to the level of the parents in B. hookeriana. Florivores and granivores generally reduce seed stores, although this varies markedly among species. In Banksia tricuspis, black cockatoos actually increase seed set by selectively destroying borers. Potential loss of populations through the root pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi also challenges management, especially in the southern sandplains. Prefire dead plants are a poor source of seeds for the next generation when fire does occur. Harvesting seeds and sowing post-fire have much to commend them for critically endangered species. Bare areas caused by humans can result in ideal conditions for plant growth and seed set. However, in the case of B. hookeriana/B. prionotes, disturbance by humans has fostered hybridisation, threatening the genetic integrity of both species, whereas fine-textured soils are unsuitable for colonisation or rehabilitation. Few viable seeds become seedlings after fire, owing to post-release granivory and herbivory and unsuitable germination conditions. Seedling-competitive effects ensure that season/intensity of fire is not critical to recruitment levels, except in the presence of weeds. Water availability during summer-autumn is critical and poses a problem for conservation management if the trend for declining rainfall in the region continues. Our simulation modelling for three banksias shows that the probability of co-occurrence is maximal when fire is stochastic around a mean of 13 years, and where fire-proneness and post-fire recruitment success vary in the landscape. Modelling results suggest that non-sprouting banksias could not survive the pre-European frequent-fire scenario suggested by the new grasstree technique for south-western Australia. However, we have yet to fully explore the conservation significance of long-distance dispersal of seeds, recently shown to exceed 2.5 km in B. hookeriana.

The effects of these and preceding wild. res in the 1980s on spinifex (Triodia spp.) sand-ridge plant communities were examined at 38 sites in central Australia. We used both multivariate and univariate techniques to assess floristic differences among sites of contrasting time-since-fire, fire season and fire interval. Time-since-fire had a consistent floristic influence across the landscape, with increased abundances of ephemeral grasses and forbs and Triodia seedlings, and species richness soon after. re but decreasing long after. re. Fire season had little effect on most functional groups of plants, although seedlings of woody species were significantly more abundant following summer than winter. res. Likewise, recent short. re intervals appeared to have little impact on the population dynamics of most functional groups, although some transient effects were observed on abundances of ephemeral forbs, Triodia seedlings and herbaceous clonal species. Long-term woody species abundances appeared to be affected by short. re intervals in the 1980s when repeated. res seemed to stimulate recruitment of some resprouting species. The present study highlighted the relative stability of spinifex vegetation types in the face of landscape-scale pyric perturbation, but emphasised that localised shifts in the composition and structure of the plant community may occur under certain. re regimes.

Seed development in Malva parviflora: Onset of germinability, dormancy and desiccation tolerance	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Seed development was examined in Malva parviflora. The first flower opened 51 days after germination; flowers were tagged on the day that they opened and monitored for 33 days. Seeds were collected at 12 stages during this period and used to determine moisture content, germination of fresh seeds and desiccation tolerance (seeds dried to 10% moisture content followed by germination testing). Seed moisture content decreased as seeds developed, whereas fresh (max. 296 mg) and dry weight (max. 212 mg) increased to peak at 12-15 and similar to 21 days after flowering (DAF), respectively. Therefore, physiological maturity occurred at 21 DAF, when seed moisture content was 16-21%. Seeds were capable of germinating early in development, reaching a maximum of 63% at 9 DAF, but germination declined as development continued, presumably due to the imposition of physiological dormancy. Physical dormancy developed at or after physiological maturity, once seed moisture content declined below 20%. Seeds were able to tolerate desiccation from 18 DAF; desiccation hastened development of physical dormancy and improved germination. These results provide important information regarding M. parviflora seed development, which will ultimately improve weed control techniques aimed at preventing seed set and further additions to the seed bank.

Multivariate analysis of the response of overgrown semi-natural calcareous grasslands to restorative shrub cutting	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Monitoring and evaluation of restoration management often suffers from poor sampling design and a lack of statistical rigour, seldom considering the spatial and temporal variability of habitat. We tested the effectiveness of shrub cutting on the restoration of calcareous grasslands, using a 4-year Before-After/Reference-Control-Impact (BARCI) project design with replicated patches of habitat. Departure from the control sites and convergence with the reference sites were analysed using the Principal Response Curves (PRC) method. The structure of communities was compared 1 year before and 3 years after management on control scrubland, restored ex-arable land, restored and reference grassland. Results show that shrub cutting did not suffice to restore the community composition of the semi-natural calcareous grasslands. The restored ex-arable areas maintained a community structure extremely similar to the control scrubland. The restored grassland, on the other hand, deviated from the control and slightly converged to the reference grassland, though not significantly. The dominant scrub species that was cut, Prunus spinosa, showed higher cover values compared to the reference grassland in any of the treatments, even the first year after cutting. Species typical of xeric and/or calcareous grassland were more abundant in the reference than in the restored grassland, white arable and ruderal species were more frequent in the restored sites. This study has demonstrated that the BARCI approach is a powerful tool for the evaluation of restoration management, as it was possible to evaluate not only departure from the unmanaged control, but also convergence with the reference community. The PRC method provided a comprehensive overview of the response of the 153 species involved in the study. Our results also indicate that the second PRC should be considered, when significant, to not exclude important information from the assessment. (C) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Moderate impacts of plant invasion and management regimes in coastal hind dune seed banks	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Plant invaders may directly or indirectly affect ecosystem resilience through their impact on soil seed banks. The invaders, and the application of control measures, change seed bank dynamics by altering the number of seeds entering and leaving the seed bank. We tested the impact of bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata), on the seed bank. We examined seed banks in heavily-invaded, sparsely-invaded and managed dunes, where bitou bush biomass had been controlled. While management of bitou bush may have reduced the density of bitou bush seeds in the soil, it did not reduce the richness of other weed species. Native tree species richness was significantly higher in seed banks of sparsely-invaded than either heavily-invaded or managed sites, perhaps indicating a permanent shift in community structure following invasion. However, remaining indices of native seed bank diversity were similar across all invasion categories, indicating that seed banks of many native species were unaffected by both invasion and management. while examination of seed banks is informative in assessing past and potential community dynamics, low similarity between the standing vegetation and seed bank at all sites indicated that many hind dune species had other storage or regeneration modes and seed banks cannot be relied upon for comprehensive dune restoration.

Bromus inermis Leyss	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.), a native of central Eurasia, was introduced to Canada as a forage and hay crop around 1888. Early reports of plants escaped from cultivation appear in 1903, and based on the number of collections prior to 1920, smooth brome spread most rapidly in western Canada. It is common along roadsides, forest margins, clearings, shorelines and disturbed areas, but its most detrimental impact is on the diversity of prairies and native grasslands. For example, in Riding Mountain National Park, MB, plant diversity of fescue prairies recently invaded by smooth brome decreased by 70%. Vegetative proliferation through underground rhizomes is key to the invasiveness of smooth brome, but long-range dispersal of seeds is facilitated by animals, wind and the transport of hay. Smooth brome is effectively controlled using selective applications of glyphosate and well-timed clipping. However, restoration of infested areas depends on the composition of native seed banks. Smooth brome remains valuable as a forage and cover crop in every province and territory in Canada.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				JAN	2007	87	1					183	198		10.4141/P06-071							WOS:000245528100024

Relationship between the soil seed bank and vegetation of tall grassland of Spartina argentinensis	CIENCIA E INVESTIGACION AGRARIA												Tall grass communities of Spartina argentinensis Parodi are the most widespread plant communities in a large saline depression in Santa Fe, Argentina. The vegetation and soil seed bank for these communities have been studied. However, there is no information about the relationship between them. We worked with previous data obtained from the Federico Wildermuth Reserve, Colonia Bel Grano, Departamento San Martin, Santa Fe, Argentina (31 degrees 57' S; 61 degrees 23' W) and used the cover-abundance of the plant species and density of the soil seed bank for 1998 and 1999. The relationship between plant types C3 and C4 (C3/C4) and annual/perennial functional groups were determined. At the same time, the similarity index and the relationship between cover-abundance and density of the shared species was determined. According to results obtained, plant species relationship between of type C3 were more frequent in the soil seed bank, while plant species of type C4 were more abundant in the vegetation. There was no significant correlation between cover-abundance in the vegetation and soil seed bank density of the common species. The similarity index was very low due to the fact that the number of species common to vegetation and soil seed bank was very low. In conclusion, there was a low relationship between species of the soil seed bank and vegetation with plant species type C3 and C4 as predominant species, respectively.																	0718-1620					JAN-APR	2007	34	1					41	48									WOS:000254432700005

The community was divided into three zones. Soil pH varied from 8.1 to 8.5. Soil conductivity was highest (191 dS m(-1)) in September and lowest (55 dS m(-1)) in June. Soil water content was relatively low and varied from 1.6% in February to 9.5% in June. Limonium stocksii maintained a persistent seed bank, which peaked at 5,887 seeds m(-2) in May. Very slow growth was observed; however, plants in the intermediate zone showed better growth than the other two zones. Stem and leaf tissue water content were affected by salinity fluctuations, but root tissue water remained unaffected. Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) accumulated in stems and leaves more than other ions. Leaves also accumulated a very high amount of magnesium (Mg++) compared to roots and stems.

J	Csontos, P				Csontos, P.			Seed banks: ecological definitions and sampling considerations	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												Definitions of seed banks are discussed in the introductory part of the paper. In the second part, a literature review regarding sampling problems in soil seed bank ecology is presented. Regarding sampling depth, a rapid decline in soil seed content is demonstrated from example studies. The use of soil cores with 5 cm or 10 cm depth is suggested to ensure comparability of results. For determination of optimal sample volumes for various communities, the species saturation model is suggested such that "minimal volume" can be defined for soil seed banks in the same way that "minimal area" can be defined in phytosociological studies. Although sampling time may depend on research goals for vegetation types with a winter standstill period, late autumn sampling is suggested for detecting the entire soil seed bank, whilst late spring sampling is recommended for the examination of its persistent part. Studies looking at medium (plant community level) and fine scales (patch level) have demonstrated that soil seed bank distributions show horizontal aggregation for most of the cases and for most of the species. Seed dispersal processes which are among major factors responsible for such aggregated patterns are also discussed.																	1585-8553	1588-2756					2007	8	1					75	85		10.1556/ComEc.8.2007.1.10							WOS:000247478300010

Telomeres and seed banks	CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS												We have found that a progressive loss of telomeric sequences occurs in high molecular weight DNA with an increasing appearance at a low molecular weight as the period of storage in the dry state was extended in time to provide seed germination loss from 98 to 0%. Telomere distribution would appear to follow the general pattern of DNA random fragmentation, which occurs in the embryos of seeds stored in a dry state; however, there are also indications of an overall telomere loss from DNA as a consequence of storage. There is a need for a convenient quality marker for the seeds that can be monitored over time. Having reviewed the implications of our results very carefully, we believe that there is considerable potential for the use of telomere sequences to mark the embryo ageing of seeds held in seed banks.																	0095-4527					JAN-FEB	2007	41	1					18	24		10.3103/S0095452707010045							WOS:000254722800004

Riparian vegetation: degradation, alien plant invasions, and restoration prospects	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Rivers are conduits for materials and energy; this, the frequent and intense disturbances that these systems experience, and their narrow, linear nature, create problems for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of increasing human influence. In most parts of the world, riparian zones are highly modified. Changes caused by alien plants - or environmental changes that facilitate shifts in dominance creating novel ecosystems - are often important agents of perturbation in these systems. Many restoration projects are underway. Objective frameworks based on an understanding of biogeographical processes at different spatial scales (reach, segment, catchment), the specific relationships between invasive plants and resilience and ecosystem functioning, and realistic endpoints are needed to guide sustainable restoration initiatives. This paper examines the biogeography and the determinants of composition and structure of riparian vegetation in temperate and subtropical regions and conceptualizes the components of resilience in these systems. We consider changes to structure and functioning caused by, or associated with, alien plant invasions, in particular those that lead to breached abiotic- or biotic thresholds. These pose challenges when formulating restoration programmes. Pervasive and escalating human-mediated changes to multiple factors and at a range of scales in riparian environments demand innovative and pragmatic approaches to restoration. The application of a new framework accommodating such complexity is demonstrated with reference to a hypothetical riparian ecosystem under three scenarios: (1) system unaffected by invasive plants; (2) system initially uninvaded, but with flood-generated incursion of alien plants and escalating invasion-driven alteration; and (3) system affected by both invasions and engineering interventions. The scheme has been used to derive a decision-making framework for restoring riparian zones in South Africa and could guide similar initiatives in other parts of the world.

Vegetation dynamics on sediment deposits upstream of bioengineering works in mountainous marly gullies in a Mediterranean climate (Southern Alps, France)	ECO- AND GROUND BIO-ENGINEERING: THE USE OF VEGETATION TO IMPROVE SLOPE STABILITY	Developments in Plant and Soil Sciences				1st International Conference on Eco-Engineering	SEP 13-17, 2004	Thessaloniki, GREECE					Current erosion-control studies in mountainous catchments emphasise the effectiveness of bioengineering works in constructing vegetation barriers that are designed to trap and permanently retain sediment upstream of such barriers. Plant establishment and succession should result in colonisation of these sediment deposits, thereby improving the trapping capacity of the works. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the natural vegetation to colonise and grow on sediment accumulated upstream of 29 bioengineering works. They were constructed on the channel bottom of two marly gullies in the mountainous Southern French Alps region, which has a Mediterranean climate. We analysed the soil seed bank in sediment deposits after a germination experiment conducted in the laboratory, where soil cores were placed in a non-limited water condition. We also determined the standing vegetation which developed on the sediment deposits on field sites over 2 years of drought (2003 and 2004). The results show that the number of plants was 80/m(2) on average in the samples studied in the laboratory, vs. 3 l/m 2 in 2003 and 20/m(2) in 2004 on the field sites, with a total diversity of 40 species. Therefore, despite 2 years of drought, natural plant colonisation occurred on the sediment deposits. An improvement in soil water conditions slightly increases the capacity of the sediment deposits to allow seed germination. However, despite the initial success in vegetation colonisation, plant abundance and recovery were rather low, which suggests that vegetation established itself very slowly.																	0167-840X		978-1-4020-5592-8				2007	103						297	+									WOS:000249857200029

Woods. Two populations, Varela and Verdemilho, were monitored in the field during two consecutive life cycles and aspects of their morphology and density were recorded monthly. In the laboratory seedlings were exposed to different salinity for 10 weeks and growth and mortality rate were recorded weekly. The growth of the populations differed significantly, possibly because of the different salinities of the two sampling sites and/or genetic adaptations of the two populations to the environmental conditions. The absence of a significant correlation between sediment salinity and stem elongation suggested, however, that salinity, alone was not responsible for the differences observed and was possibly associated with other factors, because of nutritional, edaphic, and microclimatic conditions. S. ramosissima did not develop well in conditions of elevated or moderate salinity; its growth was optimum at low salinity. Optimum development of S. ramosissima may, nevertheless, depend on the total number of large seeds in a population seed bank, because of their greater success in germination and germinability under stress conditions than small seeds.

Protection of these values should be a common goal for the managernent authorities, tourist-industry, the tourists, environmental organisations, local people and other user groups. In traditional nature conservation severely disturbed areas are considered as lost. By restoration these areas can retain values as recreation sites and nature areas. Disturbed sites can be created into areas of ecological, aesthetical, cultural, or landscape qualities for the environment, for people and for sustainable tourism. Ranges of restoration methods for establishment of a vegetation cover following disturbance exist. Some are closely related and others are very different both related to scientific approach, management strategy, cost, practical experience, and site-relevance. One relevant way of grouping the different methods is: seeding or planting of introduced species, the use of native species, nutrient and soil treatments, and landscaping. In many situations natural regeneration is the best strategy for establishment of a new vegetation cover. Successful restoration requires an expanded and integrated approach including technological, social, political, economical and aesthetical aspects. An integrated approach is essential to the application of scientific knowledge into practical restoration enterprises with a time frame, cost and scale that is relevant for the management of each specific area.																	1235-0583		978-952-484-168-9				2007	50						52	61									WOS:000253841800006

Establishment and persistence of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) in disturbed soil as a function of an urban-rural macro-environment	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												No data are available on whether rising carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] or increased air temperature can alter the establishment and persistence of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) within a plant community following soil disturbance. To determine ragweed longevity, we exposed disturbed soil with a common seed bank population to an in situ temperature and [CO2] gradient along an urban-rural transect beginning in early 2002. No other consistent differences in meteorological variables (e.g. wind speed, humidity, PAR, tropospheric ozone) as a function of urbanization were documented over the course of the study (2002-2005). Above-ground measurements of biomass over this period demonstrated that ragweed along the transect responded to urban induced increases in [CO2]/temperature with peak biomass being observed at this location by the end of 2003. However, by the Fall of 2004, and continuing through 2005, urban ragweed populations had dwindled to a few plants. The temporal decline in ragweed populations was not associated with increased disease, herbivory or auto-allelopathy, but was part of a demographic reduction in the total number of annual plant species observed for the urban location. In a separate experiment, we showed that such a demographic shift is consistent with CO2/temperature induced increases in biomass and litter accumulation, with a subsequent reduction in germination/survival of annual plant species. Overall, these data indicate that [CO2]/temperature differences associated with urbanization may increase initial ragweed productivity and pollen production, but suggest that long-term, multi-year persistence of ragweed in the urban macro-environment may be dependent on other factors.																	1354-1013					JAN	2007	13	1					266	274		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01264.x							WOS:000243403900021

Impact of prescribed fire and other factors on cheatgrass persistence in a Sierra Nevada ponderosa pine forest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Following the reintroduction of fire Bromus tectorum has invaded the low elevation ponderosa pine forests in parts of Kings Canyon National Park, California. We used prescribed burns, other field manipulations, germination studies, and structural equation modelling, to investigate how fire and other factors affect the persistence of cheatgrass in these forests. Our studies show that altering burning season to coincide with seed maturation is not likely to control cheatgrass because sparse fuel loads generate low fire intensity. Increasing time between prescribed fires may inhibit cheatgrass by increasing surface fuels ( both herbaceous and litter), which directly inhibit cheatgrass establishment, and by creating higher intensity fires capable of killing a much greater fraction of the seed bank. Using structural equation modelling, postfire cheatgrass dominance was shown to be most strongly controlled by the prefire cheatgrass seedbank; other factors include soil moisture, fire intensity, soil N, and duration of direct sunlight. Current fire management goals in western conifer forests are focused on restoring historical fire regimes; however, these frequent fire regimes may enhance alien plant invasion in some forest types. Where feasible, fire managers should consider the option of an appropriate compromise between reducing serious fire hazards and exacerbating alien plant invasions.																	1049-8001						2007	16	1					96	106		10.1071/WF06052							WOS:000244349100010

Resprouting responses of Acacia shrubs in the Western Desert of Australia - fire severity, interval and season influence survival	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The hummock grasslands of arid Australia are fire-prone ecosystems in which the perennial woody plants mostly resprout after fire. The resprouting ability among these species is poorly understood in relation to environmental variation; consequently, little is known about the impacts that contemporary fire regimes are having on vegetation within these systems. We examined the resprouting ability of adults and juveniles of four widespread Acacia species (A. aneura, A. kempeana, A. maitlandii, A. melleodora) by experimentally testing the effects of fire severity, interval and season. We found that fire severity and season strongly affected survival, but the magnitude of the effects was variable among the species. Unexpectedly, a short fire interval of 2 years did not have a strong negative effect on resprouting of any species. Fire severity had variable effects among the four species, with those species with more deeply buried buds being more resilient to high-severity soil heating than those with shallow buds. Season of fire also strongly affected survival of some species, and we propose that seasonal variation in soil heating and soil moisture mediated these effects. The species by environment interactions we observed within one functional group (resprouters with a soil-stored seed bank) and in one genus suggest that modelling landscape response to fire regimes will be complex in these arid ecosystems. We predict, however, that the dominant resprouting acacias in hummock grasslands of central Australia are highly resilient to a range of fire regimes.

J	Pausas, JG; Lloret, F				Pausas, Juli G.; Lloret, F.			Spatial and temporal patterns of plant functional types under simulated fire regimes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												In spite of enormous fire suppression advances in Mediterranean countries, large high-intensity fires are still common. The effects on vegetation structure and composition of fire and fire regime changes at large spatial and temporal scales are poorly known, and landscape simulation models may throw some light in this regard. Thus, we studied how the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of the different plant types are sensitive to the frequency, extent and spatial distribution of wildfires, using a landscape simulation model (FATELAND). We simulated the dynamics of 10 plant functional types (PFTs) defined as combinations of post-fire persistence strategies and life forms, under the following fire scenarios: No Fire, Suppressed (one large fire every 20 years), Prescribed (small fuel reductions every year), Unmanaged-1 ( two small fires every year) and Unmanaged- 2 (four small fires every year). The results suggest that the different fire regimes generate different spatial fire-recurrence patterns and changes in the proportion of the dominant species. For instance, with increasing fire recurrence, seeder shrubs (i. e. those recruiting new individuals after fire from persisting seed bank) with early reproduction increased and seeder trees decreased, while little variation was found for resprouters. Fire also increased the spatial aggregation of plants, while PFT richness decreased with increasing fire recurrence. The results suggest patterns of changes similar to those reported in field studies, and thus they provide consistent hypotheses on the possible vegetation changes due to different fire scenarios.

Yet little is known about the role of the soil seed bank in seedling recruitment of S. spinosum and whether grazing has any effect on the size and spatial distribution of its seed bank and seedling emergence. We studied the effects of sheep grazing on the soil seed bank and seedling emergence of S. spinosum in a Mediterranean semiarid shrubland in the northern Negev Desert in Israel. The variation in density of the seed bank in autumn and of seedling emergence in the spring was measured during two years, beneath shrub canopies and in the open space matrix, inside and outside exclosures that prevented sheep grazing. Seed density beneath the shrubs ranged between 2000 and 3000 seeds m(-2), and was about ten times as great as that in the adjacent open space patches. Moreover, beneath the shrubs, the proportion of the autumn seed bank that emerged as seedlings in the spring was three times as great as in the open space patches. Grazing caused a 60% increase in soil seed bank density beneath the shrub canopy but had no effect on the seed bank in the open space patches. Variation in spring seedling density between grazing treatments and patch types was strongly related to the availability of seeds in the previous autumn.																	0792-9978	2223-8980					2007	55	1					35	43		10.1560/IJPS.55.1.35							WOS:000255321800005

Survival of Sarcopoterium Spinosum seedlings growing on terra rossa soil	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Seedling survival of the dwarf shrub Sarcopoterium spinosum growing on hilly terra rossa soil was monitored between 2000 and 2004 on forty 1 x 1-m quadrats, each of which contained a single shrub. Of the 40 shrubs, 20 (designated P+) received a dressing of super-phosphate in 1988 and 20 (designated P-) did not. After seed dispersal in 1999, the shrubs were uprooted to prevent further addition of seeds. Seed dispersal was monitored up to 50 cm from the edge of the mother shrub. There were large year-to-year differences in emergence that were not clearly related to the rainfall distribution. On the P+ quadrats the peak biomass of herbaceous vegetation was consistently greater and the number of emergent seedlings was consistently smaller than on the P- quadrats, but seedling survival was not related to differences in herbaceous biomass. Our main conclusions are: S. spinosum germination is extremely erratic from year to year; only 0.5 of an average of 8-14 seedlings m(-2) that emerged, survived the first summer; these survivors had a good chance of becoming established plants; seedlings can become established in dense herbaceous vegetation; seedling dispersal was limited to 50 cm from the edge of the shrub; the current soil seed bank can maintain recruitment for at least 5 years without replenishment.																	0792-9978	2223-8980					2007	55	1					45	51		10.1560/IJPS.55.1.45							WOS:000255321800006

The contribution of persistent soil seed banks and flooding to the restoration of alluvial meadows	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Restoration of species-rich flood meadows impoverished by agricultural. intensification is an important challenge. The relationships between flooding regime and soil seed bank were compared in three successive meadow communities (hygrophilic mesohygrophilic and mesophilic) distinguished along a topographic and hydric gradient. Differences in flood duration and frequency between the three associations allowed the study of the contribution of floods to soil seed bank richness and density. No significant difference was found in species richness among the three soil seed banks, whereas the densities were significantly higher in the wettest community. The three seed bank compositions were clearly distinguished along the hydric gradient. In fact, the three seed bank types constituted a species poor version of the meadow communities to which they belong. Flood contributions appear to play a minor rote in seed bank enrichment. Thus, seed dispersal by flood water would probably be insufficient to enable the restoration of alluvial meadows. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

Link, a monsoon desert annual, in two different habitats	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A demographic study of Senna occidentalis (L.) Link, a circumtropical weed, was conducted at two habitats: an old-field (a moister site) and a waste ground (a drier site). The survivorship curves of both the populations closely corresponded to Deevy type I (greater age-specific mortality at higher age). Moisture stress appeared to be the major cause of mortality. Seed rain occurred essentially during October with the highest seed-fall in the second and third weeks. Seed predation by bruchids was greater for the waste ground population compared to that of the old-field. The extent of seed predation differed significantly among individuals between the populations. Seed densities in soil at both the sites declined remarkably in late August due to rainfall and consequent germination while the seed bank was elevated in November due to production and dispersal. The proportional allocation of biomass to roots was small for both the populations. Reproductive allocation of biomass and phosphorus varied considerably between populations. Reproductive allocation of biomass and particularly phosphorus was much greater for the old-field compared to the waste ground population. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.				Shaukat, S.

Restoration of Stipa kryloviisteppes in Inner Mongolia of China: Assesment of seed banks and vegetation composition	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The landscapes of Inner Mongolia are widely known for the vast Stipa krylovii steppes. However, overgrazing and other improper land uses have extensively degraded the Stipa krylovii steppe ecosystem in recent decades. Knowledge about the soil seed banks and the remaining vegetation in these damaged ecosystems is crucial for guiding the restoration efforts. Using a germination method, this study examined the size, composition, and species richness of the soil seed banks in three field types: overgrazed steppe, enclosed steppe and abandoned crop field. The abandoned crop field had the largest soil seed bank with mostly annual and weedy plant species. Seeds of desirable perennial grass species were impoverished by the intensive cultivation in the abandoned crop field. The lack of desirable perennial species in the abandoned field was a critical limiting factor for restoration. Grazing decreased the size of the seed bank in the overgrazed steppe. But seeds of desirable grassland species were present in both the overgrazed and the enclosed steppes. As indicated by the Sorenson's indices of community similarity (50-67%), plant species abundance and composition in the soil seed banks were closely related to the corresponding vegetation for each of the three sites.

Horizontally, the total number of seeds per unit area decreased from the shrub canopy center to intershrub areas, and most seeds were found under shrub canopies. Vertically, the highest proportion of seeds was found at depths of 5-10 cm. The emergence percentage, seedling mass, and seedling height, which were significantly affected by both burial depth and seed size, were highest at the optimal burial depth of 2 cm, and decreased with increasing burial depth in each seed size-class. Although seedling mass was usually greatest for large seeds and least for small seeds at each burial depth, little difference was observed in seedling height at shallow burial depths of 0-3 cm. The population shows a patchy and discontinuous distribution pattern. Population height increases with increasing sand depth. Also the density increases with increasing depth of sand in the desert; however, there is a steady decrease when the depth of and is more than 100 cm. This result indicates that the depth of sand that is most suitable for the growth of Nitraria sphaerocarpa is 100 cm. The size of the population is significantly correlated with the sand depth, which increases with increasing depth in the desert.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2007	19	4					482	487		10.1016/S1001-0742(07)60081-3							WOS:000245721800019	17918649

DNA is easy to extract from most plant tissues and can be stored for long periods in DNA banks. Curation methods are well developed for other botanical resources such as herbaria, seed banks and botanic gardens, but procedures for the establishment and maintenance of DNA banks have not been well documented. This paper reviews the curation of DNA banks for the characterisation and utilisation of biodiversity and provides guidelines for DNA bank management. It surveys existing DNA banks and outlines their operation. It includes a review of plant DNA collection, preservation, isolation, storage, database management and exchange procedures. We stress that DNA banks require full integration with existing collections such as botanic gardens, herbaria and seed banks, and information retrieval systems that link such facilities, bioinformatic resources and other DNA banks. They also require efficient and well-regulated sample exchange procedures. Only with appropriate curation will maximum utilisation of DNA collections be achieved.

Seed bank response to wet heat and the vegetation structure of a Virginia pocosin	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Pocosins are shrub wetlands of the southeastern coastal plain maintained by fire. Increased herbaceous plant diversity has been reported after wildfire. To test the effect of radiant heating on the seed bank of pocosin-upland ecotones, wet heat treatments were applied to Sphagnum substrate from a Virginia small depression pocosin. The seedling emergence method was used to quantify wetland seedling abundance and richness. Extant vegetation was measured at each seed bank sampling area and the seed bank and vegetation were compared with Sorenson similarity values. No significant seedling abundance, richness, or evenness effects were detected among wet heat and control groups. However, the high wet heat treatment (75 degrees C) significantly reduced the density of Sphagnum cuspidatum capitula more than 80% relative to the control. Mean seed bank density was 6,209 seedlings/m(2) (richness = 11) and was dominated by Scirpus cyperinus (97.8%), contained many early successional species. The seed bank did not closely resemble the extant vegetation. Pocosin canopy was sparse and dominated by Pinus serotina. The shrub-sapling stratum indicated co-dominance of Acer rubrum and ericaceous species, potentially indicating a shift from a shrub bog to a wet pine-hardwood community.																	1095-5674					JAN-FEB	2007	134	1					80	88		10.3159/1095-5674(2007)134[80:SBRTWH]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000246986000009

Relationship between community structure and seed bank to describe successional dynamics of an Atlantic Coast maritime forest	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Relationships between current community composition and the soil seed bank were investigated within a maritime forest on Virginia's Eastern Shore. Forty families, 48 genera, and 52 species were documented in the current community. Three overstory species (Liquidambar styraciflua, Acer ruibrum, and Pinus taeda) were dominants and comprised 72% of all overstory trees sampled. Analysis of stem size classes indicated that P. taeda was not recruiting and would eventually be replaced by hardwoods. Ilex opaca, Toxicodendron radicans, and Lonicera japonica comprised the majority of cover in the understory. The forest was in a mid-successional seral stage. In comparison, 31 families, 43 genera, and 45 species were identified from the seed bank. Seed bank composition was largely distinct from the aboveground community, although seven tree species that emerged from the seed bank were present in the overstory. Dissimilarity between the present community and seed bank indicated that replacement of existing species is likely to occur from future seed rain, especially from bird-dispersal. Presence of invasive species within the overstory, understory, and seed bank may alter forest succession.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JAN-FEB	2007	134	1					89	98		10.3159/1095-5674(2007)134[89:RBCSAS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000246986000010

The rate of emergence is highest during spring (April, May) and autumn (September, October). On low-nutrient soils and in near-row crops the plants create small forms but also these small plants reproduce and so they can enrich the soil seed bank. From this seed bank Geranium plants emerge in high rates in following years. Plants in nutrient rich wide-row crops are much larger. This weed shows relatively high tolerance to many herbicides (it can even tolerate low closes of glyphosate) and more over, it can emerge very well after the decrease of residual effect of soil applied herbicides. This can bring problems especially in root crops and in vegetable stands. In herbicide treated Sugar beet stands this weed species can not succeed. The reason is in sufficient efficacy of commonly used herbicide combinations (desmedipham + phenmedipham) and relatively slow growth of Geranium in early growth stages.

G. tetrahit emerge mostly from upper soil layers, the majority of seedlings occur during April. Depends on actual weather conditions, the emergence can take place also in May. The rate of emergence decrease during following period and during summer and autumn occurs only on fields with dense soil seed bank of this species. Under suitable moisture conditions, G. tetrahit can grow to strong plants and so this weed can strongly compete with the crop (especially potatoes and pulses) and produce large amounts of seeds. Even if this is not a typical weed of sugar beet stands, we can occasionally find it there, especially in the marginal areas of beet production.

Because red tide algal blooms usually occur unexpectedly, seagrass responses to the microalgal blooms have rarely been documented. A red tide caused by a dense bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo, a noxious red-tide-causing alga of temperate and subtropical waters, occurred at a study site on the south coast of Korea in late May 2002. Because the red-tide event occurred on an eelgrass bed where seagrass monitoring was being conducted, pre-event conditions were well documented. Nearly all eelgrass shoots disappeared rapidly because of the reduction in light caused by the algal bloom. Additionally, a thick layer of mucilaginous material secreted from algal cysts suffocated eelgrass plants for weeks, directly causing eelgrass death. Eelgrass seedlings were found in the die-off area from December 2002; < 1 yr after its destruction, the site was completely re-established by seedling recruitment via germination from the seed bank. Seedling mortality was very low. Seedlings grew exponentially during the spring, and their fast growth also contributed to rapid eelgrass recolonization. During the second year of recolonization, asexual reproduction through lateral shoot production by rhizome elongation and branching played the main role in the persistence and growth of the eelgrass bed. Seed density in the seed bank varied seasonally, increasing to a maximum after seed release and decreasing to nearly zero after seed germination. Many more seedlings were found and nearly all seedlings established successfully in the first year after the bloom, when no adult eelgrass shoots were observed, suggesting significant effects of shoot density on rates of seed germination and seedling establishment. This was a unique opportunity to examine eelgrass responses to dense microalgal blooms, which provided valuable information on the die-off process caused by red tide and the natural recolonization of seagrass after its destruction.																	0171-8630						2007	342						105	115		10.3354/meps342105							WOS:000248895700009

Most freshly-matured seeds of Colubrina oppositifolia have water-impermeable seed coats (physical dormancy). At 28(12 h)/20(12 h), 25(12 h)/15(12 h) degrees C and ca. 24 degrees C (room temperatures), 99-100% of the seeds imbibed, and 96-100% of the seeds that germinated did so in 27-34 days. Daily weighing of individual seeds showed that start of imbibition (= 5% increase in mass) at room temperature ranged from < 1 to 20 days. Thus, at high temperature, physical dormancy is broken so rapidly that technically most seeds would be classified as nondormant (i.e. germinate in <= 30 days). At 15(12 h)/6(12 h) and 20(12 h)/10(12 h) degrees C, 93 and 96%, respectively, of the seeds had imbibed after 30 days, but only 12 and 50%, respectively, of the seeds that germinated did so in 30 days. Eleven months of dry storage at room temperatures increased rates of imbibition and germination of seeds incubated at 28/20 and 20/10 degrees C. Based on the relatively rapid rates at which seeds become water-permeable and germinate when incubated on a moist substrate, we predict that the soil seed bank of this endangered species may be only short-lived. Thus, seeds would imbibe and germinate (or die) during the first wet season following their dispersal.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JAN	2007	27	1					25	30		10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[25:IAGOSO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000244138000004						
J	Klimesova, J; Klimes, L				Klimesova, Jitka; Klimes, Leoa			Bud banks and their role in vegetative regeneration - A literature review and proposal for simple classification and assessment	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												While sexual regeneration of plants after disturbance is relatively well understood, vegetative regeneration has attracted some attention only recently. Its role along environmental gradients and across biomes is poorly known and standard methods for assessment are not yet established. We review current knowledge about the role of bud banks in vegetative regeneration and the diversity of their modes of functioning. The similarities and differences between bud banks and seed banks are illustrated, focusing on dormancy, dispersability, seasonal dynamics, longevity and storage of carbohydrates. We try to formulate some principles that unity bud bank functioning across habitats and growth forms: (1) the bud banks consist of all buds which may be used for vegetative regeneration, including those formed adventitiously only after injury; (2) vertical distribution of buds reflects avoidance of disturbance; (3) seasonal changes in the bud bank make vegetative regeneration sensitive to timing of disturbance; and (4) ability to form adventitious buds provides a potential for vegetative regeneration from roots, stumps and leaves. Based on these principles, a simple classification of bud banks is presented similar to the classification of seed banks. Bud bank traits are considered in relation to severity, timing and frequency of disturbance. These include vertical distribution and seasonal fluctuations in the number of buds. Methods for quantitative assessment of bud numbers and resprouting capacity are reviewed, and a new approach based on indirect bud counts is proposed. The suggested concept of bud banks may be widely used in studies focusing on plant functional traits in relation to disturbance regimes at the levels of plant individuals, populations and communities. Its further development may incorporate adjustments for areas with lion-seasonal climate and refinements for some growth forms, such as epiphytes. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

J	Pino, J; de Roa, E				Pino, Joan; de Roa, Enric			Population biology of Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (Malvaceae) in the Llobregat delta (Catalonia, NE of Spain)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Field experiments and wild population monitoring have been performed to study the population biology of the rare long-lived Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (Malvaceae) in the Llobregat delta (Catalonia, NE Spain). Field experiments explored the fate of seeds in soil at different depths, seedling emergence, and seedling survival, growth and flowering with and without canopy cover during the first 2 years of life. They also were used to ascertain the size-related pattern of seedling survivorship and flowering. Field data concerning mortality, growth and fecundity of adult plants were collected yearly in three wild populations for 7-9 years. In old adults (reproducing long before the beginning of the study), ANOVAR tests were performed to compare maximum diameter, total and fertile shoots, and viable seeds per plant between years and populations. New adults (starting flowering the first year of study or in subsequent years) were used to explore, using linear and polynomial regressions, the association of RGR and both total and fertile shoot production with (i) plant size (maximum basal diameter or its logarithm); (ii) plant age (years in adult stage); and (iii) plant age after removing the effect of size and year-to-year fluctuations. In this case, we examined the age-related pattern of the residuals obtained from the regressions with size and year. The study identified the following main demographic features of K. pentacarpos: (i) transient, shallow soil seed bank; (ii) shade tolerance of seedling emergence; (iii) canopy-facilitation of seedling survival and bolting during the first two years of life; (iv) size-related pattern for seedling survivorship but not flowering; (v) exclusive dependence on a fluctuating seed output for reproduction; (vi) rapid adult growth; and (vii) high adult longevity but (viii) rapid depletion of fecundity with age. Seed output was highly constrained by mining insects. The changing size-structure and the decreasing reproductive success of old adults in several populations suggest that K. pentacarpos might undergo a dynamics of population establishment and extinction in the Ricarda marshes. Because of fluctuating reproduction and the lack of a persistent seed bank, the conservation of standing adult populations appears to be a key factor to ensure the persistence of the species.

J	Smith, RGB; Brock, MA				Smith, R. Geoff. B.; Brock, Margaret A.			The ups and downs of life on the edge: The influence of water level fluctuations on biomass allocation in two contrasting aquatic plants	PLANT ECOLOGY												Plant communities at wetland edges typically exhibit strong zonation along water depth gradients, although community structure is not as simple as this common observation may suggest. Water levels fluctuate at many temporal scales and in varied patterns. Understanding of how water regime controls plant community structure requires information on how individual species are affected by water regime. The allocation of biomass to roots, tillers, stolons and inflorescences was measured over 16 weeks in two species of aquatic plants with contrasting life histories. Juncus articulatus L. produces large numbers of small seeds while Glyceria australis C. E. Hubb produces small numbers of large seeds. Both species also reproduce vegetatively. Changes in biomass allocation were measured in response to duration, frequency and amplitude of water level fluctuations. The fluctuations in water level were achieved by suspending plants in pots from chains and raising and lowering the pots in and out of water in replicate tanks. There were complex responses to water regime components. As is common to many emergents, both species increased allocation to above ground vegetative structures in response to increasing water depth. Differences between the species in overall patterns of allocation reflected differences in life history. Juncus articulatus showed greater overall biomass production and greater proportional resource allocation to inflorescences than Glyceria australis. There were other differences in response to components of water regime that distinguished the species, mainly in allocation to reproduction in response to the range of depths (amplitude) and extended dry periods. These different functional responses to aspects of water level fluctuations indicate it may be possible to manipulate species composition if water levels are controllable. The most important characteristics of water regime were threshold events such as extremes of depth and dry periods. These may not be captured in measures of water regime such as average water levels.

Review of mathematical models of weed seed bank dynamics	PLANTA DANINHA												Plant growth follows certain physiological principles that can be quantitatively described, up to a certain extent, by mathematical equations.

Spatial relationships between soil seed bank and seedling populations of Hordeum spontaneum and Cardaria draba in saffron fields	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IIND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SAFFRON BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Symposium on Saffron Biology and Technology	OCT 28-30, 2006	Mashhad, IRAN	Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Ctr Excellence Special Crops, Fac Agr, Jehad e Agr Org Khorasan e Razavi, Govenor Gen S Khorasn, Birjand Int Saffron Export Co, Union Saffron Sellers Mashhad, Assoc Khorasan e Razavi Rural Cooperat, Assoc Iranian Saffron Growers Cooperat				Geostatistical techniques were used to characterize the spatial relationship between Hordeum spontaneum and Cardaria draba seedlings and soil seed bank over the entire growing season of 2004-2005 in three saffron (Crocus sativus L.) fields, located in Southern Khorasan (33 degrees North latitude, 57 degrees East longitude), Iran. The maps of H. spontaneum seed bank density corresponded moderately to those seedling densities in a and strongly to those in b and c fields. The emergence percentage of Cardaria draba was higher than for H. spontaneum in all fields. Semivariograms showed spatial autocorrelation in seed bank and seedling populations of H. spontaneum and C. druba in all fields. Grey-scale field maps of C. draba seed banks corresponded visually to maps of seedling populations and could have been used to target control efforts, but visual correspondence between H. spontaneum seed bank and seedling maps was poor.

Seed germination biology of intermountain populations of fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens : Chenopodiaceae)	PROCEEDINGS: SHRUBLAND DYNAMICS-FIRE AND WATER	USDA FOREST SERVICE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RESEARCH STATION PROCEEDINGS				Conference on Shrubland Dynamics-Fire and Water	AUG 10-12, 2004	Lubbock, TX					Fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) is a widely distributed shrub of semiarid western North America. We studied viability and germinability of fourwing saltbush seeds over 10 years for collections from 23 Intermountain populations. Fruit fill averaged 53 percent, and 96 percent of filled fruits contained viable seeds even after 6 years of laboratory storage. Seed collections were generally dormant to some degree at harvest and lost dormancy via two processes, moist chilling and after-ripening in dry storage. Prolonged chilling (24 wks) substituted for dry after-ripening, resulted in germination percentages similar to those obtained without chilling after 2 years of storage. Collections from warm desert habitats were generally least dormant, while collections from pinyon-juniper and mountain brush habitats were highly dormant. But these trends were not very strong. Seeds of the diploid population from Jericho Dunes were essentially nondormant at harvest, while those from a population near Page, Arizona, were essentially completely dormant. Unchilled seeds did not germinate to any degree until tested after 10 years of storage. Patterns of dormancy loss suggest that this species is opportunistic and generally able to establish in response to either winter or summer precipitation. In addition, its seeds probably form persistent seed banks in the field.																							2007		47					153	162									WOS:000252688700023

Does Geijera parviflora Lindl (Rutaceae) facilitate understorey species in semi-arid Australia?	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Species composition under tree canopies often differs from that of surrounding micro-environments. In arid and semi-arid zones, trees can be beneficial to understorey vegetation. This study examined zones of vegetation composition and soil physiochemical parameters associated with Geijera parviflora Lindl. The importance of shade, rainfall redistribution, seed bank and soil moisture were examined. Species abundance, soil moisture, seed bank composition, rainfall redistribution and soil nutrient concentration were measured under five randomly selected mature G. parviflora trees in south-western New South Wales, Australia. To complement the findings from this study, artificial shade plots were constructed in a canopy-free area and species abundance measured seven months after shade construction. The study demonstrated that G. parviflora was associated with zonation of understorey vegetation. Two zones of understorey vegetation were found in relation to G. parviflora: (i) under the tree canopy with high species diversity, and ( ii) beyond the canopy, this community being dominated by Dissocarpus paradoxus throughout the year with Crassula colorata appearing after rainfall. The zone beyond the canopy also had lower soil nutrient concentrations. Soil moisture, nutrient concentration and the seed bank density were significantly higher under the canopy. However, the canopy reduced precipitation reaching the soil surface. The effects of the canopy on understorey species composition and soil moisture were enhanced after winter rainfall. Artificial shade increased species abundance and richness under a 90%-shading treatment. The results indicated that G. parviflora generated spatial heterogeneity over the broader plant community increasing species richness, abundance and diversity under the canopy. This emphasises the importance of arid zone trees in conserving understorey plant diversity. Shading, soil nutrient concentration and increased seed bank density and soil moisture appeared to be key influences on the plant communities under the canopy.

Exploiting diversity to manage weeds in agro-ecosystems	SCALE AND COMPLEXITY IN PLANT SYSTEMS RESEARCH: GENE-PLANT-CROP RELATIONS	WAGENINGEN UR FRONTIS SERIES				International Frontis Workshop on Gene-Plant-Crop Relations: Scale and Complexity in Plant Systems Research	APR 23-26, 2006	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS					Weed management systems that rely less on chemical control are needed globally. Next to curative chemical weed control, there are other ways of tackling weed problems, such as (a) reduction of the weed seed bank in the soil, (b) reduced recruitment of weed seeds from the soil seed bank, and (c) strengthening the relative competitive ability of the crop. A number of case studies are presented in which diversity is used as a basis for improved weed management. In the first case study, diversity refers to genetic variation within a crop species, which is utilized in breeding programmes aiming at the development of more competitive cultivars. In the other case studies, diversity refers to the reinforcement of weakly competitive crop species through the addition of a second species that contains a strong weed-suppressing function. Here a distinction is made between intercropping, where the species are grown simultaneously, and sequential or rotational cropping, where a cover crop is introduced in the cropping interval in between two main crops. Weed-competitive cultivars, intercropping and rotational cover cropping all have potential to contribute significantly to the weed management of agro-ecosystems. Rather than making curative control completely redundant, they allow the regular curative control measures to be applied at a lower dose or in a less frequent manner. The weed-suppressive effect was largely determined by the combined effects of genotype (or species) and management. Obtaining a sufficient level of weed suppression while maintaining the yielding ability is a major issue in the development of weed-competitive cultivars and the design of intercropping systems. In both cases, competition models showed to be useful tools to analyse and optimize systems. Opportunities and potential obstacles for implementation of the proposed strategies are discussed.

High viability recorded in ultra-dry seeds of 37 species of Brassicaceae after almost 40 years of storage	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Final germination percentages of 25 accessions of Brassicaceae from the UPM (Universidad Politdenica de Madrid) seed bank were evaluated after 38-40 years of storage. The seeds were preserved at temperatures between -5 degrees C and -10 degrees C in flame sealed vials containing dehydrated (blue) silica gel. Seed moisture content ranged between 0.3 and 3% (f.w.b) after storage. Most accessions (tell Out of twelve) with high initial (before storage) germination rate (low initial dormancy) maintained these high values almost intact after storage (91-100% germination). In two accessions, seeds had developed a secondary dormancy, which was successfully overcome by scarification. A second set of 13 accessions had low initial germination rates (0-20%, i.e. high initial dormancy). In one accession, dormancy had been broken during storage (92% germination) and in nine accessions germination was significantly enhanced by GA, and or scarification. Seed dormancy most often decreases during storage but it may also increase or remain unchanged. The consideration of these dormancy variations is very important when evaluating seed longevity in wild species. The preservation method based on silica gel and low temperature (-5 degrees C and -10 degrees C) has proved highly efficient at least for Brassicaceac. Vials with seeds of 12 additional accesssions had remained at room temperature during 34-39 years and those seeds showed germination percentages that were similar to those preserved in the cold room. This result suggests that temperature might not be as important as expected - at least for medium-term preservation - and supports the possibility of using ultra-dry methods.				Gonzalez-Benito, M.

Germination responses of four wild species to diurnal increase or decrease in temperature	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Seedling emergence in a single growth season from the seed bank and the effect of a daily gradual increase or decrease in temperature on germination of four wild species, viz. C. virgata, H. grandiflora, E. crusgalli and C. divaricatum were evaluated. We hypothesized that seeds germinated more in spring than in autumn in the study area and the diurnal increase or decrease in temperature played a critical role in controlling germination timing. Four ranges of temperature (5-10, 10-15, 15-20 and 20-25 degrees C) were used and there were two opposite schemes in each range, with one increasing temperature by 0.5 degrees C every day, the other decreasing temperature by 0.5 degrees C every day. Seedling emergence in May and June was significantly higher than in September and October. Three species showed significant differences in germination between diurnal increased and decreased temperature in the ranges 5-10 and 10-15 degrees C, with the exception of C. divaricatum. Diurnal increase in temperature promoted germination. At the optimum temperature range for germination (15-20 and 20-25 degrees C), this response of seeds to daily increased temperature was not observed. This study has revealed the adaptive strategy of these species to diurnal increased temperature in spring and the diurnal decreased temperature in autumn.																	0251-0952						2007	35	2					291	302		10.15258/sst.2007.35.2.05							WOS:000249514100005

Dormancy classification and potential dormancy-breaking cues for shrub species from fire-prone south-eastern Australia	SEEDS: BIOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGY					8th International Workshop on Seeds	MAY, 2005	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Plant Sci, Bayer CropSci, Griffith Univ Ctr Forestry & Horticultural Res, ISSS				Ecological studies require a clear understanding of the processes of dormancy release and germination. In fire-prone environments, implying that seeds are dormant because of a lack of germination from a soil-stored seed bank can confound results of experiments aimed at identifying dormancy mechanisms of fresh seeds. In this study, dormancy classification is endorsed as a starting point for establishing mechanisms that control dormancy of species from fire-prone vegetation. Shrub species within the physical dormancy (PY), physiological dormancy (PD), morphological dormancy (MD) and morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) classes were found to occur in the south-eastern Australian region in proportions similar to that of other fire-prone regions. Seasonal temperatures, not fire cues, are the main factors that break physiologically related dormancy mechanisms and can also control the timing of germination. Seasonal emergence patterns are more likely for species with a PD component than for those with PY. This can delay seedling emergence depending on the timing of the fire event, particularly in regions without a distinct rainfall season, and potentially hinder recruitment. Species with MPD and PD may therefore be more sensitive to seasonal shifts in the fire regime, and this could have implications for community species composition and threatened species management.

The effect of light intensity on seed production and quality in a number of Australian wild oat (Avena fatua L.) lines	SEEDS: BIOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGY					8th International Workshop on Seeds	MAY, 2005	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Plant Sci, Bayer CropSci, Griffith Univ Ctr Forestry & Horticultural Res, ISSS				Several aspects of the maternal environment (e.g. air temperature, soil moisture, soil nutritional status and photoperiod) are known to influence seed production and quality in a range of plant species. However, little is known about the effect of other environmental factors, such as the light intensity perceived by the developing plant, on these seed characters. This is particularly important when elucidating the persistence mechanisms of annual weeds that may produce seeds under a crop canopy. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of light intensity on the reproductive characteristics of a number of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) lines originating from a range of 61116 locations in Australia. Under a reduced light intensity and in the absence of competition, the overall plant growth, seed production, seed weight and depth of seed dormancy (but not seed viability) were all reduced compared with that seen in plants growing in full sunlight. In addition, the reduced light intensity conditions significantly increased plant height and reduced tiller production, but did not affect leaf area production. In general, these responses were the same for all six lines studied and indicate that the reduced light intensity perceived by late germinating weeds present within a crop canopy causes the production of seeds with traits that are likely to result in rapid loss from the soil seed bank. In addition, all lines grown under the reduced light intensity conditions had an extended development time (up to 70 days), that it would be unlikely that they would reach maturity before the crop was harvested, and therefore would not be able to return any seed to the soil seed bank.																			978-1-84593-197-1				2007							383	+		10.1079/9781845931971.0383							WOS:000251161900040

Plant dispersal strategies, seed bank distribution and germination of Negev Desert species	SEEDS: BIOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGY					8th International Workshop on Seeds	MAY, 2005	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Plant Sci, Bayer CropSci, Griffith Univ Ctr Forestry & Horticultural Res, ISSS				In a natural flat area of deep loess soil in the Negev Desert of Israel, near Sede Boker, the distribution of seeds of different species, in the seed bank, is a result of their strategies of seed dispersal, seed size and structure and seed germination. Samples were collected in summer from 39 plots measuring 350cm(2). In Carrichtera annua (L.) DC., which has a protection strategy, seeds are enclosed in lignified structures as aerial seed banks on the dry and lignified plant until they are dispersed by rain. Of 3244 C. annua seeds, 3110 were found in the aerial seed bank. In Spergularia diandra (Guss.) Heldr. & Sart., which has an escape strategy, the tiny dust-like mature seeds are dispersed into cracks in the soil by wind. Of 1043 seeds, 896 were found in the upper 0-1 cut layer of soil and only 99 at a depth of 1-2 cm. No seeds remained on the dry plants. Neotorularia torulosa (Desf.) Hedge & J. Leonard has developed a dual dispersal strategy. Of 954 N. torulosa seeds, 630 were found protected in the aerial seed bank. The rest were dispersed by wind, 177 escaped into the upper 0-1 cm layer of soil and 147 were at a depth of 1-2 cm.																			978-1-84593-197-1				2007							407	415		10.1079/9781845931971.0407							WOS:000251161900042

In this chapter we review some aspects of the seed biology of Australian tropical forest and woodland communities. Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge of seed biology of most species and some habitats in tropical Australia. Although much less research has been carried out on the tropical flora, in comparison with the temperate flora of Australia, some general trends begin to emerge from published studies. The Eucalyptus-dominated forest and woodland flora have a bimodal peak in seed production, with the woody vegetation flowering towards the end of the dry winter season, and the herb and grass understorey flowering around the end of the wet season. The rainforest communities show extended fruit production with a peak around early summer (i.e. December). These communities do not maintain a large seed bank. Many species produce dormant seeds, but for most species seed dormancy is broken at the beginning of the following summer wet season.

Saving seeds, saving culture: A case study of a heritage seed bank	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												This article examines a heritage seed saving organization, the Seed Savers Exchange (SSE), a nonprofit seed bank in northeastern Iowa. To begin, I focus on how SSE conceives of seeds and nature more broadly. From here, the analysis moves to understand how these "ideas" of nature shape the materiality that is ultimately conserved. Next, the value statements of conservation are analyzed. All conservation policies and practices rest upon normative assumptions about what type of nature ought to be conserved. The final section sets out to detail what some of those value statements are as they relate to SSE, and how they are used to instill within people similar commitments to conservation overall and seed saving in particular. When taken together, these three components - (1) conceptions of nature, (2) the materiality being conserved, and (3) the values embedded in all conservation practices - signify what I call the "trialectic of conservation".																	0894-1920						2007	20	8					739	750		10.1080/08941920601091345							WOS:000248725100005

Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for conservation and management	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												In response to ever-increasing anthropogenic changes to natural ecosystems, regional, national and international organizations have established guidelines for monitoring biological diversity. Most monitoring programs, however, do not take full advantage of the potential afforded by molecular genetic markers, which can provide information relevant to both ecological and evolutionary time frames, while costing less and being more sensitive and reliable than traditional monitoring approaches. As several molecular and computational approaches are relatively new, many technical and theoretical issues remain to be resolved. Here, we illustrate how DNA and population genetic data can provide valuable information, often unattainable via other approaches, for monitoring species of management, conservation and ecological interest.

Seed size and burial effects on giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida) emergence and seed demise	WEED SCIENCE												Giant ragweed is a competitive, allergenic weed that persists in agricultural fields and early successional sites. Field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of seed size and seed burial depth on giant ragweed emergence and seed demise. In a seedling emergence experiment, small (< 4.8 mm in diameter) and large (> 6.6 mm in diameter) seeds were buried 0, 5, 10, and 20 cm in fall 1997, and weed emergence was monitored over the next seven growing seasons. A generalized linear mixed model fit to the cumulative emergence data showed that maximum emergence for both seed sizes occurred at the 5-cm burial depth, where probability of emergence was 19% for small seeds and 49% for large seeds. Emergence probability at the 10-cm burial depth was 9% for small seeds and 30% for large seeds, and no seedlings emerged from the 20-cm burial depth. The model predicted that >= 98% of total cumulative emergence was completed after four growing seasons for large seeds buried 5 cm, five growing seasons for small seeds buried 5 cm and large seeds buried 10 cm, and seven growing seasons for small seeds buried 10 cm. Seed size and burial treatment effects on seed demise were tested in a second experiment using seed packets. Rates of seed demise were inversely proportional to burial depth, and the percentage of viable seeds remaining after 4 yr ranged from 0% on the soil surface to 19% at the 20-cm burial depth. Some seeds recovered from the 20-cm burial depth were viable after 9 yr of burial. These results, coupled with previous research, suggest that seed size polymorphism facilitates giant ragweed adaptation across habitats and that a combination of no-tillage cropping practices, habitat modification, and timely weed control measures can reduce its active seed bank in agricultural fields by 90% or more after 4 yr.																	0043-1745					JAN-FEB	2007	55	1					16	22		10.1614/WS-06-109.1							WOS:000243891400004

Influence of seed depth and pathogens on fatal germination of velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi)	WEED SCIENCE												Fatal germination of weed seeds occurs when a weed seed germinates, but the seedling dies before reaching the soil surface. Controlled-environment bioassays of velvetleaf and giant foxtail seed fate in Michigan field soil (Kalamazoo silt loam, 1.1% soil organic matter) were used to determine the role of pathogenic fungi and seed burial depth in fatal germination of these species. Fatal germination at 2 cm seed depth was nonexistent for giant foxtail, and rare (< 10% of seeds studied) for velvetleaf. At greater depths, fatal germination remained close to zero for giant foxtail, whereas it increased to as high as 40% for velvetleaf at a 10-cm burial depth. Cultures taken from fatally germinated velvetleaf seedlings were found to contain Pythium ultimum, a soilborne pathogen known as the causal agent for pea root rot. When samples of infected media taken from these cultures were used to inoculate field soil in pots, fatal germination of velvetleaf from depths of 4 to 6 cm increased, compared with field soil inoculated with sterile media. At seed burial depths of 8 and 10 cm, fatal germination of velvetleaf increased to 20 and 40%, respectively, and was the same for unsterilized soil and P. ultimum-inoculated soil. Given that maximal fatal germination of velvetleaf occurred in the unsterilized soil treatment at the 10 cm depth, burial of newly shed velvetleaf seeds to a 10 cm, or possibly greater, depth with tillage equipment may be a practical way of reducing velvetleaf seed banks through fatal germination.

Wallace			Forest-floor treatments in Arizona ponderosa pine restoration ecosystems: No short-term effects on plant communities	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Leaf litter accumulation during fire exclusion and increases in tree density in postsettlement southwestern Pinus ponderosa forests may limit the establishment of understory vegetation. We performed an experiment in P. ponderosa forests of northern Arizona to ascertain plant community responses to forest-floor scarification and Oi removal on thirty-six 100-m(2) plots overlaid on an existing ecological restoration experiment that involved tree thinning, pes, forest-floor treatments had no effect and prescribed burning. Constrasting with findings from many other forest types, forest-floor treatments had no effect on community diversity or composition during the 2-year experiment. Sorensen similarities were as high as 97% between posttreatment years within treatments; and successional vectors also provided little indication that treatments may appreciably affect longer-term successional trajectories. Lack of response to these fairly drastic treatments is surprising given these forests' exceptionally heavy Oi horizons and large proportions of conifer litter. Apparently shading, belowground competition for water or nutrients, or other tree-associated factors more strongly limit understory communities than does leaf litter. Based on sparse A-horizon seed banks averaging < 300 seeds . m(-2) and limited aboveground vegetation, we hypothesize that seed shortages, particularly for native perennials, also partly precluded a treatment response. Because extensive unvegetated areas at these restoration sites may be colonized by exotics, conservative management strategies could include testing the seeding or outplanting of desirable native species as an option for filling unoccupied microsites. Reporting of "no treatment effect" experiments such as this one is important to avoid biasing meta-analyses, as is future research to clarify combinations of factors limiting understory communities. Increased understanding of these limiting factors may lead to identification of other treatments that promote recovery of native species during ecological restoration in this region.																	1527-0904					JAN	2007	67	1					120	132		10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[120:FTIAPP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000245786700016

Many species previously common are now on the Red List. To discuss the conservation and management of rice field biodiversity, the flora and vegetation of rice fields in an area called Nakaikemi are described. Diverse flora developed in recently abandoned or plowed fields. Without management, diversity reduced as tall reedy invaders took over. Management and monitoring surveys were conducted to experimentally conserve and restore rice field biodiversity Many Red List plants grew in planted fields and in fallow fields plowed but not planted. The diverse species characteristic of cultivated and recently abandoned fields germinated in old abandoned fields after surface vegetation was removed. Our findings demonstrated that appropriate management is required to conserve biodiversity, and that rich species diversity can be restored in species-poor abandoned fields from existing seed banks.																			978-0-415-40820-2				2007							323	329									WOS:000252067700044

TreeMig: A forest-landscape model for simulating spatio-temporal patterns from stand to landscape scale	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					International Conference of the International-Environmental-Modelling-and-Software-Society	JUN 14-17, 2004	Osnabruck, GERMANY	Int Environm Modelling & Software Soc				Landscape patterns result from complex endogenous dynamics and heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Landscape models are appropriate tools for analysing such patterns. We present the dynamic, spatially explicit, grid-based and spatially linked forest-landscape model TreeMig. In each grid cell, the forest dynamics is simulated with a multi-species, height structured forest model, based on growth, competition and death of the trees in each height class. Within-cell heterogeneity is accounted for by assuming that trees are randomly distributed resulting in Poisson distributions of tree densities and light. Reproduction is modelled explicitly by seed production, seed bank dynamics, germination and sapling development. The forests in the different cells interact spatially through seed dispersal. The model is flexible and can be applied on a range of spatial scales, from single stands to entire regions. The model's ability to generate patterns was tested in two case studies with different spatial resolutions. The first case study shows simulations of pattern formation by endogenous dynamics on a small spatial scale. The simulations are conducted under spatially and temporally homogenous environmental conditions, initialized with seeds of all species in the Centre cell. The simulation shows transiently several types of patterns in the species biomasses: circular standing waves, patch structures and homogenous spread of dominant species. In the second, large-scale case study, the tree species' spread since the last Ice Age in the Alpine region of the Valais is simulated, under temporally and spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. The simulated spatio-temporal pattern consists of immigration waves of new species into empty or already forested areas, fast die-backs after sharp, strong temperature decreases, slower recolonization after temperature increases and spatial separation of the species according to the environmental conditions. The simulation indicates that the environment forms the basis for the endogenous dynamics, primarily migration and competition, which play a particular role during the transient phases after drastic changes in the boundary conditions (immigration and climate change). We conclude that the forest-landscape model TreeMig is able to produce landscape patterns resulting from both, endogenous dynamics and exogenous drivers and is suitable for a range of different applications.

To clarify the effects of thinning and distance from neighboring hardwood forests on hardwood establishment in conifer plantations. we measured the abundance and diversity of hardwoods at different life stages (seed-fall, soil seed bank, seedling, sapling) and environmental conditions (light, soil temperature, litter accumulation, and composition) from -2 to 40 m from the hardwood-coniferous forest boundary into the coniferous forest interior in five unthinned and four thinned stands in Cryptomeria japonica plantations in Japan. In unthinned stands, hardwood abundance and diversity decreased with increasing distance into the coniferous forest interior for all life stages, perhaps because of a distance-dependent decrease in seed-fall and the subsequent soil seed bank for wind- and bird-dispersed seeds. Higher light and soil temperatures and shallower litter accumulation were observed at the hardwood-coniferous forest boundary compared to the coniferous forest interior, suggesting favorable environmental conditions for germination, emergence, and seedling growth for hardwood species, and resulting in higher species diversity near the boundary. In thinned stands, hardwood abundance and diversity also decreased with increasing distance into the coniferous forest interior for seed-fall and the soil seed bank, but did not decrease for seedlings and saplings, probably because of distance-independent improvement of environmental conditions due to thinning. Higher light availability and soil temperature and lower litter accumulation in thinned stands enhance seedling establishment for not only shade-tolerant but also shade-intolerant and light-demanding species. Our results suggest that distance-dependent diversity of juvenile hardwoods in dense coniferous plantations is closely related to distance-dependent gradients in both seed-fall and environmental conditions, but thinning enhances diversity, even in the forest interior.

DELLA-mediated cotyledon expansion breaks coat-imposed seed dormancy	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Seed dormancy is a key adaptive trait in plants responsible for the soil seed bank. The long established hormone-balance theory describes the antagonistic roles of the dormancy promoting plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and the germination promoting hormone gibberellin (GA) in dormancy control [1-6]. Light, temperature, and other dormancy-breaking signals function to modulate the synthesis and perception of these hormones in the seed [7-10]. However, the way in which these hormones control dormancy in the imbibed seed remains unknown. Here, we show that the DELLA protein regulators of the GA response are required for dormancy and describe a model through which hormone signal integration and dormancy regulation is achieved. We demonstrate that cotyledon expansion precedes radicle emergence during Arabidopsis seed germination and that a striking correlation exists between final seedling cotyledon size and seed dormancy in the DELLA mutants. Furthermore, twelve previously characterized seed-dormancy mutants are also defective in the control of cotyledon size in a manner consistent with their effect on germination potential. We propose that DELLA-mediated, light-, temperature-, and hormone-responsive cotyledon expansion prior to radicle emergence overcomes dormancy imposed by the seed coat and underlies seed-dormancy control in Arabidopsis.

The role of area enclosures and fallow age in the restoration of plant diversity in northern Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This study investigated the roles played by area enclosures and fallow age in the restoration of plant species richness and soil seed bank species richness in degraded mountain rangelands in northern Ethiopia. Management types (enclosures versus grazed) influenced woody and herbaceous species richness, while fallow age showed no effect on the woody species. Management, age and the doubling of fallow age influenced the herbaceous species richness and species diversity. Management showed no effect on soil seed bank species richness. Fallow age and the doubling of fallow time also showed no influence on the soil seed bank of grass species, but they were influential on the forbs species soil seed bank. The trends for restoration of plant species richness and diversity and grass seed bank in response to fallow age were positive-linear, but they declined when the fallow ages were doubled. The exception was the forbs seed bank showed linear trends when age of restoration was doubled. The data suggest that the restoration of degraded rangelands in the high mountain zones of northern Ethiopia was still in the weedy succession stages. Long-term monitoring will be required to gain an informed understanding of the roles played by area enclosures and fallow age in the restoration of plant biodiversity.																	0141-6707					DEC	2006	44	4					507	514		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00664.x							WOS:000242197900011						
J	Campbell, ML; Clarke, PJ				Campbell, Monica L.; Clarke, Peter J.			Seed dynamics of resprouting shrubs in grassy woodlands: Seed rain, predators and seed loss constrain recruitment potential	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Measuring the fate of seeds between seed production and seedling establishment is critical in understanding mechanisms of recruitment limitation of plants. We examined seed fates to better understand the recruitment dynamics of four resprouting shrubs from two families (Fabaceae and Epacridaceae) in temperate grassy woodlands. We tested whether: (i) pre-dispersal seed predation affected seed rain; (ii) post-dispersal seed predation limited seed bank accumulation; (iii) the size of the seed bank was related to seed size; and (iv) viable seeds accumulated in the soil after seed rain. There was a distinct difference in seed production per plant between plant families with the legumes producing significantly more seeds per individual than the epacrids. Seed viability ranged from 43% to 81% and all viable had seed or fruit coat dormancy broken by heat or scarification. Pre-dispersal predation by Lepidopteran larvae removed a large proportion of seed from the legume seed rain but not the epacrids. Four species of ants (Notoncus ectatomoides, Pheidole sp., Rhytidoponera tasmaniensis and Iridomyrmex purpureus) were major post-dispersal seed removers. Overall, a greater percentage of Hardenbergia (38%) and Pultenaea (59%) seeds were removed than the fleshy fruits of Lissanthe (14%) or Melichrus (0%). Seed bank sizes were small (< 15 seeds m(-2)) relative to the seed rain and no significant accumulation of seed in the soil was detected. Lack of accumulation was attributed to seed predation as seed decay was considered unlikely and no seed germination was observed in our study sites. Our study suggests that seed predation is a key factor contributing to seed-limited recruitment in grassy woodland shrubs by reducing the number of seeds stored in the soil.

J	Jakobsson, A; Eriksson, O; Bruun, HH				Jakobsson, Anna; Eriksson, Ove; Bruun, Hans Henrik			Local seed rain and seed bank in a species-rich grassland: effects of plant abundance and seed size	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												In this study, we examined the relationship between seed size, seed rain, and seed bank in a species-rich perennial grassland in Sweden. The seed rain was monitored by 100 seed traps placed in a 10 m x 10 m area for 1 year. The seed bank was sampled by taking 100 soil samples, each in close vicinity to a seed trap. Abundance of reproductive ramets in the area was estimated, since this is likely to affect the proportion of hit seed traps and seed bank samples. When abundance of reproductive ramets was accounted for, we found a negative relationship between seed size and proportion of hit seed bank samples, but we found no relationship between seed size and proportion of hit seed traps. We found strong positive relationships between the abundance of reproductive ramets and proportion of hit seed traps and seed bank samples. We also found strong positive relationships between abundance of reproductive ramets and abundance of seeds in the seed rain and the seed bank, but no relationship between seed size and abundance of seeds in the seed rain or the seed bank. We discuss these results in the context of theory suggesting that large-seeded and small-seeded species may coexist because of a trade-off between colonization and competitive abilities, where smaller-seeded species are able to reach more sites than seeds of larger-seeded species, because they are more numerous and (or) better dispersed.

J	Frieswyk, CB; Zedler, JB				Frieswyk, Christin B.; Zedler, Joy B.			Do seed banks confer resilience to coastal wetlands invaded by Typha xglauca?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Historically, seed banks conferred resilience to Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands by providing propagules of many species to replace invasive plants, such as Typha x glauca Godr. After flooding, the seed bank could allow recovery of wetland composition and structure as the water levels fall. Using the seedling emergence method to estimate seed density, species and guild richness, and floristic quality, we evaluated the resilience of five wetlands along the western coast of Green Bay, Lake Michigan by comparing seed bank attributes in areas invaded by Typha to those of neighboring uninvaded areas and to attributes of the extant vegetation. Resilience decreased from north to south among the five wetlands, mirroring a gradient of decreasing water quality. The invasive Lythrum salicaria L. dominated the seed bank of all five wetlands despite low relative abundance in the extant vegetation. The resilience of Green Bay coastal wetlands is threatened by the overwhelming presence of L.asalicaria in the seed bank. Because the seed bank holds a wetland's potential to be renewed by the natural hydrological cycle, seed bank assessment should be a routine measure of wetland resilience.																	0008-4026					DEC	2006	84	12					1882	U16		10.1139/B06-100							WOS:000244858700012

To understand the potential of the seed bank in species conservation and population restoration, this study compared the genetic diversity of O. rufipogon plants with that of its soil seed banks in two marshes. A total of 11 pairs of rice SSR primers were used and 9 were polymorphic. Allele frequencies of the seeds differed significantly from those of surface plants and varied between soil layers. Relatively more alleles and higher genetic diversity (H (e)) were found in plant populations, relative to seed banks. The numbers of germinable seeds and the level of genetic variation in seed banks decreased with the increasing of soil depth, indicating a rapid seed loss. Genetic differentiation was detected between sites and between plant and seed populations, as well as among seeds of different soil strata. Rapid seed loss, partly dormancy loss, and nonrandom seed mortality are discussed as the possible contributors to the pattern of reduced genetic variation within seed banks, compared to plants. These could also be responsible for the considerable genetic differentiation between populations. The seed population held about 72% of the total genetic variation of O. rufipogon in each marsh, indicating the potential of seed banks for restoring population variabilities if the plant populations were lost.																	1566-0621					DEC	2006	7	6					909	917		10.1007/s10592-006-9132-y							WOS:000241947900008						
J	Rymer, PD; Ayre, DJ				Rymer, Paul D.; Ayre, David J.			Does genetic variation and gene flow vary with rarity in obligate seeding Persoonia species (Proteaceae)?	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Theory predicts that genetic variation is a determinant of persistence, and that the abundance and distribution of variation is strongly dependent on genetic drift and gene flow. Small, isolated populations are expected to be less diverse and more differentiated than large, inter-connected populations. Thus rare species may be more at risk of extinction. We used 389 putative AFLP loci to compare genetic variation and structuring in two pairs of closely-related common (large populations geographically widespread) and rare (small populations spatially restricted) Persoonia species. We genotyped 15-22 adult plants, from four populations, covering the geographic range of each species. Although genetic diversity was low for all four species (for long-lived outcrossing perennials), we found significantly more diversity within populations of the rare species than within those of the common species. AMOVA revealed significant levels of structure both among species (21%) and populations (15%). The proportion of inter-population variation within species did not vary consistently with rarity (Pair 1 rare 21.1% versus common 16.5%; Pair 2 rare 15.8% versus common 20.6%). However populations of the rare species were more differentiated than common species with similar geographic separation, suggesting greater gene flow between populations of the common species. Therefore, even relatively small genetically isolated populations of rare Persoonia species were more diverse than large populations of common Persoonia species. We hypothesise that common Persoonia species have undergone a rapid range expansion from a narrow gene pool, while genetic diversity is maintained in the soil seed-bank of rare remnants.

Duncan			Lacandon Maya forest management: Restoration of soil fertility using native tree species	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					5th Annual Conference of the American-Ecological-Engineering-Society	MAY 18-20, 2005	Ohio States Univ, Columbus, OH	Amer Ecol Engn Soc	Ohio States Univ			In southern Mexico, where rainforests are being degraded rapidly, the Lacandon Maya use an agroforestry system that both restores and conserves the rainforest. Their system cycles through field and fallow stages that produce food, medicines, and raw materials, and regenerates tall secondary forest. This investigation identified plants managed by Lacandon to restore soil fertility during fallow. Through interviews, Lacandon identified 20 plants managed for forest restoration. Leaf litter measurements and soil samples were taken near two of these species, Ochroma pyramidale and Sapium lateriflorum. Leaf litter increased quicker beneath O. pyramidales compared to other tree species (R = 0.48, P = 0.004), and total nematode concentrations increased with distance from this tree (R = 0.71, P < 0.001). Together, these two findings indicated an inhibition of degradation that permits accelerated soil organic matter accumulation. Available phosphorus (P) concentrations beneath S. lateriflorum were 16% higher than outside the canopy (P = 0.03), and increased with age of the tree, indicating P recovery from subsoil. Our research shows that the Lacandon are cognizant of the natural abilities of certain species to fulfill the restoration needs in their systems. It demonstrates that Maya agroforestry and local knowledge could contribute to efforts to conserve and restore rainforests, and reduce deforestation by accelerating fallow in tropical agriculture.

Agricultural legacies in the great basin alter vegetation cover, composition, and response to precipitation	ECOSYSTEMS												The land-use history of an ecosystem influences current structure and possibly response to modern disturbances and stresses. In semiarid systems the nature of land-use legacies is poorly understood, confounding efforts to establish sustainable management approaches. We compare previously cultivated and non-cultivated lands in Owens Valley, California, where cultivation once extended to 34% of the valley floor but was largely discontinued by 1940, to measure the influence of past disturbance on modern vegetation. We combined historic maps of cultivated and non-cultivated land with an extensive vegetation survey, historic aerial photographs, and satellite measurements of vegetation response to precipitation variability to examine the importance of land-use history in determining the sensitivity of vegetation to annual variations in precipitation. Remote sensing analysis showed that total plant cover on previously cultivated lands was lower and fluctuations in cover were marginally more dependent on precipitation compared with plant cover on non-cultivated lands. We then compared modern plant assemblages within cultivated and non-cultivated land to determine if compositional differences could explain the current patterns of vegetation cover. We found lower species richness on previously cultivated parcels, and higher frequency and cover of perennial grasses on non-cultivated lands. Therefore, we showed differences in land-cover patterns, isolated a mechanism that could account for the differences (species differences), and developed a method for remotely analyzing land regions that have experienced historic anthropogenic disturbance.

Salinity thresholds for the loss of submerged macrophytes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper is the first in a pair investigating potential mechanisms for ecological regime change in salinising wetlands. In this first paper, we investigated some of the factors responsible for the formation and maintenance of a macrophyte-dominated ecological regime by studying the germination and flowering of four submerged macrophyte species common in saline Western Australian wetlands; Ruppia polycarpa R. Mason, Ruppia megacarpa R. Mason, Lamprothamnium macropogon (A. Braun) Ophel and L. cf. succinctum (A. Braun in Ascherson) Wood, and by following the survival of adult R. polycarpa as salinities were increased to a range of endpoints (6, 15, 45, 70 and 100 ppt). Increased salinity led to a decrease in the number of germinating plants, an increase in the time to emergence of germinating plants and a decrease in the number of inflorescences (or fertile plants) produced by R. polycarpa, L. macropogon and L. cf. succinctum. Germination of R. megacarpa was low, providing limited information with regard to salinity response. The survival of adult plants also decreased as salinity increased and was negatively affected by faster rates of salinity increase. The upper salinity limits for germination, within the 70 day experiment, were 40-50 ppt for R. polycarpa and L. cf. succinctum, and 30-40 ppt for L. macropogon. Survival of adult R. polycarpa also declined markedly at above 45 ppt.

Ecological patterns of plant diversity in a plantation forest managed by clearfelling	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Commercial forests represent an important but often neglected biological resource. This study related the understorey plant species composition of a coniferous plantation forest managed by clearfelling to environmental factors (stand structure, soil pH and previous land use) and ecological patterns (abundance-occupancy relationships, species dispersal and life history). 2. Plant species richness and composition were recorded in 326 managed stands of different ages, soil types and land-use histories in a 185-km(2) lowland forest planted onto heath and arable land. 3. Stands replanted in the last 10 years had the greatest species richness, typically containing in the order of 18 plant species. Stands on soils of high pH had greater plant species richness, as did those on previously arable land. 4. Less than a quarter (23%) of all species persisted in the above-ground vegetation throughout the growth cycle. The majority recolonized forest stands during the cycle, by physical dispersal or from the seed bank, largely after canopy opening in mature stands (26%) or after felling (47%). Annual species and species with plumed seeds were most abundant in early growth stages, while shrubs with berries were more abundant in mature stands. 5. We found a strong positive interspecific relationship between frequency of stand occupancy and mean abundance within occupied stands. For species not persisting above-ground throughout the forestry cycle (i.e. patch colonizers), the slope of the abundance-occupancy relationship was steeper for those with a long-distance dispersal mechanism than for those lacking such a mechanism. 6. Synthesis and applications. Rotational clearfelling of plantations may be an appropriate form of forest and conservation management in forests planted on former open areas such as heaths, where the conservation interest is not in old-growth species but in earlier successional species. Maximizing representation of young growth stages will help maximize plant diversity in such cases. These prescriptions contradict guidance for sustainable forestry; however, it is appropriate to vary guidelines according to land-use history and species composition. Our findings confirm the importance of dispersal to species persistence within landscapes comprising successional patch networks.

Consequences of hydrochory in Hibiscus	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Seed dispersal provides a template upon which the demographic processes of plant life cycles operate and, most importantly, seed dispersal determines the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Here, we review recent studies on seed dispersal by water (hydrochory) in species of Hibiscus to elucidate the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of hydrochory at different spatiotemporal scales. We consider seed dispersal related processes that determine the distribution and dynamics of genetic variation, that is, the spatial shuffling effect of the seed bank that modifies genetic make-up within a population, the formation of a genetic reservoir within a metapopulation, and lineage dispersions and speciation that may produce patterns in plant phylogeography. Seed movement patterns within ecological time and space are likely to leave non-random patterns in long-term plant evolution and phylogeny.

The goal of this experiment was to find the most appropriate combination of treatments to reintroduce Danthonia californica, a formerly dominant perennial bunchgrass, into degraded California coastal prairies. Danthonia californica was sown from seed and transplanted at two sites and at two grazing intensities (grazed/ungrazed) in a multifactorial experiment testing the effects of (1) local versus nonlocal seed sources; (2) topsoil removal; and (3) reduction of plant neighbors. Seed emergence was very low, suggesting that transplanting may be a better option to reintroduce D. californica. Although transplants grown from nonlocal seeds survived better initially at both sites, transplants from local seeds had higher survival after 1.5 year at one site. This suggests that short-term plant establishment studies may be misleading. Topsoil removal greatly enhanced transplant survival, and neighbor removal primarily increased transplant growth. Our results suggest that removing topsoil prior to transplanting seedlings grown from local seeds is the most promising method to reintroduce D. californica. However, the benefits of removing topsoil to provide safe sites for plant establishment should be weighed carefully against potential negative effects on the native seed bank and microbial communities on a site-specific basis.

The action of post-dispersal beetles (Coleoptera : Scarabaeidae) and ants (Hymenoptera : Formicidae) on scats of Didelphis spp. (Mammalia : Didelphidae)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												A two year study of dung beetles and ants acting on scats of two species of opossum (Didelphis spp.) was carried out. Scats were left in the field in order to detect post-dispersal agents. A portion of each scat (30 %) was examined for seeds in the laboratory. Beetles were recovered from burrows (51 % of 84 faecal samples left in the field) where they either buried scats of opossums or were attracted, together with ants, to pitfalls (N = 10) baited with opossum scats. Dung beetles were the main post-dispersal agents of seeds found in scats of opossums, rolling the scats away or burying then on the site of deposition. They buried faeces at 4 to 15 cm in depth (N = 22 tunnels). The main dung beetles identified (medium to large size) were Eurysternus (28.7 % in pitfalls) and Dichotomius (13.7 %), Coprophanaeus (seen only directly on facces), besides small-bodied beetles (< 10 mm; 57.6 %). The ant Acromirmex sp. transported some seeds from scats. This species was present in 25.5 % of all Formicidae samples (pitfall). These post-dispersal agents contribute to avert scat seed predators such as rodents, and to accelerate seed bank formation.

A review of current knowledge of the weedy species Themeda quadrivalvis (grader grass)	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												This review of grader grass (Themeda quadrivalvis) attempts to collate current knowledge and identify knowledge gaps that may require further research. Grader grass is a tropical annual grass native to India that is now spread throughout many of the tropical regions of the world. In Australia, it has spread rapidly since its introduction in the 1930s and is now naturalised in the tropical areas of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia and extends south along the east coast to northern New South Wales. It is a vigorous grass with limited palatability, that is capable of invading native and improved pastures, cropping land and protected areas such as state and national parks. Grader grass can form dense monocultures that reduce biodiversity, decrease animal productivity and increase the fire hazard in the seasonally dry tropics. Control options are based on herbicides, grazing management and slashing, while overgrazing appears to favour grader grass. The effect of fire on grader grass is inconclusive and needs to be defined. Little is known about the biology and impacts of grader grass in agricultural and protected ecosystems in Australia. In particular, information is needed on soil seed bank longevity, seed production, germination and growth, which would allow the development of management strategies to control this weedy grass.																	0049-4763					DEC	2006	40	4					193	201									WOS:000247384500001						
J	Wagner, M; Heinrich, W; Jetschke, G				Wagner, Markus; Heinrich, Wolfgang; Jetschke, Gottfried			Seed bank assembly in an unmanaged ruderal grassland recovering from long-term exposure to industrial emissions	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The main aim of this 3-year study was to relate the temporal patterns in seed bank composition of a ruderal grassland previously subjected to industrial pollution with the successional. patterns in the above-ground vegetation. In particular, we tested whether the observed changes conformed to a paradigm of declining seed numbers and diversity and decreasing similarity between seed bank and vegetation, as previously formulated for secondary successions. We found that seed numbers and the number of species per soil sample increased during the 3 years of the study. The compositional similarity between seed bank and vegetation did increase for the 0-2 cm surface layer, and remained roughly constant for deeper soil layers. Thus, the patterns found differed from those of other secondary successional communities and do not support the tested paradigm. Rather, our findings resemble those from a number of primary successional ecosystems. We suggest that temporal patterns of similarity between seed bank and vegetation should be interpreted in terms of the factors that determine the relative rates of compositional change in vegetation and seed bank at different stages of succession. Our study also provides information about the seed bank persistence of 22 species, including several species for which such knowledge previously was scarce. In particular, this study indicates the extreme longevity of the seeds of the halophytic grass Puccinellia distans. Several years after its rapid decline in the vegetation, this species dominated the seed bank, and no measurable decline in seed density was detected during this study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Seeds of Atriplex tatarica do not germinate immediately after shedding, but may remain in a dormant but viable state indefinitely. We investigated whether there were genetic and fitness differences between plants derived from seeds of the different fruit types germinated in different temperatures and salinities. Seeds that germinated in optimal and suboptimal conditions differed significantly in their genetic composition due, in part, to their source population. Seeds that germinated in the suboptimal conditions produced more homozygous plants. Plants that were primarily heterozygous were generated from nondormant fruit types as well as from fruits that germinated in the optimal conditions. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the degree of heterozygosity and plant fitness measured as the mass of the stem and reproductive structures. In conclusion, the genetic variation of natural populations may be at least partly due to the ability of particular seed genotypes to germinate in the specific environmental conditions of a particular locality. In some circumstances, the process of differential germination may select not only for genetic variability but also for higher fitness if heterozygosity-fitness correlations are present.

J	Middleton, B; van Diggelen, R; Jensen, K				Middleton, Beth; van Diggelen, Rudy; Jensen, Kai			Seed dispersal in fens	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How does seed dispersal reduce fen isolation and contribute to biodiversity? Location: European and North American fens. Methods: This paper reviews the literature on seed dispersal to fens. Results: Landscape fragmentation may reduce dispersal opportunities thereby isolating fens and reducing genetic exchange. Species in fragmented wetlands may have lower reproductive success, which can lead to biodiversity loss. While fens may have always been relatively isolated from each other, they have become increasingly fragmented in modem times within agricultural and urban landscapes in both Europe and North America. Dispersal by water, animals and wind has been hampered by changes related to development in landscapes surrounding fens. Because the seeds of certain species are long-lived in the seed bank, frequent episodes of dispersal are not always necessary to maintain the biodiversity of fens. However, of particular concern to restoration is that some dominant species, such as the tussock sedge Carex stricta, may not disperse readily between fens. Conclusions: Knowledge of seed dispersal can be used to maintain and restore the biodiversity of fens in fragmented landscapes. Given that development has fragmented landscapes and that this situation is not likely to change, the dispersal of seeds might be enhanced by moving hay or cattle from fens to damaged sites, or by reestablishing lost hydrological connections.

This species now occurs in only two known localities in Japan. One is a native population (Oitoike population), but the other (Teganuma-Okahotto population) is found in a small artificial pond that was dug in 1998. It is considered that the Teganuma-Okahotto population grew from a soil seed bank. Based on RAPD variation, we compared the genetic diversity of the two populations of P lucens var. teganumensis in Japan and one population of P. lucens subsp. sinicus var. sinicus in China. The Teganuma-Okahotto population showed RAPD variation, suggesting that it may be derived from more than one seed buried in old sediments. This population also had the highest value of Shannon's Information Index among the three study populations. This finding suggests that seeds buried in sediments can contain genetic variability, and may be used to conserve the genetic diversity of rare and endangered plants. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Gap disturbance triggers the recolonization of the clonal plant Ambrosia tenuifolia in a flooding grassland of Argentina	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Flooding provokes the death of many dicotyledonous species in grazed grasslands of the Flooding Pampa in Argentina, including the clonal plant Ambrosia tenuifolia, which produce the opening of numerous gaps. The objective of this study was to investigate the recolonization of grassland by A. tenuifolia after this species disappeared due to the occurrence of prolonged flooding events. To this end, responses of seed germination to environmental factors associated with gaps, such as light quality and temperature regime, conditions related to seedling survival, and clonal growth of ramets outside the gaps were studied in two different experiments in the field. Environmental factors related to gaps promoted the recruitment of new genets. The combined effect of alternating temperatures and the high red : far-red ratio set off germination from the soil seed bank; germination also was enhanced when signals were generated artificially under the intact canopy in the field. Higher resource availabilities and maximum seedling survival were recorded in canopy gaps, which were the focus of invasion. Grassland recolonization outside the gaps continued rapidly by clonal growth, from small gaps and large ones, even within the dense surrounding canopy. This provoked an intense competition with the other species. Gap opening by disturbances, seed germination in gaps and clonal growth were decisive for the recolonization of A. tenuifolia populations. This sequence of events triggered the recolonization of the plant community by this species, in sites where it had been eliminated by prolonged flooding. This process represents one of the most significant fluctuations in the vegetation dynamics of the Flooding Pampa Grasslands.

J	Cooper, EJ				Cooper, Elisabeth J.			Reindeer grazing reduces seed and propagule bank in the High Arctic	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												It is commonly assumed that plant establishment in the High Arctic is limited by severe abiotic conditions by a paucity of popagules and seeds. Heavy reindeer grazing may reduce plant allocation to reproduction and removes significant proportions of flowers and seeds, thus reducing contributions to seed bank. In contrast, foraging and trampling may break up existing mature plants, increasing the vegetative propagules in the soil. To determine the effect of grazing on colonization potential in the High Arctic, two studies were carried out: (i) a comparison of seed bank inside and outside three long-term reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhnchus (Vrolic)) exclosures and (ii) an investigation of the germinable seed and propagule bank of two neighbouring peninsulas with contrasting reindeer grazing history in north-western Svalbard (79 degrees N, 12 degrees E). Seed banks inside reindeer exclosures germinated significantly more seedings (596 seedlings . m(-2)) than those outside (263 seedlings.m(-2)). Species composition and total plant cover was similar on both peninsulas, but forage-plant cover was lower on the heavily grazed peninsula (Broggerhalvoya) than on the adjacent lightly grazed peninsula (Sarsoyra). Broggerhalvoya had significantly lower species richness and density of seed and propagule bank (0.21 +/- 0.02 germinating species per sample, 0.15 +/- 0.02 propagule species per sample, 416 +/- 103 seedlings.m(-2), 283 +/- 78 propagules.m(-2)) than did Sarsoyra (0.44 +/- 0.40 germinating species per sample, 0.35 +/- 0.03 propagule species per sample, 1016 +/- 188 seedlings.m(-2), 782 +/- 238 propagules.m(-2)). These results imply that reindeer depleted both the seed and propagule banks, thus reducing the potential for colonization of disturbed areas. Grazing may, therefore, have a lasting impact on High Arctic communities.																	0008-4026					NOV	2006	84	11					1740	1752		10.1139/B06-127							WOS:000244858600012

Reducing potential gene escape in time by appropriate post-harvest tillage - Evidence from field experiments with oilseed rape at 10 sites in Europe	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Persistence of oilseed rapeseed in soil can result in weed problems but also reduce oil quality of following rape crops or result in unwanted gene escape which is particularly relevant in the context of genetically modified oilseed rape. In this paper data from 13 field experiments at sites in England, Austria and Germany are presented where tillage operations were tested that potentially reduce the build-up of a seed bank. In the majority of experiments seed losses were artificially simulated by broadcasting ca. 10,000 freshly ripened rapeseed m(-2) onto cereal stubbles. Oilseed rapeseedlings in autumn, the seed bank in winter-spring and yields of the following crop winter wheat were assessed as a function of tillage regime. During summer and autumn 19-70% of the seeds germinated and emerged. This part of the population was killed by following tillage operations or herbicide applications. However, 0-29%, in moist years 0-5%, of the initially broadcasted seeds developed dormancy and remained ungerminated in the soil until the following winter-spring. Delaying incorporation of the seeds by leaving the stubble untouched for up to 4 weeks resulted in a reduced seed bank in almost every case. Also, repeated stubble tillage compared to an early single stubble tillage operation resulted in a smaller seed bank. The type of primary tillage (ploughing versus non-inversion cultivation) had no clear effect. No relation was found between the number of seedlings in autumn and the size of the seed bank the following winter-spring. Grain yield of the following crop winter wheat was not adversely affected by delayed stubble tillage. The results indicate that stubble tillage aiming at a reduced seed bank of oilseed rape should focus on conditions avoiding induction of secondary dormancy rather than improving germination conditions. This means that, under the climatic conditions of central and western Europe, the stubble should be left untouched for several weeks after harvest before starting the usual tillage sequence with stubble tillage and ploughing or a non-inversion tillage sequence.

The consequences of this process for the composition of the viable soil seed bank are poorly understood. In this study we quantified the impact of the yellow ant Lasius flavus on both aboveground vegetation and seed bank of a low-intensity pasture located in the Vogelsberg area (Hesse, Germany). A few species of the mound vegetation (mainly therophytes) were restricted to the mounds, but most species also occurred in the surrounding area. The seed bank of ant mounds differed from that of the pasture soil between the mounds, with the abundance of germinating seeds being twice as high in the mounds. This was mainly due to the very large number of seeds originating from winter annuals and Thymus pulegioides., Seed abundance of most other species was lower in the mounds. Our results showed that this is partly due to dispersule weight limiting dispersal of seeds from the surrounding vegetation onto the mounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Changes in understory vegetation of a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona 30 years after a wildfire	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wildland fires can cause shifts in understory species composition and production. Many studies have examined short-term changes in understory vegetation following a wildfire; however, very few long-tenn studies are available. The objective of this study was to examine changes in understory (herbaceous and shrub) species composition and production since the 1972 Rattle Burn wildfire on the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. Understory species composition and production were originally sampled in 1972,1974, and 1980 and were re-sampled during July and August of 2002 and 2003 on 30 plots in each of four sites: high severity burn, low severity burn, unburned site prescribed burned in 1977, and an unburned site. Repeated measures analysis was used to test for the effects of fire and time on understory species production. The effects of fire on understory species composition were tested using multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP). A lingering effect of the Rattle Burn wildfire on the understory plant production and composition was revealed. Severely burned sites, which had the least pine basal area, may have greater understory production as compared to unburned sites up to 30 years after a wildfire. However, species composition on all sites was altered. A significant, negative relationship was found between tree basal area and understory species composition and production for 1972 and 2003.

Germination responses of annual plants to substrate type, rainfall, and temperature in a semi-arid inter-tropical region in Mexico	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Environmental factors related to water availability that control the germination and establishment of desert annual plants are fundamental in determining the dynamics of such communities. We carried out a factorial experiment with three levels of simulated rainfall, temperature, and substrate type, and analysed the germination responses of six annual plant species from three different plant associations within the semi-arid Zapotitlan Valley, Mexico. As there is no difference in the rainfall and temperature conditions of these associations, we hypothesized that differences in substrate play an important role in the structure of these communities. Four of the analysed species showed a significant effect of interaction between substrate type and other analysed factors, while the other two species showed no effect. Therefore, observed differences in the spatial-temporal distribution of species in the Zapotitlan Valley cannot be explained solely by differences in substrate type, as substrate type acts in combination with conditions of water availability and temperature depending on the requirements of individual species. The dispersion capacities and biotic interactions of different species should also be considered in such an analysis. Therefore, to determine the structure and dynamics of annual plant communities in such an environment requires monitoring of year-to-year variations in rainfall, and temperature in the context of a heterogeneous micro-topographic framework in which different soil types form a complex mosaic.

Soil-seed bank survival in forests of the Southern United States	NEW FORESTS												We evaluated the longevity of seeds of 12 common woody species buried in fresh condition in the forest floor at three forest locations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Seed samples of each species were retrieved annually for 5 years from each location. Germination and tetrazolium chloride staining tests were conducted on the samples to determine germinative capacity. When averaged across all species, seeds remained viable longer at the Alexandria, Louisiana site than at the two sites in Mississippi. Seeds of the 12 species varied widely in their response to burial. Some species, such as American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana L.), muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia Michx.), and sugarberry (Celtis laevigata Willd.), had relatively high germinative capacities (from 33 to 60 percent, depending on species) even after burial in the forest floor for 5 years, whereas other species, such as flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria Ait.), had very low germinative capacities (less than 6 percent) by the end of the first year after burial. Species were classified into five groups based on their similarity of response.																	0169-4286					NOV	2006	32	3					335	345		10.1007/s11056-006-9007-6							WOS:000241949200008

Indirect interactions between browsers and seed predators affect the seed bank dynamics of a chaparral shrub	OECOLOGIA												Interactions between herbivores and seed predators may have long-term consequences for plant populations that rely on persistent seed banks for recovery after unpredictable fires. We assessed the effects of browsing by deer and seed predation by rodents, ants and birds on the densities of seeds entering the seed bank of Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, a maritime chaparral shrub in coastal California. Ceanothus produced many more seeds when protected from browsers in long-term experimental exclosures than did browsed plants, but the seed densities in the soil beneath browsed and unbrowsed Ceanothus were the same at the start of an intensive one-year study. The density of seeds in the soil initially increased in both treatments following summer seed drop: while densities returned to pre-drop levels within a few weeks under browsed plants, soil seed densities remained high for 5-8 months beneath unbrowsed plants. Rodent abundance (especially deer mice) was higher near unbrowsed plants than > 30 m away, and rodents removed Ceanothus seeds from dishes in the experimental plots. At least in the short term, rodent density and rates of seed removal were inversely related to the intensity of browsing. Our data have management implications for maintaining viable Ceanothus populations by regulating the intensity of browsing and the timing, intensity and frequency of fires.																	0029-8549					NOV	2006	150	1					69	77		10.1007/s00442-006-0503-3							WOS:000241552400008	16896769

Development of novel methods for the initiation of in vitro bryophyte cultures for conservation	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE												The value of ex situ plant collections for conservation is increasingly recognised. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RGB, Kew) has been pioneering methods for the development of such collections with the establishment of the Millennium Seed Bank and a project for the ex situ conservation of threatened UK bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, hornworts). A broad range of bryophytes are currently held in a tissue culture collection at RBG, Kew on sucrose-free 1/4 or 1/2 Murashige & Skoog or Knops minimal medium. The efficacy of the novel sterilising agent Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) was tested on a range of taxa, utilising a variety of bryophytic initiation material. Concentrations of 1% (w/v) for 3 min and 0.5% (w/v) for 2 min, without the addition of detergent, were found to be successful in initiating cultures from sporophytes and leafy gametophores respectively. Initiation of cultures from wild-collected sporophytes was more successful than from wild-collected gametophores. However, pre-culturing of gametophore material was found to enhance success rate of procedures. Transferring visibly clean material away from contamination post-initiation was also determined to increase protocol success rate. The ability of the biocide Plant Preservative Mixture (TM)(PPM (TM)) to control fungal and bacterial contamination in bryophyte protonemal cultures was also tested, but not found to be suitable. However, results obtained indicated that contamination may confer resistance on the moss against the phytotoxic effects of the biocide. Methods developed have wider applicability for the establishment of in vitro collections of other threatened plants.

J	Auld, TD; Denham, AJ				Auld, Tony D.; Denham, Andrew J.			How much seed remains in the soil after a fire?	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks that persist after a fire are important in fire-prone habitats as they minimise the risk of decline or local extinction in plants, should the fire-free interval be less than the primary juvenile periods of the species. In two common woody plant genera (Acacia and Grevillea) in southeastern Australia, we examined the size and location of the residual seed bank after fire across areas of varying seedling densities at three locations in comparison to the distribution of seeds in the soil at an unburnt site. We found viable dormant seeds remaining in the soil after fire (evidence of residual soil seed bank). A significantly lower proportion of seeds remained in the top 5 cm of soil than at 5-10 cm or 10-15 cm soil depths, independent of seedling density or plant genus. This was due to greater germination, and possibly some seed mortality, near the soil surface. Reduced germination below 5 cm was probably due to the reduced efficacy of the fire cues that break seed dormancy, a declining ability of seeds to emerge successfully from such depths, and the lower abundance of seeds in the soil at such depths. The magnitude of the residual seed bank was similar across 0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm soil depths in Acacia suaveolens. For two Grevillea species, most residual seeds were at 0-5 and 5-10 cm. The residual soil seed bank in the top 10 cm of soil after fire varied across sites with estimates of 0, 19 and 27% in G. speciosa and 23, 35, and 55% in A. suaveolens. At two sites, both species had similar residual seed bank sizes, while at a third, there were large differences between the species (0-55%). The observed patterns imply that the fire-related cues that break seed dormancy generally declined with soil depth. For Acacia, seed dormancy is broken by heat shock, a fire-cue that declines with soil depth. Some 250 species (approx 15% of the fire-prone flora) in the region are thought to have dormancy broken by heat shock. For Grevillea, where seed dormancy is broken by the interaction of smoke and heat shock, at two sites, we suggest three possibilities: (i) the smoke cue declined with soil depth; (ii) both heat and smoke are obligatory for breaking seed dormancy; or (iii) the cues may be independent and additive and below the zone of soil heating, only a proportion of available seeds had dormancy broken by smoke alone. At a third site (no residual seed bank detected) the smoke cue was predicted not to have declined with soil depth. Up to 900 species (just under half the fire-prone flora) in the study region are thought to have seed dormancy broken by the interaction of heat and smoke during the passage of a fire.

PLANT ECOLOGY												Forest paths are characterised by a zonation in vegetation composition as a result of gradients in abiotical conditions and continued recreational impact. Little is known about how much seed bank composition is affected by recreation and the existing path structure. As it is difficult to assess the contribution of seed banks to vegetation restoration, this study imparts relevant knowledge to restore vegetation on paths which are closed for recreational use. We surveyed seed bank and field layer vegetation composition in transects across path ecotones in deciduous forest. Analysis concentrated on seed bank characteristics and similarities of the seed bank and field layer vegetation in terms of ecological and seed size groups. A total of 74 species and 9,815 seedlings germinated out of the seed bank samples. The total seed density does not differ between path zones, but significant differences exist in the depth distribution and composition of the seed bank throughout transects. There is a large discrepancy between the composition of the seed bank and the vegetation. Small seeded species of disturbed environments dominate in each path zone. Typical forest species dominate in the vegetation while their contribution to the seed bank is low. Only with reference to the proportion of species of forest edges and clearings, the seed bank and vegetation do not differ significantly. Similarity between the seed bank on the path centre and the vegetation in the respective path zones decreases towards the undisturbed forest vegetation. Some competitive species like Urtica dioica and Lythrum salicaria are excessively represented in the seed bank and efficiently may obstruct further visitor use. However, these early successional species may not contribute to the conservation values of forests. Therefore management should carefully consider alternative amendments (e.g. soil scarification and seeding) to stimulate vegetation restoration.

Losses of seeds of temperate trees to soil fungi: effects of habitat and host ecology	PLANT ECOLOGY												Evidence suggests that impacts of fungal pathogens on tree recruitment tend to be greater in the forest understory than in openings, and that shade-tolerant trees are less vulnerable than shade-intolerant species. To investigate the role that harmful soil fungi may have in reducing regeneration of temperate trees, we applied fungicide to buried seeds of matched pairs of species differing in their relative shade tolerance and/or successional status (Acer negundo versus Acer saccharum, Prunus virginiana versus Prunus serotina, and Pinus strobus versus Tsuga canadensis), in three habitats that differed in their degree of openness (old field, forest gap, and forest understory). Our results indicated that soil fungi reduced germination of A. negundo, P. virginiana, P. serotina. and T. canadensis, and reduced viability of ungerminated seeds of P. strobus; no significant effects of fungi on seeds of A. saccharum were detected. However, we found seeds were not less likely to survive following burial in forest understory than in gaps. As well, results for only one species pair (A. negundo versus A. saccharum) were consistent with the prediction that shade-intolerant or successional species should be more susceptible to fungal attack than mature forest species. These results contrast with other studies of temperate and especially tropical forest trees.

To assess the potential for natural forest regeneration, species composition and diversity of all forest fragments (10) in a study area of 13,000 ha were analyzed in relation to environmental and soil variables. Using a random design and a density of approximately one plot per 2 ha in all fragments, 31 20x20 m plots were sampled. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests yielded five communities representing two forest types and one degraded savanna habitat. The forest fragments had a species-poor tree and shrub community in which plots were rather homogeneous and most species abundant. NMDS and analysis of variance indicated that a topographical gradient correlated to soil phosphorus, soil depth, stoniness and the proximity to the river system explained the major differences in species composition and separated moist and dry Afromontane forest communities. The grazing intensity further partitioned the habitats. Present communities and their environmental correlates indicate that the secondary climax forest in the area probably consisted of dry Afromontane forest interlaced by broad strips of moist Afromontane forest along rivers and streams and not a continuous, mono-dominant Juniperus forest as is often presumed. Negative effects of the degraded matrix on forest fragments increased with decreasing patch area and increasing shape irregularity. Nevertheless, all remaining fragments are important for their role in the landscape ecology of the region as refuges and species pools and should be protected and managed accordingly. If seed dispersal from forest fragments into exclosures and subsequent tree recruitment are both successful, the vegetation type most likely to establish is Afromontane savanna woodland, and if managed properly, eventually dry Afromontane forest may arise. Increasing the size of small patches and placing forest plantations and exclosures in the vicinity of small forest fragments is expected to yield the most immediate results. This approach may increase the likelihood of patch colonisation by frugivorous forest birds and thus foster the regeneration of native woody species.

J	Carter, MR; Ivany, JA				Carter, M. R.; Ivany, J. A.			Weed seed bank composition under three long-term tillage regimes on a fine sandy loam in Atlantic Canada	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Tillage systems can influence weed seed viability and the distribution with depth of weed seeds in soil. To investigate this 'tillage effect', weed seed bank composition was determined at two soil depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) in three tillage systems [mouldboard plough (NIP), shallow tillage (ST), and direct drilling (DD)] established for 14 years on a sandy loam (Podzol) in Prince Edward Island, Atlantic Canada. The cropping system was a cool-season soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in rotation with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The objectives were to evaluate the size and composition of the viable soil seed bank, using the seedling germination method, and to determine if the adoption of non-inversion tillage practices (DD and ST) influence seed bank parameters relative to the conventional full inversion MR The diversity of weed species was slightly lower for NIP (17 species) compared to the ST (21 species) and DID treatments (22 species). The population for most weed species was relatively low with only three common species [low cudweed (Gnaphalium uliginosum L.), creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.)] above 5 m(-2). For the total soil depth sampled (0-20 cm), weed seed population was significantly greater under DD (56 weeds m(-2)) and ST (66 weeds m(-2)), compared to MP (25 weeds m(-2)), and mainly related to changes in the number of annual broadleaf weeds, compared to perennial broadleaf and grasses. Comparison of the 0-10 with the 10-20 cm soil depth showed a relatively uniform weed seed distribution for the MP treatment, while a greater proportion of weed seeds was found at the lower soil depth for DD and ST. This distribution tended to be weed species dependent. Soil texture and weed seed characteristics were considered to have a critical impact on the total weed seed bank size, specifically for the 10-20 cm soil depth. Overall, the weed bank size was relatively small indicating that adoption of conservation tillage practices for sandy loams in Atlantic Canada should not cause a major change in weed community and weed populations, or present a need for significant changes in weed control management.

J	Conn, JS				Conn, Jeffery S.			Weed seed bank affected by tillage intensity for barley in Alaska	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The weed seed bank of a long-term tillage study in subarctic Alaska was studied at the end of 10 years of continuous spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Tillage treatments were: no-till, disked once (spring), disked twice (spring and fall), and chisel plow (fall). Soil cores were obtained from each tillage treatment and seeds were manually separated from soil after washing through sieves. Tillage treatment had a significant effect on seed density of shepherds purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medic.), cinquefoil (Potentilla norvegica L.), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.), and on total seed density. Seed density was higher for these species and total seed density was greater under no-till than under other tillage treatments. Seed density was higher near the soil surface under no-till and chisel plow treatments than under disked treatments, which helps explain the greater difficulty of controlling weeds under reduced tillage.

Sampling requirements for estimation of the soil seed bank of a west Texas salt marsh	TEXAS JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The purpose of this study was to determine the sample incubation time, surface area, depth of the soil sample and number of soil samples required to adequately estimate the seed bank of the Distichlis spicata (saltgrass) community, the most widespread of the salt marsh communities, in the Diamond Y Spring Preserve, north of Fort Stockton, Texas. The locally abundant but geographically rare and threatened puzzle or Pecos sunflower (Helianthus paradoxus) is found in this salt marsh Community. Soil samples should be incubated for 6 to 8 weeks after cold stratification, but there were no significant differences in the total number of seeds germinated between 5 and 13 weeks (260-323 seeds germinated). A sample size with all area of 0.1 m(2) and 6 cm in depth was sufficient to sample the soil seed bank in this inland salt marsh community. No viable seeds of any species were found in the 10 cm deep samples and 99.4% were less than 6 cm deep. Additionally, 15 soil samples seemed adequate to sample the area, although the variance was high ((X) over bar =92.4, SD=85 seeds/m(2)).																	0040-4403					NOV	2006	58	4					349	370									WOS:000258844400007						
J	Valleriani, A				Valleriani, Angelo			Evolutionarily stable germination strategies with time-correlated yield	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												We investigate the effect of auto-correlated yield on the evolutionarily stable germination fraction of dormant seeds. By using both analytics and numerics, we first show that in a regime of small fluctuations a positive correlation reduces dormancy and a negative correlation enhances dormancy. By extending the numerical analysis we also show that in the regime of large fluctuations a more complex picture emerges where also negative correlations can reduce dormancy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Chauhan, BS; Gill, G; Preston, C				Chauhan, Bhagirath S.; Gill, Gurjeet; Preston, Christopher			Influence of environmental factors on seed germination and seedling emergence of rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum)	WEED SCIENCE												Rigid ryegrass is a major weed of southern Australian cropping systems. Increased knowledge about the germination biology of rigid ryegrass would facilitate development of effective weed control programs. The influence of different environmental factors on seed germination of rigid ryegrass was studied. The level of seed dormancy in five different populations, collected from different fields on the same farm, was found to be similar, suggesting consistency in seed dormancy in populations at a single location. Dormancy release was more rapid for seeds after-ripened in the field compared with those after-ripened dry in a greenhouse. Seed decay was found to be an important contributor to the loss of seeds for this species from the seed bank in the field. Seed decay was much greater for seeds after-ripened on the soil surface compared with buried seed. In contrast, germination played an important role in the loss of buried seed as compared with surface seed. Regardless of the burial depth, the dormant seed component present at the end of the growing season was quite small (4 to 16%). Seedling emergence of rigid ryegrass in the field was greater (49%) for seeds buried at 1 cm than for those on the soil surface (16%). No seedlings emerged from seeds buried at 10 cm. Seed germination of rigid ryegrass was tolerant to a wide range of PH and showed some tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. The results indicate rigid ryegrass is unlikely to become a greater weed problem in notill compared with cultivated seeding systems.

J	Leon, RG; Owen, MDK				Leon, Ramon G.; Owen, Micheal D. K.			Tillage systems and seed dormancy effects on common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) seedling emergence	WEED SCIENCE												Understanding weed seedling emergence patterns is important for successful implementation of many weed management strategies. Identifying the sources of variation of emergence patterns could greatly improve our ability to predict emergence timing. Differences in seed dormancy levels between populations or biotypes are usually not considered when studying seedling emergence of many weed species despite evidence that dormancy levels can affect weed seedling emergence patterns. We studied the importance of seed dormancy on seedling emergence patterns of common Waterhemp using three biotypes (Ames, Everly, and Ohio) that differed in dormancy regulation and level (5, 26, and 87% germination, respectively) and three tillage systems (notillage, chisel plow, and moldboard plow) in 2004 and 2005. Seedling emergence was at least four times greater under no-tillage than under chisel or moldboard plow conditions. Fewer seedlings emerged in moldboard plow than in other tillage systems. Furthermore, seedling emergence occurred in no-tillage over a longer period than in chisel and moldboard plow. In no-tillage the largest emergence events occurred at the end of June, whereas in other tillage systems most emergence occurred during May and the first week of June. Among biotypes, differences in number of emerged seedlings were more evident than differences in emergence timing. For Everly and Ohio biotypes, the number of emerged seedlings was the same between chisel and moldboard plow plots. For the Ames biotype, in 2004, the number of emerged seedlings was 25-fold higher in chisel plow than in moldboard Plow, and the emergence pattern in no-tillage was longer and peaked later than in the other tillage systems. However, these results were not observed in 2005. Overall, we did not observe consistent differences in seedling emergence patterns among biorypes, which suggested that under field conditions, other factors can compensate for differences in seed dormancy levels.

J	Smith, RG; Gross, KL				Smith, Richard G.; Gross, Katherine L.			Rapid change in the germinable fraction of the weed seed bank in crop rotations	WEED SCIENCE												The dynamics of soil seed banks in crop rotations of corn, soybean, and winter wheat were investigated to determine whether weed seed inputs associated with the winter wheat phases of the rotation were present in the readily germinable fraction of the seed bank in subsequent phases. Two studies were conducted, each in chisel-plowed systems. In one study, we compared seed banks in plots after 8 yr of corn grown continuously and with rotation that included winter wheat and soybean. A second study followed seed bank composition and abundance for 3 yr in plots that were planted to corn and soybean in successive years after planting to winter wheat. Seed banks were measured by direct germination in a heated greenhouse. In the first study, seed banks in plots planted to continuous corn (never planted to winter wheat) and the corn phase of the rotation (winter wheat planted 3 yr earlier) did not differ in species composition or abundance despite significant differences in seed banks in plots that had been planted to winter wheat the previous season. In the second study, seed bank abundance and composition in plots planted to winter wheat in 2001 rapidly changed after planting of corn and soybean in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Data from the two experiments suggest that seed banks in annual row crops experience rapid change in composition and abundance and can be strongly influenced by the most recent crop. This could limit our ability to infer longer term trends associated with changes in management practices from studies of soil seed banks.

J	Maron, JL; Crone, E				Maron, John L.; Crone, Elizabeth			Herbivory: effects on plant abundance, distribution and population growth	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Plants are attacked by many different consumers. A critical question is how often, and under what conditions, common reductions in growth, fecundity or even survival that occur due to herbivory translate to meaningful impacts on abundance, distribution or dynamics of plant populations. Here, we review population-level studies of the effects of consumers on plant dynamics and evaluate: (i) whether particular consumers have predictably more or less influence on plant abundance, (ii) whether particular plant life-history types are predictably more vulnerable to herbivory at the population level, (iii) whether the strength of plant-consumer interactions shifts predictably across environmental gradients and (iv) the role of consumers in influencing plant distributional limits. Existing studies demonstrate numerous examples of consumers limiting local plant abundance and distribution. We found larger effects of consumers on grassland than woodland forbs, stronger effects of herbivory in areas with high versus low disturbance, but no systematic or unambiguous differences in the impact of consumers based on plant life-history or herbivore feeding mode. However, our ability to evaluate these and other patterns is limited by the small (but growing) number of studies in this area. As an impetus for further study, we review strengths and challenges of population-level studies, such as interpreting net impacts of consumers in the presence of density dependence and seed bank dynamics.

Intra-specific density dependence is required to maintain species diversity in spatio-temporal forest simulations with reproduction	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Including explicitly the link between parent trees and recruitment is indispensable for many forest model applications, e.g. for simulating tree species migrations. However this positive feedback can result in unrealistic dominance of single species. We examine in which way this feedback can be modelled to maintain species diversity and species composition similar to observed forests. A submodel of the spatio-temporal forest model TreeMig for simulating seed production, seed dispersal, seed bank dynamics and sapling development is presented. With the extended model, interactions of different factors that can influence species diversity in a forest are examined. In simulations under different bioclimatic conditions of Switzerland differential hypotheses for maintaining species diversity are tested. The simulated species diversity and dominant species are compared to data compiled from the Swiss National Forest Inventory. Intra-specific density regulation is necessary to produce in the simulations a species diversity and species composition similar to data. Without this intra-specific density dependence, strong seed producers, such as birch (Betula pendula) dominate the stand, in contrast to the data, and decrease species diversity. With intra-specific density regulation, species diversity is further increased by spatial or temporal variability. Temporal variability in environmental factors alone can enhance species diversity if the factors fluctuate between the favourable and unfavourable range of the strong seed producers.

As the recent commissioning of a number of sewage treatment plants within the complex of the Mazurian Great Lakes has led to an improvement in water transparency, it was expected that species composition would start to return to the state present before intensive eutrophication. The role of seed and oospore banks in the reconstruction of submerged macrophytes is analysed on the basis of laboratory experiment. Cores of sediments (9 cm long) were collected from the littoral of Lake Mikolajskie. The cores were divided in 3 cm layers and were incubated under laboratory conditions. Five species of submerged macrophytes were germinated from the propagule banks. The richest in viable propagules was the deepest layer and poorest in active propagules was the shallowest layer of sediment. The recolonization of the littoral zone of Lake Mikolajskie by species, which occurred at a earlier period in the lake's history is possible because viable propagules have persisted in deeper sediments.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 15	2006	570						127	131		10.1007/s10750-006-0171-7							WOS:000241361300019

Consumers limit the abundance and dynamics of a perennial shrub with a seed bank	AMERICAN NATURALIST												For nearly 30 years, ecologists have argued that predators of seeds and seedlings seldom have population-level effects on plants with persistent seed banks and density-dependent seedling survival. We parameterized stage-based population models that incorporated density dependence and seed dormancy with data from a 5.5-year experiment that quantified how granivorous mice and herbivorous voles influence bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus) demography. We asked how seed dormancy and density-dependent seedling survival mediate the impacts of these consumers in dune and grassland habitats. In dune habitat, mice reduced analytical lambda (the intrinsic rate of population growth) by 39%, the equilibrium number of above-ground plants by 90%, and the seed bank by 98%; voles had minimal effects. In adjacent grasslands, mice had minimal effects, but seedling herbivory by voles reduced analytical lambda by 15% and reduced both the equilibrium number of aboveground plants and dormant seeds by 63%. A bootstrap analysis demonstrated that these consumer effects were robust to parameter uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that the quantitative strengths of seed dormancy and density-dependent seedling survival-not their mere existence-critically mediate consumer effects. This study suggests that plant population dynamics and distribution may be more strongly influenced by consumers of seeds and seedlings than is currently recognized.																	0003-0147					OCT	2006	168	4					454	470		10.1086/507877							WOS:000240855500003	17004218

Effect of light on seed germination of eight wetland Carex species	ANNALS OF BOTANY												center dot Background and Aims In wetland plant communities, species-specific responses to pulses of white light and to red : far-red light ratios can vary widely and influence plant emergence from the seed bank. Carex species are the characteristic plants of sedge meadows of natural prairie wetlands in mid-continental USA but are not returning to restored wetlands. Little is known about how light affects seed germination in these species-information which is necessary to predict seed bank emergence and to develop optimal revegetation practices. The effects of light on germination in eight Carex species from prairie wetlands were investigated. center dot Methods Non-dormant seeds of eight Carex species were used to determine the influence of light on germination by examining: (a) the ability of Carex seeds to germinate in the dark; (b) the effect of different lengths of exposures to white light on germination; (c) whether the effect of white light can be replaced by red light; and (d) whether the germination response of Carex seeds to white or red light is photoreversible by far-red light. center dot Key Results Seeds of C. brevior and C. stipata germinated > 25 % in continuous darkness. Germination responses after exposure to different lengths of white light varied widely across the eight species. Carex brevior required < 15 min of white light for >= 50 % germination, while C. hystericina, C. comosa, C. granularis and C. vulpinoidea required >= 8 h. The effect of white light was replaced by red light in all species. The induction of germination after exposure to white or red light was reversed by far-red light in all species, except C. stipata. center dot Conclusions The species-specific responses to simulated field light conditions suggest that (a) the light requirements for germination contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks in these species and (b) in revegetation efforts, timing seed sowing to plant community development and avoiding cover crops will improve Carex seed germination.

The following questions are asked: (a) whether dormancy release in seed banks of the tropical shrub Parkinsonia aculeata (Caesalpiniaceae) is determined by wet heat (incubation under wet, warm to hot, conditions); and (b) whether its effect is modified by microclimate. center dot Methods A seed burial trial was conducted in the wet-dry tropics (northern Australia) to compare dormancy release across different habitats (open, artificial cover, ground cover and canopy cover), burial depths (0, 3 and 20 cm) and burial durations (2, 6 and 14 weeks). Results were compared with predictions using a laboratory-derived relationship between wet heat and dormancy release, and microclimate data collected during the trial. center dot Key Results Wet heat (defined as the soil temperature above which seeds were exposed to field capacity or higher for a cumulative total of 24 h) was 43.6 degrees C in the 0 cm open treatment, and decreased with increasing shade and depth to 29.5 degrees C at 20 cm under canopy cover. The dormancy release model showed that wet heat was a good predictor of the proportion of seeds remaining dormant. Furthermore, dormancy release was particularly sensitive to wet heat across the temperature range encountered across treatments. This resulted in a 16-fold difference in dormancy levels between open (< 5 % of seeds still dormant) and covered (82 %) microhabitats. center dot Conclusions These results demonstrate that wet heat is the principal dormancy release mechanism for P. aculeata when conditions are hot and wet. They also highlight the potential importance of microclimate in driving the population dynamics of such species.				van Klinken, Rieks D/B-1772-2009	van Klinken, Rieks D/0000-0002-7578-8977												0305-7364	1095-8290				OCT	2006	98	4					875	883		10.1093/aob/mcl171							WOS:000240925800016	16891334

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The large losses of heathland area since the end of the 18th century can be expected to have resulted in the decline or even extinction of many characteristic heathland species. Historical data on plant species distribution patterns can provide valuable information in this context. Therefore, the aims of this research are to study how the loss of heathland area has changed the presence of heathland and forest plant species in north-western Belgium using historical plant distribution data, and to test whether the heathland flora shows an extinction debt. Furthermore, plant traits determining extinction sensitivity are investigated. Our results revealed that, despite the dramatic reduction of heathland area (more than 99% of heathland was destroyed over a 230-year period), the loss of heathland species is relatively limited (11%) and is comparable with that of forest species (11%). Heathland species that have a long-term persistent seed bank or can propagate vegetatively are least sensitive to extinction. For forest species, on the other hand, growth form is the key determinant for extinction sensitivity. Long-lived woody species have a greater chance of persisting. The relatively low extinction numbers probably represent an extinction debt and the full effects of habitat loss may not have been fully manifested yet. Consequently, future extinctions are expected to occur unless environmental conditions are improved. Therefore, heathland restoration and prevention of further heathland area losses is required.

Soil seed banks and plant community assembly following disturbance by fire and logging in interior Douglas-fir forests of south-central British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Relationships between soil seed banks and aboveground understory vegetation were examined in dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Beissn.) Franco) forests near Kamloops, British Columbia, to compare the effects of different disturbance types (low and high severity fires and non-salvage logging), and to evaluate how seed banks contribute to post-disturbance vegetation establishment. Sites were selected to represent disturbances at 1, 5, and 10 years prior to sampling, and data were analyzed using nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Seed density and species composition of seed banks did not differ significantly among the 1 year disturbed sites; however, the rooted frequencies of seed-origin plants in the establishing vegetation decreased in the order: lightly burned > severely burned > logged. Seed dispersal within the first year following fire is believed to be an important recovery mechanism on burned sites. Low frequencies of seed-derived plants, particularly conifer seedlings, on logged sites pose concerns for the initial recovery of vegetation following logging; nonetheless, the lack of significant differences in understory species composition between sites burned 5 years prior to sampling and sites logged 10 years prior to sampling, and their corresponding undisturbed sites, suggests that vegetation recovery can occur relatively quickly. Rooted frequencies of plants establishing naturally in burned areas were similar to those in undisturbed areas, which suggests that post-fire erosion control seeding using agronomic species may not be necessary in these forests.																	0008-4026					OCT	2006	84	10					1548	1560		10.1139/B06-112							WOS:000243408000005

We examined the potential influences of inbreeding depression on a population of Nymphoides peltata (Menyanthaceae) restored from the remnant soil seed bank. A hand-pollination experiment demonstrated self-compatibility of a single remaining homostyle genet and significant inbreeding depression in selfed progeny, especially in parameters related to seedling growth (delta = 0.5-0.6 for biomass, and delta = 0.3-0.4 for relative growth rate). Our genetic analysis indicated that the presumed number of parents contributing to the current soil seed bank was only 2-8 genets and that a single sib-family dominated at each of three sampling sites. The results also showed that the selfed progeny of the homostyle genet were overwhelmingly dominant at two sites (86.8 and 94.7%). As a result, the growth performance of the seed bank seedlings was significantly reduced, to a level as low as that of the selfed progeny. Active restoration efforts to minimize the negative effects of the genetic bottleneck and continuous monitoring based on genetic and demographic study are recommended.

J	Lazaro, A; Traveset, A; Castillo, A				Lazaro, Amparo; Traveset, Anna; Castillo, Amparo			Spatial concordance at a regional scale in the regeneration process of a circum-Mediterranean relict (Buxus balearica): connecting seed dispersal to seedling establishment	ECOGRAPHY												Both microhabitat and temporal scales have significant effects on the regeneration process of plant species. However, the consistency of those patterns at large scales is largely unknown, despite of being essential from both an ecological and a conservation viewpoint. In this study, we examined the spatio-temporal variation in the process of regeneration through seeds of the relict Mediterranean shrub Buxus balearica. By means of observations and experiments, we quantified the losses at different recruitment phases (seed rain, seed predation, seedling emergence and establishment) both at a small spatial scale (distance and microhabitat effects) and at a temporal scale (four years), and compared them at a regional scale (10 different localities). We additionally studied transition probabilities between phases in two populations and measured the size structure of 18 localities encompassing all the distributional range of the species. The results show that seed shadow follows a leptokurtic pattern which is consistently maintained until the seedling phase (i.e. there is spatial concordance). Despite post-dispersal factors are spatially uncoupled, they do not remove the gradient established in the seed shadow. Although the importance of different seed predators varied between regions, post-dispersal seed predation (ca 80%), together with seedling emergence (usually lower than 10%, some years even nil), and seedling mortality during the first summer (ca 70%) were - consistently in all populations - the most critical bottlenecks in the regeneration of the species. Moreover, an absence of seed bank prevents the buffering of dramatic losses during such phases. Watering of sown seeds increased seedling emergence and survival, and number of leaves per seedling, and survival was consistently higher under vegetation coverage. These results suggest that hydric stress notably contributes to limit the regeneration of this once widespread species evolved under a subtropical climate, which nowadays appears in old-structured populations throughout its distributional area.

Landscape-scale variation in the seed banks of floodplain wetlands with contrasting hydrology in China	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. At a local scale, the species composition, diversity and spatial variation of wetland plant communities are determined primarily by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in their environments. Less is known about variation at a landscape-level. The floodplain of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River in China includes hydrologically connected, subtropical wetlands with different hydrological characteristics. 2. We examined seed-bank species composition and richness in marshes of two contrasting hydrological types: permanent marshes, fed by local runoff, and lakeshore marshes more closely connected to the regulated river. Lakeshore marshes are flooded annually to depth of approximately 1 m and during flooding they support an alternate, aquatic vegetation type. The soil seed bank in March was a comparative estimator of species diversity. At the beginning of the growing season it included seeds from both phases of alternating vegetation types associated with the annual hydrological cycle. 3. A regional pool of 101 species was detected in the seed banks of six wetlands associated with the river and its tributaries: 56 occurred in permanent marshes and 59 in lakeshore marshes, with only 15 common to both. Species rarefaction curves indicated that more species occurred in permanent than lakeshore marshes at equal numbers of individuals sampled. However, the more heterogeneous lakeshore seed banks were estimated (Chao 2) to have greater total species richness (81) than permanent marsh (60). 4. Analysis using Sorensen's coefficient of similarity and DCA ordination revealed complex variation, with much greater differences between hydrological types than within them, irrespective of geographical distance. The types also differed significantly in the composition of four functional groups of species. 5. Despite the potential for dispersal of propagules via the annually pulsing river system (hydrochory), at a regional and landscape scale, diversity is maintained largely by large-scale temporal hydrological heterogeneity and smaller scale spatial and topographic heterogeneity.

Impacts of restoration treatments on alien plant invasion in Pinus ponderosa forests, Montana, USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Invasion by alien plant species represents a challenge to land managers throughout the world as they attempt to restore frequent fire-adapted ecosystems following decades of fire exclusion. In ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa forests of western North America, the response of alien species to restoration treatments has not been well documented, particularly for alien species capable of altering environmental conditions (transformers). Understanding alien species dynamics is critical for developing treatments that accomplish restoration goals while minimizing alien invasion. 2. We used a replicated, randomized block experiment to compare the effects of an untreated control and thin-only, burn-only and thin-burn treatments on alien and transformer understorey species at multiple spatial scales (1 m(2), 100 m(2) and 1000 m(2)). Data were collected pre-treatment and for multiple post-treatment years. We compared richness and cover of alien species and transformer species among treatments, and identified environmental variables correlated with transformer species cover. Indicator species analysis was used to identify transformer species associated with specific treatments. 3. Alien and transformer species richness and cover were significantly higher in the thin-burn than in all other treatments at all spatial scales. Thin-only and burn-only treatments showed greater alien and transformer species responses than the control at the larger 100-m(2) and 1000-m(2) scales. 4. Increased transformer cover was strongly correlated with increased tree crown scorch height and removal of overstorey trees. 5. The thin-burn treatment had four transformer species as indicators, the thin-only had one, while the burn-only and control had none. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results show that alien species, including transformers, respond to restoration treatments, especially the combined thin-burn treatment. Therefore monitoring for alien species invasion is an essential component of a restoration programme. Abundance of transformer species increased with increasing disturbance intensity, suggesting that less intense single-disturbance treatments (burn-only, thin-only) or incremental treatments may be preferred in some applications. Where more intense treatments are required to meet management objectives, specific strategies, such as seeding of native species, limiting grazing before and after treatment and harvesting over a protective winter snowpack, may be necessary to limit alien invasion.																	0021-8901					OCT	2006	43	5					887	897		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01206.x							WOS:000239987700006

Constraints on understory vegetation communities of tidal freshwater swamps: a reciprocal transplant experiment	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Plant community composition may be limited by propagule availability, environmental constraints, or both. In the Nanticoke River watershed in Maryland and Delaware, herbaceous communities of tidal freshwater swamps in upstream areas are less diverse than in downstream areas. To test factors constraining plant community composition, a reciprocal transplant study was conducted between an upstream site with lower diversity, Broad Creek, and a downstream site with higher diversity, Deep Creek. Species composition, height, biomass, and below-canopy PAR were measured in sections of soil with rooted vegetation (sods) assigned to one of three treatments arranged in a randomized block design: transplant (excavated and moved between sites), disturbed control (excavated and replaced in same location), or undisturbed control (no excavation). Data were also collected on soil seed bank composition, hydrology, and salinity. Vegetation measures in sods transplanted from Deep to Broad Creek were not significantly different from control sods left at Deep Creek, but sods transplanted from Broad to Deep Creek developed a community intermediate to controls at either site. Broad Creek was inundated 10% longer than Deep Creek (P < 0.0001), and had lower light levels for four of five sample periods (P < 0.021); salinity was significantly higher in Deep Creek for all months (P < 0.001) and exceeded 3 parts per thousand in July. Seedling density (P = 0.013) and taxa density (P = 0.001) were four times higher in seedlings emerging from seed bank samples of Deep Creek than Broad Creek. The community that developed in sods transplanted into Broad Creek suggests that over short time scales, diversity may be increased by propagule additions. However, a combination of propagule availability and suitable environmental conditions over longer periods may be necessary to sustain a robust vegetation commutity.

Flood-deposited wood creates regeneration niches for riparian vegetation on a semi-arid South African river	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: The formation of large woody debris (LWD) piles during floods has significant impacts on riparian succession through pioneering plants often establishing in association with wood. We assess the importance of LWD for seed regeneration of riparian plants after a century-scale flood disturbance in a semi-arid environment. Location: The Sabie River within Kruger National Park in the semi-arid northeast of South Africa. Methods: Our approach was to quantify the riparian soil seed bank, to record the frequency of establishment of riparian plants in woody debris piles, and to conduct experimental out-plantings of common riparian trees in plots with and without LWD. Results: We found the abundance and diversity of seedlings were higher in soils taken from wood piles than from open reference areas, and most seedlings were herbaceous species. Surveys indicated that numbers of seedlings recorded within woody debris were significantly greater than in open reference areas or within established vegetation. Seedling establishment in various cover-types also varied for different riparian tree species. Experimental out-planting of seedlings of two riparian tree species (Philenoptera violacea and Combretum erythrophyllum) revealed that, after 433 days, planted seedlings survived only in woody debris piles. Conclusion: LWD formed after a large flood creates hetero-geneous patches that may influence post-disturbance regeneration of riparian vegetation by providing a variety of environmental niches for seedlings establishment. We suspect that higher seedling survival in LWD is due to increased moisture (particularly in the dry season) and nutrients, and protection from seasonal flooding and herbivory.

How are the long-term dynamics of the root hemiparasite Rhinanthus angustifolius related to vegetation structure, grassland management and climate? 2. Does R. angustifolius have a long-term impact on standing crop and community composition? Location: A formerly fertilized grassland, part of a larger brook valley system in the nature reserve 'Drentsche Aa', near Groningen, The Netherlands. Methods: Vegetation development has been monitored since 1973 in 54 permanent plots in nine management regimes without fertilizer application. Results: 1. The hemiparasite established when standing crop was less than 600 g.m(-2) and performed best under annual hay-making using machinery. Since its appearance, the population fluctuated stochastically, with two peaks. Coinciding collapses in six adjacent grasslands and comparison with an integrated climatic index suggest that the population collapses are induced by spring drought. 2. We did not find a relationship between total standing crop and R. angustifolius cover. Cover of grasses was negatively related to the abundance of the hemiparasite in the same and the previous year. Forb cover tended to increase with the parasite. Conclusions: R. angustifolius shows stochastic population fluctuations, mainly determined by spring drought, to which this species is probably highly vulnerable because of its parasitic and annual life style without a persistent seed bank. The hemiparasite also shows long-term relationships with grass cover (negative) and forb cover (positive), but it seems to have no lasting impact on standing crop.

Seed bank, seed dispersal and vegetation cover: Colonization along a newly-created river channel	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: What is the relative importance of the initial seed bank and subsequent seed dispersal for floristic composition of bank vegetation two years after creation of a newly-cut reach of a river channel? Location: River Cole, West Midlands, United Kingdom. Methods: We took bank and bed sediment samples from a 0.5-km reach of a new river channel cut into intact flood-plain. After river diversion, seed samples deposited on artificial turf mats placed on the river banks and flood-plain edge were taken in summer and winter 2002 and 2003. Seed rain samples from funnel traps were taken during summer 2002 and 2003. We undertook greenhouse germination trials to assess viable seed species within these samples. In summer 2004, we surveyed river bank vegetation. Agglomerative cluster analysis was used to investigate floristic similarity between seed bank, seed rain, seed deposition samples and final bank vegetation cover. DCA was used to explore contrasts between the samples and to assess whether these reflected interpretable environmental gradients. Results: Seed rain samples contained a small subset of species in the summer depositional samples. 38 species were found within the final vegetation, the seed bank, and at least one of the four sets of depositional samples; a further 30 species not present in the seed-bank samples were present in at least one of the four sets of depositional samples and the final vegetation. Floristic composition of the vegetation was most similar to the depositional samples from winter 2002 and 2003 and summer 2003. DCA axis 1 reflected a time sequence from seed-bank samples through depositional samples to the final vegetation. Conclusions: Newly cut river banks were colonized rapidly. Seed remobilization and hydrochorous transport from the upstream catchment are important for colonization. Species richness was highest in samples deposited during winter when high fiver flows can remobilize and transport viable seeds from upstream. This process would also have enhanced the species richness of seed production along the banks during the second summer (2003).																	1100-9233					OCT	2006	17	5					665	674		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2006.tb02490.x							WOS:000242483400013

A high percentage of seeds is retained on dead plants which become covered by moving sand, but little is known about the ecological significance of burial of canopy-stored seeds. We investigated the size and dynamics of the buried canopy-stored seed bank and effects of burial on seed germination. In March (during the windy season), May (beginning of the germination season), and July (middle of the growing season), the number of seeds per square meter in sample plots in the dunes was 623, 223 and 22, respectively, with 54.6, 30.6 and 12.9% of the total seeds retained on buried plant canopies. In a controlled experiment, more seedlings emerged from released (dispersed) than from canopy-stored seeds when burial depth was the same. No viable ungerminated released seeds were found, but 45-80% of the ungerminated canopy-stored seeds were viable. In general, with an increase in applied water germination of released seeds buried at a depth of I or 2 cm and of canopy-stored seeds buried at I cm increased, but regardless of watering regime few or no released seeds at 4 cm or canopy-stored seeds at 2 or 4 cm germinated. Significantly more seedlings emerged from plants buried in a horizontal than in a vertical position. Seedlings originating from buried canopy-stored seeds on an active dune accounted for only 5.4% of the total seedlings emerging, and most of them emerged later than those from released seeds. Thus, seed release is more effectively postponed in buried than in exposed canopies, and burial of canopy-stored seeds is a mechanism that helps regulate seed germination and seedling emergence of A. squarrosum on active dunes.																	0032-079X					OCT	2006	288	1-2					71	80		10.1007/s11104-006-9090-7							WOS:000243001400006						
J	Reine, R; Chocarro, C; Fillat, F				Reine, Ramon; Chocarro, Cristina; Fillat, Federico			Spatial patterns in seed bank and vegetation of semi-natural mountain meadows	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed bank composition and vegetative spatial patterns were studied in four mountain meadow communities in the Broto Valley (N. Spain), in order to analyse the differences that might exists between the two life forms. Soil and vegetation samples were taken at 1 m intervals from 10 m x 10 m quadrats in each meadow in one-year study. The spatial distribution of species was analysed along with the calculation of an autocorrelation coefficient which takes account of the relative position of samples: (Moran's I). The results indicate that the abundance of the majority of the species in the seed bank and in the vegetation are randomly distributed, the percentage of species with a clumped distribution only exceeds 35% in the vegetation of one meadow and none of the taxa identified showed a uniform spatial organisation. The species that were distributed in the seed bank in a clumped pattern in more than one meadow were those of the pioneer species (Anagallis arvensis, Centaurium erythraea, Lamium purpureum and Stellaria media). All of these formed long-term persistent seed banks but were absent in the established vegetation in these meadows. According to the results, there exist not only differences between the spatial distribution of the species present in the same community, but also, that some species change their pattern of distribution according to the life form and to the grassland type in which they are found.

Modelling the persistence of volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The mixing of volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus) within the crop has been tolerated by farmers. However, the coexistence of volunteer and crop populations needs to be tightly controlled where the introduction of unique varieties is accompanied by concern over the associated economic and environmental risks, as with the introduction of genetically modified (GM) varieties. A means is required to explore volunteer population dynamics before GM varieties are widely grown commercially. Yet, few measurements of the physiological status in situ, life-cycle biology or even their decline in the seed bank are available for any type of volunteer population. Accordingly, a model of within-field oilseed rape population dynamics was developed to predict the density of volunteers and the associated impurity (proportion of volunteer plants or seeds in the total number of oilseed rape plants or seeds) under a range of conditions, and to define a framework for exploring persistence of GM and other volunteers in agricultural systems. Simulations were based on a parameterisation of a typical winter oilseed rape cultivar grown in rotation with winter wheat. For all combinations of parameter values considered, the volunteer cohorts declined over time. The results were consistent with observations on the persistence of oilseed rape. Persistence remained high across the range of life-history parameter values estimated for oilseed rape. In the absence of control the simulated volunteer cohort did not fall below 1% of the total oilseed rape density until 16 years after it was sown. The stringent application of a combination of control measures (represented by 100% herbicide efficacy and reduction of harvest seed loss to 1%) reduced impurity to 0.12% within 3 years. National and international legislation has imposed thresholds for labelling of adventitious presence of GM material in foodstuffs, including harvested crops, ranging from 0.5% and 0.9% in the European Union to 5% in Japan. The results of this study indicate that the lower thresholds could be met within a reasonable time-frame (3 years) but only with the rigorous application of volunteer control measures. This might affect the adoption rates of GM and other unique varieties of oilseed rape by reducing the net benefit of these to individual farmers and have a limiting effect on the supposed reduction herbicide use associated with GM herbicide tolerance. Consequently, dedicated production of single varieties, e.g. either GM or non-GM, may be the only way that the coexistence of these crop types can be achieved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wilbur, HM; Rudolf, VHW				Wilbur, Henry M.; Rudolf, Volker H. W.			Life-history evolution in uncertain environments: Bet hedging in time	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Many vertebrates, forest herbs, and trees exhibit both variable age at maturity and iteroparity as adaptations to uncertain environments. We analyze a stochastic model that combines these two life-history adaptations with density-dependent fertility. Results for a model with only iteroparity are consistent with previous work; environmental uncertainty favors adult survival over juvenile survival. This holds true even if there is a moderately strong convex trade-off between adult survival and fecundity, but the direction of selection can depend on which life-history trait is considered a random variable. A life history with only developmental delay favors juvenile survival in uncertain environments, consistent with previous models of seed banks. When both developmental delay and iteroparity are included in the model, both adaptations are favored in uncertain environments. Our simulations show that selection is not necessarily a runaway process in which either developmental delay or iteroparity is favored, as recently proposed by Tuljapurkar and Wiener, but rather that selection can favor both mechanisms. Invasion analysis shows that selective pressure on life-history delays increases as environmental variation increases. Reproductive delay and adult survival can be either adaptations or constraints. Natural-history studies that estimate model parameters can resolve this uncertainty.

The effect of life form, species, population and burial time on persistent SB size was assessed with factorial ANOVA. Persistent seed bank size was compared with the Martonne aridity index (shown to be a surrogate for inter-annual variation in precipitation) and seed size using linear regression. ANCOVA assessed the effect of life-form on SB size with aridity as covariate. center dot Key Results Three species had a transient SB and 15 a persistent SB. ANOVA revealed a significant effect of life-form on SB size with annuals having larger SB size and greater capacity to form a persistent SB than perennials. Significant inter-population variation in SB size was found in 64 % of cases. Seed mass was negatively correlated with persistent SB size. Persistent seed bank size was significantly correlated with the Martonne aridity index in the perennial and annual species, with species from more arid areas having larger persistent SBs. However, when aridity was considered as a covariate, ANCOVA revealed no significant differences between the annual and perennial herbs. center dot Conclusions Persistent seed bank size in Chaetanthera appears to reflect environmental selection rather than any trade-off with adult longevity.

J	Haefliger, P; Schwarzlaender, M; Blossey, B				Haefliger, Patrick; Schwarzlaender, Mark; Blossey, Bernd			Impact of Archanara geminipuncta (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) on aboveground biomass production of Phragmites australis	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Management of invasive plants with biological control rests on the assumption of herbivores as structuring forces of plant community composition, but only 30% of programs achieve substantial plant suppression. Control is often caused by a few successful agents, and improvements in the ability to select the most promising species would greatly improve weed biocontrol programs. We evaluated impact of different larval stages and larval densities of the stem boring noctuid Archanara geminipuncta on height and biomass production of Phragmites australis in the field and in a common garden in the native European range. In the field, stem biomass was reduced 21.5-64.5% by A. geminipuncta attack with the largest reduction due to early larval feeding. In the common garden, P. australis performance declined linearly (stem height 40%, biomass 50%; and percentage of flowering stems 90%) as attack rates increased. Significant field and common garden impact and the large Eurasian distribution indicate great potential of A. geminipuncta for biocontrol of introduced P. australis in North America if host specificity tests produce favorable results. If approved for release, we anticipate that A. geminipuncta could establish throughout the range of introduced P. australis in North America. We also anticipate that this moth will build high populations with significant impact on height, aboveground biomass, and clonal expansion of P. australis. This attack is expected to reduce competitive ability of P. australis, favoring native wetland species and preventing further negative ecological impacts associated with the current spread of introduced P. australis in North America.

Ronnie; Peterson, Garry; Messier, Christian; Bergeron, Yves; Flannigan, Mike			Can forest management based on natural disturbances maintain ecological resilience?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Given the increasingly global stresses on forests, many ecologists argue that managers must maintain ecological resilience: the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances without undergoing fundamental change. In this review we ask: Can the emerging paradigm of natural-disturbance-based management (NDBM) maintain ecological resilience in managed forests? Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under consideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance. Implementing NDBM while maintaining resilience means recognizing that (i) biodiversity is important for long-term ecosystem persistence, (ii) natural disturbances play a critical role as a generator of structural and compositional heterogeneity at multiple scales, and (iii) traditional management tends to produce forests more homogeneous than those disturbed naturally and increases the likelihood of unexpected catastrophic change by constraining variation of key environmental processes. NDBM may maintain resilience if silvicultural strategies retain the structures and processes that perpetuate desired states while reducing those that enhance resilience of undesirable states. Such strategies require an understanding of harvesting impacts on slow ecosystem processes, such as seed-bank or nutrient dynamics, which in the long term can lead to ecological surprises by altering the forest's capacity to reorganize after disturbance.

Nonconstituent species in soil seed banks as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in forest fragments	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												Forest fragmentation is prevalent in regions with high human population density, but also with high biological diversity, such as southwestern China. Predicting potential changes in species composition in native forest ecosystems resulting from forest fragmentation is an important approach in assessing forest ecosystems and sustainable management of forests. The term nonconstituent species is proposed for plant species that occur in a natural landscape but are not native to it. We hypothesized that fragmentation of continuous forests significantly increases both the richness and the size of soil seed banks of nonconstituent species. To test our hypothesis we compared soil seed banks in three small fragments and one large tract of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. In total, 249 species were identified in all soil samples from the four sites. Nonconstituent species represented 36.4%-61.5% of the total taxa and 33.8%-59.6% of total germinants from soil samples in the three forest fragments, but only 3.7%-7.9% of total taxa and 7.5%-9.4% of total germinants from soil samples in the continuous forest tract. Both richness and size of soil seed banks of nonconstituent species were greater under forest fragments than under continuous forest. A majority of nonconstituent species were native weeds and annual herbs with wind-dispersed seeds; most were present in soil seed banks but not in aboveground vegetation. We suggest that nonconstituent species in soil seed banks could be used as an indicator species group for assessing human disturbance. If so, the richness and size of soil seed banks of nonconstituent species could play an important role in quantifying disturbance in forests.																	0045-5067					SEP	2006	36	9					2300	2316		10.1139/X06-137							WOS:000241585000022

Genomic DNA from four rye samples varying in their initial viability after one and three cycles of reproduction was analyzed by AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) fingerprinting. Seven EcoRI/MseI primer combinations defined 663 fragments, and seven PstI/MyeI primer combinations defined 551 fragments. The variation in the frequency of the seventy-four EcoRI/MseI bands was statistically significant between samples. These changes could be attributed to genetic changes occurring during storage and regeneration. However, the PstI/MseI fragments appeared to be uninfluenced by seed ageing, regeneration and propagation. A combined Principle Coordinate Analysis revealed differences between samples with different initial viability. We showed that materials with low initial viability differ in their response from highly viable ones, and that the changes exhibited in the former case are preserved through regeneration cycles.

J	Gepts, P				Gepts, Paul			Plant genetic resources conservation and utilization: The accomplishments and future of a societal insurance policy	CROP SCIENCE												Concerns about the genetic erosion of crop genetic resources (CGR) were first articulated by scientists in the mid-20th century and have since become an important part of national policies and international treaties. The C-8 (Plant Genetic Resources) section of the Crop Science Society of America (CSSA) was created in 1990 in response to these concerns. Over the last 50 yr, both ex situ and in situ conservation have been set up to maintain threatened CGR. During this period, a set of tools (core collections, molecular markers, and geographic information systems) has been adopted to facilitate conservation and utilization by breeders. Current and future trends include characterization of the genotypic basis of phenotypic variation and the evolutionary, ecological, and human factors that have shaped CGR. The intellectual property regime to which CGR are subjected since 1980 has limited the exchange of germplasm. It remains to be seen if these regimes will evolve so as to achieve basic goals of conservation of genetic diversity and traditional knowledge associated with diversity, while at the same time reward breeders and farmers. Funding of biodiversity conservation remains a critical point. Finally, broadening the conservation circle to establish closer collaborations with grassroots conservation movements and community seed banks is necessary to better conserve the broad range of CGR and as an essential starting point for participatory breeding efforts.

Seed germination: interpopulation variationand effect of light, temperature, presowing treatments and seed desiccation	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												Germplasm conservation of medicinal plants is of increasing interest and, when possible, seed banking is the most efficient system for ex situ conservation of these plant genetic resources. Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort, Guttiferae) is a medicinal plant with evidence of efficacy as an anti-depressant. The aim of this work was to increase knowledge of its seed germination behaviour by studying 68 wild populations. Seed germination tests were carried out at 25/15 degrees C under a photoperiod of 16-h light/8-h darkness. Final germination percentages were highly variable depending on the accession, ranging from 6 to 98%. Similarly, germination rate (as expressed by T-50 values) varied significantly from 6.1 to 23.0 days. The effect of seed desiccation with silica gel on subsequent germination was also studied. The effect of two other incubation temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C) and light (photoperiod or darkness) on seed germination was studied in several accessions. Temperature had no significant effect on final germination percentages. However, light significantly increased the germination of most but not all accessions assayed. Seeds from four accessions with low germination percentages were subjected to different presowing treatments that could increase germination: dry heat, hot water and gibberellic acid. Germination was promoted significantly by gibberellic acid in two of the four accessions assayed, but the thermal treatments did not enhance significantly the germination percentages. This study reveals that conclusions based on one population of Hypericum perforatum cannot characterize the germination behaviour for the entire species.				Gonzalez-Benito, M.

Monsoon rain forest seedling dynamics, northern Australia: contrasts with regeneration in eucalypt-dominated savannas	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												To explore: (1) the relative influences of site conditions, especially moisture relations, on pathways and rates of monsoon rain forest seedling and sapling regeneration, especially of canopy dominants, in northern Australia; and (2) contrasts between regeneration syndromes of dominant woody taxa in savannas and monsoon rain forest. Four monsoon rain forest sites, representative of regional major habitat and vegetation types, in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. A decadal study involved: (1) initial assessment over 2.5 years to explore within-year variability in seed rain, dormant seed banks and seedling (< 50 cm height) dynamics; and (2) thereafter, monitoring of seedling and sapling (50 cm height to 5 cm d.b.h.) dynamics undertaken annually in the late dry season. On the basis of observations from this and other studies, regeneration syndromes of dominant monsoon rain forest taxa are contrasted with comparable information for dominant woody savanna taxa, Eucalyptus and Corymbia especially. Key observations from the monsoon rain forest regeneration dynamics study component are that: (1) peak seed rain inputs of rain forest taxa were observed in the wet season at perennially moist sites, whereas inputs at seasonally dry sites extended into, or peaked in, the dry season; (2) dormant soil seed banks of woody rain forest taxa were dominated by pioneer taxa, especially figs; (3) longevity of dormant seed banks of woody monsoon rain forest taxa, including figs, was expended within 3 years; (4) seedling recruitment of monsoon rain forest woody taxa was derived mostly from wet season seed rain with limited inputs from soil seed banks; (5) at all sites rain forest seedling mortality occurred mostly in the dry season; (6) rain forest seedling and sapling densities were consistently greater at moist sites; (7) recruitment from clonal reproduction was negligible, even following unplanned low intensity fires. By comparison with dominant savanna eucalypts, dominant monsoon rain forest taxa recruit substantially greater stocks of seedlings, but exhibit slower aerial growth and development of resprouting capacity in early years, lack lignotubers in mesic species, and lack capacity for clonal reproduction. The reliance on sexual as opposed to vegetative reproduction places monsoon rain forest taxa at significant disadvantage, especially slower growing species on seasonally dry sites, given annual-biennial fires in many north Australian savannas.

Passive establishment of vegetation in constructed wetlands in agricultural settings: a case study	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Three wetlands constructed in 1995 on land adjacent to agricultural fields in northwest Ohio were allowed to establish vegetation passively. Survey data collected 1998-2001 from quadrats in open water, frequently and infrequently submerged zones within the basin, identified 77 species over the three sites. Greatest species diversity occurred in the infrequently and frequently submerged zones. The dominant species within the wetlands originated from agricultural fields, nearby drainage ditches, streams, and the seeded erosion control buffer zones surrounding the wetlands. Six years following construction, less than 50% of the dominant species were wetland species. Results suggest that for constructed wetlands in agricultural settings, plantings or seeding of desired species will be required to supplement the existing sources of wetland vegetation species.																	0030-0950					SEP	2006	106	4					164	168									WOS:000242721300006

Influence of high temperatures on seed germination of a special Pinus pinaster stand adapted to frequent fires	PLANT ECOLOGY												This study examines the effect of fire on the germination of Pinus pinaster seeds from a population with special adaptations to this type of disturbance, due to the high frequency of fires to which they have been subjected. The action of fire was simulated in the laboratory using thermal shocks. Temperatures of 60, 90, 120, 200 and 300 degrees C were used for exposure times of 1 and 5 min. The viability of seeds of this species from the soil seed bank of a population subjected to a wildfire was also evaluated. The results show that germination is not increase by a thermal treatment. The effect is negative at temperatures above 90 degrees C and exposure times of 1 min with a significant decrease in, or even no, germination. Therefore the seeds cannot stand high temperatures and reproductive effort is placed on serotinous cone development and the production of high numbers of seeds. The high viability of the seeds from the area burned by wildfire, immediately after the fire and 1 year later, show the high potential of the soil seed bank to contribute to the regeneration of the burned area.

Seeds were collected at seven sites in the Slavkovsky les region, Czech Republic, cold-stratified for 2 months and germinated at seven temperature regimes. Under all temperature regimes, fresh seeds germinated to significantly higher percentages than older (1, 2, 3 years) seeds. For all storage lengths, seeds germinated best at alternating day/night temperatures of 20/5 degrees C. The length of the germination period had a significant effect only at low constant temperatures of 2 and 6 degrees C, where germination percentage increased between 2 and 6 months. Seasonal germination exhibited a distinct pattern, with rapid depletion of seed bank by the first spring after seed burial. Non-dormant seeds were present in the soil early in spring and late in autumn. The higher summer temperatures prevented dormancy breaking and another cold period of at least two months below 10 degrees C was needed to bring non-germinated seeds out of dormancy. The results suggest that (1) seed dormancy of H. mantegazzianum was not completely broken until the first spring, but that some seeds re-enter or retain dormancy during high summer temperatures and that (2) the threshold needed for breaking the dormancy was achieved gradually during the cold autumn and winter months. However, in a small fraction of seeds the dormancy breaking process took several years. Of seeds buried in 10 different regions of the Czech Republic, on average 8.8% survived 1 year, 2.7% 2 years and 1.2% remained viable and dormant after 3 years of burial. The ability of even small fraction of H. mantegazzianum seeds to survive for at least 3 years can result in re-invasion of this species into controlled sites.

Native plant regeneration on abandoned desert farmland: Effects of irrigation, soil preparation, and amendments on seedling establishment	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Direct seeding methods to revegetate abandoned farmland were tested at a desert site west of Phoenix, Arizona. Native seeds were broadcast onto plots prepared by mulching, imprinting, chiseling, and fertilizing with phosphorous in a split-plot design. Each main plot was split into subplots that were not irrigated, irrigated with saline (3.25 dS/m) well water, or irrigated and hand weeded of Salsola iberica. Native seeds germinated poorly on all treatments, and three annual exotic weeds (Brassica nigra, S. iberica, and Schismus spp.) dominated the plots. None of the main plot treatments (mulching, imprinting, chiseling, or fertilizing) had a significant effect on seed germination or canopy cover. Irrigation increased plant cover on plots, but weeds dominated the cover (< 4% native species, up to 50% weeds). Near the end of the second growing season a seed bank study was conducted in the greenhouse. Undisturbed desert soil had relatively few weed seeds and more native plant seeds than the disturbed agricultural soil samples, which had few viable native seeds and were dominated by Schismus spp., B. nigra, and S. iberica. The results illustrate the difficulty of establishing native plants on abandoned desert farmland due to the dominance of weedy species, the presence of salts in the soil, and the lack of adequate soil moisture in the treatments without supplemental irrigation.																	1061-2971					SEP	2006	14	3					339	348		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00142.x							WOS:000239795300003

Increasing the effectiveness of reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) control in wet meadow restorations	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration practices are often based on trial and error or anecdotal information because data from controlled experiments are not available. In wet meadow restorations of the upper Midwest United States, Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) is controlled with spring burning and spring glyphosate herbicide applications, but the relative effectiveness of either treatment with respect to P. arundinacea growth and life history has not been assessed. We designed a multiyear field experiment to evaluate effects of burning and herbicide application timings on P. arundinacea populations. Burning did not reduce P. arundinacea biomass but reduced the P. arundinacea seed bank, potentially limiting recolonization of P. arundinacea. Glyphosate applications in late August and late September were more effective than in mid-May (due to enhanced glyphosate translocation to rhizomes), such that two mid-May applications reduced P. arundinacea biomass to a level equivalent to that achieved by one late-season application. Phalaris. arundinacea recolonized rapidly from the seed bank and, in plots that received suboptimally timed (mid-May) herbicide, from rhizomes. Establishment of native species was very low, likely due to competition with recolonizing P. arundinacea. Unplanted species (from the seed bank and refugial populations) accounted for the majority of non-P. arundinacea biomass. Recolonization of other species was strongly limited by a threshold level of P. arundinacea biomass. Adequate site preparation (over multiple growing seasons) and aftercare (selective removal of P. arundinacea) will be the key to facilitating subsequent wet meadow vegetation establishment. This research provides an example of the importance of experimental evidence as the basis to improve the efficiency of restoration practices.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2006	14	3					441	451		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00152.x							WOS:000239795300013

Testing a passive revegetation approach for restoring coastal plain depression wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration of coastal plain depressions, a biologically significant and threatened wetland type of the southeastern United States, has received little systematic research. Within the context of an experimental project designed to evaluate several restoration approaches, we tested whether successful revegetation can be achieved by passive methods (recruitment from seed banks or seed dispersal) that allow for wetland "self-design" in response to hydrologic recovery. For 16 forested depressions that historically had been drained and altered, drainage ditches were plugged to reestablish natural ponding regimes, and the successional forest was harvested to open the sites and promote establishment of emergent wetland vegetation. We sampled seed bank and vegetation composition 1 year before restoration and monitored vegetation response for 3 years after. Following forest removal and ditch plugging, the restored wetlands quickly developed a dense cover of herbaceous plant species, of which roughly half were wetland species. Seed banks were a major source of wetland species for early revegetation. However, hydrologic recovery was slowed by a prolonged drought, which allowed nonwetland plant species to establish from seed banks and dispersal or to regrow after site harvest. Some nonwetland species were later suppressed by ponded conditions in the third year, but resprouting woody plants persisted and could alter the future trajectory of revegetation. Some characteristic wetland species were largely absent in the restored sites, indicating that passive methods may not fully replicate the composition of reference systems. Passive revegetation was partially successful, but regional droughts present inherent challenges to restoring depressional wetlands whose hydrologic regimes are strongly controlled by rainfall variability.					, Christopher/0000-0003-0692-3079												1061-2971					SEP	2006	14	3					452	460		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00153.x							WOS:000239795300014

The utility of aged seeds in DNA banks	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The long-term utility of DNA banks is predicated on the stability of DNA during storage. The quality and yield of DNA extracted from seeds from four garden species, which varied in age from 1 to 135 years old, was used to examine the early stages of DNA degradation. Seeds that were 70 years old yielded high molecular weight DNA, which permitted amplification of a 650 bp segment of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA and a 487 bp segment of the plastid-encoded large subunit of rubisco (rbcL). DNA extracted from seeds estimated to be about 135 years old was degraded, but still permitted amplification when routine extraction procedures were used. The rbcL sequences obtained from c. 135-year-old cucurbit seed DNA were consistent with species identifications based on seed morphological features; however, ITS sequences from the same samples were determined to be of fungal origin. A comparison of our results with studies of DNA stability in leaf specimens suggested that DNA degraded within both tissues, but perhaps more slowly within seeds. Evidence that high-quality DNA can be extracted from old, non-viable seeds expands the utility of seed banks in preserving genetic resources.

Inheritance of deep seed dormancy and stratification-mediated dormancy alleviation in Amaranthus tuberculatus	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Amaranthus tuberculatus is a weed species that has shifted emergence patterns over the past few years, presumably due to changes in seed dormancy in response to selection in agricultural fields. Although it is recognized that the seed dormancy phenotype is greatly affected by the environment, it is also acknowledged that the genotype plays a significant role. However, the importance of the genotype in determining intra-population seed dormancy variability, and the effect on emergence patterns, is not well understood. The objective of the present study was to determine the importance of the genotype on deep dormancy and the stratification-mediated dormancy alleviation in A. tuberculatus. Wild populations differing in seed dormancy were crossed and F-2 families were generated. These families were used to determine narrow sense heritability of dormancy and stratification-mediated dormancy alleviation at the individual (h(i)(2)) and family (h(i)(2)) levels. h(i)(2) ranged from 0.13 to 0.4 and 0.04 to 0.06 for the dormancy and stratification response, respectively. In the case of h(f)(2), the values ranged from 0.76 to 0.91 for deep dormancy and from 0.33 to 0.58 for the stratification response. The genetic correlation between these two traits was below 0.075, indicating that different genes control them. High temperature strengthened the dormancy of deeply dormant seeds, making them less sensitive to stratification. However, high temperature promoted the germination of non-deeply dormant seeds. It is proposed that delayed weed emergence can be generated by selecting genes that control stratification response, and not necessarily only the genes that are directly responsible for deep dormancy.

Fungal infection and soybean competition induce plastic responses in velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) growth and reproductive output	WEED SCIENCE												The historic maternal environment; the identity of competing, neighboring plants; and biotic stresses, such as fungal disease and herbivory, interact to influence the competitive ability, reproductive output, and plasticity of weed populations. A weed capable of altering its phenotype in response to environmental factors is better able to compete for resources in agroecosystems, thereby reducing crop yields and contributing more seeds to the seed bank. Velvetleaf is a highly competitive annual weed in many North American cropping systems, exhibiting a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in response to biotic and abiotic factors. We examined the effects of seed size (small and large), competitive environment (with and without soybean), and stress level (none = no treatment, moderate = pathogen inoculation, high = pathogen plus herbicide) on velvetleaf allometry and reproductive output during three field seasons. Only under the high-stress treatment was velvetleaf biomass, height, and reproductive output compromised (> 15% each), and these traits were further reduced with soybean competition. Soybean competition alone reduced velvetleaf biomass (> 50%), height (25%), and seed output (50%), but effects of competition varied with stress level. Velvetleaf plants that originated from large seeds (>= 10 mg) generally outperformed plants originating from small seeds (< 10 mg) except under the high-stress treatment. These findings suggest that velvetleaf life-history traits and reproductive output in the current generation are a function of both present and historic factors. Management strategies for this species should involve tactics that not only reduce its competitive ability (e.g., biomass, height) but also decrease its seed production via synergistic stressors such as increased crop competitiveness, reduced-rate herbicide applications, and pathogen infection.

J	Byrd, KB; Kelly, M				Byrd, Kristin B.; Kelly, Maggi			Salt marsh vegetation response to edaphic and topographic changes from upland sedimentation in a pacific estuary	WETLANDS												This study investigated how changes in salt marsh soil properties and topography on sediment fans related to shifts in salt marsh plant community composition in the Elkhorn Slough Watershed, California, USA. Several sediment fans have formed in this watershed as soil eroding from farms moved downslope, filling marshes, mudflats, and channels. Sandy sediment deposition increased marsh plain elevation and altered edaphic properties by increasing bulk density and decreasing soil moisture, salinity, and soil nitrogen compared to reference sites. These changes created a strong wetland-upland gradient and influenced the development of well-defined vegetation zones from wetland to upland: pickleweed (Salicornia virginica), cattail (Typha spp.) and bulrush (Scirpus spp.), and arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis). Based on statistical analysis, arroyo willow grew in a distinct edaphic environment, and its expansion into the salt marsh was restricted by elevation in tidal areas greater than 1.80 m NAVD 88, spring soil moisture levels lower than 20%, and year-round salinity levels lower than 2.67 dS/m. Cattail and bulrush were present in transitional environmental conditions with fluctuating salinity and at an elevation similar to that of the pickleweed community. The hydrogeologic setting played a part in this change, as the contribution of upland sandy soils likely facilitated the emergence of new edaphic properties including lower salinity, lower soil moisture, and reduced soil nutrients. The findings in this study underline the importance of on-going erosion-control efforts to estuarine conservation in Central California.

Effects of salinity and temperature on the germination of Phragmites australis, Juncus kraussii, and Juncus acutus: Implications for estuarine restoration initiatives	WETLANDS												We describe effects of salinity and temperature on germination characteristics of three dominant macrophytes, Phragmites australis, Juncus acutus, and J. kraussii, located in wetlands along the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. These wetlands were altered, from estuarine to freshwater habitats, by flood mitigation activities initiated during the 1970s. Tidal restoration to approximately 300 hectares of the marsh is planned to occur by 2008, with the goal to reduce freshwater vegetation in favor of salt marsh species. We determined if timing restoration projects to coincide with natural germination cycles or seasonal conditions of high salinity would be disadvantageous to P. australis or J acutus germination. Germination trials lasted 25 days under two temperature range treatments (10-25 and 15-30 degrees C) and a salinity gradient (0-30 ppt). Many P. australis seeds commenced decomposition after three days (up to 58%). Increased salinity lowered germination in all species; however, only P. australis was influenced by temperature. Phragmites australis germinated in all conditions, although germination rate was low (2% +/- 1.7) in the highest salinity treatment at high temperature regime. Both Juncus species obtained 100% germination in freshwater, failed to germinate in the highest salinity, and seed viability was not affected by 25 days emersion in high salinity. For areas dominated by P. australis in eastern Australia, we suggest that tidal reinstatement should be initiated in late autumn when P. australis seed banks are low. Additionally, periods of heavy rainfall, which reduce soil salinity, may help other species colonize the area. Further studies are required to determine characteristics of J. acutus that can be used to repress the species spread along the eastern coast of Australia. Currently, active measures involving chemical and physical weed suppression, litter removal, and mass planting of native species, are likely to be required to achieve management goals.

Stochastic modelling of feral plant populations with seed immigration and road verge management	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The escape of cultivated species from fields could induce changes in the natural balance of semi-natural habitats. We therefore developed a modelling approach to highlight the determinants of feral population dynamics in the case of winter oilseed rape. This stochastic stage-structured model encompasses roadside verge management, seed immigration, seed bank and density-dependence. Within the framework of comparative demography, the elasticity decomposition of the extinction probability was performed according to the three main processes of population dynamics highlighted by the one-at-a-time elasticity analysis: management, seed bank and rosette survival. Despite large extinction probabilities, populations persisted at least 5 years. Results showed that anthropogenic processes (management, seed transport, cropping) and intrinsic processes focal recruitment, seed bank) both. govern population persistence. Models of oilseed rape escaped from fields should thus include these two types of processes. Results also highlighted the interaction between seed bank and seed immigration: increasing immigration frequency increased the positive impact of seed bank on population persistence. Intraspecific comparisons via elasticity decomposition could be adapted to other cultivated species to quantify general processes in escape from fields. Such approaches are crucial for understanding how feral populations could facilitate (trans-)gene transfer to crops and wild relatives and to choose optimal control strategies to limit their spread.

Sources of diversity in a grassland metacommunity: Quantifying the contribution of dispersal to species richness	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Metacommunity theory suggests a potentially important role for dispersal in diversity maintenance at local, as well as regional, scales. In addition, propagule addition experiments have shown that dispersal often limits local diversity. However, actual dispersal rates into local communities and the contribution of immigrants to observed local diversity are poorly known. We present a new approach that partitions the diversity of a target community into dispersal-maintained and dispersal-independent components. Specifically, we quantify distances through space and time to the nearest potential seed source for naturally occurring recruits in target communities by using hierarchical data on species pools ( local, site, region, and seed bank). Using this "recruit tag" approach, we found that dispersal contributed 29%-57% of the seedling diversity in perennial grass-lands with different successional histories. However, both dispersal and seedling mortality remained remarkably constant, in absolute terms, over succession. The considerable loss of diversity over secondary succession ( 66%), therefore, could be understood only by considering how these processes interact with the decreasing disturbance rate (i.e., frequency of gaps) in later-successional sites. We conclude that a metacommunity perspective is relevant and necessary to understand the diversity and community assembly of this study system.

Seed dormancy and delayed flowering in monocarpic plants: Selective interactions in a stochastic environment	AMERICAN NATURALIST												We explore the effects of temporal variation in multiple demographic rates on the joint evolution of delayed reproduction and seed dormancy using integral projection models ( IPMs). To do this, we extend the standard IPM to include a discrete state variable representing the number of seeds in the seed bank, density- dependent recruitment, and temporal variation in demography. Parameter estimates for Carlina vulgaris and Carduus nutans are obtained from long- term studies. Carlina is relatively long lived and has a shortlived seed bank, whereas most Carduus plants flower in their first year and the seed bank is long lived. Using the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ESS) approach, we predict the observed flowering and germination strategies. There is excellent agreement between the predictions and the field observations. The effects of temporal variation on the joint ESS are partitioned into components arising from nonlinear averaging ( systematic changes in the mean resulting from the interaction between variability and nonlinearity) and nonequilibrium dynamics ( fluctuations in fitness caused by temporal variation). This shows that temporal variation can have substantial effects on the observed flowering and germination strategies and that covariance between demographic processes is important. We extend the models to include spatial population structure and assess the robustness of the results from the nonspatial models.

Interactive influences of fire intensity and vertical distribution of seed banks on post-fire recolonization of a tall-tussock grassland in Argentina	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Recolonization patterns of a tall-tussock grassland differ between low-frequency and high-intensity fires. A series of laboratory and field experiments were performed on the seed bank and on seeds of the main colonizing species (Carduus acanthoides, Cirsium vulgare, Lotus glaber) to determine and compare the effects of fire frequency and fire intensity on their recolonization potential. Seed-bank size of colonizing species did not show a significant variation with contrasting fire frequencies, so overall interval-dependent effects do not seem to affect their propagule pool at the time of fire. However, frequency of fire modified the proportion of viable seeds and their dormancy state according to species. Accumulated emergence from experimentally buried soft-seeds of Lotus was lower after high-intensity fires (following wind direction) than after back-fires (against wind direction), but no significant effects of fire-front direction on seedling emergence were observed for hard-seeds of Lotus nor Carduus and Cirsium. Seedling emergence from buried seeds of Cirsium was increased with doubling fuel loads, particularly from deepen soil layers, where Cirsium had most of their viable seeds after a low frequency of fire. Emergence from hard-seeds of Lotus was less promoted than Cirsium by doubling fuel loads, and according to analysis of excavated seedlings, it was completely inhibited from upper soil layers of the seed bank. Integration of species-specific and burial depth-specific responses of Cirsium and Lotus seeds according to fuel load, vertical distribution of the seed banks, seed dormant states and mean emergence depths, resulted in expected emergence values which agree with their previously observed patterns of recolonization. Thus, event-dependent mechanisms had a better predictive value on recolonization success of the studied species than the observed cumulative effects of fire history on their seed-bank size.																	1442-9985					AUG	2006	31	5					608	622		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01593.x							WOS:000239112400008

Da Silva			The invasion of Pteridium aquilinum and the impoverishment of the seed bank in fire prone areas of Brazilian Atlantic Forest	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Several studies have documented that fires are widespread in the tropics. Because fire in the Atlantic Rain Forest is rare, fire events and their consequences at the community level have not been evaluated. This study describes the composition of different seed banks in areas of Atlantic Forest. The study was carried out in the National Park of Tijuca in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Four different areas were chosen considering their differences on fire history. Fifteen soil surface samples (23 cm (centimeter) diameter x7 cm height at 5 cm deep) were obtained from random locations within each site. The dominant family at all study sites except in the most preserved one were Dennstaetiaceae, followed by Melastomataceae and Poaceae. The family Dennstaetiaceae was exclusively represented by Pteridium aquilinum (Klf.) Herter. There were no significant differences among areas when comparing the number of seedlings excluding P. aquilinum. However, the number of P. aquilinum was higher in the most disturbed area, while Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae were more frequent in a less impacted area. Our results suggest that the seed bank in disturbed areas of the Atlantic Forest possibly will not contribute for forest restoration after disturbance.				Matos, Dalva M.

Challenges to introducing and managing disturbance regimes for Holocarpha macradenia, an endangered annual grassland forb	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Introducing rare plants to new sites for conservation to offset effects of habitat destruction requires detailed knowledge of habitat requirements, plant demography, and management needs. We conducted a factorial experiment replicated at three coastal prairie sites to test the effects of clipping frequency and litter accumulation on seed germination, seedling survival, reproduction, and seedling recruitment of introduced populations of the endangered, tall-stature, annual forb, Holocarpha macradenia (DC.) E Greene.. Clipping favored H. macradenia, primarily by enhancing seed germination and flower production. Litter accumulation had no effect on seed germination, even after 5 years of treatments. Seedling recruitment was highly site specific with large numbers of recruits recorded at only one of three sites. Although recruitment of seedlings was higher in clipped plots for 2-3 years, by 4-5 years after introduction very few seedlings survived to reproduction in any treatment. We attribute this result to a combination of poor habitat quality, small population size, and lack of a seed bank. We were unsuccessful in introducing this relatively well-studied species of concern to apparently suitable habitat at multiple sites in multiple years, which suggests that translocating rare plant populations to mitigate for habitat destruction is an expensive and highly uncertain endeavor.

We studied fire recurrence effects on Pinus halepensis populations at a regional level in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), by comparing post-fire populations in paired areas once-burnt (1994) and twice-burnt (once from 1978 to 1991, and again in 1994). Survey was conducted 10 years after fire in 14 study sites: density, height, and diameter were recorded, and dendrochronological analyses were conducted to deal with time of recruitment and radial growth. In both types of areas, post-fire recruitment took place mainly just after the summer fire, in 1994 (87% of individuals), and also in 1995 (12%). Density was significantly lower in twice-burnt areas than in once-burnt ones, which is attributed to fire intervals shorter than 15 years, the minimum time-length required by R halepensis populations to recover pre-fire density levels. Height and diameter records evidenced a growth decline in twice-burnt areas. Dendrochronological analyses revealed that radial pine growth was lower in twice-burnt areas along the first post-fire years (from 1994 to 1999), thus resulting in lower total radial growth than in once-burnt areas. Such radial growth differences are attributed to differences in soil nutrient availability along the first post-fire years (post-fire nutrient boom), resulting from differences in pre-fire fuel loads between once- and twice-burnt areas. According to our results, drastic changes in P halepensis forests in the western Mediterranean Basin are likely to be expected under fire regimes characterized by high levels of fire recurrence.

J	Verkaik, I; Espelta, JM				Verkaik, Iraima; Espelta, Josep M.			Post-fire regeneration thinning, cone production, serotiny and regeneration age in Pinus halepensis	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Many pines growing in fire-prone ecosystems exhibit an abundant production of cones and the retention of part of these cones as an aerial seed bank in the canopy (serotiny). The protection of seeds and their prolific release after fire facilitate the re-colonization of the burned area. However, over-stocking in this fire regenerated stands may constraint tree growth, as well as increase the risk of new wildfires. Therefore, thinning is strongly recommended both to reduce fire occurrence and to reduce intraspecific competition. Although the benefits of thinning for tree growth in fire regenerated forests have been thoroughly documented, less attention has been paid to the effects on reproductive traits such as the timing of reproduction, the size of the cone crop and the degree of serotiny. In this study, the effects of thinning on the reproductive traits of fire regenerated Pinus halepensis forests with different regeneration age (22-, 18- and 10-yr-old) were investigated. In the thinned plots, there was a greater increase in the percentage of pines that started producing cones for the first time (thinning = 50.4 +/- 11.4%, control = 13.3 +/- 4.0%), as well as an increase in the number of new cones produced per pine (between two- and six-fold compared to the control stands). Our results show that thinning may decrease serotiny depending on age. Thus, the number of pines bearing open cones did not change during the study in the thinned or control plots of the younger stands (10 yrs) or in the control plots of 22 and 18 yrs, while it increased in the thinned stands of 22 and 18 yrs. Not a single cone was observed to open during the study in the thinned or control 10-yr-old plots, while in the 22- and 18-yr-stands the number of old serotinous cones per pine opened was higher in the thinned plots than in the control ones. Therefore, we conclude that thinning in fire regenerated R halepensis forests should be conducted in younger stands (10-yr-old, in our study), because thinning at this age shortens the juvenile (non-reproductive) period and greatly increases the number of new cones produced per pine in completely serotinous individuals.

Many parasites of medical and veterinary importance infect via free-living stages that undergo a period of development in the environment before seeking a host. Frequently, considerable variation is observed in the development rates of these stages, such that some individuals may be considered to occupy distinct subpopulations, similar to a plant's seed bank. Under certain conditions, these subpopulations may act as a reservoir for the parasite, buffering it from the impact of management strategies and reducing control success. 2. We assessed the impact of intraspecific variation in development rates on parasite control by developing a population dynamic model of the ectoparasite Argulus coregoni, a major parasite of Finnish fish farms. We divided argulid eggs into two subpopulations: an exposed class with fast hatching rates and an 'egg bank' with slower hatching rates. We then assessed the success of a number of potential control strategies under a range of egg bank hatching regimes. 3. The predicted seasonal dynamics of the various life-cycle stages matched well those observed in Finnish fish farms. Simulations showed that the long-term growth rate of the argulid population tends to be reduced by the presence of a slow-hatching egg bank, unless the egg bank affords some protection in the form of reduced egg mortality. 4. Sensitivity analysis showed that the key stages of the parasite's life cycle are those that relate to the on-fish juvenile mortality and development rates. The next most sensitive parameters relate to the number of viable eggs at the start of the year, such as female fecundity and overwinter egg survival. We showed that current control approaches that target these stages could prove highly effective at suppressing the argulid population. However, long-term control was greatly reduced in both cases as the proportion of eggs entering the egg bank increased. This was especially true if mortality of the egg bank was lower than that of the exposed eggs. 5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding the factors affecting parasite persistence is vital for the development of effective long-term control. We have shown that inherent heterogeneity within a parasite population may have a substantial impact on its long-term growth rate, and can be an important mechanism reducing the effectiveness of targeted control strategies in the field.

A more general aim is to assess the impact of fire as a natural factor influencing the vegetation of the southern slopes of the Alps. Locations: Alps, southern Switzerland. Methods: Presence-absence data to fit the model were obtained from the most recent field mapping of C. salviifolius. The quantitative environmental predictors used in this study include topographic, climatic and disturbance (fire) predictors. Models were fitted by logistic regression and evaluated by jackknife and bootstrap approaches. Changes in fire regime were simulated by increasing the time-return interval of fire (simulating longer periods without fire). Two scenarios were considered: no fire in the past 15 years; or in the past 35 years. Results: Rock cover, slope, topographic position, potential evapotranspiration and time elapsed since the last fire were selected in the final model. The Nagelkerke R-2 of the model for C. salviifolius was 0.57 and the Jackknife area under the curve evaluation was 0.89. The bootstrap evaluation revealed model robustness. By increasing the return interval of fire by either up to 15 years, or 35 years, the modelled C. salviifolius population declined by 30-40%, respectively. Main conclusions: Although fire plays a significant role, topography and rock cover appear to be the most important predictors, suggesting that the distribution of C. salviifolius in the southern Swiss Alps is closely related to the availability of supposedly competition-free sites, such as emerging bedrock, ridge locations or steep slopes. Fire is more likely to play a secondary role in allowing C. salviifolius to extend its occurrence temporarily, by increasing germination rates and reducing the competition from surrounding vegetation. To maintain a viable dormant seed bank for C. salviifolius, conservation managers should consider carrying out vegetation clearing and managing wild fire propagation to reduce competition and ensure sufficient recruitment for this species.

The number and diversity of species and stem density decreased with distance from the broad-leaved forest in maturing gap stands (51-58 years old; > 10 years after crown snow damage), but not in recent gap stands (34-42 years old; < 10 years after crown snow damage), and increased with improved light conditions in the interior of recent gap stands, but not in that of maturing gap stands. The stem densities of tall and small tree species and woody lianas were greater in the interior of recent gap stands than in maturing gap stands. Woody lianas, which are characteristically shade intolerant, had a high stem density in the interior of recent gap stands. In contrast, the stem density of shrubs was greater in maturing gap stands than in recent gap stands, irrespective of distance. Shade-tolerant shrubs had a high stem density in maturing gap stands. Wind-dispersed and frugivore-dispersed species were concentrated at the edges of maturing gap stands, but some frugivore-dispersed species, which may persist in soil seed banks, occurred in the interior of recent gap stands. Gravity-dispersed species tended to occur both at the plantation edge and in the interior. The differences in the occurrence patterns of broad-leaved trees in the two types of stands reflected the difference in the effect of both the distance from the adjacent broad-leaved forest and the light conditions related to canopy gaps, with the time since gap formation in a region where crown snow damage often occurs.																	1341-6979					AUG	2006	11	4					267	274		10.1007/s10310-006-0215-x							WOS:000240059300007						
J	Leyer, I				Leyer, Ilona			Dispersal, diversity and distribution patterns in pioneer vegetation: The role of river-floodplain connectivity	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Are there changes in dispersal patterns in floodplain pioneer vegetation with effects on seedling number, species richness and species composition along a gradient of declining river-floodplain connectivity? Location: Middle Elbe river floodplain, Germany. Methods: An experiment with five treatments was set up along a gradient of declining river-floodplain connectivity, partitioning seedlings into three groups: (1) emerging solely from water dispersed seeds, (2) from wind/animal dispersed seeds and (3) from the soil diaspore bank. Two controls were established: without any manipulation and exclusion of all seeds. The results were compared with those of vegetation and soil sampling to evaluate the representativeness of the experimental sites in terms of species composition, diversity, seedling number and soil parameters. Results: Water dispersal and the soil diaspore bank were the major dispersal strategies shaping floodplain pioneer vegetation at the Middle Elbe river. The number of seedlings, species richness and the variation in species composition in these habitats depend on the degree of connectivity. The seedling number and species richness is highest in sites of permanent or almost permanent exchange with the main channel, where water dispersal additionally contributes to the number of seedlings grown from the soil seed bank. Conclusion: The results underline the importance of river-floodplain ecotones as sink habitats for water-dispersed seeds. Considering the strongly reduced river-floodplain interactions due to dykes and other engineering structures, management strategies are necessary to improve connectivity and the renewal of fluvial land forms.

Genetic structure among and within peripheral and central populations of three endangered floodplain violets	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Understanding the partitioning of genetic variance in peripheral and central populations may shed more light on the effects of genetic drift and gene flow on population genetic structure and, thereby, improve attempts to conserve genetic diversity. We analysed genetic structure of peripheral and central populations of three insect-pollinated violets (Viola elatior, Viola pumila, Viola stagnina) to evaluate to what extent these patterns can be explained by gene flow and genetic drift. Amplified fragment length polymorphism was used to analyse 930 individuals of 50 populations. Consistent with theoretical predictions, peripheral populations were smaller and more isolated, differentiation was stronger, and genetic diversity and gene flow lower in peripheral populations of V. pumila and V. stagnina. In V. elatior, probably historic fragmentation effects linked to its specific habitat type were superimposed on the plant geographic (peripheral-central) patterns, resulting in lower relative importance of gene flow in central populations. Genetic variation between regions (3-6%), among (30-37%) and within populations (60-64%) was significant. Peripheral populations lacked markers that were rare and localized in central populations. Loss of widespread markers in peripheral V. stagnina populations indicated genetic erosion. Autocorrelation within populations was statistically significant up to a distance of 10-20 m. Higher average genetic similarity in peripheral populations than in central ones indicated higher local gene flow, probably owing to management practices. Peripheral populations contributed significantly to genetic variation and contained unique markers, which made them valuable for the conservation of genetic diversity.

Genetics of cattails in radioactively contaminated areas around Chornobyl	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Research on populations from radioactively contaminated areas around Chornobyl has produced ambiguous results for the presence of radiation effects. More studies are needed to provide information on whether radiation exposure at Chornobyl significantly affected genetic diversity in natural populations of various taxa. Eleven and nine variable microsatellite loci were used to test for differences in genetic diversity between reference and Chornobyl populations of two cattail species (Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia, respectively) from Ukraine. Our purpose was to determine whether radiation had a significant impact on genetic diversities of the Chornobyl Typha populations, or if their genetic composition might be better explained by species demography and/or changes in population dynamics, mainly in sexual and asexual reproduction. Populations closest to the reactor had increased genetic diversities and high number of genets, which likely were due to factors other than radiation including increased gene flow among Chornobyl populations, enhanced sexual reproduction within populations, and/or origin of the genets from seed bank. Both Typha species also demonstrated small but significant effects associated with latitude, geographical regions, and watersheds. Typha's demography in Ukraine possibly varies with these three factors, and the small difference between Chornobyl and reference populations of T. latifolia detected after partitioning the total genetic variance between them is probably due primarily to these factors. However, the positive correlations of several genetic characteristics with radionuclide concentrations suggest that radiation may have also affected genetics of Chornobyl Typha populations but much less than was expected considering massive contamination of the Chornobyl area.

A study of Atriplex tatarica (Chenopodiaceae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												We investigated to what extent the soil seed bank differed genetically and spatially in comparison to three consecutive life history stages (seedlings, mature plants, and fruiting plants) in a natural population of Atriplex tatarica. Representatives of particular life history stages from twenty subunits within a large population were randomly collected and subjected to allozyme analysis. Comparison of population polymorphism among various life history stages showed significant differences in observed heterozygosity (H-O) and F statistics (F-IS and F-ST), but nonsignificant ones in the cases of number of alleles per polymorphic locus (A) and gene diversity (H-S). These results indicate an increasing number of heterozygotes, a decreasing level of inbreeding and an increase of the partitioning genetic diversity among populations with increasing population age. Spatial autocorrelation was used to calculate f, the average co-ancestry coefficient between individuals within distance intervals of two meters along a 39 m long transect. Significant positive fine scale genetic structure was detected in mature and fruiting plants but not in soil seeds and seedlings stages. The results of the presented study on A. tatarica indicated that significant differences exist in genetic differentiation, differentiation in allele frequencies and spatial autocorrelation among early (soil seeds and seedlings) and late (mature and fruiting plants) life history stages but not within early and late ones. This pattern suggests that, rather than storing genetic variability in the soil or germination and establishment success, self-thinning might be the major microselective force in populations of A. tatarica.

J	Valleriani, A; Tielborger, K				Valleriani, A; Tielborger, K			Effect of age on germination of dormant seeds	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												Dormant seeds in permanent soil seed banks change their germination probability with age, but little is known about the causes of this behavior. Since current adaptive models do not consider the age structure of the seed bank, the sole explanation is that changes in germination probability with age are due to passive accidental factors or to decay of seeds. Here we present a theory, which shows that such changes might be adaptive. In particular, in density-regulated populations, the evolutionarily stable fraction of germinating seeds in each age class increases with age whenever age-dependent mortality of dormant seeds remains constant or increases with age.

J	De Luis, M; Raventos, J; Gonzalez-Hidalgo, JC				De Luis, Martin; Raventos, Jose; Gonzalez-Hidalgo, Jose Carlos			Post-fire vegetation succession in Mediterranean gorse shrublands	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In Western Mediterranean areas, forest fires are frequent in forests established on old croplands where post-fire regeneration is limited to obligate-seeder species. This has resulted in the spread of Mediterranean gorse (Ulex parviflorus) increasing the risk and severity of fires. The aim of this paper is to test the auto successional hypothesis on a Mediterranean gorse shrubland dominated by seeders species. Particular objectives are: a) to analyze the effect of fire on seedling emergence, survival and growth on the main species involved on plant regeneration process. b) to identify changes in the relative abundance of species as consequence of fire by using a before-after experiment. Then, after experimental fires, seedling emergence, survival and growth rates were analyzed for the main species present in the vegetation regeneration process. Our results show that Mediterranean gorse communities are dominated by Fabaceae species (64% of individuals, mainly of Ulex parviflorus). However, our study demonstrates that vegetation regeneration after fire does not display an auto successional pattern and is produced a change on dominance from Fabaceae (mainly U. parviflorus) to Cistaceae (mainly C. albidus) species. Cistaceae seedlings (mainly Cistus albidus and Helianthemum marifolium) were the most abundant post-fire (63% of total germination) while species of Fabaceae (including U. parviflorus and Ononis fruticosa) represented 25%, and Lamiaceae (restricted to Rosmarinus officinalis) comprised only 3% of total emergences. Seedling survival did not differ significantly from one species to another (25-30% of initial individuals over 3 years) but seedling growth rates were also higher for Cistaceae than for Fabaceae individuals. Then, after fire, in terms of biomass, Fabaceae presence decreased from 78.7% to 13.1% while Cistaceae increase from 8% to 83.4%. Given that fire frequency, intensity or severity is partially controlled by the composition and structure of the plant community population changes in the main species, could affect the future fire regime and in turn, affect the hydrological, ecological and economic role of a large stretch of forest and woodland areas in western Mediterranean ecosystems.

While the fields were the same size, were adjacent to the same patch of remnant steppe and were cultivated with the same crop, site-specific environmental variables contributed to 23% of the vegetation patterns; each site was characterised by its unique historical trajectory and thus, by a particular set of species. Distance from boundaries contributed to 10% of the vegetation patterns. Species characterising the surrounding steppe were found close to boundaries; species characterising abandoned fields were found further away. Winter seed banks and summer deep seed bank did not contribute much to either effect and were characterised by species dating back from past cultivation. Conversely, summer surface seed bank greatly contributed to (83%) the differences in species composition between the three fields. Seed rain contributed to differences in species composition between fields (91%) and distance (76%). Ant-borne seeds largely contributed to the differences between fields (87%). The colonisation of steppe species on field margins occurs mainly through seed rain and is very slow and incomplete. In a semi-and fragmented open-landscape, patches of native vegetation do not play a great role in colonisation processes, and itinerant sheep grazing is insufficient to initiate recovery.

J	Cherry, JA; Gough, L				Cherry, JA; Gough, L			Temporary floating island formation maintains wetland plant species richness: The role of the seed bank	AQUATIC BOTANY												In wetlands, fluctuating water levels create opportunities for recruitment of new individuals from seed banks, and drawdown periods often favor the establishment of species adapted for life in shallow water. In this study, floating island formation functioned similarly to drawdowns in water level by creating patches of sediment that were less inundated relative to the surrounding deep water marsh. The disturbance of floating island formation (i.e., mats of sediment and vegetation rising vertically in the water column) also resulted in reduced cover of the dominant rooted, floating-leaved macrophyte, thereby creating temporary gaps for the establishment of other species. To assess how floating island formation influences species richness and composition of wetland plant assemblages relative to surrounding deep water marsh. field surveys of plant percent cover on and off of islands were conducted over 2 years, along with a controlled greenhouse seed bank experiment in which levels of inundation were manipulated. Five plant species were present in deep water marsh compared to 22 in surrounding on floating islands. Plant assemblages on floating islands consisted primarily of emergent species, while floating-leaved perennials dominated the deep water marsh. Species richness and assemblage composition in the greenhouse seed bank experiment differed among water level treatments in a manner consistent with differences observed in field surveys. Assemblages germinating under minimal inundation treatments were more species rich (3.5-4.3 species per sample) and contained more emergent species (> 450 individuals m(-2)) than did those germinating under flooded conditions (2.8-2.9 species per sample and < 405 individuals m(-2)). This study, in addition to being the only reported seed bank study of temporary (i.e., seasonal) floating islands, demonstrates that islands altered levels of inundation favoring the germination of more species-rich, emergent wetland plant assemblages. Because these islands persisted long enough for several species to set seed, their formation may be one mechanism by which the seed bank is replenished and populations of otherwise uncommon species are maintained.

Information on seed germination of annual species in the temperate semiarid region of China is limited. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the seed germination behavior of 17 annual species collected from a wide range of habitats in the Wulanaodu region of Horqin sandy land. Measurements were conducted on freshly collected seeds and on samples subjected to chilling and dry storage for 150 days and 365 days. Three species achieved germination percentages greater than 90% in any storage condition. Eight species had an after-ripening mechanism, and freshly collected seeds could mature and germinate in a single growing season. Three species had strong innate dormancy, and this fraction (18-50%) of seeds did not germinate even after dry storage for 365 days. Two species had short-lived seeds, whose longevity was less than one year. The majority of annual species showed potential for rapid germination and a unimodal germination curve with time, expressed as the proportion of seed germinated per day. A minority of the species had long germination duration and exhibited a multimodal process. Seventeen annual species produced four germination patterns and two germination strategies based on germination percentages and processes. Species with high germination percentages, short germination duration and a unimodal curve, exhibited risk-taking strategy in a growing season. Species with a low final germination fraction or long germination duration and a multimodal curve or both, showed a risk avoiding strategy. The adaptability to uncertain environments of some annual species in temperate semiarid region is discussed.																	1532-4982	1532-4990				JUL-SEP	2006	20	3					195	207		10.1080/15324980600705651							WOS:000238763400002

A landscape perspective of the stream corridor invasion and habitat characteristics of an exotic (Dioscorea oppositifolia) in a pristine watershed in illinois	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The spatial distribution of exotics across riparian landscapes is not uniform, and research elaborating the environmental constraints and dispersal behavior that underlie these patterns of distribution is warranted. This study examined the spatial distribution, growth patterns, and habitat constraints of populations of the invasive Dioscorea oppositifolia in a forested stream corridor of a tributary of Drury Creek in Giant City State Park, IL. The distribution of D. oppositifolia was determined at the watershed scale mainly by floodplain structure and connectivity. Populations of D. oppositifolia were confined to the floodplain, with overbank flooding from the stream. Dioscorea oppositifolia probably originates in disturbed areas upstream of natural corridors, and subsequently, the species disperses downstream into pristine canyons or ravines via bulbils dispersing in the water. In Giant City State Park, populations of D. oppositifolia were distributed on the floodplain across broad gradients of soil texture, light, slope, and potential radiation. The study also examined the longevity of bulbils in various micro-environments to illuminate strategies for the management of the species in invaded watersheds. After 1 year, the highest percentages of bulbils were viable under leaves, and much lower percentages were viable over leaves, in soil, and in the creek (76.0 +/- 6.8, 21.2 +/- 9.6, 21.6 +/- 3.6, and 5.2 +/- 5.2%), respectively. This study suggests that management procedures that reduce leaf litter on the forest floor (e.g., prescribed burning) could reduce the number of bulbils of D. oppositifolia stored in the watershed.

J	Robson, DB				Robson, Diana Bizecki			A conservation evaluation of Smooth Goosefoot, Chenopodium subglabrum (Chenopodiaceae), in Canada	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Smooth Goosefoot (Chenopodium subglabrum) is restricted to North America and reaches its northern distribution limit in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The habitat of Chenopodium subglabrum contains some element of active sand. It is commonly found on the stabilizing edges of active dunes as well as dune blowouts, and occasionally on bare or recently disturbed sand plains. Chenopodium subglabrum is a sexually reproducing annual species with seeds that may remain in the seed bank for several years, waiting for the conditions it favours for germination. Germination of this species is erratic, possibly in response to moisture, making the overall population trend difficult to determine. The estimated population in Canada is likely between 5000 and 10000 individuals. There has been considerable loss of habitat as dunes become vegetated. The processes of dune stabilization and fire control threaten survival of this species.																	0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2006	120	3					335	341		10.22621/cfn.v120i3.325							WOS:000251660300009

Eradication is commonly declared either on an ad hoc basis, on notions of seed bank longevity, or on setting arbitrary thresholds of 1% or 5% confidence that the species is not present. Rather than declaring eradication at some arbitrary level of confidence, we take an economic approach in which we stop looking when the expected costs outweigh the expected benefits. We develop theory that determines the number of years of absent surveys required to minimize the net expected cost. Given detection of a species is imperfect, the optimal stopping time is a trade-off between the cost of continued surveying and the cost of escape and damage if eradication is declared too soon. A simple rule of thumb compares well to the exact optimal solution using stochastic dynamic programming. Application of the approach to the eradication programme of Helenium amarum reveals that the actual stopping time was a precautionary one given the ranges for each parameter.

Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations contribute to the regeneration of holly (Ilex aquifolium L.) in mediterranean central Spain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The aim of this study is to evaluate the recruitment possibilities of holly (flex aquifolium L.) populations under Pinus sylvestris plantations in the mountains of Central Spain. Population recruitment of holly under P. sylvestris L. plantations was studied at two localities. We sampled holly seed rain, seed bank, and seedling emergence and survival (of both emerged and planted seedlings) in both localities. Seed germination was analysed by randomly sowing flex seeds and their subsequent recollection and analysis over the following 3 years (only in one locality). Seed rain, seed bank and emerged seedling densities did not differ between localities. Seed bank density was between 10 and 20 seeds m(-2), considerably higher than the observed seed rain (0.4-1.2 seeds m(-2)), and also higher than the emerged seedling density (0-4 seedlings m(-2)). But flex is not very efficient in germinating under pine forests (29.1% germination after 3 years). This may indicate a seed accumulation process of at least 5 years. Seedling survival for the first year differed among the studied sites (50-60 vs. 17%). Nevertheless these survival rates are higher than those found for the same seedling populations in different forest habitats (not Scots pine forests) from near locations. Differences in summer water stress between the study sites are proposed as the main cause of the observed differences in seedling survival. It is concluded that P. sylvestris forests may provide one of the best regeneration habitats for holly in the Mediterranean area, where this species is close to the Southern limit of its distribution.																	1612-4669					JUL	2006	125	3					271	279		10.1007/s10342-006-0121-y							WOS:000239457800008

Graham (Solanaceae): Population and soil seed bank dynamics, seed germination patterns and seedling response to flood and drought	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Disturbances in plant communities provide opportunities for weed germination, propagation, spread, and invasion. When the population density of a weed increases, fast-tracked and appropriate control management strategies are required. The objectives of this study were to: (i) examine the population and soil seed bank dynamics of Nicotiana glauca; (ii) compare the germination patterns of invasive N. glauca seeds collected from two states in Australia, and (iii) investigate the impact of a flood in September 1997 and subsequent drought on N. glauca seedlings. The density of N. glauca followed a steep positive increment during the sampling time (September 1999 to October 2004). The increment pattern was similar in flooded fenced and unfenced plots. Plant density increased over much of the observation period, but had declined to 80 and 432 stems ha(-1), respectively, by October 2004. Stem density recorded in October 2004 along two transects radiating from the central point of the newly created lake demonstrated that a significant number of stems appeared to be dead. A soil seed bank study revealed that seed density varied significantly (p = 0.0001) between flooded fenced (598.75 +/- 71) and flooded unfenced (327.5 +/- 66) plots. In contrast, no N. glauca seedlings were recruited from-the soil collected from the control plots. Germination trials were undertaken on N. glauca seed collected from New South Wales. There was no significance difference detected between treatments light and temperature. Similarly, no interaction was found between light and temperature. A comparative study on seed germination patterns of N. glauca seeds collected from Ivanhoe, New South Wales, and the Flinders Ranges, South Australia, showed that temperature had a significant effect on N. glauca seed germination. The effect varied significantly with main variables (state, length and time) and also with different interactions, except state x light (P = 0.3840). N. glauca seedlings exposed to flood were found to withstand partial flooding for at least 58 days. Under waterlogged conditions, the seedlings showed stem hypertrophy and produced adventitious roots. Only one seedling was found dead in the drought treatment. In conclusion, it is clear that N. glauca invaded the area after a rare flood event and began to function as a casual weed. Established seedlings in the field can withstand extreme ecological events such as flood and drought. Understanding the plants' ecological characteristics through a study such as this at an early rather than late stage in the invasion will help us to take appropriate control measures for this species.

We tested this assumption with a full factorial experiment that examined the effects of fungivorous Collembola and of seed coating with a fungicide on seed longevity of four grassland plant species. 2 Seeds of Centaurea nigra, Dactylis glomerata, Origanum vulgare and Taraxacum officinale were kept in Petri dishes filled with soil under conditions that stimulate fungal growth but not seed germination. Treatment factors were (i) addition of the collembolan Protaphorura fimata, a soil-dwelling fungus feeder; and (ii) seed treatment with the fungicide chitosan. After 5 weeks, germination was recorded and viability of the remaining ungerminated seeds was determined. 3 In three species, the addition of P. fimata resulted in an increase in the number of remaining ungerminated viable seeds. This was due to reduced seed mortality (C. nigra, O. vulgare) or to reduced germination (D. glomerata). Seeds of T. officinale remained unaffected. 4 For the fungicide treatment, no significant main effect was found in any species, although in two species there was a significant interaction between the addition of Collembola and seed coating with chitosan. There is circumstantial evidence that this interaction may have resulted from a negative effect of chitosan on adult survival of P. fimata. 5 These results show that fungus-feeding soil invertebrates affect not only the performance of live plants, as shown in previous studies, but also the persistence of seeds in the soil, and that this effect varies between different plant species. 6 Our results suggest that by reducing the mortality of seeds due to fungal decay, fungal grazers may influence the dynamics of plant populations and the assembly of plant communities. Further experimentation under more realistic conditions is, however, required to investigate the importance of this process under field conditions.

Seed rain, transient seed banks, and seedling recruitment of annuals on a coastal beach	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Annual plants are important colonizers of the bare sandy areas that typify the pioneer zone of many coastal beaches. The spatial distribution of the potential seed rain in autumn, transient seed bank in early spring, and seedling recruitment in late spring were examined for the summer annuals in a 40 X 45 in section of beach on Staten Island, NY. The relationship of the dominant perennial, Ammophila breriligulata, to recruitment was also explored. Estimated seed rain was very high, showing species-specific distribution patterns along the shore-to-land gradient for Triplasis purpurea, Cenchrus tribuloides, and Heterotheca subaxillaris, the most abundant native annuals. Seed rain and spring recruitment for T purpurea and C tribuloids were greatest in regions of the beach where A. breriligulata was less abundant. Recruitment of T purpurea and C tribidoides, but not H. subaxillaris, was negatively associated with living A. breviligulata. Summed over all annuals, recruitment was 73.6 +/- 5.2 seedlings m(-2) in the absence of litter and 45.8 +/- 4.3 seedlings m(-2) where A. breviligulata litter occurred. Thus, the distribution and abundance of A. breviligulata was inversely related to the seed rain and recruitment of annuals. The weedy annual Allollugo verticillata was most abundant in the transient seed bank (669 +/- 205 seeds m(-2)), but T purpurea was also common (211 +/- 32 seeds m(-2)); mean total density of all species was 1,082 seeds m(-2). For the three natives, only a small proportion (ca. 1-30%) of the seed rain was detected in the transient seed bank. Depletion of seeds over the transition from seed bank to seedling recruitment was 77% for C tributoides, over 90% for T purpurea and H. subaxillaris, and 99% for M. verticillata. Thus, only a very small fraction of the potential seed rain in autumn resulted in successful seedling recruitment the following spring. Despite the massive loss of seeds across seasons, patches of annual species maintain viable populations from year to year and provide vegetation cover on the coastal beach.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL-SEP	2006	133	3					379	392		10.3159/1095-5674(2006)133[379:SRTSBA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000242957400001

The seed bank of hemlock forests: implications for forest regeneration following hemlock decline	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Soil seed banks are especially important for forest regeneration in stands with few understory species and individuals. The understory of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)dominated stands in New England primarily consists of hemlock seedlings and saplings, but all size classes of hemlock are attacked by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Prior to the initiation of a large-scale manipulative experiment designed to examine the impact of the adelgid on hemlock forest ecology, we documented the seed bank composition of eight large (0.81 ha) experimental hemlock-dominated and Young hardwood-dominated plots. The seed bank samples from the hemlock-dominated plots contained significantly fewer species (rarefied species richness 24; 95% confidence interval = 20-28) than those from the hardwood -dominated plots (species richness = 30). Seed banks from all plots were dominated by Betula lenta, Rubus spp., and Carex pensylvanica. Among plots, there was little compositional relationship between the forest overstory and its understory on the one hand, and its seed bank on the other hand. Because seeds of' herrilock and birch persist for only a few years in the seed bank, and because hemlock seedlings are readily attacked and killed by the adelgid, damaged hemlock stands are more likely to be replaced by stands of black birch and other hardwoods than by hemlock.

J	Donahue, C; Rogers, WE; Siemann, E				Donahue, Candice; Rogers, William E.; Siemann, Evan			Restoring an invaded prairie by mulching live Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow trees): Effects of mulch on sapium seed germination	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												The introduced Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) has spread across the southeastern United States and is rapidly replacing native prairies with monospecific Sapium forests. Most attempts to control Sapium are only temporarily effective because of its large seed bank and ability to resprout from cut stumps. We performed a two-year field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of using large shredding mowers to mulch live Sapium trees and restore Sapium-invaded prairies. We predicted that Sapium mulch would damp diurnal soil temperature fluctuations and suppress Sapium seed germination because Sapium seed germination is highly dependent upon those fluctuations. We manipulated mulch depths and types (0, 10, and 15 cm deep Sapium mulch and hardwood and straw mulch) in the field and measured soil temperatures beneath them. Diurnal soil temperature fluctuations were damped at depths as little as 5 cm, and Sapium mulch significantly reduced Sapium seedling emergence. Deep layers of Sapium mulch (15 cm) reduced seedling survival and native vegetation cover as well. Comparisons among Sapium mulch and alternative mulch materials revealed no allelopathic effects of Sapium mulch on Sapium seedling emergence, survival, or growth. Vigorous regrowth of native vegetation through 5 cm of Sapium mulch was evident by the end of the first growing season. With no trees or stumps remaining on the site, a mowing regime can be implemented immediately regardless of the pre-mulching density of the trees. A heavy closed-canopy Sapium forest might result in mulch depths that slow the return of native vegetation and delay accumulation of adequate fuel loads to support prescribed burning.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JUL	2006	26	3					244	253		10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[244:RAIPBM]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000239501000003						
J	Coffey, KL; Kirkman, LK				Coffey, Kim L.; Kirkman, L. Katherine			Seed germination strategies of species with restoration potential in a fire-maintained pine savanna	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Seed germination phenology studies are important tools for determining whether seeds exhibit dormancy and what environmental conditions trigger germination. Within longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller) ecosystems of the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, little is known about dormancy patterns and germination cues of the suite of native species composing the diverse fire-maintained ground cover vegetation. We used two methods to determine if several dominant or functionally important herbaceous species were capable of forming a persistent soil seed bank, including: (1) a germination phenology study and (2) a buried seed bag study. Results indicate that within species studied from three common families (Asteraceae, 2 species; Fabaceae, 8 species; and Poaceae, 3 species), species within the Fabaceae family seem most capable of forming long-term persistent seed banks. Although most of the Poaceae and Asteraceae species examined exhibited little dormancy in the germination phenology study, evidence from the buried seed bag study indicates that several species may form transient or even short-term persistent seed banks under favorable conditions. The absence of evidence of persistent seed banking potential for several dominant species examined in this study suggests that seed reintroduction will likely be a necessary component in restoration efforts in longleaf pine ecosystems.																	0885-8608					JUL	2006	26	3					289	299		10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[289:SGSOSW]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000239501000009

Soil microbial community composition as affected by restoration practices in California grassland	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Agricultural practices have strong impacts on soil microbes including both the indices related to biomass and activity as well as those related to community composition. In a grassland restoration project in California, where native perennial bunchgrasses were introduced into non-native annual grassland after a period of intensive tillage, weeding, and herbicide use to reduce the annual seed bank, microbial community composition was investigated. Three treatments were compared: annual grassland, bare soil fallow, and restored perennial grassland. Soil profiles down to 80 cm in depth were investigated in four separate layers (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-80 cm) using both phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid (PLFAs) and ergosterol as biomarkers in addition to microbial biomass C by fumigation extraction. PLFA fingerprinting showed much stronger differences between the tilled bare fallow treatment vs. grasslands, compared to fewer differences between restored perennial grassland and annual grassland. The presence or absence of plants over several years clearly distinguished microbial communities. Microbial communities in lower soil layers were little affected by management practices. Regardless of treatment, soil depth caused a strong gradient of changing habitat conditions, which was reflected in Canonical Correspondence Analysis of PLFAs. Fungal organisms were associated with the presence of plants and/or litter since the total amount and the relative proportion of fungal markers were reduced in the tilled bare fallow and in lower layers of the grassland treatments. Total PLFA and soil microbial biomass were highly correlated, and fungal PLFA biomarkers showed strong correlations to ergosterol content. In conclusion, microbial communities are resilient to the grassland restoration process, but do not reflect the change in plant species composition that occurred after planting native bunchgrasses.

Experiments were conducted in South Australia at two locations (Roseworthy Campus and Minlaton, a site on the Yorke Peninsula) in 2003 and 2005. The distribution of surface seeds through the soil profile was associated with the level of soil disturbance. The low-soil-disturbance tillage systems left more seed on the soil surface, whereas the high-soil-disturbance systems buried most of the seeds. The seedling recruitment of rigid ryegrass was lower under the low-soil-disturbance tillage systems than under the high-soil-disturbance tillage systems at both locations. The seedling recruitment was two- to fourfold greater under minimum tillage than under no-till. Not only was the seedling recruitment lower under the low-soil-disturbance tillage systems, biomass accumulation by rigid ryegrass seedlings was also lower under these systems. The carryover of residual viable seeds from one season to the next was similar between the tillage systems. However, seed decay under no-till (48 to 60%) was much greater than under minimum tillage (12 to 39%).

In this paper, we examine temporal change in open formations in the natural reserve of Poggio all'Olmo (central Italy). This area has undergone rural depopulation and the cessation of traditional methods of agriculture, resulting in the subsequent re-establishment and spread of other vegetation formations. Aerial photographs taken in 1954, 1977 and 1998 were orthorectified and classified based on the physiognomic characteristics of the vegetation. An objective definition of the minimum mapping unit (MMU) was guaranteed by using vector formal grids for this classification. We applied landscape pattern metrics based on landscape composition, the shape and size of patches and patch isolation. Our results demonstrate the key roles of shrubland, woodland and coniferous plantations in the ongoing fragmentation of open formations in the landscape. Multi-temporal landscape analyses, and, in particular, a restricted suite of landscape metrics, proved useful for detecting and quantitatively characterizing dynamic ecological processes. We conclude with some recommendations on the management alternatives feasible for the protection of the remaining grassland formations in the natural reserve of Poggio all'Olmo.

Especially rare plant species are inherently difficult to detect. In our study we validated the accuracy of a sampling method which is based on a high number of individual sample units (100 soil cores/plot, altogether 12 plots) gathered by means of a random-systematic sampling design. We used this method in the course of a case study on successional stages of endangered inland sand vegetation in two areas of Germany. We analysed seed bank composition, proportion of endangered species, similarity between seed bank and aboveground vegetation and grazing impact. (1) Methodological approach. The method produced results with high representativeness. On average, about 78% (topsoil: 1-6 cm depth) and 72% (subsoil: 11-16 cm) of the species (jackknife estimator) were detected. The mean SORENSEN distance between l9 and 10 composite samples (each consisting of 10 soil cores) was low (< 0.05 topsoil, < 0.1 subsoil). Ordination of the topsoil samples revealed a high degree of homogeneity of the composite samples. (2) Case study. The soil seed banks of mid-successional stages (Diantho-Armerietum, Armerio-Festucetum) were significantly richer in species and diaspores than the associated pioneer stages (Spergulo-Corynephoretum, Koelerion glaucae). The seed banks of the base-rich successional series were significantly richer in plant species (parallel to aboveground vegetation) as well as in diaspores than the seed banks of the acidic series. Diaspores of many pioneer species were found in very low densities (e. g. Corynephorus canescens) in the soils of mid-successional stages or were not found in these stages (e.g. Phleum arenarium). Therophytes with higher ability to colonise gaps in mid-successional stages accumulated seed banks, albeit mostly in low densities. Among them were two Red List species (Medicago minima, Vicia lathyroides). With some exceptions (e.g. Vicia lathyroides) diaspores of Red List species were found in low abundances in the seed banks (< 50 diaspores m(-2) in topsoil as well as in subsoil). Among the Red List species detected in the aboveground vegetation one of four species (25%, acidic series) or seven of 12 species (58%, basic series) were detected in the seed banks. A two-year period of extensive sheep grazing did not alter seed banks of Koelerion glaucae and Armerio-Festucetum stands.

However, it preserved some areas from the general eutrophication due to agriculture intensification. We investigated the reconstituting vegetation on clearcuts of 25 to 50 year old plantations. Vegetation composition is widely in accordance with past extensive land use before Norway spruce plantation and characteristic species are generally well represented. Best-conserved habitats are Calluna heathlands and acidic mires. We also examined the persistent soil seed bank in three standing plantations. Species present in these seed banks are nearly the same as those found in situ in clearcuts. So the potential of these new environments is high in terms of nature restoration and conservation.																	1253-8078	2166-3408				JUN	2006	153	2					201	218		10.1080/12538078.2006.10515537							WOS:000239364900005						
J	Karlowski, U				Karlowski, U			Afromontane old-field vegetation: secondary succession and the return of indigenous species	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												South-west Uganda primarily holds afromontane forests within three protected areas: Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Echuya Forest Reserve and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. All forests contain portions of old-field vegetation. The central question of this study, then, is whether and how natural regeneration of afromontane vegetation would take place. A successional pathway consisting of nine plant communities was found for the first 2 years after cessation of agricultural use. A return of afromontane species despite of an initial dominance of neophytes, a diversification of life form spectra and a growing importance of endozoochory with time belonged to the conspicuous characteristics of this secondary succession. To obtain an insight into the role of birds and buffaloes as possible vectors for seed input, I examined their faeces with regard to germinable seeds. Both, bird faeces, as well as buffalo faeces contained germinable seeds originating from the forest flora. Thus, animal dispersal from the forest into the regenerating zones could be documented. The regeneration potential of the soil-seed bank seems to be limited in its time scale, and only an initial regeneration capacity could be found. A further progressive succession into a secondary afromontane forest depends on an input of diaspores from undisturbed forest sites. Zoochory appears to be one of the most important dispersal mechanisms.																	0141-6707					JUN	2006	44	2					264	272		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00647.x							WOS:000237691500017						
J	Meyer, SE; Quinney, D; Weaver, J				Meyer, SE; Quinney, D; Weaver, J			A stochastic population model for Lepidium papilaferum (Brassicaceae), a rare desert ephemeral with a persistent seed bank	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Population viability analysis (PVA) is a valuable tool for rare plant conservation, but PVA for plants with persistent seed banks is difficult without reliable information on seed bank processes. We modeled the population dynamics of the Snake River Plains ephemeral Lepidium papilliferum using data from an 11-yr artificial seed bank experiment to estimate age-specific vital rates for viability loss and germination. We related variation in postgermination demographic parameters to annual variation in precipitation patterns and used these relationships to construct a stochastic population model using precipitation driver variables. This enabled us to incorporate realistic levels of environmental variability into the model. A model incorporating best estimates for parameter values resulted in a mean trajectory for seed bank size that remained essentially stable through time, although there was a measurable risk of extinction over a 100-yr period for the study population under this scenario. Doubling the annual seed viability loss rate resulted in near-certain extinction, as did increasing first-year germination to 100%, showing the importance of the persistent seed bank. Interestingly, increasing environmental variance substantially decreased the risk of extinction, presumably because this plant relies on extremely good years to restock the persistent seed bank, while extremely bad years have little impact. If every year were average in this desert environment, the species could not persist. Simulated effects of livestock trampling resulted in greatly increased extinction risk, even over time frames as short as 15 years.																	0002-9122					JUN	2006	93	6					891	902		10.3732/ajb.93.6.891							WOS:000237941600011	21642152

Intensive grazing by Barnacle geese depletes High Arctic seed bank	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Studies in the Canadian Arctic show dramatic effects of increased goose grazing on vegetation structure and soil conditions, but little is known of the role of goose grazing in the European Arctic. We focused on how geese might affect plant recruitment via effects on seed production and soil seed bank in High Arctic Svalbard. Experimental grazing by captive Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis (Bechstein, 1803)) decreased flower densities both at normal and at high grazing pressure. Geese showed a clear preference for reproductive rather than vegetative shoots. Soil samples collected inside and outside 7-year-old exclosures in an intensively goose-grazed area revealed significant effects on the germinable soil seed bank. The density of viable seeds in the top soil layer inside exclosures was six times higher than in grazed plots. Lower densities of viable seeds occurred in the basal than in the top layer but there was no difference in basal layer seed density between exclosed and grazed plots. This study shows that geese have strong effects on floral abundance and consequently on the seed bank. We argue that goose grazing in these systems influences the potential for recovery after a disturbance event and thus the long-term plant species diversity and dynamics.

Whole-lake effects of invasive crayfish (Orconectes spp.) and the potential for restoration	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Effects of invasive species are often extrapolated to whole systems based on small-scale, short-term, and (or) single-system studies. For example, previous laboratory studies and in-lake cage experiments suggest that invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus reduce macrophyte and snail abundance in north temperate lakes, and snapshot lake surveys provide supporting evidence. Still, these impacts have not been demonstrated in multiple whole lakes over time. Thus, in summer of 2003, we resurveyed benthic invertebrates and macrophytes in lakes originally surveyed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the late 1930s. Our multilake survey supports the macrophyte results from small-scale and comparative studies: macrophyte species richness and abundance declined significantly in invaded lakes relative to uninvaded lakes. We next conducted a laboratory seed-bank study to examine the potential for macrophyte restoration in a lake occupied by rusty crayfish for at least 15 years. Only two macrophyte species (Najas flexilis and Chara spp.) germinated from sediments from the invaded lake compared with eight species from reference sediments. This suggests that invaded lakes may have depauperate seed banks and that restoration of invaded macrophyte communities may require manual planting, even if crayfish could be removed.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2006	63	6					1276	1285		10.1139/F06-037							WOS:000238285700008

Also important is the ability to experience those claims directly. Attention must thus be paid to creating spaces that are not only deliberative but also tactile, so individuals can experience for themselves the phenomena around which knowledge claims are being made. This becomes particularly important in environmental conflicts, given that they often involve objects/processes that are epistemologically removed from our lived worlds. To inform this argument, the case of a non-profit seed bank, where just such a tactile space has been created, is examined.																	0964-4016					JUN	2006	15	3					345	361		10.1080/09644010600627535							WOS:000237242000001

The cropping systems were a conventional spring wheat-soybean rotation, a no-till spring wheat-soybean rotation, and a mulch-till system with a spring wheat-yellow sweetclover-winter-annual rye-soybean rotation. Emerged weeds were sampled three times each year in wheat and soybean at pre-plant, before post-emergence herbicide treatment, and post-harvest. Soil seed banks were deter-mined at initiation and termination of the experiment. Thirty-nine weed species were identified during the experiment and annual broadleaf weeds were most prevalent. Canada thistle, common lambsquafters, dandelion, green and yellow foxtail, kochia, redroot pigweed, wild buckwheat, and wild mustard were dominant weeds in each cropping system over the 8-year experiment. Between 1994 and 2001, total weed density decreased in the mulch-till system based on weeds sampled in wheat (r = -0.93) and soybean (r = -0.68), primarily due to a decrease in annual broadleaf weeds. Total density of weeds sampled in wheat increased in the no-till system (r = 0.63), primarily due to an increase in common lambsquarters. The mulch-till system in combination with reduced amounts of herbicide, which were used to control Canada thistle, kept weed densities similar to conventional and no-tillage systems. Final soil seed batik densities were lower in the conventional system than either the no-till or mulch-till systems. Common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed seed banks were greater in no-till than the conventional or mulch-till systems in 2001, whereas green and yellow foxtail seed banks were greatest in the mulch-till system. In 2001, no-till and conventional system soil seed banks consisted of about 87% broadleaf and 13% grass species, whereas the mulch-till system soil seed bank consisted of 68% broadleaf and 32% grass species.

J	Hilgartner, WB; Brush, GS				Hilgartner, WB; Brush, GS			Prehistoric habitat stability and post-settlement habitat change in a Chesapeake Bay freshwater tidal wetland, USA	HOLOCENE												Analyses of fossil seeds and pollen grains preserved in seven sediment cores and borings were combined with historical land-use records to reconstruct an 1800-yr history of Otter Point Creek (OPC), a freshwater tidal deltaic wetland in the upper Chesapeake Bay. The objectives of the study were to document the role of natural and anthropogenic disturbance on habitat development at different sites within the wetland. Fossil seeds revealed a 1500-yr period ( AD 230 to 1700) of subtidal habitat stability characterized by the aquatic macrophytes Zannichellia palustris, Najas gracillima, N. guadalupensis, Elodea canadensis and Vallisneria americana. Natural disturbance had little or no impact on the estuarine habitat during this time. By the early 1700s, forest clearance for agriculture and lumber during European settlement led to higher erosion rates in the watershed. This led to rapid sediment efflux and broad habitat changes along a hydrologic gradient within the estuary. The aquatic macrophytes disappeared when estuarine sedimentation rates increased from a pre- 1700 mean of 0.05 cm/ yr to 0.60 cm/ yr after 1730 - 1750. As the estuary continued to fill behind a prograding delta from AD 1750 to 1950, sub-tidal species were replaced sequentially by increasingly less flood-tolerant dominants of low marsh (Zizania aquatica), middle marsh (Typha angustifolia or Leersia oryzoides), high marsh (Acorus calamus), shrub marsh (Typha latifolia and Salix nigra) and riparian forest (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Betula nigra). Habitat change progressed in pulses followed by periods of habitat stasis. The most rapid and extensive period of change occurred between 1840 and 1880, synchronous with the period of highest sedimentation rates, mid-century storms and intensive land use in the watershed. The rate and pattern of community change differed among sites where position relative to the watershed, local disturbance, and channel shifts at or adjacent to the site influenced different community pathways. A conceptual model is proposed to describe the spatial and temporal development of eastern US freshwater tidal wetland habitats, reflecting the importance of the impact of colonial deforestation.

Seed bank composition of open and overgrown calcareous grassland soils - a case study from Southern Belgium	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The success of calcareous grassland recreation following abandonment depends to a large extent on the composition of the soil seed bank. We studied the species richness and composition of the seed bank along a chronosequence from well-developed calcareous grassland to scrub and forest vegetation, which had developed on calcareous grassland over the last 225 years. The seed bank density was highest in the calcareous grassland soils (930 seeds/m(2)). However, the seed bank was mainly composed of rather common species of nutrient poor grassland, which were poorly represented in the surface vegetation. There were no significant differences in soil seed bank density and species composition between the calcareous grassland and scrub vegetation that was less than 15 years old, largely because several grassland species had persisted in the scrub vegetation and were therefore able to replenish the soil seed bank. In contrast seed density and species richness declined significantly after 40 years of grassland abandonment. Indeed, forest soils had the lowest seed densities (214 seeds/m(2)) with only a few grassland species represented. This reflects the lack of grassland species in the field layer of the forest, and, therefore, the lack of seed production and seed bank replenishment. It is clear that recreation of calcareous grassland on long abandoned sites cannot rely on germination of target species from the seed bank alone. Even in the calcareous grassland soil, seeds of target species are not abundant as the majority produces transient seeds, which decay rapidly if they do not germinate immediately. Successful grassland recreation on such sites therefore may require seeds of target species to be introduced artificially (e.g. as seed mixtures, green hay, etc.). Alternatively, reinstatement of traditional practices, such as grazing or mowing, will increase the natural dispersal potential of these species, allowing population reestablishment in the long term.
