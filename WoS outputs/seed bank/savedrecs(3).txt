Assessing wetland mitigation efforts using standing vegetation and seed bank community structure in neighboring natural and compensatory wetlands in north-central Texas	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												It is often presumed plant recruitment from the soil seed bank and nearby wetlands will be sufficient to establish a wetland plant community following the restoration or creation of wetland hydrology. This approach to wetland restoration was examined in four compensatory wetlands and a natural oxbow wetland (Oxbow) in a floodplain of the West Fork Trinity River in north-central Texas. We assessed: (1) similarities in vegetation and seed bank composition among natural and compensatory wetlands, (2) within site similarity of vegetation relative to its seed bank community, and (3) the effects of hydrology (Wet vs. Drained soil) on the germination of seeds from the seed bank. Species richness of the standing vegetation was variable across sites and years, however when pooled across years (2008-2009) vegetation and seed banks showed similar species richness (66 vs. 70 species). Fewer wetland species (i.e., species occurring in wetlands > 50 % of the time) were observed in the vegetation relative to the seed bank (25 vs. 41 species), and seed banks of compensatory wetlands were more similar to the natural wetland than was the standing vegetation. In the seed bank study, location (i.e., site) significantly affected total species richness, wetland species richness, diversity, and germinated seeds m(-2), however no significant effect of hydrology was detected. These results suggest hydrology alone is not sufficient to establish a desired wetland plant community in a created wetland and the inclusion of seed bank surveys with field vegetation surveys provides a more complete assessment of wetland creation and restoration.

We determined whether medieval artificial habitats have left a long-lasting imprint in the current forest vegetation. We compared soil chemical properties, canopy conditions, actual vegetation, and soil seed bank patterns between 19 former feudal mottes and 19 paired control sites located in the same forest patches. Soil from the mottes contained more stones, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and their pH was higher than for controls. Species richness and diversity of either vegetation or seed bank did not differ between mottes and controls, but species composition did, with more calciphilous and eutrophic species on the mottes. Mottes also hosted more competitive and competitive-ruderal species and more epizoochores. Centuries after their reclamation, medieval artificial habitats still generate particular soil conditions that are reflected by an original floristic composition compared to the same-aged surrounding understories of the lowland forests in which they occur. These long-lasting after-effects are better explained by the locally increased soil fertility than by dispersal limitation of forest species.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				APR	2015	18	3					507	519		10.1007/s10021-015-9843-3							WOS:000351605400012

Microscopic examination and viral infectious efficacy were used to measure the infectious titers of the Ad-HPV16E6E7 MSB and WSB. Polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the stability of the Ad-HPV16E6E7 target gene insertion, while western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to assess the expression levels of the Ad-HPV16E6E7 target protein. A C57BL/6 mouse TC-1 tumor cell growth inhibition model was used to evaluate the biological effect of Ad-HPV16E6E7 administration. The infectious titers of the Ad-HPV16E6E7 MSB and WSB were 6.31x10(9) IU/ml and 3.0x10(9) IU/ml, respectively. In addition, the expression levels of the inserted target genes and target proteins were found to be stable. In the mouse TC-1 tumor inhibition analysis, when the virus titers of the Ad-HPV16E6E7 MSB and WSB were 10(9) IU/ml, the tumor inhibition rate was 100%, which was significantly different when compared with the control group ((MSB)-M-2=20.00 and (WSB)-W-2=20.00; P<0.01). Therefore, the Ad-HPV16E6E7 vaccine seed bank is genetically stable and meets the requirements for vaccine development.																	1792-0981	1792-1015				APR	2015	9	4					1161	1165		10.3892/etm.2015.2268							WOS:000351711600012

For example, significant delays can occur between the human activities permitting the arrival of an invader, the establishment of this new species, and the manifestation of its impacts. In this context, to assess the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, it may become necessary to include a historical perspective. In this study, we reconstructed the history of human activities in a temperate forest now protected as a nature reserve to evaluate the magnitude and duration of the impact of human disturbances (e.g. trails, old quarries), as well as environmental factors, in explaining the probability of occurrence and the intensity of invasion by non-native earthworms and plants. The present-day patterns of distribution and intensity of earthworms and plants were better explained by proximity to the oldest human disturbances (initiated more than a century ago) than by proximity to more recent disturbances or to all disturbances combined. We conclude that understanding present-day patterns of non-native species invasions may often require reconstructing the history of human disturbances that occurred decades or even centuries in the past.

It is therefore necessary to pay the same attention to the biological diversity represented in ex situ conservation facilities as is often paid to protected-area networks. Building the phylogenetic diversity of ex situ collections will strengthen our capacity to respond to biodiversity loss. Since 2000, the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership has banked seed from 14% of the world's plant species. We assessed the taxonomic, geographic, and phylogenetic diversity of the Millennium Seed Bank collection of legumes (Leguminosae). We compared the collection with all known legume genera, their known geographic range (at country and regional levels), and a genus-level phylogeny of the legume family constructed for this study. Over half the phylogenetic diversity of legumes at the genus level was represented in the Millennium Seed Bank. However, pragmatic prioritization of species of economic importance and endangerment has led to the banking of a less-than-optimal phylogenetic diversity and prioritization of range-restricted species risks an underdispersed collection. The current state of the phylogenetic diversity of legumes in the Millennium Seed Bank could be substantially improved through the strategic banking of relatively few additional taxa. Our method draws on tools that are widely applied to in situ conservation planning, and it can be used to evaluate and improve the phylogenetic diversity of ex situ collections.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				APR	2015	29	2					370	381		10.1111/cobi.12390							WOS:000351353400008	25196170

Minimum sampling intensity required to capture extant genetic diversity in ex situ seed collections: examples from the endangered plant Sibara filifolia (Brassicaceae)	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Sibara filifolia (Brassicaceae), Santa Cruz Island Rock Cress, an endangered annual plant endemic to the California Channel Islands which was presumed extinct for nearly 50 years, is currently known from only a few small patches on San Clemente Island (SCl) and Santa Catalina Island (SCa). In addition to protecting extant populations, recovery efforts have included ex situ seed collections to hedge against stochastic population losses. We examined genetic diversity and population structure in the wild and the effect of sampling intensity on the genetic diversity of ex situ seed collections using 13 species-specific microsatellite loci. Much of the genetic variation on each island consisted of rare alleles; 33 % (SCl) or 56 % (SCa) of the non-fixed alleles occurred at frequencies a parts per thousand currency sign0.05. Patches on SCl were genetically depauperate (mean H-O = 0.002) compared to patches on SCa (mean H-O = 0.344). One patch on SCl was genetically distinct, while the remaining four patches were genetically indistinguishable. The three patches on SCa were genetically distinct from those on SCl, but not from one another. Simulated sampling for the ex situ seed collections found that 10 individuals was sufficient to capture 90 % of the diversity for normalized measures (N-E, H-O, and H-E) in a depauperate (SCl) population, while 30 individuals was necessary in a diverse (SCa) population. However, sampling 125 (SCl) or 60 (SCa) individuals was necessary to capture 90 % of all the alleles present. These findings indicate that theoretical guidelines for ex situ seed collections that recommend targeting 50 individuals per population overestimate the sampling effort required to adequately preserve common alleles, but may underestimate the effort necessary to capture most alleles in wild populations.

J	Kannan, C; Aditi, P; Zwanenburg, B				Kannan, Chinnaswamy; Aditi, Pathak; Zwanenburg, Binne			Quenching the action of germination stimulants using borax and thiourea, a new method for controlling parasitic weeds: A proof of concept	CROP PROTECTION												Broomrapes (Orobanche and Phelipanche spp) and witchweeds (Striga spp) are the two most devastating parasitic weeds causing enormous losses in agriculture. They have a strong dependence on germination stimulants that are released by the host plants. Knowledge of the structure and bioactivity of these stimulants play an essential role in designing control methods for these weeds. The seeds of the parasites are very minute in size and remain viable in the soil for up to 20 years. Reduction of the weed seed bank has been suggested as an attractive option. Suicidal germination is achieved by applying the germination stimulants to the soil prior to planting crop seedlings or sowing crop seeds, Orobanche seeds germinate in absence of the host and as a consequence the germinated seeds die due to lack of nutrients from the host plants. This approach requires a very strict protocol and hence difficult to perform at field levels. Recently, we proposed a novel concept for weed control by decomposing the germination stimulants in soil prior to action. In this paper, this concept is further substantiated by two crucial experiments, namely a study of the phototoxic effect of the reagents used and a demonstration the actual quenching of the germination of seeds of parasitic weeds by applying borax and/or thiourea. The results demonstrate that timely decomposition of stimulation is indeed a feasible method for weed control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Seed dormancy and persistent sediment seed banks of ephemeral freshwater rock pools in the Australian monsoon tropics	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Rock pools are small, geologically stable freshwater ecosystems that are both hydrologically and biologically isolated. They harbour high levels of plant endemism and experience environmental unpredictability driven by the presence of water over variable temporal scales. This study examined the hypothesis that the sediment seed bank in monsoon tropical freshwater rock pools would persist through one or more periods of desiccation, with seed dormancy regulating germination timing in response to rock pool inundation and drying events. Methods Seeds were collected from seven dominant rock pool species, and germination biology and seed dormancy were assessed under laboratory conditions in response to light, temperature and germination stimulators (gibberellic acid, karrikinolide and ethylene). Field surveys of seedling emergence from freshwater rock pools in the Kimberley region of Western Australia were undertaken, and sediment samples were collected from 41 vegetated rock pools. Seedling emergence and seed bank persistence in response to multiple wetting and drying cycles were determined. Key Results The sediment seed bank of individual rock pools was large (13 824 +/- 307 to 218 320 +/- 42 412 seeds m(-2) for the five species investigated) and spatially variable. Seedling density for these same species in the field ranged from 13 696 to 87 232 seedlings m(-2). Seeds of rock pool taxa were physiologically dormant, with germination promoted by after-ripening and exposure to ethylene or karrikinolide. Patterns of seedling emergence varied between species and were finely tuned to seasonal temperature and moisture conditions, with the proportions of emergent seedlings differing between species through multiple inundation events. A viable seed bank persisted after ten consecutive laboratory inundation events, and seeds retained viability in dry sediments for at least 3 years. Conclusions The persistent seed bank in freshwater rock pools is likely to provide resilience to plant communities against environmental stochasticity. Since rock pool communities are often comprised of highly specialized endemic and range-restricted species, sediment seed banks may represent significant drivers of species persistence and diversification in these ecosystems.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Cross, Adam/S-2710-2019; Merritt, David/G-9376-2011; Renton, Michael/A-9979-2011	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; Merritt, David/0000-0002-3250-6861; Renton, Michael/0000-0003-1316-0145												0305-7364	1095-8290				APR	2015	115	5					847	859		10.1093/aob/mcv014							WOS:000354067300011	25660345

Information on the abundance of adults, seedlings, soil seed banks, seed rains, and the seed mass of 96 species was collected in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (China), which had different levels of grazing disturbance. The relationships between seed-mass-abundance patterns for adults, seedlings, the soil seed bank, and seed rain in the plant community were evaluated using regression models. Results showed that grazing levels affected the relationship between seed size and abundance properties of adult species, seedlings, and the soil seed bank, suggesting that there is a shift in seed-size-species-abundance relationships as a response to the grazing gradient. Grazing had no effect on the pattern of seed-size-seed-rain-abundance at four grazing levels. Grazing also had little effect on the pattern of seed-size-species-abundance and pattern of seed-size-soil-seed-bank-abundance in meadows with no grazing, light grazing, and moderate grazing), but there was a significant negative effect in meadows with heavy grazing. Grazing had little effect on the pattern of seed-size-seedling-abundance with no grazing, but had significant negative effects with light, moderate, and heavy grazing, and the vertical bar r vertical bar values increased with grazing levels. This indicated that increasing grazing pressure enhanced the advantage of smaller-seeded species in terms of the abundances of adult species, seedlings, and soil seed banks, whereas only the light grazing level promoted the seed rain abundance of larger-seeded species in the plant communities. This study suggests that grazing disturbances are favorable for increasing the species abundance for smaller-seeded species but not for the larger-seeded species in an alpine meadow community. Hence, there is a clear advantage of the smaller-seeded species over the larger-seeded species with increases in the grazing level.

J	Wang, GD; Wang, M; Lu, XG; Jiang, M				Wang, Guo-dong; Wang, Ming; Lu, Xian-guo; Jiang, Ming			Effects of farming on the soil seed banks and wetland restoration potential in Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Seed bank is an important source of regenerative material in wetlands, and can be of value in the restoration of farmed wetlands if the seeds can survive periods of cultivation. A seed bank assay of soils from sedge meadows was conducted to determine the extent to which seeds are maintained during farming for various lengths of time. Soils from natural sedge meadows, soybean fields and paddy fields farmed for 1-30 years were collected in Sanjiang Plain, northeastern China. Soils were placed in a glasshouse setting in freely drained condition. We found that species richness and seed density in sedge meadows were higher than in soybean and paddy fields. There were significantly negative effects of the length of time of farming on the seed bank in soybean fields. Important wetland species survived cultivation as seeds within 10 years (e.g., Calamagrostis angustifolia and Polygonum amphibium), but most sedge meadow species disappeared when farmed for more than 10 years in soybean fields. Species richness and seed densities of species kept in a very low level in paddy fields farmed for various periods. Key structural dominants Carex species maintained with low seeds in natural wetlands and soybean fields farmed for 1-5 years, and tussock-forming Carex (e.g., Carex appendiculata and Carex meyeriana) were all absent in farmed fields. The structure of the seed bank was related to environmental factors including latitude, number of years farmed and field water depth as based on Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis. Critical components of the vegetation are not maintained in seed banks, which may make these floodplain wetlands difficult to restore via natural recolonization. To reestablish the structure imposed by tussock sedges, specific technologies (e.g., planting, hydrochory) might be developed to encourage the development of tussocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The application of NGS (next-generation sequencing technologies) for 16S analysis has been broadly used for understanding bacterioplankton composition and structure. Most of studies conducted on aquatic ecosystems with 16S NGS have been in seawater and lakes. A few studies using NGS have been conducted in river environments and have suggested the presence of a bacterial seed-bank. We performed 16S highly variable V4 region high-throughput analysis in the Sinos River, which is located in one of most important Brazilian industrial centers. This region has several contrasts in its environmental characteristics, presenting a longitudinal gradient of eutrophication and making it a remarkable study site for observing the dynamics of bacterioplankton. We demonstrated consistent evidence for the existence of a bacterial seed-bank and its longitudinal persistence. Seasonal shifts reinforce the importance of the source of the river in maintaining the bacterial seed-bank that spreads throughout the river. Therefore, the preservation of the source of the river is important not only for hydrologic reasons but also to maintain the microbial composition and the ecological integrity of the river.				de Oliveira, Luiz Felipe Valter/C-6850-2008; Margis, Rogerio/A-7230-2008	de Oliveira, Luiz Felipe Valter/0000-0003-4535-0621; Margis, Rogerio/0000-0002-2871-4473												1932-6203					MAR 24	2015	10	3							e0120608	10.1371/journal.pone.0120608							WOS:000353889600085	25803426

We studied changes in the spatial patterns of Caragana stenophylla along a climatic drought gradient within the Inner Mongolian Plateau, China. We examined spatial patterns, seed density, "nurse effects" of shrubs on seedlings, transpiration rates and water use efficiency (WUE) of C. stenophylla across semi-arid, arid, and intensively arid zones. Our results showed that patches of C. stenophylla populations shifted from a random to a clumped spatial pattern towards drier environments. Seed density and seedling survival rate of C. stenophylla decreased from the semi-arid zone to the intensively arid zone. Across the three zones, there were more C. stenophylla seeds and seedlings underneath shrub canopies than outside shrub canopies; and in the intensively arid zone, there were almost no seeds or seedlings outside shrub canopies. Transpiration rates of outer-canopy leaves and WUE of both outer-canopy and inner-canopy leaves increased from the semi-arid zone to the intensively arid zone. In the intensively arid zone, transpiration rates and WUE of inner-canopy leaves were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than those of outer-canopy leaves. We conclude that, as drought stress increased, seed density decreased, seed proportions inside shrubs increased, and "nurse effects" of shrubs on seedlings became more important. These factors, combined with water-saving characteristics associated with clumped spatial patterns, are likely driving the changes in C. stenophylla spatial patterns.																	1932-6203					MAR 18	2015	10	3							e0121234	10.1371/journal.pone.0121234							WOS:000352138500205	25785848

Empirically validating a dense woody regrowth 'problem' and thinning 'solution' for understory vegetation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In landscapes with a short history of intensive land use, woody plant regrowth on cleared land is often favorably received as a shift back to a more natural state. However, it is common for these regrowth stands to be much denser than undisturbed forest. High stem density can adversely affect stand structure, understory composition, and habitat for dependent fauna. Thinning to reduce stem density is one common silvicultural method used to manage dense stands for ecological or restoration objectives. The effect of thinning on the stand structure is well understood but those on the understory vegetation are not. We address this knowledge gap in anticipation of an increasing call for public investment in 'ecological' thinning across public and private land. Our case study is from the eucalypt woodlands and forests of central Victoria, Australia, an ecosystem in which dense woody regrowth is common. From a broad survey of 98 sites, spanning a range of stem densities, we explored the effect of density on understory vegetation. High densities of small trees (<20 cm DBH) caused the greatest suppression of native and exotic cover and species richness. We compared our observations with benchmarks and found that sites with stem densities exceeding their benchmark had median values approximately one-seventh of the benchmark native understory cover, which was also less than a quarter of the cover of those sites with benchmark or lower stem density. We conducted an additional targeted survey of 11 thinned sites paired with non-thinned sites to evaluate the effects of thinning. We built models combining broad and targeted survey data relating understory response to stem density, thinning, land tenure and environmental covariates. These models predicted that thinning is likely to elicit positive responses from the understory plant community in the short term. This is the desired response from native species, but we caution that thinning can equally favor exotic plant species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M.; Loureiro, Susana			Simulated post-fire temperature affects germination of native and invasive grasses in cerrado (Brazilian savanna)	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Although fire is an important factor in determining cerrado vegetation, information about its effect on seed banks is sparse. Cerrado fires are rapidly moving surface fires with low residence time, producing only short-term heating of the uppermost centimetres of the soil. However, the reduction in vegetation cover and deposition of ashes increases the daily amplitude of soil temperature by as much as 35 degrees C. Aims: To assess the effect of post-fire daily soil temperatures on the germination of one alien and nine native grasses. Methods: Seeds were stored at alternating temperatures of 45 oC/10 oC (10h/14h) for 7d or 30d, simulating two different storage times in the soil seed bank before the onset of the rainy season. Germination was monitored over 30d. Results: The variation in temperature had a significant effect on the rate of seed germination in some species, either enhancing it (Aristida setifolia) or reducing it (Schizachyrium sanguineum). Increased storage time reduced the viability of S. sanguineum and Echinolaena inflexa. The invasive Melinis minutiflora had the highest germination rate and it also showed the best toleration of post-fire conditions (45 oC/10 oC) after 7d, with significant reduction in the germination time after 30d. Conclusions: Fire seems to have a significant effect in the early life of cerrado grasses. Some native species responded positively to temperature oscillation, suggesting that they should be better prepared to compete with alien species after a fire, with more of their seeds germinating and/or at a more rapid rate.

In this study, we began by manipulating an abiotic filter, summer water availability, on the theory that irrigation prior to the growing season could trigger the germination of exotic species during unfavorable environmental conditions. First, we performed a greenhouse experiment to assess the germination traits of 23 native and exotic species at low (16 degrees C, spring) and high (30 degrees C, summer) temperatures. At summer temperatures, we found high emergence of many exotic and native grasses and low emergence of native forbs suggesting that summer irrigation may help deplete the exotic seed bank. In a second experiment, we established field plots to test the efficacy of summer irrigation and simultaneously manipulated a biotic and a dispersal filter, subjecting some plots to grazing and/or native seed addition. Summer irrigation and seed addition had no effect on percent cover or species richness while grazing reduced native cover but increased native species richness and soil nitrogen content. Our data suggest that manipulating grazing (a biotic filter) may be more effective than altering abiotic or dispersal filters when restoring invaded serpentine grassland. However, summer irrigation may also be effective, if applied at lower temperatures or for longer periods.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	2015	23	2					122	130		10.1111/rec.12162							WOS:000353962500004

Abundances of Coplanted Native Bunchgrasses and Crested Wheatgrass after 13 Years	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L] Gaertm) has been seeded on more than 5 million hectares in western North America because it establishes more readily than native bunchgrasses. Currently, there is substantial interest in reestablishing native species in sagebrush steppe, but efforts to reintroduce native grasses into crested wheatgrass stands have been largely unsuccessful, and little is known about the long-term dynamics of crested wheatgrass/native species mixes. We examined the abundance of crested wheatgrass and seven native sagebrush steppe bunchgrasses planted concurrently at equal low densities in nongrazed and unburned plots. Thirteen years post establishment, crested wheatgrass was the dominant bunchgrass, with a 10-fold increase in density. Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer), Thurber's needlegrass (Achnatherum thurberianum (Piper) Barkworth), basin wildrye (Leymus cinereus [Scribn. & Merr.] A. Love), and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl) maintained their low planting density, whereas bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. Love), needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comata [Trin. & Rupr.] Barkworth), and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey) densities declined. Our results suggest that densities of native bunchgrasses planted with crested wheatgrass are unlikely to increase and that some species may only persist at low levels. The high recruitment of crested wheatgrass suggests that coplanting of some native bunchgrasses may be a viable way of avoiding crested wheatgrass monocultures when this species is necessary for rehabilitation or restoration.

Evaluation of Seed Persistence in Cow Cockle	CROP SCIENCE												Cow cockle [Vaccaria hispanica (P. Mill.) Rauschert] is an introduced summer annual weed in North America and has been investigated as a potential crop for the Canadian prairies. Seed persistence contributes to volunteers in subsequent crops; therefore, it is undesirable in this prospective crop. To determine whether cow cockle is persistent and forms a seed bank, two comparative experiments (field and laboratory) were conducted from 2008 through 2011. In the field, seedling recruitment and residual seed bank were measured for a cultivated and a weedy cow cockle population under spring and zero-tillage systems. In the lab, seeds of 15 populations were rapidly aged at elevated temperature and relative humidity (45 degrees C and 60% RH). The time taken in aging days for viability to fall to 50% (p(50)) was used to determine relative seed longevity. In the field study, the weedy population had higher seedling emergence and a larger residual seed bank in most locations. Populations did not differ in the size of the seed bank under spring tillage, whereas a larger soil seed bank of weedy population was observed in no-till treatments. In the lab, the populations showed considerable differences in seed longevity. Although the cultivated population showed less seed persistence compared to the weedy population, both field and laboratory studies suggested that a considerable amount of seed of the cultivated population persists in the soil even after 3 yr; and this may pose some concerns for the production of cow cockle as a crop in the Canada.																	0011-183X	1435-0653				MAR-APR	2015	55	2					899	909		10.2135/cropsci2014.04.0334							WOS:000352223000043

To assess the effectiveness of T. yunnanensis ex situ conservation in China, the genetic diversity and genetic structure of nine cultivated and 14 natural populations were compared using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The purpose of this comparison was to determine whether the cultivated populations were genetic representatives of natural types. Among the 14 natural populations studied, three were from Tibet and 11 were from the Hengduan Mountains. There were fewer genetic variations among cultivated populations than among natural populations, but this difference was not significant. However, 23 unique alleles were detected in cultivated populations and 14 were detected in natural populations. Striking differences in genetic structure (G(ST) = 0.365) was observed between them. STRUCTURE, AMOVA and cluster analyses also consistently showed a clear genetic separation between the 14 natural and seven cultivated populations. Only five natural populations from the south-central Hengduan Mountains were genetically represented in two cultivated collections. The reason for the occurrence of distinct genetic differences between cultivated and natural populations and the loss of natural population-specific alleles in the cultivated populations can be attributed to uneven selection during establishment. These results suggest that the genetic structure of T. yunnanensis may not have been conserved effectively. Based on our study, practical conservation strategies for ex situ preservation of T. yunnanensis have been developed.

J	Jaganathan, GK; Dalrymple, SE; Liu, BL				Jaganathan, Ganesh K.; Dalrymple, Sarah E.; Liu, Baolin			Towards an Understanding of Factors Controlling Seed Bank Composition and Longevity in the Alpine Environment	BOTANICAL REVIEW												The ability of seeds to regenerate from soil seed banks has long been recognized as a key survival strategy for plants establishing new niches in highly variable climates of alpine environments. However, the fundamental aspects of evolutionary/selective forces for seed bank development in alpine ecosystems are largely unknown. Here, we developed a model that describes dormancy, a high temperature requirement and a specific light/darkness regime at the time of seed shedding can preclude autumn germination, thus contributing to seed persistence until the next growing season. The benefits of these factors synchronising germination with the growing season are reviewed. Additionally, the importance of climatic variations of maternal environment affecting some of these factors is also discussed. It is suggested that the environmental conditions during the growing season partly control the seed persistence and seeds that fail to germinate are carried over to the next season. Species that have small (< 3 mg) and round-shaped seeds tend to persist more easily in soil for over 5 years, than do the large or flat seeds. However, some large-seeded species also have the potential to establish short-term persistence bank. A literature survey reveals 88 % of the alpine seeds have a mass < 3 mg. Seed size has only a weak relationship with mean germination timing (MGT) indicating that reduced persistence in large-seeded species cannot be counteracted by quicker germination, but combined effects of other factors stimulating germination remain an open area to be studied. It is proposed that long distance dispersal (LDD) is limited in most-but not all-species, primarily due to the absence of specialized dispersal structures. However, among numerous dispersal modes, most species tend to be dispersed by wind. Thus, spermatophytes of alpine environments have a greater tendency to establish seed banks and spread the risk of germination to many years, rather than being dispersed to other micro-climates.

Diatoms, particularly pennate diatoms, dominated the phytoplankton community. The dominant species were Grammonema islandica (Grunow in Van Heurck) Hasle, Fragilariopsis cylindrus (Grunow) Krieger, F. oceanica (Cleve) Hasle, Navicula vanhoeffenii Gran, Thalassiosira antarctica Comber, T. gravida Cleve, T. nordenskioeldii Cleve, and T. rotula Meunier. Phytoplankton cell densities varied from 0.08x10(4) to 428.8x10(4) cells/L, with an average of 30.3x10(4) cells/L. Using cluster analysis, phytoplankton were grouped into three assemblages defined by ice-forming conditions: open water, ice edge, and sea ice assemblages. In spring, when the sea ice melts, the phytoplankton dispersed from the sea ice to the ice edge and even into open waters. Thus, these phytoplankton in the sea ice may serve as a "seed bank" for phytoplankton population succession in the subarctic ecosystem. Moreover, historical studies combined with these results suggest that the sizes of diatom species have become smaller, shifting from microplankton to nannoplankton-dominated communities.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				MAR	2015	33	2					458	467		10.1007/s00343-015-3367-8							WOS:000351156800019

Dune crests serve as preferential habitats for perennial plants during frequent drought years	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Following frequent droughts in the last 19 years, high mortality of perennial plants was noted in the Hallamish dune field in the Negev Desert (P = 95 mm). To evaluate the vegetation change, vegetation cover and species composition were studied in 20 plots located at the semi-stable non-crusted dune crest (CR) and 20 plots located at the crusted interdune (ID) during the summer of 2012 and compared to data from 1994. In addition, periodical moisture measurements were carried out in a pair of plots, 50-100 m apart, at CR and ID between October 2009 and September 2012. The findings exhibit a substantial decrease in the living perennials (mainly consisting of shrubs), with ID exhibiting the highest reduction in living shrubs. The findings are in agreement with measurements of the available water content, AWC (i.e., above the wilting point) during 2010-2012. While being recorded at >60 cm at CR, AWC was not recorded at ID at 60-120 cm depth during the summer months. Lower evaporation rates due to higher albedo and especially subsurface flow from the adjacent highly active crest are mainly seen responsible for deeper infiltration and higher AWC at CR. It is concluded that while sufficient AWC was present at CR to sustain most of the perennial shrubs also during frequent drought years, insufficient moisture was retained at ID to sustain most perennials. Non-crusted dune crests may thus serve as preferential habitats (fertility belts) for perennial plants, providing refugia for shrubs during frequent drought years. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lundgren, R; Lazaro, A; Totland, O				Lundgren, Rebekka; Lazaro, Amparo; Totland, Orjan			Effects of experimentally simulated pollinator decline on recruitment in two European herbs	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Pollinator decline causes great concern because reduced pollinator availability may negatively affect plants' seed production and in turn influence seedling recruitment and densities of plant populations. We used a novel experimental approach that simulates pollinator decline to assess the effects of a 4-year reduction in pollinator availability on reproduction and recruitment in two common European herbs, Centaurea jacea and Leucanthemum vulgare. The experiment strongly reduced visitation rates (by 59%) and seed set (by 23%) in Leucanthemum, but this did not cause reduced seedling recruitment, suggesting that other factors, such as water availability or the existence of a seed bank, are important for recruitment in this population of Leucanthemum. The experiment also significantly reduced visitation rates to Centaurea (by 33%), but did not affect seed set or seedling recruitment. In this species, however, seed set increased with visitation rates and local recruitment increased with seed production, indicating that a consistent pollinator decline may negatively affect Centaurea population densities.Synthesis. Our experiment reduced pollinator availability without artificially affecting quality components of the pollination process. Therefore, this approach may represent a realistic simulation of a pollinator decline. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses an experimental reduction in pollinator visitation to assess its effects on population recruitment in plants. This study shows that a large pollinator decline may affect population densities, but only in populations where seedling recruitment is limited by seed production. Our results also highlight the importance of going beyond visitation rates and seed production to study the impact of pollinator decline on plant populations.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				MAR	2015	103	2					328	337		10.1111/1365-2745.12374							WOS:000350549000005						
J	Gooden, B; French, K				Gooden, Ben; French, Kris			Impacts of alien plant invasion on native plant communities are mediated by functional identity of resident species, not resource availability	OIKOS												Alien plant invasion and nutrient enrichment as a result of anthropogenic landscape modification seriously threaten native plant community diversity. It is poorly understood, however, whether these two disturbances interact with the functional identity of recipient native plants to drive community change. We performed a mesocosm experiment to examine whether the interactive effects of invasion by a stoloniferous turf-grass Stenotaphrum secundatum and nutrient enrichment vary across different plant growth forms of an endangered coastal plant community. Communities contained 18 species (drawn without replacement from a pool of 31 species) with either runner, tufted or woody growth forms. Species were well-established and reproductively mature prior to S. secundatum introduction. Species growth (% cover), reproductive output, soil temperature and light availability were monitored for two growing seasons. Invasion and nutrient enrichment (two levels: natural control' and enriched') had no effect on species richness, community composition, reproductive output, soil temperature or light penetration. There was no interactive effect of nutrients and invasion on community productivity (i.e. final biomass), such that invasion caused a reduction in community biomass at both natural and enriched nutrient levels. This was driven only by reduced biomass of functionally-similar native runner species, which share similar root morphologies and nutrient-acquisition strategies with S. secundatum. Our study indicates that impacts of invasion are dependent upon the functional identity of species within recipient communities, not the availability of resources. This shows that management cannot buffer invader effects by manipulating resource availability. Revegetation strategies should target functionally-similar natives for replacement following invader control.

Effects of storage under low temperature, room temperature and in the soil on viability and vigour of Leucospermum cordifolium (Proteaceae) seeds	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed longevity, the control of dormancy and the eventual fate of seeds were studied in two experiments simulating conditions in natural fynbos. In one experiment a batch of mature, freshly harvested, intact achenes ("seeds") of the myrmecochorous species Leucospermum cordifolium was divided into lots, of which one was buried in mesic mountain fynbos (experiencing a mediterranean-type climate with hot summers). Other seed lots were stored open at room temperature and in closed nitrogen filled containers at 3 degrees C, respectively. Stored seeds were sampled and germinated under optimal laboratory (viability estimate) and seed bed (vigour estimate in fynbos) conditions, during autumn, after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 years. Low temperature stored seeds maintained a high viability and vigour for c. two years but ambient temperature storage led to a marked decline after 1 year ending in almost complete mortality after 4 years of shelf storage. Four year soil-stored seeds, by contrast, maintained a high viability and vigour, of 80% and 60% respectively of the original seed source values. The soft pericarp/elaiosome in soil-stored seeds disappeared completely whilst the testa became progressively scarified over time. The strongly increased germination rate (velocity) in soil-stored seeds was attributed to natural oxygenation mediated by testa scarification. In another experiment freshly matured intact achenes were oxygenated with 1% H2O2 and the pericarps removed. Disinfection and benzyladenine growth regulator soaking (200 mg L-1 for 24 h) were applied as separate treatments. The seedswere then sown at 1 cm depth in a standard seed bed in autumn and germination was recorded in the first winter season and, in the undisturbed seed bed, in each subsequent winter for 5 germination seasons. H2O2 oxygenated seeds gave a much higher germination percentage and rate than non-oxygenated seeds, although sporadic germination continued over five germination seasons in all treatments. Seeds germinated only during autumn and early winter each year. The results of the combined experiments suggest that, in nature, Leucospermum seeds can persist underground for long periods. We propose a model of soil-stored seeds in which the intact testa of freshly dispersed seeds is gradually scarified, leading to uneven, extended germination of the young (mainly current season) seed cohort over the first (and possibly several) post-fire germination seasons; and the synchronous germination of the older (scarified), larger, portion of the seed bank, leading to massive species recruitment during the early stages of the first post-fire winter germination season. The numerous wet-dry cycles due to natural rainfall, over prolonged periods in fynbos, may contribute to seed longevity via cellular repair processes. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Seed bank dynamics in relation to disturbance and landscape for an ant-dispersed species	PLANT ECOLOGY												We examined how landscape and disturbance affect the distribution of the seed bank of the ant-dispersed species Capnoides sempervirens. Seed bank samples were collected within mixed hardwood-conifer stands 0-1,269 m from source (aboveground) populations on granite-gneiss outcrops in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, USA. Regression models revealed three variables important in predicting seed bank presence and/or seed abundance: distance from rock outcrops, soil depth, and elevation. Although seeds were found up to 175 m from potential source plants, seed presence was greatest 0-10 m from rock outcrops. These results are consistent with local dispersal by ants and/or secondary dispersal (e.g., runoff) downslope. Seed presence was also greatest at higher elevations, in shallower soils, and within boundaries of recent fires. Viable seed banks occurred in stands > 85 years old, but an upper limit for seed bank viability could not be determined. The absence of seeds in deeper, hydric soils also suggests that habitat-specific factors influence seed viability. Based on these findings, reoccurring fire and physical landscape characteristics not only influence seed distribution and viability, but also have the potential to influence population persistence.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				MAR	2015	216	3					371	381		10.1007/s11258-014-0442-8							WOS:000349975000002

Benth. and Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze severely affect maize (Zea mays L.) production in sub-Saharan Africa. A single Striga plant produces a large number of seeds that form a bank of viable but dormant seed in the soil until they get a chemical signal from suitable maize host roots. Imidazolinone-resistant (IR) open-pollinated maize varieties (OP Vs) developed for Striga control were tested in diverse environments in four countries of eastern Africa in 2004. The objective of the study was to assess the agronomic performance of IR maize and genotype. environment interactions (GE) for grain yield (GY) and the number of emerged Striga plants across 17 environments under Striga-infested and Striga-free conditions. In the combined analysis of variance across Striga-infested and Striga-free locations, mean squares for genotypes and GE were significant for most measured traits. The best IR maize variety (STR-VE-216) outyielded the Striga-tolerant and commercial genotypes by 113 and 89%, respectively, under Striga-infested conditions. IR OP Vs supported significantly fewer emerged Striga plants relative to the check varieties. Under Striga-free conditions, IR OP Vs showed GY advantage over commercial varieties. Under Striga-infested conditions genotypic variance (sigma(2)(G)) was larger than genotype. location variance (sigma(2)(GxT)) for GY and number of emerged Striga plants at 12 wk after planting. The genetic correlations among locations under Striga-infested conditions were high (0.990), suggesting little GE between most environments used. Cluster analysis of genotypes under Striga-infested locations revealed two major groups that separated the IR OP Vs from the check varieties. The outstanding performance of selected IR OP Vs indicates that their use for Striga control would reduce the Striga seed bank while benefiting farmers with high GY.																	0011-183X	1435-0653				MAR-APR	2015	55	2					540	555		10.2135/cropsci2014.08.0593							WOS:000352223000008

Factors that act at relatively small scales, for example, the evolution of biological traits associated with invasiveness, scale up to shape species distributions among different climates and habitats, as well as other characteristics linked to invasion, such as attractiveness for cultivation (and by extension propagule pressure). To identify drivers of invasion it is therefore necessary to disentangle the contribution of multiple factors that are interdependent. To this end, we formulated a conceptual model describing the process of invasion of central European species into North America based on a sequence of drivers. We then used confirmatory path analysis to test whether the conceptual model is supported by a statistical model inferred from a comprehensive database containing 466 species. The path analysis revealed that naturalization of central European plants in North America, in terms of the number of North American regions invaded, most strongly depends on residence time in the invaded range and the number of habitats occupied by species in their native range. In addition to the confirmatory path analysis, we identified the effects of various biological traits on several important drivers of the conceptualized invasion process. The data supported a model that included indirect effects of biological traits on invasion via their effect on the number of native range habitats occupied and cultivation in the native range. For example, persistent seed banks and longer flowering periods are positively correlated with number of native habitats, while a stress-tolerant life strategy is negatively correlated with native range cultivation. However, the importance of the biological traits is nearly an order of magnitude less than that of the larger scale drivers and highly dependent on the invasion stage (traits were associated only with native range drivers). This suggests that future research should explicitly link biological traits to the different stages of invasion, and that a failure to consider residence time or characteristics of the native range may seriously overestimate the role of biological traits, which, in turn, may result in spurious predictions of plant invasiveness.

The present work analyzes post-dispersal predation on a Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) belowground seed bank. The study was carried out at the experimental site of Mata de Cuellar (Segovia, central Spain), where an integrated analysis of maritime pine regeneration has been underway since 2004. Seed predation was monitored every month from 2010 to 2013. A generalized linear model was fitted using "next spring seed density" as the response variable and seed rain, micro-site conditions and annual climate variability as explanatory variables. Seed rain, distance to the nearest stump, basal area and Walter's drought index, along with percentage cover of herbaceous species, pine needle litter and shrub species, had significant positive effects. The number of neighboring trees had a significant negative effect on seed density. These results demonstrate how seed rain, summer drought and micro-site conditions are crucial to understand the effects of predation on the belowground seed bank. Though greater than null, the final seed bank might be insufficient for successful natural regeneration due to high mortality caused by difficult germination and establishment conditions.

Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought intensity was quantified using the standardized precipitation index. We tested effects of drought intensity, grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history (annual, perennial) of the herbaceous layer to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that both components of ecosystem stability were better explained by dominant herbaceous life history than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems showed the same response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27% less resistant. In contrast, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher postdrought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer. To the best of our knowledge, our study established the first predictive, cross-continental model between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggests that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystem degradation under future global change regimes.

A continental view of pine-associated ectomycorrhizal fungal spore banks: a quiescent functional guild with a strong biogeographic pattern	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Ecologists have long acknowledged the importance of seed banks; yet, despite the fact that many plants rely on mycorrhizal fungi for survival and growth, the structure of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal spore banks remains poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to assess the geographic structure in pine-associated ECM fungal spore banks across the North American continent. Soils were collected from 19 plots in forests across North America. Fresh soils were pyrosequenced for fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons. Adjacent soil cores were dried and bioassayed with pine seedlings, and colonized roots were pyrosequenced to detect resistant propagules of ECM fungi. The results showed that ECM spore banks correlated strongly with biogeographic location, but not with the identity of congeneric plant hosts. Minimal community overlap was found between resident ECM fungi vs those in spore banks, and spore bank assemblages were relatively simple and dominated by Rhizopogon, Wilcoxina, Cenococcum, Thelephora, Tuber, Laccaria and Suillus. Similar to plant seed banks, ECM fungal spore banks are, in general, depauperate, and represent a small and rare subset of the mature forest soil fungal community. Yet, they may be extremely important in fungal colonization after large-scale disturbances such as clear cuts and forest fires.

Strong aroma, good taste and its elongation during cooking are the key characteristics of PSM rice. Thirty-one PSM accessions were genotypically characterized, and their physical grain and cooking quality traits were studied. We used specific gene markers associated with aroma, apparent amylose content (AAC) and alkali spreading value to determine the alleles carried by different PSM accessions. The results revealed that six PSM accessions (PSM10, PSM12, PSM13, PSM21, PSM22 and PSM30) had a 3-bp insertion in Os2AP gene. Gel consistency (GC) allele was predominant among the PSM accessions for gelatinization temperature (GT), however, the phenotype observed was between low and intermediate GT because of the combination of the GC allele with the presence of low GT allele at heterozygous state from the other loci of the SSIIa gene. Intermediate to high AAC was observed among the PSM accessions corresponding to the haplotype identified for the single nucleotide polymorphism G/T and the (CT)(n) repeat in the Wx gene. The characterization and grouping data of PSM accessions posted benefits to Myanmar seed banks, and our results will help in maintaining the integrity of PSM rice variety.																	1672-6308	1876-4762				MAR	2015	22	2					53	64		10.1016/j.rsci.2015.05.004							WOS:000213882000001

The role of imbibition on seed selection by Harpalus pensylvanicus	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Invertebrate weed seed predation is an important component of weed seed loss in agricultural fields. This study investigated the role of seed imbibition on the selection and consumption of the seeds of seven common agricultural weed species by Harpalus pensylvanicus De Geer, a granivorous carabid beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) that is found throughout North America. The volatile organic compounds released by ambient dry and imbibed weed seeds were quantified, and Y-tube bioassays were conducted to determine if H. pensylvanicus individuals responded to volatile compounds released from weed seeds. H. pensylvanicus individuals were found to consume higher masses of seeds for each weed species examined in imbibed versus ambient dry trials (P < 0.05). Larger seeded species had the greatest increase in mass consumption between dry seed and imbibed seed trials. The seeds from the seven weed species examined released carbon dioxide and ethylene when ambient dry and imbibed, but H. pensylvanicus adults were only able to detect weed seeds through olfaction when volatile release was highest as a result of imbibition. These results demonstrate that seed imbibition is important in determining seed detection and consumption by invertebrates and may affect seed banks in agricultural fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Increasingly mechanized timber harvesting and the repeated use of skid trail networks may affect ground vegetation differently at subsequent stages in the forest rotation. At a fine scale, no studies have yet compared the influence of micro-environmental factors and the effects of skid trail disturbance on ground flora diversity. We investigated understory diversity patterns on skid trails in 30-, 50- and 63-year-old oak forests in the northern half of France. Subplots were placed on skid trail center, wheel track, skid trail edge plus an off-trail control. At each subplot, we measured soil moisture, soil compaction (penetration resistance and bulk density) and photosynthetic active radiation and recorded the abundance of all vascular plants. The richness and abundance of ground flora were calculated based on the classification of their life form, seed bank persistence, light preference and moisture requirements. For each ecological group, we found out its best diversity indicator from subplot location, micro-environmental factors (soil moisture and compaction, light) and stand attributes (stand type, basal area), then assessed the magnitude and negligibility of the effect of the best indicator. (1) Higher soil compaction compared to controls was detected on the tracks of skid trails in the 50- and 63-year-old stands. Neither soil moisture nor light varied with subplot location whatever the stand type. (2) The best diversity indicator that showed non-negligible effects included subplot location, and soil moisture or soil compaction. Compared to controls, skid trails in the 50- and 63-year-old stands were richer in tree and short-term seed bank species, while skid trails in the 30-year-old plots had no effect on ground flora. The abundance of tree and shade-tolerant species was also higher on skid trails. Soil moisture was positively correlated with the richness of low- and high-humidity species, shade-tolerant species and transient seed bank species as well as with the abundance of short-term seed bank species. Bulk density positively affected heliophilous species richness, while penetration resistance was positively related to shrub abundance. Skid trails and soil compaction in our research area had either no impact or a positive impact on ground flora diversity. Longer-term studies of skid trail effects are needed to validate these main findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Restoration potential of native forests after removal of conifer plantation: A perspective from Australia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study investigates whether undertaking a rotation of pine plantation on abandoned farmland facilitates the return of native species. Plant functional traits were used as a means of assessing the effects of land-use change on vegetation. We explored the relationships among plant traits, time since harvesting and environmental variables for the vegetation found in Pinus radiata plantations after clear-felling. Vegetation was monitored 1-3 years following harvesting and repeated eight years later. We compared species richness, composition and traits to those in reference native forest and abandoned farmland. There was a significant temporal shift in attribute associations of harvested plantations towards those in native forest and a move away from plant attributes common to the pre-plantation use of abandoned farmland. Cluster analysis produced ten emergent groups of plant functional traits for 144 plant species. After harvesting, attribute associations were typical of therophytes and included high specific leaf area (SLA), small stature, arbuscular or non-mycorrhizal associations and small, wind-dispersed seed. These were predominantly introduced species that were dominant in abandoned farmland. The repeat survey identified an obvious decrease in therophytes and an increase in species with low SLA, ant dispersal, large seed and ectomycorrhizal associations. This was largely due to an increase in native Myrmecochorous shrubs. Similar attributes were also shared by Ericoid heaths but these species failed to recolonise harvested sites. Relationships among plant traits of species and environmental variables changed over time with a greater proportion of the variance in attribute associations explained by prevailing site conditions (e.g. type of ground cover, edaphic properties) with increasing time since harvesting. There were no relationships among plant attribute associations and stem density or basal area of planted overstorey species suggesting that planting of tubestock seedlings of native overstorey species does not effectively promote the development of native vegetation. The persistence of introduced grasses in areas of former plantation, recruitment failure of native species and a ready supply of introduced species from surrounding land uses suggest that additional rehabilitation measures will be required to promote the return of a fuller complement of native species.

J	Tyagi, RK; Agrawal, A				Tyagi, Rishi Kumar; Agrawal, Anuradha			Revised genebank standards for management of plant genetic resources	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Genebanks are storehouses of genetic resources which have the primary responsibility of collecting, regenerating, conserving, characterizing, evaluating, documenting and distributing germplasm. With reference to plant genetic resources (PGR), today over 1,750 genebanks have been established worldwide, wherein 7.4 million accessions are maintained as ex situ collections in either seed banks, field genebanks, in vitro genebanks and/or cryogenebanks. To ensure that PGR are conserved in genebanks under recognized and appropriate conditions globally, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in collaboration with the International Board of Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) published the original Genebank Standards in 1994. Subsequently with advancements in science and technology, and changes in policy issues related to genetic resources, a need arose to revise the Genebank Standards. A consortium of global, regional and national stakeholders led by the FAO, Bioversity International, Global Crop Diversity Trust (GCDT), International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) and International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) prepared the revised version of the Genebank Standards. During the Fourteenth Regular Session of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) of the FAO the document on revised Genebank Standards was endorsed on 18 April 2013 and subsequently published as Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. These revised genebank standards have a universal value and utility in guiding genebank management for seeds (orthodox and non-orthodox) and vegetatively propagated crops. It can be used by genebank curators as a source of guidance for developing standard operating procedures. We have compared the draft revised Genebank Standards (2013) with the original Genebank Standards (1994) to highlight the key features, along with some historical account on genebanks and development of standards.

Nutritional quality analyses of traditional varieties of rice (Oryza sativa) collected from tribal areas in eastern India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Traditional varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L.) having withstood the rigors of time (tolerating both abiotic and biotic stresses) are grown by Indian farmers in rural and tribal parts of India for their subsistence. Seeds of 100 traditional varieties were accessed from the Gene Campaign collection of rice from eastern India and evaluated for nutritional traits (protein, amino acid, starch, amylose and amylopectin) to identify (i) nutritionally superior cultivars for improving livelihood of farmers and tribal communities and (ii) trait-specific donor types which can be used in rice improvement programmes. Seeds of tested cultivars exhibited wide variation for nutritional traits. Higher amylose content (>= 20%) were recorded in 16% cultivars. Amongst the 100 cultivars tested two cultivars, namely, GC/JH/2007/187 and GC/OR/2007/168 were identified with very high values for protein and amylose contents. Amylose content was positively correlated with starch and negatively correlated with amylopectin. Several superior cultivars were identified with better combination of two or more nutritional traits which can be recommended for cultivation by the farmers and tribal communities for their livelihood. Such cultivars can be used as donors in rice crop improvement programme, therefore, also need attention for their long-term conservation in field level seed banks and the National Genebank, for future use.																	0019-5022					FEB	2015	85	2					266	269									WOS:000352628300021

Post-fire spatial heterogeneity alters ground-dwelling arthropod and small mammal community patterns in a desert landscape experiencing a novel disturbance regime	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Anthropogenic activities have resulted in novel disturbance regimes which have unknown impacts on biodiversity. A notable example is the establishment of fire regimes in ecosystems that have not historically burned. These new disturbance regimes leave behind a complex spatial matrix with varying patterns of landscape heterogeneity. Research on novel disturbance regimes often ignores remnant vegetation within disturbed habitats, even though landscape variation in a disturbed area can influence population and community dynamics. Our objective was to understand the influence of spatial heterogeneity, characterized by varying levels of isolation and remnant vegetation, within a landscape disturbed by a novel fire regime in the Mojave Desert where wildfire was exceedingly rare to non-existent in this landscape prior to recent times. We found that community patterns of both ground-dwelling arthropods and small mammals varied based on the amount of remnant vegetation and isolation levels within burned habitats. Ground-dwelling arthropod abundance and richness measurements were highest in burned habitats that had remnant long-lived vegetation present, whereas small mammal abundance and richness measurements were highest in continuous expanses of unburned habitat. We also found that the negative impacts of fire on arthropods and small mammal communities in isolated, burned habitats were masked by the presence of long-lived perennial vegetation. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating habitat heterogeneity into future studies of novel disturbance regimes and provides evidence for the utility of restoration plantings in desert ecosystems.

Seed fates in crop-wild hybrid sunflower: crop allele and maternal effects	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Domestication has resulted in selection upon seed traits found in wild populations, yet crop-wild hybrids retain some aspects of both parental phenotypes. Seed fates of germination, dormancy, and mortality can influence the success of crop allele introgression in crop-wild hybrid zones, especially if crop alleles or crop-imparted seed coverings result in out-of-season germination. We performed a seed burial experiment using crop, wild, and diverse hybrid sunflower (Helianthus annuus) cross types to test how a cross type's maternal parent and nuclear genetic composition might affect its fate under field conditions. We observed higher maladaptive fall germination in the crop- and F-1- produced seeds than wild-produced seeds and, due to an interaction with percent crop alleles, fall germination was higher for cross types with more crop-like nuclear genetics. By spring, crop-produced cross types had the highest overwintering mortality, primarily due to higher fall germination. Early spring germination was identical across maternal types, but germination continued for F-1-produced seeds. In conclusion, the more wild-like the maternal parent or the less proportion of the cross type's genome contributed by the crop, the greater likelihood a seed will remain ungerminated than die. Wild-like dormancy may facilitate introgression through future recruitment from the soil seed bank.

Managing breaches of containment and eradication of invasive plant populations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Containment can be a viable strategy for managing invasive plants, but it is not always cheaper than eradication. In many cases, converting a failed eradication programme to a containment programme is not economically justified. Despite this, many contemporary invasive plant management strategies invoke containment as a fallback for failed eradication, often without detailing how containment would be implemented. We demonstrate a generalized analysis of the costs of eradication and containment, applicable to any plant invasion for which infestation size, dispersal distance, seed bank lifetime and the economic discount rate are specified. We estimate the costs of adapting eradication and containment in response to six types of breach and calculate under what conditions containment may provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme. We provide simple, general formulae and plots that can be applied to any invasion and show that containment will be cheaper than eradication only when the size of the occupied zone exceeds a multiple of the dispersal distance determined by seed bank longevity and the discount rate. Containment becomes proportionally cheaper than eradication for invaders with smaller dispersal distances, longer lived seed banks, or for larger discount rates. Both containment and eradication programmes are at risk of breach. Containment is less exposed to risk from reproduction in the occupied zone' and three types of breach that lead to a larger occupied zone', but more exposed to one type of breach that leads to a larger buffer zone'. For a well-specified eradication programme, only the three types of breach leading to reproduction in or just outside the buffer zone can justify falling back to containment, and only if the expected costs of eradication and containment were comparable before the breach.Synthesis and applications. Weed management plans must apply a consistent definition of containment and provide sufficient implementation detail to assess its feasibility. If the infestation extent, dispersal capacity, seed bank longevity and economic discount rate are specified, the general results presented here can be used to assess whether containment can outperform eradication, and under what conditions it would provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme.

J	Knappova, J; Munzbergova, Z				Knappova, Jana; Muenzbergova, Zuzana			Low seed pressure and competition from resident vegetation restricts dry grassland specialists to edges of abandoned fields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The occurrence of 66 dry-grassland species was compared between the edges and the interiors of 48 abandoned fields in northern Bohemia, Czech Republic, Europe. More species occurred at the edges than in the interiors. The proximity of the source grassland had a positive effect on species richness at the edges but not in the interiors. Soil characteristics did not differ between the edges and the interiors, but aboveground biomass was significantly lower at the edges, suggesting that edges have more open vegetation and provide more microsites suitable for colonisation. Neither dispersal traits nor habitat requirements were significantly associated with species that were more narrowly restricted to the edges of fields. However, the species that occurred more often at the edges than in the interiors were those that were infrequent in dry grasslands within the study area. These species responded positively to the grassland neighbourhood, they had a narrower niche, lower specific leaf area, a shorter persistence in the seed bank and a later initiation of flowering. The results of the study indicate that low microsite availability, together with low seed pressure, is most limiting for these specialised and competitively inferior species. For this reason, they are much more restricted to dry grasslands, and their conservation relies primarily on proper management of their current habitats. The suitability of abandoned fields for grassland specialists could be enhanced by disturbance that would create colonisation microsites, and successful recruitment of grassland species can be supported by seed additions.

J	Di Sacco, A; Bedini, G				Di Sacco, Alice; Bedini, Gianni			Demography and reproductive performance of Calystegia soldanella on a sandy seashore in Tuscany, Italy	BOTANY												Calystegia soldanella (L.) R.Br. is a psammophyte growing in the coastal foredunes of temperate areas. We investigated its demography and reproductive performance, to improve the in situ and ex situ management of the species as an essential element in planning the stabilization of the shoreline. The studied population is located in northwestern Tuscany, Italy. Demographic data were recorded in 20 quadrats from May to October 2009. Self-pollination ability has been tested by wrapping flower buds in cotton lint. Seeds traits (length, width, depth, shape index, mass, and water content), flotation ability, and germination percentage have been determined on seeds collected from the study site. The presence of C. soldanella seeds in the soil seed bank has been investigated by sifting the sand of 30 soil core samples. Our results showed that ramet density decreases during summer, mainly owing to drought. Predation reduces ramet size especially in spring and autumn, but rarely fatally, having the greatest impact on flower removal and, therefore, in decreasing the population's genetic variability. Self-pollination does not occur and the percentage of reproductive ramets increases with their size. Tested seeds were able to float on water and germinated to 100%. No C. soldanella seeds were observed in the soil core samples. While suggesting useful indications for the management of the investigated population, our results provide a guideline for a more comprehensive study about the management of C. soldanella.

A total of 60 species from 25 family 43 genera were identified from the seed banks of the three rivers. In the eutrophic Paihe River, the species richness and mean seed density were the highest, followed by the oligotrophic Hangbuhe River and the hypereutrophic Nanfeihe River. Various compositions of three functional group assemblage of hydro-ecotypes were found in different rivers. The dominant and endemic species were aquatic, wetland, and terrestrial species in Hangbuhe River, Paihe River, and Nanfeihe River, respectively. The shift trend of seed bank in three rivers probably presented past vegetation dynamics under the trophic process in the rivers of Chaohu Lake Basin. Seed bank in the river bed might be quickly assessed by its trophic level. Additionally, it might imply that the seed bank with more aquatic species in the oligotrophic river would be a potential seed resource for vegetation restoration of severely degraded river ecosystems.

J	Kaiser, T; Pirhofer-Walzl, K				Kaiser, Thomas; Pirhofer-Walzl, Karin			Does the soil seed survival of fen-meadow species depend on the groundwater level?	PLANT AND SOIL												Numerous studies noted that the seed banks of drained former wet-meadows did not have enough residual seed potential for the successful restoration of species-rich fen-meadows. However, it is unclear whether a decline in groundwater level exerts a negative effect on the seed survival of wet-meadow plant species in the soil. This paper assessed the dependence of soil seed survival on different groundwater levels. We tested the influence of the groundwater level on the seed survival rate of 8 wet-meadow plant species in fen lysimeters with constant groundwater levels of 5, 30 and 70 cm. Seeds were buried in nylon mesh bags at 2 depths (5 and 25 cm), exhumed after 1, 3 and 5 years in the spring and tested in a climate chamber for germinable seeds under conditions of different day-night rhythms and fluctuating temperatures. At both burial depths, more viable seeds survived at lower groundwater levels compared with groundwater levels near the surface. Waterlogged conditions resulted in a significant reduction in the number of germinable seeds for most of the studied plant species. A cluster analysis divided the eight plant species into three groups which differed in soil seed bank persistence and tolerance towards soil wetness. The decline of the groundwater level due to fen-meadow drainage does not negatively affect the seeds of wet-meadow plant species. Our results also suggest that for some species, the classification of soil seed bank type may vary according to the groundwater level dynamic of the location.

Transition from heathland to scrub in south-eastern Tasmania: extent of change since the 1970s, floristic depletion and management implications	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Heathland is a speciose and floriferous vegetation type, defined by its stature (< 2 m) and dominance by scleromorphic shrubs. Heathland has been in decline globally, and much of its loss has been due to less frequent fire, while in some places more frequent fire has resulted in degradation through the loss of obligate seeding species. The aims of the present study were to determine: (1) the extent of the transition from heathland to scrub in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia between c1976 and 2013; (2) the spatial attributes of heathland that are likely to have been the most instrumental in heathland loss; (3) whether the transition to scrub resulted in the loss of local species richness and changed species composition when taking both above ground vegetation and the soil seed bank into account; and (4) the implications of the answers to the first three questions for heathland management. Changes in heathland and scrub extent were mapped from remote sensing imagery and ground truthing. At one locality with floristic data from the heathland of 1976, the scrub that has replaced the heathland was surveyed and soil collected to determine seed banks under heating and non-heating treatments. Approximately one third of the 1976 heathland had become scrub by 2013, mostly around the margins of heathland patches and near built up areas. Twenty-two species present in 1976 were not found in either the scrub or seed bank, with only three species absent from the scrub, but present in the 1976 heath, being found in the seed bank. The species composition of germinates in the unheated treatment was dominated by taxa that colonise mechanically disturbed areas, such as Juncus, while germinates in the heat treated soils were largely scleromorphic heath species. The depletion of species richness by the transition to scrub, and the large extent of its incidence, suggest that a higher frequency of planned fire is needed in south-eastern Tasmania.

Regeneration failure threatens persistence of Persoonia elliptica (Proteaceae) in Western Australian jarrah forests	PLANT ECOLOGY												The severe disruption of herbivore relationships can result in catastrophic, demographic consequences for plant populations. We investigated the potential roles of herbivory, fire and their interaction, in the observed long-term regeneration failure of Persoonia elliptica R.Br. (Proteaceae), an understory tree species of fire-prone jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Sm.) forests in southwestern Australia. Seed production, storage and viability were assessed, as was seedling recruitment in both the presence and absence of fire (a potential germination cue), using experimental herbivore exclosure plots. We also sought to determine the 'herbivory zone' (height) within which P. elliptica was susceptible to browsing. Herbivores, primarily the western grey kangaroo, preferentially consumed leaves of P. elliptica up to a browsing height of 1.5 m. Viability of fresh seeds was low at ca. 39 % and rapid viability loss was observed in the soil seed bank, with only ca. 5 % of seeds remaining viable for > 1 year. Germination was restricted almost solely to burned areas and survival of recruits to the confines of herbivore exclosures. We suggest that an increase in the primary herbivore, combined with low viable seed supply, is the likely cause of continuing regeneration failure in this species. The slow growth of the species suggests that without intervention, seedlings and juvenile plants will be unable to escape the herbivory zone. Management actions to facilitate recruitment might best focus on the combination of managed fires to break seed dormancy, followed by fencing to protect seedlings from large herbivores.

The growth pattern of Namibian fairy circles was examined in relation to environmental, termite, and plant variables to provide support for the sand termite (Psammotermes allocerusSilvestri) hypothesis of circle origin. 2. New and young circles were associated with the highest number of sand termites and their foraging grass sheetings which were both considerably lower in mature and senescent circles. 3. Circles increased in size with age, and apart from the senescent stage had higher soil moisture levels than the matrix. 4. In laboratory trials sand termites browsed seedling roots, negatively impacting root and leaf number. 5. This provides a potential mechanism for circle formation through central-based foraging by P. allocerus which eliminates Stipagrostis grass clumps around its nest system. 6. The resulting bare disc is postulated to be maintained through a combination of a depleted seed bank, termite herbivory on seedlings, and excavations by pugnacious ants (Anoplolepis steingroeveriForel).																	0307-6946	1365-2311				FEB	2015	40	1					42	49		10.1111/een.12157							WOS:000347717200005

Their cumulative impacts on native biotas alter the functioning of island ecosystems and threaten biodiversity. A report is given here of the first attempt to eradicate both taxa from a protected nature reserve in south-eastern France (Bagaud Island). In order to minimise unwanted hazardous outcomes and produce scientific knowledge, the operations were embedded in a four-step strategy including initial site assessment, planning, restoration and monitoring. RESULTSTrapping, which resulted in the removal of 1923 rats in 21045 trap-nights, made it possible to eliminate a substantial proportion of the resident rat population and to reduce the amount of rodenticide delivered in the second stage of the operation. Forty tons of Carpobrotus spp. were manually uprooted from a total area of 18000 m(2); yet careful monitoring over a decade is still required to prevent germinations from the seed bank. CONCLUSIONTwo years after the beginning of the interventions, both eradication operations are still ongoing. Biosecurity measures have been implemented to reduce reinvasion risks of both taxa. With the long-term monitoring of various native plants and animals, Bagaud Island will become a reference study site for scientific purposes.

(Nymphaeaceae) in Japan	ACTA PHYTOTAXONOMICA ET GEOBOTANICA												We analyzed the population genetic structure of Euryale ferox Salisb. (Nymphaeaceae), an annual aquatic herb, to obtain information useful for conservation of this species. A total of 391 plants from 58 populations throughout Japan and four plants from a population in China were sampled and genotyped using eight microsatellite markers. Within- and among-population genetic diversity of E. ferox in Japan was basically low, with all eight microsatellite loci fixed to single alleles in many populations. However, multilocus genotypes including heterozygous loci were detected from three populations; these populations had inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) not equal to 1.0 and it is assumed that these multilocus genotypes are produced by outbreeding of genetically different individuals. Principal coordinate analysis (PCO) and population genetic structure analysis using INSTRUCT software uncovered at least two genetically distinct groups within Japanese E. ferox populations, neither of which had a simple geographical distribution pattern. This complex genetic structure may be the result of a random fixation of MLGs through genetic drift after habitat loss and by spatial and temporal admixture among populations through seed dispersal and seed banks.

Plant life on gypsum: a review of its multiple facets	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												The adaptation of plants to particular soil types has long intrigued biologists. Gypsum soils occupy large areas in many regions of the world and host a striking biological diversity, but their vegetation has been much less studied than that developing over serpentine or saline soils. Herein, we review all aspects of plant life on gypsum ecosystems, discuss the main processes driving their structure and functioning, and highlight the main conservation threats that they face. Plant communities in gypsum habitats typically show distinctive bands at very small spatial scales, which are mainly determined by topography. Plants living on gypsum soils can be classified into three categories: (i) wide gypsophiles are specialists that can penetrate the physical soil crust during early life stages and have physiological adjustments to cope with the chemical limitations imposed by gypsum soils; (ii) narrow gypsophiles are refugee plants which successfully deal with the physical soil crust and can tolerate these chemical limitations but do not show specific adaptations for this type of soils; and (iii) gypsovags are non-specialist gypsum plants that can only thrive in gypsum soils when the physical crust is absent or reduced. Their ability to survive in gypsum soils may also be mediated by below-ground interactions with soil microorganisms. Gypsophiles and gypsovags show efficient germination at low temperatures, seed and fruit heteromorphism within and among populations, and variation in seed dormancy among plants and populations. In gypsum ecosystems, spatio-temporal changes in the composition and structure of above-ground vegetation are closely related to those of the soil seed bank. Biological soil crusts (BSCs) dominated by cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses are conspicuous in gypsum environments worldwide, and are important drivers of ecosystem processes such as carbon and nitrogen cycling, water infiltration and run-off and soil stability. These organisms are also important determinants of the structure of annual plant communities living on gypsum soils. The short-distance seed dispersal of gypsophiles is responsible for the high number of very narrow endemisms typically found in gypsum outcrops, and suggests that these species are evolutionarily old taxa due to the time they need to colonize isolated gypsum outcrops by chance. Climate change and habitat fragmentation negatively affect both plants and BSCs in gypsum habitats, and are among the major threats to these ecosystems. Gypsum habitats and specialists offer the chance to advance our knowledge on restrictive soils, and are ideal models not only to test important evolutionary questions such as tolerance to low Ca/Mg proportions in soils, but also to improve the theoretical framework of community ecology and ecosystem functioning.

The ecophysiology of seed persistence: a mechanistic view of the journey to germination or demise	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Seed persistence is the survival of seeds in the environment once they have reached maturity. Seed persistence allows a species, population or genotype to survive long after the death of parent plants, thus distributing genetic diversity through time. The ability to predict seed persistence accurately is critical to inform long-term weed management and flora rehabilitation programs, as well as to allow a greater understanding of plant community dynamics. Indeed, each of the 420000 seed-bearing plant species has a unique set of seed characteristics that determine its propensity to develop a persistent soil seed bank. The duration of seed persistence varies among species and populations, and depends on the physical and physiological characteristics of seeds and how they are affected by the biotic and abiotic environment. An integrated understanding of the ecophysiological mechanisms of seed persistence is essential if we are to improve our ability to predict how long seeds can survive in soils, both now and under future climatic conditions. In this review we present an holistic overview of the seed, species, climate, soil, and other site factors that contribute mechanistically to seed persistence, incorporating physiological, biochemical and ecological perspectives. We focus on current knowledge of the seed and species traits that influence seed longevity under ex situ controlled storage conditions, and explore how this inherent longevity is moderated by changeable biotic and abiotic conditions in situ, both before and after seeds are dispersed. We argue that the persistence of a given seed population in any environment depends on its resistance to exiting the seed bank via germination or death, and on its exposure to environmental conditions that are conducive to those fates. By synthesising knowledge of how the environment affects seeds to determine when and how they leave the soil seed bank into a resistance-exposure model, we provide a new framework for developing experimental and modelling approaches to predict how long seeds will persist in a range of environments.

The economic implications of the management practices have been rarely considered in those models. Their inclusion could enhance weed management decisions. A bioeconomic spatially explicit model was developed and validated using field data. The model integrated a weed population submodel, a weed-crop competition submodel and an economic analysis. It was employed to evaluate long-term management strategies to control Lolium rigidum Gaudin, a troublesome weed infesting cereals in Mediterranean climates. A total of eleven individual and integrated management strategies, including cultural and chemical control, were evaluated. The predicted and observed distributions of population growth rates were similar for the four experimental plots used in the validation. One plot was fully validated with most proposed validation methods, while in the remaining plots, the predicted growth rates, in general, underestimated the observed growth rates. Our results showed that most individual management programmes were worse at controlling L.rigidum populations than integrated management ones. The programmes integrating cultural control strategies and herbicide at its full rate achieved the best long-term control. However, other strategies that were not as efficient at decreasing weed densities were more profitable economically, such as herbicide application at full rate. Economic returns were negative in all the strategies simulated. A sensitivity analysis showed that the seed bank and the economic outcomes were especially sensitive to fecundity and to the control exerted by management.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the use of herbicide and low-input cultural control methods or full-dose herbicide applications are the most economically efficient strategies controlling L.rigidum populations. However, cultural control methods are not recommended as the only management strategies. Herbicide applications at full doses are preferable to applications at low doses, producing more successful weed control and, generally, less economic losses. The spatially explicit bioeconomic model developed has proved to be useful evaluating long-term weed management strategies in dry land cereal agrosystems. This kind of model would enhance weed management decisions for farmers based on an economic as well as an agronomic point of view.

Here we show that size and richness of an acid grassland seed bank is strongly reduced after 13 years of simulated N deposition. Soils receiving 140 kg N ha(-1) per year show a decline in total seed abundance, seed species richness, and the abundance of forbs, sedges and grasses. These results reveal larger effects of N pollution on seed banks than on aboveground vegetation as cover and flowering is not significantly altered for most species. Further, the seed bank shows no recovery 4 years after the cessation of N deposition. These results provide insights into the severe negative effects of N pollution on plant communities that threaten the stability of populations, community persistence and the potential for ecosystems to recover following anthropogenic disturbance or climate change.

Seed dormancy cycling in Arabidopsis: chromatin remodelling and regulation of DOG1 in response to seasonal environmental signals	PLANT JOURNAL												The involvement of chromatin remodelling in dormancy cycling in the soil seed bank (SSB) is poorly understood. Natural variation between the winter and summer annual Arabidopsis ecotypes Cvi and Bur was exploited to investigate the expression of genes involved in chromatin remodelling via histone 2B (H2B) ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination and histone acetylation/deacetylation, the repressive histone methyl transferases CURLY LEAF (CLF) and SWINGER (SWN), and the gene silencing repressor ROS1 (REPRESSOR OF SILENCING1) and promoter of silencing KYP/SUVH4 (KRYPTONITE), during dormancy cycling in the SSB. ROS1 expression was positively correlated with dormancy while the reverse was observed for CLF and KYP/SUVH4. We propose ROS1 dependent repression of silencing and a sequential requirement of CLF and KYP/SUVH4 dependent gene repression and silencing for the maintenance and suppression of dormancy during dormancy cycling. Seasonal expression of H2B modifying genes was correlated negatively with temperature and positively with DOG1 expression, as were histone acetyltransferase genes, with histone deacetylases positively correlated with temperature. Changes in the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were seen on DOG1 (DELAY OF GERMINATION1) in Cvi during dormancy cycling. H3K4me3 activating marks remained stable along DOG1. During relief of dormancy, H3K27me3 repressive marks slowly accumulated and accelerated on exposure to light completing dormancy loss. We propose that these marks on DOG1 serve as a thermal sensing mechanism during dormancy cycling in preparation for light repression of dormancy. Overall, chromatin remodelling plays a vital role in temporal sensing through regulation of gene expression.

We tested the hypothesis that DOC is a factor enhancing spring recruitment of the species by exposing sediments from a humic lake with a 17-year bloom history, to three various DOC additions (two solutions of glucose and one solution of a peat extract). Sediments and lake water were incubated for 14 days at 16A degrees C, in 14:10 h light:dark cycle, with germling and adult cell abundance ascertained in the water every third day, and water parameters every seventh day. Our important findings were that (1) Gonyostomum recruitment was uneven and the period of germination was relatively short; (2) all treatments significantly affected germling occurrence; however, sugar-derived DOC seemed to suppress the recruitment, whereas peat extract improved it. Due to the additional phosphorus load in peat treatment (against phosphorus-free sugar treatments), it is likely that it played a major role in the observed differences, however, our results did not exclude the potential role of peat-derived DOC forms. In conclusion, we proposed that Gonyostomum expansion is supported by enhanced recruitment from sediment seed banks related to water chemistry alterations, driven by the climate change.

Resuscitation of the rare boisphere contributes to pulses of ecosystem activity	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Dormancy is a life history trait that may have important implications for linking microbial communities to the functioning of natural and managed ecosystems. Rapid changes in environmental cues may resuscitate dormant bacteria and create pulses of ecosystem activity. In this study, we used heavy-water ((H2O)-O-18) stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify fast-growing bacteria that were associated with pulses of trace gasses (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from different ecosystems [agricultural site, grassland, deciduous forest, and coniferous forest (CF)] following a soil-rewetting event. Irrespective of ecosystem type, a large fraction (69-74%) of the bacteria that responded to rewetting were below detection limits in the dry soils. Based on the recovery of sequences, in just a few days, hundreds of rare taxa increased in abundance and in some cases became dominant members of the rewetted communities, especially bacteria belonging to the Sphingomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae. Resuscitation led to dynamic shifts in the rank abundance of taxa that caused previously rare bacteria to comprise nearly 60% of the sequences that were recovered in rewetted communities. This rapid turnover of the bacterial community corresponded with a 5-20-fold increase in the net production of CO2 and up to a 150% reduction in the net production of CH4 from rewetted soils. Results from our study demonstrate that the rare biosphere may account for a large and dynamic fraction of a community that is important for the maintenance of bacterial biodiversity. Moreover, our findings suggest that the resuscitation of rare taxa from seed banks contribute to ecosystem functioning.

Do soil microbes and abrasion by soil particles influence persistence and loss of physical dormancy in seeds of tropical pioneers?	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Germination from the soil seed bank (SSB) is an important determinant of species composition in tropical forest gaps, with seed persistence in the SSB allowing trees to recruit even decades after dispersal. The capacity to form a persistent SSB is often associated with physical dormancy, where seed coats are impermeable at the time of dispersal. Germination literature often speculates, without empirical evidence, that dormancy-break in physically dormant seeds is the result of microbial action and/or abrasion by soil particles. We tested the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis in four widely distributed neotropical pioneer tree species (Apeiba membranacea, Luehea seemannii, Ochroma pyramidale, and Cochlospermum vitifolium). Seeds were buried in five common gardens in a lowland tropical forest in Panama, and recovered at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after burial. Seed permeability, microbial infection, seed coat thickness, and germination were measured. Parallel experiments compared the germination fraction of fresh and aged seeds without soil contact, and in seeds as a function of seed permeability. Contrary to the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis the proportion of permeable seeds, and of seeds infected by cultivable microbes, decreased as a function of burial duration. Furthermore, seeds stored in dark and dry conditions for 2 years showed a higher proportion of seed germination than fresh seeds in identical germination conditions. We determined that permeable seeds of A. membranacea and O. pyramidale had cracks in the chalazal area or lacked the chalazal plug, whereas all surfaces of impermeable seeds were intact. Our results are inconsistent with the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis of dormancy loss and instead suggest the existence of multiple dormancy phenotypes, where a fraction of each seed cohort is dispersed in a permeable state and germinates immediately, while the impermeable seed fraction accounts for the persistent SSB. Thus, we conclude that fluctuations in the soil temperature in the absence of soil abrasion and microbial infection are sufficient to break physical dormancy on seeds of tropical pioneer trees.

J	Cuneo, P; Leishman, MR				Cuneo, Peter; Leishman, Michelle R.			Recovery after African Olive invasion: can a 'bottom-up' approach to ecological restoration work?	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												African Olive (Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata) is a densely crowned evergreen small tree, native to eastern Africa that is highly invasive in areas where it has been introduced, including Hawaii and Australia. Invasion by African Olive threatens Cumberland Plain Woodland, a critically endangered grassy eucalypt woodland from western Sydney, Australia, through the formation of a dense mid-canopy excluding the regeneration of native species. We established a 3-year field experiment to determine the effectiveness of direct seeding and fire, as techniques for early stage restoration of a 2ha historically cleared and degraded Cumberland Plain Woodland site after the removal of African Olive. Direct seeding was able to re-establish a native perennial grass cover which was resistant to subsequent weed invasion and could be managed as an important first stage in woodland restoration with fire and selective herbicide. Fire was able to stimulate some germination of colonising native species from the soil seed bank after 15years of African Olive invasion; however, germination and establishment of native shrubs from the applied seed mix was poor. We propose a bottom-up' model of ecological restoration in such highly degraded sites that uses a combination of direct seeding and stimulation of the soil seed bank by fire, which could be applicable to other degraded grassy woodland sites and plant communities.

CONFERENCE AGRICULTURE FOR LIFE, LIFE FOR AGRICULTURE	Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia				4th International Conference on Agriculture for Life, Life for Agriculture	JUN 04-06, 2015	Bucharest, ROMANIA	Univ Agronom Sci Vet Med Bucharest				In last decades, farmland biodiversity came under large threat. To counteract farmland biodiversity loss and other environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, European farmers can apply Agri-environmental schemes. One of these is the creation of flower strips, a part of the cropping field where flowers are sown or naturally settled. Flower strips are known to increase biodiversity in the agricultural landscape, notably attracting specific insects groups, such as pollinators and natural enemies that can provide valuable pollination and biocontrol services to the crop. However, the plant species composition and management of the strips can have a large influence on the identity and amount of useful insects present in the strips, suggesting the need to develop tailored flower strips to maximize the services delivered. Functional diversity (FD) is sometimes proposed as a promising approach, focusing on plant functional traits rather than plant species itself. Yet, it is not certain that sowing a set of plant species results in the desired vegetation with the desired functional trait composition. Species from soil seed bank or dispersing from neighboring vegetation can settle in the strip, while sown species might not always be equally adapted to local conditions. To test this, we developed seed mixtures with four different levels of FD, based on flower traits, and sew them as flower strips in a conventional arable field. We monitored the vegetation to calculate the FD of the realized vegetation. While the absolute FD values of the realized vegetation were lower than the expected FD values, the realized vegetation showed the same FD gradient as expected from the sown mixtures, indicating that it is possible to manipulate FD in flower strips.

The results showed that with the aggravation of degraded natural grassland, grassland coverage reduced gradually(P<0.05), the Stipa krylovii height, coverage, and biomass presented the decreasing trend along the degradation(P<0.05), and the seed bank density displayed a pattern of initial increase and the followed by a subsequent decline(P<0.05). Based on geostatistical analysis, the semivariogram models of soil seed bank presented a similar nonlinear model in the four experimental alpine grasslands; the sill and range distributed as inverted U type; but the structure ratio showed the opposite change trend and 75.97%-94.48% of spatial heterogeneity resulted from spatial autocorrelation. Specifically, except the type I grassland, there is an obvious positive correlation in the type II and type III grasslands (P < 0.01), the positive correlation existed in the Type IV grassland(P < 0.05).																	2160-1070		978-1-61275-072-9				2015	81						444	450									WOS:000380582100079

Evaluation of Fruit Quality in Tomato Landraces under Organic Greenhouse Conditions	II INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HORTICULTURE IN EUROPE	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Symposium on Horticulture in Europe (SHE)	JUL 01-05, 2012	Angers, FRANCE	Int Soc Hort Sci				Given the importance of plant biodiversity in agro-ecological systems, we evaluated the potential use of 39 tomato landraces for greenhouse farming in the province of Almeria, Spain. The cultivars were selected from a collection of Andalusia vegetables, preserved in the Seed Bank at the University of Almeria (BSUAL). Besides a phenotypic characterisation of each cultivar, a comparative study of vegetative, floral and fruit development has been performed, as well as a detailed analysis of fruit quality under organic farming conditions. The agronomic assessment was completed with an evaluation of the organoleptic and external fruit quality based on the consumer preferences achieved from a tasting attended by 80 people from different sectors, ages and gender. A wide diversity in growth pattern, leaf morphology, flowering time, and particularly in fruit size, shape and colour, was detected among the 39 tomato landraces analysed, influencing the better adaptation of some cultivars over others within organic greenhouse conditions. Parthenocarpy was detected in some cultivars, whose fruits were able to grow until maturity in absence of pollination. Differences in the postharvest quality of fruits during their cold storage for 14 days were also observed among the different landraces. All of these attributes, including data from the tasting, have been used to identify and select those cultivars with better performance and fruit quality under organic farming in greenhouses.

Maximising the value of seed collections for horticulture and conservation	XXIX INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON HORTICULTURE: SUSTAINING LIVES, LIVELIHOODS AND LANDSCAPES (IHC2014): IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES	Acta Horticulturae				29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 4th International Symposium on Plant Genetic Resources	AUG 17-22, 2014	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Hort Sci				Seed collection and processing can be a costly and time-consuming element of plant production and germplasm conservation. Understanding seed set, viability and germination, and responses to handling and storage conditions might provide information for decision-making relating to both horticultural plant production and long-term seed conservation. In this study, two species, Backhousia citriodora and B. myrtifolia were used to model how seed characteristics should be assessed. Commonly used in horticulture and readily available from Australian seed suppliers, anecdotal industry information suggested seed viability was an issue for both species. It was found that low seed set rather than seed viability was the reason for apparent low germination. Although seeds were found only in a small percentage of capsules, for B. citriodora 8-16.5% and for B. myrtifolia 20 and 35%, the extracted seed had relatively high germination rates; B. citriodora 74% and B. myrtifolia 94%. This finding underlines the importance of implementing ongoing seed quality assessment to maximise effectiveness of seed collection. In addition, an examination of storage options and seed longevity indicated that an alternative seed storage method such as cryopreservation should be considered to ensure long-term conservation of germplasm of these two species.																	0567-7572		978-94-62610-87-3				2015	1101						55	61		10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1101.9							WOS:000378649000009

Cryopreservation of Secondary Protocorms, an Alternative Pathway for Conservation of Western Australian Terrestrial Orchids	II INTERNATIONAL ORCHID SYMPOSIUM	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Orchid Symposium	FEB 19-21, 2014	Bangkok, THAILAND	Int Soc Horticultural Sci				Orchidaceae contains many species worldwide with a high extinction risk. Efforts to overcome this problem include ex situ approaches such as seed banking and in vitro germination of orchid seed symbiotically or asymbiotically. The rationale behind this study was to investigate alternative protocols for orchid propagation that would reduce dependence on valuable seed stocks especially with rare and endangered orchid species, while still enabling experiments to be conducted to improve in vitro and long-term storage methods. We report on research into secondary protocorm proliferation and cryopreservation of native orchid species conducted at Kings Park Botanic Garden (KPBG), Perth, Western Australia. Secondary protocorms of Caladenia latifolia R. Br. were produced from primary protocorms following asymbiotic germination using a protocol developed at Kings Park. A cryostorage protocol developed for the primary protocorms was utilized and modified for secondary protocorms. This was based on droplet vitrification and storage in Liquid Nitrogen (LN). Secondary protocorms of C. latifolia were precultured on a 1/2MS with 0.2 M raffinose solid medium for 2 days, followed by PVS2 treatment for 20 minutes at 0 degrees C, then protocorms were placed on foil strips in droplets of PVS2 and stored in LN. Control protocorms were taken from PVS2 treated with washing solution (1 M sucrose) and placed on recovery medium without LN storage. All secondary protocorms survived cryopreservation without browning and proceeded to develop into plantlets. However regeneration to plantlets took up to 20 weeks with C. latifolia, and further experiments will be necessary to shorten the regeneration time if possible. However the results are promising and will be trialled with other orchids, including rare species.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929												0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62610-68-2				2015	1078						61	67									WOS:000378329500007

In this study, impacts of fire on the alpine wet meadow community were investigated by a comparative analysis of sampling plots in the Lhasa area. The influence of microgeomorphology was also considered in the analysis. The results indicated that fire changed the species composition and species dominance of the meadow. A higher number of species, and greater community evenness and diversity, was found in the burned plots compared with the unburned plots. However, no significant impact was found on above-ground biomass. Communities in the relatively flat ground areas were more sensitive to the disturbance while the ridges provided suitable microhabitats for the wet meadow species. Biomass of the ridge communities was significantly higher than that of the ground communities. Furthermore, the wet meadow community was more significantly affected by the fire in the peak growing season.																			978-1-60595-264-2				2015							4483	4490									WOS:000375561905094

Scutellaria chamaedrifolia Hedge & Paton (Lamiaceae) is a rare endemic species confined to northern mountain ranges of Pakistan with small geographic range. Potential habitats suitable for species survival were determined using species occurrence records obtained through field surveys. Twenty two topoclimatic factors derived from globally interpolated datasets using Arcmap were used as predictor variables. Look up tables generated through Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction (GRASP) program were used to produce prediction maps. The results revealed that annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, mean temperature of the driest quarter, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, precipitation of wettest month and precipitation of the coldest quarter were significantly affecting species distribution. Localities from Mansehra, Batagram, Torghar and adjoining Shangla and Buner districts were identified as best suitable habitats (p = 0.9) for the species. Establishment of the protected areas and seed banks are imperative for conservation of the species.

Efficiency of Some Crops in Inducing Suicidal Germination of the Parasitic Weed, Striga hernonthica Del Benth	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL					4th International Conference for Applied Biological Control (ESBCP)	OCT 19-22, 2015	Cairo, EGYPT					The parasitic weed Striga hermonthica (Orobanchaceae) is a major pest that threatens production of cereal food crops in Africa mainly; sorghum, pearl millet, maize, sugarcane and rice. The parasite is difficult to control by traditional control methods due to its close association with its host plant, prodigious seed production and ability of the parasite seeds to remain viable for up to 20 years. These factors enable Striga to enrich soil seed bank within short period of time, if it is not checked. Induction of suicidal germination of the parasite seeds will greatly contribute to reduction of Striga seed reservoir in the soil and hence will greatly contribute to reduction of the damage caused by the parasite to the host crop. This study was set to evaluate efficiency of 12 plant species from different families, containing crop and weed species (found in the farming system where Striga prevail in Sudan), in inducing suicidal germination of Striga seeds. Root chamber technique was used to observed underground stages ofthe parasite. Results showe d that all tested plant species stimulated germination of Striga seeds to varying degrees. The host sorghum vatiety Dabar-1, hitherto known to be highly susceptible to S. hermonthica attack, stimulated germination of 48.2% of the parasite seeds, whereas the amount stimulated by Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) was 56.2% and H. sabdariffa var. sabdariffa (karkade) was 25.5%. The germination of Striga seeds induced by leguminous species varied between 40.4% for Lab lab purpureus to 8.3% for Cassia occidentalis. Germination of Striga seeds stimulated by sunflower was 16.7%. The attachment of germinated Striga seeds to sorghum roots was 14.9%, whereas attachment to roots of other plant species varied between 0 to 5.2%. Therefore, including crops like; A. esculentus and Lab lab purpureus in crop rotation, where Striga prevails, will greatly contribute to deplete the parasite seed bank and subsequently reduce damage to the grown cereal host crops.																	1110-1768						2015	25	3					735	738									WOS:000371938000031

The study was to determine different soil tillage and weed control methods on weeding and numbers of weed seeds in the soil, in the case of wheat, maize and soybean crops. Dicotyledonous perennial weeds species causes special problems because of its ability to reproduce both through seeds but particularly through vegetative propagation, and also because its relative tolerance to numerous herbicides. Extending new tillage systems, conservative systems specific to conservative sustainable agriculture, is a difficult task to accomplish under the circumstances of strong dicotyledonous perennial weed infestation. Convolvulus arvensis L. is one of the most dangerous perennial dicotyledonous weeds when applying minimum tillage systems. A research study was conducted in the pedoclimate of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, investigating the control of C. arvensis by minimum tillage. The goal was to determine the relationship between soil tillage system and herbicide on wheat, maize and soybeans. Except for the soil tillage system, all other variables were held constant for a 3-year crop rotation. The use of minimum tillage systems caused, at the end of a 3 year crop rotation, the increase of the C. arvensis pervasion in all three crops: 11.2-39.1% for soybeans, 0.9-4.2% for wheat, and 11.9-24.4% for maize. The occurrence of C. arvensis seeds in the soil increased to 169% under the disk + rotary harrow minimum tillage system, with 77% of those seeds located in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile. Total weed density was significantly lower under the conventional tillage than under the minimum tillage system. Related to conventional soil tillage system, the productions registered in minimum tillage system represented 93-99% in wheat, 89-97% in maize, 103-112% in soybean. The main benefit of the conventional tillage is a highly important decline of perennial weeds.

Essential oil products have both a direct and a fumigant effect on reducing serrated tussock seed germination	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Essential oil products derived from pine trees and oranges were assessed for germination effects on seeds of serrated tussock in a three-replicate randomised complete block Petri dish trial. The trial compared pine oil, orange oil and a commercial orange essential oil extract (Haulage-DC) applied at concentrations of 0%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, 1.25% 2.5% and 6.0% in direct and indirect (fumigant) dose response applications. The trial also assessed the fumigant effects of the pine oil on seed germination by periodically removing Petri dish seals at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after application. Compared with the untreated control, 0.25% or greater concentrations of essential oil products applied directly to serrated tussock seeds reduced germination by more than 90%. Fumigant effects of pine oil and orange oil products, but not Haulage-DC, reduced serrated tussock germination by 91% or more when applied at concentrations of 1.25% or above. An assessment of sequential opening of Petri dish seals to release pine oil vapours did not reveal any changes in seed germination, suggesting that vapour effects may occur within the first day of treatment. The results indicate that essential oils could be used to destroy seed banks of unpalatable grasses without the need to initiate the germination process in all seeds.				butler, kym L/D-5507-2014	butler, kym L/0000-0002-1958-3942												0028-8233	1175-8775					2015	58	4					454	462		10.1080/00288233.2015.1080172							WOS:000371317900009

The majority of these experiments were conducted on initially dried seeds. The desiccation and LN exposure tolerance of fresh P. avium seeds is unknown. In the present study, fresh seeds were used to determine seed response to desiccation and cryopreservation. Desiccation of seeds from a moisture content (MC) of 19.7-20.2% to 10.1-10.9% or 07.6-8.5% reduced seedling emergence from approximately 73 to 19 and 16% for first provenance; and from approximately 89 to 10-12% for second provenance of seeds. After exposure to LN, seeds had the highest seedling emergence when seed MC was the highest (19.7 and 20.2%, respectively) prior to cryostorage. Results indicated that P. avium seeds should be classified as intermediate. For cryopreservation in seed banks, we recommend that seeds be dried directly after extraction from fruits in the range of 16.8-20.2% of MC (0.21-0.25 g.g(-1) of WC) and directly immersed in LN in tightly closed cryovials.

Vegetation of the study site consists predominantly of tall sedges in most wet places, surrounded by abandoned drained wet meadows. Vegetation of oligotrophic water bodies quickly enveloped in dug pools. During our 2-year monitoring, continual successional change of vegetation was found, with the gradual infiltration of species from surrounding vegetation. Strong effect on the vegetation has also the fluctuating water level. We assume that in the long-term perspective, both the hydrological conditions and other restoration activities will be crucial for surviving of competitively weak endangered wetland species on the locality.

In this study, as no clear conclusions for Southern Baltic Region transitional maritime-continental climate and soil conditions have been reached to date, we investigated the interactions between maize and weeds in such technologies with low herbicide application levels. Toward this aim, a long-term field experiment was initiated at the Experimental Station of Aleksandras Stulginskis University, Kaunas district, Lithuania (54 degrees 52' N, 23 degrees 49'E) in 1988. The soil was ploughed to a depth of 22-25 cm (control) and 12-15 cm, cultivated to a depth of 25-30 and 10-12 cm or no-tilled. In deep-cultivated, shallow-cultivated and no-tilled plots, the residues covered 5.9, 5.7 and 13.2 times higher area of the soil surface than that in the control. The reduced primary and no-tillage conditions typically showed irradiance increases at the 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 altitudes of maize crop. Besides, more weed seeds were found in the upper 0-15 cm layer (60%) than in the deeper (15-25 cm) layer (40%). In the deep and shallow-cultivated plots, there were 2 and 3 times more perennial weeds than in the conventionally ploughed. At the end of the maize (Zea mays L.) vegetation, in the shallow-ploughed, deep and shallow-cultivated or no-tilled plots, there was 46, 40, 30 and 16 % greater weed stand density, whereas the dry mass of weeds decreased by 30, 22, 36 and 17 %, respectively. Weed infestation in the short season maize primarily depended on the soil coverage with pre-crop residues, the maize stand density, the maize canopy height and the solar radiation level over the soil surface.

The role of frugivorous birds and bats in the colonization of cloud forest plant species hi burned areas hi western Mexico	ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The role of frugivorous birds and bats in the colonization of cloud forest plant species in burned areas in western Mexico. The extension of montane cloud forests in western Mexico is threatened by several disturbances that limit their extension. In this study we aimed to assess the contribution of birds and bats in the dispersal and colonization of cloud forest plants in contiguous surface-burned pine forests. We sampled seed rain and sapling establishment over one year in two surface-burned sites, which differed in the size of their closest cloud forest patch. A total of 17 plant species were found, most of which were late-successional trees, shrubs and climbers. Distance influenced the seed rain of only one dispersed taxon (Solanum sp.) and had no effect on the sapling distribution of this or other plants. In turn, marked differences were found between sites, with more seeds dispersed and higher sapling density in the site that was next to the larger cloud forest patch. The role of long-distance dispersers and the existence of seed banks before fire could explain the little importance of distance from seed source on seed dispersal and sapling distribution. Nevertheless, dispersal by birds and bats before or after fire facilitates the regeneration and conservation of cloud forests in disturbed areas formerly occupied by other habitats.

SPECIAL ISSUE: Island Plant Biology-Celebrating Carlquist's Legacy	AOB PLANTS												The accumulation of seeds in the soil (the seedbank) can set the template for the early regeneration of habitats following disturbance. Seed dispersal is an important factor determining the pattern of seed rain, which affects the interactions those seeds experience. For this reason, seed dispersal should play an important role in structuring forest seedbanks, yet we know little about how that happens. Using the functional extirpation of frugivorous vertebrates from the island of Guam, together with two nearby islands (Saipan and Rota) that each support relatively intact disperser assemblages, we aimed to identify the role of vertebrate dispersers in structuring forest seedbanks. We sampled the seedbank on Guam where dispersers are absent, and compared this with the seedbank on Saipan and Rota where they are present. Almost twice as many species found in the seedbank on Guam, when compared with Saipan and Rota, had a conspecific adult within 2 m. This indicates a strong role of vertebrate dispersal in determining the identity of seeds in the seedbank. In addition, on Guam, a greater proportion of samples contained no seeds and overall species richness was lower than on Saipan. Differences in seed abundance and richness between Guam and Rota were less clear, as seedbanks on Rota also contained fewer species than Saipan, possibly due to increased post-dispersal seed predation. Our findings suggest that vertebrate seed dispersers can have a strong influence on the species composition of seedbanks. Regardless of post-dispersal processes, without dispersal, seedbanks no longer serve to increase the species pool of recruits during regeneration.																	2041-2851						2015	7				SI				plv130	10.1093/aobpla/plv130							WOS:000369028500001	26578741

Germination profile of selected plants from Mauritius - towards a conservation strategy	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Selected endemic Mauritian plants, Cossinia pinnata, Dracaena concinna, Erythroxylum sideroxyloides, Fernelia buxifolia and Lomatophyllum purpureum were assessed for germination based on the classification of embryo type, imbibition experiments, optimum temperature for germination (15 to 35 degrees C), light conditions and the use of germination promoters (butenolide and gibberellic acid, GA(3)). Germination was between 62 and 79%. Most species responded positively to germination promoting treatments, under both light and dark conditions. These results demonstrate that the five species are typical of tropical seeds. They do not express physical dormancy and have the ability to germinate over a very wide range of normal physical environmental factors. The present study can be used to optimise storage methods and enable effective seed banking of these threatened species.																	0251-0952	1819-5717					2015	43	3					536	540		10.15258/sst.2015.43.3.07							WOS:000369044700018

Knowledge of the reproductive ecology of the invasive Salix cinerea, in its invaded range, assists in more targeted management strategies	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Management for invasive species is expensive, costing millions of dollars every year and is sometimes unsuccessful. Current control efforts for the highly invasive willow species, Salix cinerea, are extensive, costly, and not always effective because of rapid post-removal reinfestation. An improved knowledge of the reproductive ecology of this species will help design control strategies that minimise future expansion and make current control efforts more effective. To explicitly examine the reproductive ecology of this species in its invaded range in south-eastern Australia, field observations of population structure and sex ratios, pollination experiments and germination trials were undertaken across the Ovens catchment in Victoria. Pollination-exclusion experiments strongly suggest that Salix cinerea in Australia employs two pollen-dispersal mechanisms, with insects being the dominant vector and wind playing a small but significant role (ambophilous). Seed had high initial germination rates, above 95%, but seed is very short-lived with rapid linear decline in germinability until 8 weeks, after which there was no germination at all. An improved understanding of the limited seed bank of this species and the potential it has for long distance pollination has highlighted that preventing reinfestation after control efforts should be focussed on limiting seed production and dispersal. A greater understanding of a species reproductive ecology, particularly of weed species, in their new environment can assist land managers to more effectively target their efforts for long-term eradication strategies.

Soil-Based Green Roofs	GREEN ROOF ECOSYSTEMS	Ecological Studies-Analysis and Synthesis											Although typically eschewed in favor of engineered substrate, natural soils can provide an important ecological benefit for green roof systems in terms of jump-starting a viable habitat. They can act as fungal and microbial inoculants and can serve as an additional source of plants and insects (via seed banks, eggs, and larvae), presumably of species that naturally coexist. Even when no longer biologically active, natural soils can still benefit roof systems by mimicking the mineral-based properties of the natural habitat of a particular plant palette. However, concerns of fine particle illuviation, increased roof loading, and unpredictable biological activity dampen use of natural soils on green roofs. This chapter discusses the pros and cons of natural soils versus engineered substrates and how their properties can affect green roof systems. A single case study is also presented of the soil-based green roof at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas in Fort Worth (USA) that used a mixed engineered substrate-natural living soil system to model a local short-grass limestone prairie barrens ecosystem.

Temperature and herbicide impacts on germination of water chestnut seeds	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Water chestnut (Trapa natans L.) is a nonnative, annual invasive species that has infested fresh water bodies in the eastern United States (US). Management techniques intended to control or eradicate water chestnut include mechanical or physical removal and herbicide treatments. Information is limited regarding the impact of lake drawdowns on the viability of water chestnut seeds as a complement to other control measures. Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of freezing and simulated drawdowns on the viability of fruit from water chestnut plants growing in herbicide-treated and nontreated areas. In a laboratory experiment, water chestnut fruit frozen in water for 35 d did not germinate. In 2 yr of mesocosm studies, simulated drawdowns did not have a significant influence on water chestnut seed germination, whereas fruit collected from areas treated with herbicide had a significantly different germination rate than those collected from untreated areas. In these studies, the mass of fruit collected from plants in areas treated with herbicide(s) (2,4-D, and/or glyphosate) was significantly less than fruit collected from plants growing in untreated areas. These data suggest that herbicide applications may have a greater or more consistent impact on water chestnut seed viability than lake drawdowns.																	0146-6623					JAN	2015	53						105	112									WOS:000367964700014

The new-born coastal wetland was formed in 1996, without any effects of human activities since then. Plant communities composed by herbaceous plants and few woody plants characterized the zonal distribution from the river to the sea. The herbaceous plants emerged from the river bank or the sea beach to the inner upland, while the woody plants changed with opposite trends. Most plants near the river were not halotolerant, while plants near the sea were mainly halophytes. Species richness and Shannon-Wiener index coincided with this similar trend. Species diversity in the upland was larger than that near the river or the sea. The upstream seed bank was responsible for vegetation species. In spite of stable water tables, salinity governed by the Bohai Sea tide and water-sediment regulation of the Yellow River had measurable effects on vegetation composition and distribution.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	12A					4465	4471									WOS:000367699100011						
J	Havrdova, A; Douda, J; Doudova, J				Havrdova, Alena; Douda, Jan; Doudova, Jana			Local topography affects seed bank successional patterns in alluvial meadows	FLORA												Seed banks may play a crucial role in the maintenance of community diversity, but their role on semi-natural grasslands, one of the most species rich habitats in Europe, is usually unexplored in population and community studies. We aim to clarify how local factors and topography influence seed bank successional patterns on semi-natural alluvial meadows. All 35 meadows were situated in the Eagle (Orlicke) Mountains in the Czech Republic and were divided according to fallow time. Paired plots, represented low and high topography, were established on each meadow. We recorded plant species occurrence in vegetation and in the seed bank to ascertain how seed abundance, diversity and the similarity between seed bank and vegetation were influenced by topography and management. Seed abundance significantly changed, whereas seed diversity remained stable after meadow abandonment. Seed abundance was high in the low topography plots probably due to higher aboveground biomass which promoted seed accumulation. In the high topography plots, seed abundance was low in managed meadows, but seeds were accumulated after abandonment. Similarity between the seed bank and vegetation was low, but over half of the typical meadow species survived in the seed bank for long periods of time, even when they had disappeared from the aboveground vegetation. In conclusion, the local topography of alluvial meadows influenced seed bank successional patterns, mainly seed abundance, similarity between the seed bank and vegetation and responses of individual species in the seed bank. Seed bank successional patterns are dependent on specific habitat conditions and communities with high seed bank accumulation are more stable and better restored than communities where the seed bank has become severely depleted.

S.; Kernich, Beckie			Temperature affects the dormancy and germination of sympatric annual (Oryza meridionalis) and perennial (O-rufipogon) native Australian rices (Poaceae) and influences their emergence in introduced para grass (Urochloa mutica) swards	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The seed biology of two ecologically and genetically important sympatric wild rice species from northern Australia was compared - perennial Oryza rufipogon Griff. and annual Oryza meridionalis N.Q.Ng. The aim was to determine mechanisms of dormancy exhibited at seed shed and to identify factors that trigger or inhibit germination. This information was used to investigate the ecology of in situ Oryza populations in introduced para grass swards (Urochloa mutica (Forssk.) T.Q. Nguyen) and to understand interactions between the two sympatric Oryza species. Primary dormancy in the two species is similar, namely, non-deep physiological dormancy, determined by external maternal structures and broken by warm temperature treatments equivalent to dry season soil temperatures. Light quality, smoke water, gibberellic acid and nitric acid treatments had minor influences on germination. Changes to the soil profile and aboveground biomass structure due to swards of U. mutica significantly affected emergence of O. meridionalis. Thus the influence of soil temperature explains the results of previous field studies in which biomass or litter on the soil surface prevented germination. This has implications for biodiversity management on monsoonal floodplains of northern Australia, where introduced pasture species produce greater biomass than native grasslands, reduce soil temperatures and are displacing native rices. There were differences between the Oryza species - dormancy was more quickly broken in annual O. meridionalis, reflecting the reduced need for investment in seed bank persistence for annual species in annually inundated and climatically reliable wetlands.

Since then, at the national level, there has not been any work on this scale relating to flora distribution, despite the obvious need for a better understanding. In 2011, in response to this need, the Federation des Conservatoires Botaniques Nationaux(2) (FCBN, http://www.fcbn.fr) launched an ambitious collaborative project involving eleven national botanical conservatories of France. The project aims to establish a formal procedure and standardized system for data hosting, aggregation and publication for four areas: flora, fungi, vegetation and habitats. In 2014, the first phase of the project led to the development of the national flora dataset: SIFlore. As it includes about 21 million records of flora occurrences, this is currently the most comprehensive dataset on the distribution of vascular plants (Tracheophyta) in the French territory. SIFlore contains information for about 15'454 plant taxa occurrences (indigenous and alien taxa) in metropolitan France and Reunion Island, from 1545 until 2014. The data records were originally collated from inventories, checklists, literature and herbarium records. SIFlore was developed by assembling flora datasets from the regional to the national level. At the regional level, source records are managed by the national botanical conservatories that are responsible for flora data collection and validation. In order to present our results, a geoportal was developed by the Federation des conservatoires botaniques nationaux that allows the SIFlore dataset to be publically viewed. This portal is available at: http://siflore.fcbn.fr. As the FCBN belongs to the Information System for Nature and Landscapes' (SINP), a governmental program, the dataset is also accessible through the websites of the National Inventory of Natural Heritage (http://www.inpn.fr) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (http://www.gbif.fr). SIFlore is regularly updated with additional data records. It is also planned to expand the scope of the dataset to include information about taxon biology, phenology, ecology, chorology, frequency, conservation status and seed banks. A map showing an estimation of the dataset completeness (based on Jackknife 1 estimator) is presented and included as a numerical appendix. Purpose: SIFlore aims to make the data of the flora of France available at the national level for conservation, policy management and scientific research. Such a dataset will provide enough information to allow for macro-cological reviews of species distribution patterns and, coupled with climatic or topographic datasets, the identification of determinants of these patterns. This dataset can be considered as the primary indicator of the current state of knowledge of flora distribution across France. At a policy level, and in the context of global warming, this should promote the adoption of new measures aiming to improve and intensify flora conservation and surveys.																	1314-2011	1314-2003					2015	56						47	60		10.3897/phytokeys.56.5723							WOS:000366694800003	26491386					
J	Nielsen, DL; Jasper, EW; Ning, N; Lawler, S				Nielsen, Daryl L.; Jasper, Elke Walburga; Ning, Nathan; Lawler, Susan			High sediment temperatures influence the emergence of dormant aquatic biota	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Under the influence of increasing air temperatures, dormant seeds of wetland plants and eggs of microfauna may be subjected to increased sediment temperatures that adversely affect their capacity to germinate or hatch, while the wetland is in its dry' phase. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate the influence of sediment temperature on the emergence capacity of dormant seeds and eggs. Dry wetland sediment was exposed to temperatures ranging from -180 to 150 degrees C. After re-wetting, the taxon richness and abundance of communities that developed were assessed. Both aquatic plants and microfauna emerged from the seed bank at sediment temperatures lower than 50 degrees C. However, the composition of the microfaunal community was altered once temperatures exceeded 40 degrees C and germination of aquatic plants ceased once temperatures exceeded 50 degrees C. These results suggest that changes to sediment temperature during the dry phase of wetlands may play an important role in influencing communities of wetland aquatic plants and microfauna. Modelled sediment temperature data indicated that minimum sediment temperature could exceed 40 degrees C for extended periods of time under existing climate-change scenarios by 2070. An increase in the occurrence and duration of such temperatures may threaten the abundance and diversity of wetland microfauna and aquatic-plant communities.

Developmental phenology of Persoonia longifolia (Proteaceae) and the impact of fire on these events	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Persoonia longifolia R.Br. is a common understorey tree that is difficult to re-establish following bauxite extraction and land restoration in parts of the jarrah forest of south-western Western Australia. To improve restoration outcomes for P. longifolia, understanding its phenology is vital for developing methods for returning this plant to rehabilitated areas. The present study investigated in detail different aspects of the phenology of P. longifolia over a 3-year-period. Most vegetative growth occurred during the summer months and flowering and fruiting occurred concurrently. Fruit matured from July through to September, at which time these dropped to the forest floor. Germination occurred in late winter-early spring from fruit that was at least 1-year old, with poor seedling survival in natural bush (<10%) during the first 12 months. Following fire, P. longifolia plants resprouted prolifically in the next growing season, although there was very little fruit production in the first year following fire. Fruit was not produced until at least the second year following a fire, and when dispersed, required at least another year in the soil seed bank before germination commenced (i.e. 3 years post-fire). Results from the present study will improve restoration outcomes for this species, by providing guidance on better seed-collection strategies and baseline information concerning growth rates under natural conditions that can then be used to assess performance of this species in restored environments.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2015	63	5					415	425		10.1071/BT14315							WOS:000363276500005

How does the seed fate of Crotalaria podocarpa DC, a highly competitive herbaceous legume in arid rangelands, contribute to its establishment probability?	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Plant recruitment can be constrained by processes shaping its seed fate, such as pre- and post-dispersal seed predation, while facilitated by higher seed production and more effective dispersal. These activities are controlled by specific predator and disperser guilds that respond to different microsite conditions such as vegetation density with varying predation and removal rates. In Namibia's arid rangelands, the native, annual herbaceous legume Crotalaria podocarpa has considerably increased after several years of elevated rainfall, thereby reducing density and vitality of economically important fodder grasses. To investigate whether this proliferation entails the risk of a permanent establishment, we studied pre- and post-dispersal seed predation, as well as primary and secondary seed dispersal of the legume and quantified the impact of different predator groups on post-dispersal seed removal. We experimentally excluded (i) neither vertebrates nor invertebrates, (ii) birds, (iii) vertebrates (birds and rodents), and (iv) vertebrates and large invertebrates on plots with different C. podocarpa density (0-35% cover). Seed predation was mainly caused by invertebrates, with 30% pre-dispersal seed predation in pods and up to 90% post-dispersal seed removal for free seeds on the ground which is the most persistent seed stage. C. podocarpa density did not affect post-dispersal seed removal or secondary seed dispersal. As main dispersal mode for the study species explosive dehiscence was identified, with seeds reaching dispersal distances of up to 4 m, while wind or rolling dispersal played a minor role. Subsequent secondary dispersal by animals accounted for dispersal distances up to 19m. Our findings highlight the combined effects of pre- and post-dispersal seed predation to determine the total seed fate. With a contribution of about 370 seeds m(-2) to the species persistent soil seed bank, seed numbers seems to be more important for C podocarpas vagility than the species dispersal ability. Supplemented by seedling fate and adult mortality, this data can contribute to reliably predict the risk of a further spread of the species. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

Effects of maternal environmental factors on physical dormancy of Astragalus nitidiflorus seeds (Fabaceae), a critically endangered species of SE Spain	FLORA												The viability and seed dormancy of the critically endangered species Astragalus nitidiflorus were tested during eight consecutive years (2006-2013) in order to determine if the high physical seed dormancy described in a previous study is affected by annual or seasonal environmental conditions. Also, the effects of maternal factors - such as fruit position in the inflorescence or seed position in the fruit, the age of the mother plants, and water stress - on seed viability and dormancy were tested. In order to determine the variation in the degree of germinability between years, ripe seeds were harvested each July from 2006 to 2013 and their viability and dormancy were tested. Moreover, in 2013 new seeds were collected to check the effects of the maternal factors mentioned above. A trial with potted plant in greenhouse was performed to corroborate the observed field data about the effect of water stress suffered by the mother plant on seed dormancy. The results show a high variability over the years in the physical dormancy of A. nitidiflorus seeds because maternal environmental factors such as drought or mother plant age influence the proportion of seeds that enter dormancy. This in turn determines the proportion of seed that becomes part of the seed bank each year and also the age structure of the natural population. The conservation programs for this critically endangered species should consider these results to implement measures to prevent the extinction of the species. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Two years later, the stand (increased to more than 160 individuals in the meantime) was re-visited, phytosociological survey was made, and four soil cores (5 cm deep and 80 cm(2) surface area, each) were taken for seed bank studies. The phytosociological sampling revealed 28 co-occurring vascular species, most of them representing hemicryptophyte and geophyte life forms. According to Ellenberg's values, the species pool indicated sunny (L7 and L8 species dominating) and semi-dry (mainly F4 species) habitat for the common ragweed population, whereas Zarzycki's soil granulometric data reflected coarse-grained soil. Albedo of the soil was lower than that of the vegetation thus sparsely vegetated sites were considered as heat accumulating microhabitats that might support establishment of the thermophilic A. artemisiifolia. During soil seed bank analysis a high number of naturally opened fruits (dehiscent achenes) were found (718.75 per m(2)) most probably indicating frequent germination in previous years. Greenhouse germination tests proved successful germination of 125 individuals per m(2), which was considered enough to maintain the A. artemisiifolia stand at the station. The results call attention to a newly discovered, established population with increasing demography of A. artemisiifolia, a highly allergenic introduced weed of Poland.

POLISH POLAR RESEARCH												The embryology of two species, Deschampsia antarctica, a native species, and Poa annua, an alien species in the Antarctic we studied. Flowering buds of plants growing in their natural habitats on King George Island and generative tissues of both plant species grown in a greenhouse were analyzed. Adaptations to autogamy and anemogamy were observed in the flower anatomy of both species. The microsporangia of the evaluated grasses produce a small number of three-celled pollen grains. Numerous pollen grains do not leave the microsporangium and germinate in the thecae. Deschampsia antarctica and P. annua plants harvested in Antarctica developed a particularly small number of microspores in pollen chambers. In D. antarctica, male gametophytes were produced at a faster rate: generative cells in pollen did not become detached from the wall of the pollen grain, they were not embedded in the cytoplasm of vegetative cells, and they divided into two sperm cells situated close to the wall. The monosporous Polygonum type of embryo sac development was observed in the studied species. The egg apparatus had typical polarization, and the filiform apparatus did not develop in synergids. Large antipodals with polyploidal nuclei were formed in the embryo sacs of D. antarctica and P. annua. Poa annua was characterized by numerous antipodal cells which formed antipodal tissue in the chalazal region of the embryo sac. Three distinct antipodals with atypical, lateral position in the vicinity of the egg apparatus were observed in D. antarctica. The diaspores of the investigated grass species were characterized by small size, low weight and species-specific primary and secondary sculpture of the testa and caryopsis coat.

J	Freund, L; Carrillo, J; Storm, C; Schwabe, A				Freund, Linda; Carrillo, Jimena; Storm, Christian; Schwabe, Angelika			Restoration of a newly created inland-dune complex as a model in practice: impact of substrate, minimized inoculation and grazing	TUEXENIA												In Central Europe stands of the Koelerion glaucae vegetation complex are threatened and mostly highly fragmented. Knowledge about the impact of abiotic and biotic measures to restore this vegetation complex is crucial. Therefore, an inland sand dune complex (around 2 ha) was created in 2009 as a study model in the Upper Rhine Valley (Germany), which included sites with different substrate conditions as well as grazing impact and minimized inoculation with plant material. The restoration area is divided into two halves with different substrate conditions (sites 1 and 2), on which inoculation with raked plant material and grazing by donkeys was studied on systematically arranged plots with randomised treatment distribution (32 plots). Additionally the whole area was monitored by a grid-plot approach to show the floristic background (43 plots). Minimized inoculation was conducted with rare Koelerion glaucae plant material in small plots covering around 5-7% of the restoration sites. During the four-year study, vegetation development was recorded and examined in relation to the donor site and an older restoration site. Soil seed bank and seed rain in the newly deposited restoration sites were also investigated, as well as the endozoochorous seed-dispersal by donkeys. Target species ratios (TSR) were calculated to estimate the restoration success. We used mixed linear models and detrended correspondence analysis for data evaluation. Substrate conditions had an impact on the number of target species and on phanerogam and cryptogam cover. Inoculation enhanced both number and, without grazing, cover of target species since the first year. On not-inoculated plots and on grid-plots, target-species numbers increased gradually. Grazing by donkeys did not affect target-species numbers, but had a decreasing effect on target-species cover. Grazing reduced bryophyte cover, especially on inoculated plots. DCA revealed development of the experimental plots towards the donor site, as has occurred on the older restoration site. Soil seed bank and seed rain were characterized by ruderal species, and did not show similarities to the donor site. Endozoochory revealed some target species to be effectively dispersed by donkeys. Minimized inoculation is suitable to overcome seed limitation and build up starter populations of target species for the colonization of larger restoration sites. However, within four years species composition of the donor site was not achieved. Grazing by donkeys had mainly structural effects for the studied time period.																	0722-494X						2015		35					221	248									WOS:000362046000010

In general, these experiments provided evidence that emergence of canola was low when sown as seed rain or seed bank with multispecies sod and was significantly (p < 0.001) lower the second year after sod was laid. Experiment B results indicated the reinforcement materials did significantly (p < 0.05) further decrease canola emergence in Experiment B-2 (2007). Of the emerged seedlings survival to maturation the vegetative biomass and the seed biomass of these plants was significantly affected by water regime for both the A and B experiments. In contrast, in the reinforcement (B) experiments water regime did not affect survival but the presence of the material increased the proportion of surviving plants. These experiments indicated that multispecies sod could be used as an alternative roadside revegetation technique. It established and survived without supplemental water and reduced weed emergence and survival.																			978-1-60595-247-5				2015							83	92									WOS:000361108400010

Long-term forage dynamics in pastures sprayed with residual broadleaf herbicide: A test of legume recovery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Legumes such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) are important components of northern temperate pastures where they increase forage productivity and quality, but are susceptible to decline when exposed to broadleaf herbicides. Little is known about the long-term sward responses following herbicide use in northern temperate pastures, including the recovery of legumes and their subsequent contribution to forage production. We established five field sites over 2 yr to assess changes in grass, legume, total forage (grass + legume) and other forb biomass, as well as the recovery of a common weed, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber), for up to 3 yr following a single application of two broad leaf herbicides with residual properties (aminopyralid and aminocyclopyrachlor). The importance of defoliation and the legume seed bank in facilitating legume biomass recovery were also evaluated with mowing and legume overseeding, respectively, in a strip/split-split design. Both herbicides had similar functional impacts on sward composition based on peak annual biomass, reducing legume biomass by an average of 71-100% across the 3 yr, equivalent to 63.4-22.6 g m(-2) from year 1 to year 3, respectively. Although grass biomass did not change significantly with herbicides, net reductions in total forage were limited to 6.8% (28 gm(-2)) over the study, suggesting at least some ability of grasses to compensate for legume removal. Legume biomass was greater following overseeding and only in non-sprayed controls, but then decreased over time. Conversely, biomass of other forbs and cover of dandelion were lower shortly following herbicide application, only to reach levels similar to non-sprayed controls by the second growing season. Defoliation also influenced sward composition, favoring dandelion recovery following herbicide application. As both weed control and legume re-establishment are important objectives for livestock producers, the result of this study provides useful insight into the long-term impact of broad-leaf weed control on forage production in mixed swards of northern temperate pastures.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				JAN	2015	95	1					43	53		10.4141/CJPS-2014-225							WOS:000360990200005						
J	Cabrera, E; Hepp, J; Gomez, M; Contreras, S				Cabrera, Elisa; Hepp, Josefina; Gomez, Miguel; Contreras, Samuel			Seed dormancy of Nolana jaffuelii IMJohnst. (Solanaceae) in the coastal Atacama Desert	FLORA												Nolana (Solanaceae) is a genus composed of 88 species that inhabit arid and semi-arid environments throughout the Atacama Desert of Chile and Peru, and one from Galapagos Islands. Its greatest diversity is found in coastal localities, termed lomas formations, which are small isolated patches of vegetation sustained by the presence of low cloud layers. Alto Patache corresponds to one of these ecosystems, and Nolana jaffuelii I.M. Johnst., a summer annual herb, is the most abundant species in its persistent seed bank. Little is known about the seed germination requirements of this and other species present in Chilean lomas formations, despite the importance of that knowledge for taking appropriate conservation actions. The main objective of this study was to identify the germination requirements and possible dormancy mechanisms of N. jaffuelll's dispersal units, which are mericarps. Mature mericarps of N. jaffuelii were collected at Alto Patache. Histological analyses of cross and longitudinal sections of the mericarps suggested the presence of physical dormancy imposed by an impermeable pericarp. Different germination treatments were also evaluated: (T1) control, i.e., intact mericarps imbibed in water; (T2) intact mericarps washed under running water; (13) scarified mericarps (cut at the funicular scar) imbibed in water; (T4) scarified mericarps imbibed in gibberellic acid (500 mg l(-1) GA(3)); (T5) scarified mericarps imbibed in water with 2 weeks of stratification at 4 degrees C; and (T6) intact mericarps imbibed in GA(3). Only mericarps cut at the funicular scar were able to germinate, and the highest germination percentage was observed when the mericarps were imbibed in GA(3) (T4). The results of this investigation reveal the existence of physical and physiological dormancy in N. jaffuelii propagules, an adaptation that would allow this species to spend long periods waiting for favorable conditions for seedling establishment, which is characteristic of the coastal lomas formations of the Atacama Desert.

Growth and reproductive post-fire responses of two shrubs in semiarid Patagonian grasslands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Variation in fire intensity affects the post-fire survival and growth of shrubs. We examined effects of maximum fire temperature (a proxy for fire intensity) on the survival, growth and reproductive performance of the shrubs Mulinum spinosum and Senecio bracteolatus at 1 and 2 years post-fire in north-west Patagonian grasslands. We applied two fire temperature treatments to plants of each species. All M. spinosum plants survived fire treatments but high fire temperature notably decreased survival of S. bracteolatus. Bud position and plant architecture probably influenced shrub survival. During the first growing season, M. spinosum did not produce seeds whereas S. bracteolatus plants burned at low temperature produced three times more seeds and bigger seeds than unburned plants. Also, seeds from burned plants of S. bracteolatus had higher germinability than seed from unburned plants. High survival and resprouting capacity of M. spinosum even after high fire intensity indicate that this species might be less affected by changes in fire regime.																	1049-8001	1448-5516					2015	24	6					809	818		10.1071/WF14134							WOS:000360413100007						
B	Lehnebach, CA		Stow, A; Maclean, N; Holwell, GI		Lehnebach, Carlos A.			A garden at the edge of the world; the diversity and conservation status of the New Zealand flora	AUSTRAL ARK: THE STATE OF WILDLIFE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND												After drifting away from Gondawana, the land that we presently know as New Zealand went through several geological events such as the Oligocene drowning, the upheaval of the Southern Alps and several glacial-interglacial periods. These events have dramatically shaped New Zealand's flora and fauna, causing the extinction of some lineages but also promoting speciation and ecological diversification in others. Nowadays, the New Zealand vascular flora includes over 2230 species; most of them endemic (c. 80%). Despite being one of the last places on the world to be reached by people, damage to its native flora and fauna has been significant. Currently, over 38% of the native vascular flora is of conservation concern and six species became extinct. The main threats to New Zealand plants are habitat destruction, herbivory, competition from weeds and the disruption of ecological interactions. Birds are important pollinators and seed dispersers in New Zealand so a decline in their number, caused by the introduction of mammalian predators, has severely damaged plant-bird interactions and the effects of reproduction and dispersal failure are already being noticed. The spread of introduced plant pathogens is also a threat to native plants and their effect on native trees, in particular, is a matter of current concern. Preservation of New Zealand's flora is a matter of national and international relevance and many initiatives are working towards this goal. Examples include: habitat protection and restoration, conservation by cultivation, and establishment of seed banks. Future research, however, should focus on the autoecology of threatened plants, particularly in those species that depend on mutualistic interactions. This research will help to maximise resources allocated to their conservation and secure their survival and functioning in the long term.																			978-1-107-03354-2				2015							240	258									WOS:000357107100014

Ecological restoration projects took place all over Europe. Their success has traditionally been assessed using a plant community approach. However, population ecology can also be useful to assess restoration success and to understand underlying mechanisms. Methods - We took advantage of three calcareous grassland sites in Southern Belgium, where reference parcels coexist with parcels restored in the late twentieth century and with more recently restored parcels. We evaluated the colonization stage of three specialist species (Sanguisorba minor, Potentilla neumanniana and Hippocrepis comosa) using occurrence data. We also measured the reproductive traits of 120 individuals per species and compared components of fitness between recent restorations, old restorations and reference habitats. Key results - We found that the occurrence of H. comosa was similar in the different restoration classes, whereas both P. neumanniana and S. minor occurrences decreased from reference grasslands to recent restorations. In contrast, these two latter species exhibited a much higher reproductive output in recent restorations, thanks to an increased production of Rowers and seeds. Conclusions - Our results suggest that, during colonization of recently restored calcareous grasslands, favourable environmental conditions, low competition and sufficient genetic mixing may lead to an increased fitness of individuals and a faster population growth than in the reference habitat. These results demonstrate how population processes can increase ecological resilience and highlight the interest of a population-based approach to assess the success of ecological restoration.

Reproductive biology of Pentadesma butyracea (Clusiaceae), source of a valuable non timber forest product in Benin	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - The main reproductive traits of the native African food tree species, Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (Clusiaceae), which is threatened in Benin and Togo, were examined in Benin to gather basic data necessary to develop conservation strategies in these countries. Methodology - Data were collected on phenological pattern, floral morphology, pollinator assemblage, seed production and germination conditions on 77 adult individuals from three natural populations occurring in the Sudanian phytogeographical zone. Key results - In Benin, Pentadesma butyracea flowers once a year during the dry season from September to December. Flowering entry displayed less variation among populations than among individuals within populations. However, a high synchrony of different floral stages between trees due to a long flowering period (c. 2 months per tree), might still facilitate pollen exchange. Pollen-ovule ratio was 577 213 suggesting facultative xenogamy. The apical position of inflorescences, the yellowish to white greenish flowers and the high quantity of pollen and nectar per flower (1042 +/- 117 mu L) represent floral attractants that predispose the species to animal-pollination. The main pollinators were two sunbirds (Cyanomitra verticalis, Cinnyris coccinigastrus) and three Hymenoptera (Apis mellifera, Meliponula togoensis, Hypotrigona sp.). Mean fruit set reached 49%, and absolute fruit production increased with tree size. Seeds were desiccation-sensitive (i.e. recalcitrant) with a maximum duration of hydrated storage of three months. Germination of seeds was most successful and rapid at 30 degrees C (50% after nine days). Conclusions - Our results indicate that the natural reproduction of P. butyracea is not limited by its ecology so that we hypothesize anthropogenic activities to be the reason for the threatened status of P. butyracea in Benin and Togo. However, due to its recalcitrant seeds, the conservation of its genetic resources is not feasible through ex situ conservation of seed banks but in situ strategies and/or ex situ conservation in orchards should be successful.																	2032-3913	2032-3921					2015	148	2					213	228		10.5091/plecevo.2015.998							WOS:000358462600007

Post-release fates of seeds in dehiscent and indehiscent siliques of the diaspore heteromorphic species Diptychocarpus strictus (Brassicaceae)	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Fruit/seed heteromorphic plants have been studied most extensively for differences in dispersal and germination of the morphs. However, fates of the heteromorphic diaspores beginning with seed release and ending with germination/seed death have been documented for relatively few species. Our primary aim was to follow the fates of the two dispersal unit morphs of Diptychocarpus strictus over a several-year period or until they germinated or died. Our hypothesis was that the winged, mucilaginous seeds (dispersal unit) from the dehiscent upper siliques form a short-lived seed bank and the nearly-wingless, nonmucilaginous seeds inside the indehiscent lower siliques (dispersal unit) a long-lived seed bank. Thus, for the two morphs we monitored phenology of seed release in 2010, germination phenology from 2010 to 2014 and germination and survival during burial in soil from 2010 to 2012. All lower siliques had been released from mother plants by late July, whereas seed release of the winged seeds of upper siliques was not completed until late October, after the main stem had become detached (near the base). Most seeds (18%) from upper siliques that did so (c. 20%) germinated in spring 2011, whereas no seeds in lower siliques germinated until autumn 2011 (0.2%). All seeds from upper siliques had germinated or lost viability by the end of the autumn 2012 germination season, whereas 11% of seeds inside lower siliques germinated in autumn 2014 and a high proportion of the nongerminated seeds was still viable, thus supporting our hypothesis. Buried seeds of both morphs exhibited a 6-mo dormancy cycle in which the nondormant phase coincided with the two germination seasons. Dehiscence of the upper siliques and indehiscence of the lower siliques are required for D. strictus to have a high risk-low risk strategy (H/H-L/L) for diaspore dispersal and dormancy.

However, only a low germination percentage has been achieved to date. A population of Hypericurn philonotis (Cham. & Schlecht.) grows every 2 or 5 years in the Parque Ecologico de la Ciudad de Mexico (PECM). To understand seed germination and the population dynamics of H. philonotis in the PECM, we studied their seed germination to identify the dormancy type. We assessed the effect on germination of light, constant temperatures (5-35 degrees C) and fluctuating (25/35 degrees C, 18/6 h, with the highest temperature at noon, photoperiod 12/12), cold stratification, scarification (with HCl); gibberellins and seed immersion in acetone or hexane. We also studied the morphology and structure of the seeds, and the allelopathic potential of the pigments present in the seed coat on its own seed germination and early seedling growth. Light, gibberellins, a combination of temperature with gibberellins, and immersion in acetone increased seed germination. Alternating temperatures replaced the effect of gibberellins. Immersion in acetone eliminated a pigment from the seed coat, enhancing full seed germination. The acetone extract from H. philonotis seeds partially inhibited seed germination and early growth. The endosperm was reduced, and the main reserve in cotyledons was proteins. The H. philonotis seeds exhibited physiological dormancy. Gibberellins increased the embryo growth potential, reducing the constraint of the thick seed cover and any inhibiting effect of the acetone extract. The requirement of light and temperature fluctuation acts as an environmental cue for the successful germination of these minuscule seeds (0.5-0.8 mm in length). (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study, we analyzed phenological and reproductive data at the plant and population levels of the narrow endemic Anchusa littorea Moris, an endangered annual plant species growing in a few small patches at the Is Arenas dune system (SW Sardinia, Italy). Individuals from the main 2 patches were evaluated during a 4-year study period: plants were monitored on a monthly basis in each reproductive phenophase. To assess phenological variability within and among populations, an approach based on the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the Morisita-Horn similarity index was applied. The seed output and the soil seed bank were also investigated in order to analyze the reproductive capacity of this plant species. Anchusa littorea showed a long flowering season and a high flowering synchrony between patches, which contrasted with a low within-patch synchrony. The seed production per plant was low and the species did not create a soil seed bank. Population size was characterized by considerable annual fluctuations: a significant migration occurred for A. littorea plants inside the dune system over the years. These results demonstrate the importance of the phenological pattern on the knowledge of the reproductive ecology of endangered coastal plant species and will contribute to orient management and conservation efforts.

Comparison of chemical composition and biological activities of Seseli rigidum fruit essential oils from Serbia	OPEN CHEMISTRY												Plants from genus Seseli, have been widely used in European traditional medicine, exhibiting antibacterial, antifungal, insect repellent, emmenogogue, antiflatulence, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anti-tumor, antirheumatic activities and protective effect on human lymphocytes DNA. They usually grow on mountain rocky terrains. Part of their habitat on Vidlic Mountain, located in South-east Serbia, was struck with a large wildfire. Seseli rigidum fruit essential oils (from post fire and control areas) compositions were analyzed by GC and GC-MS, identifying monoterpenes alpha-pinene and sabinene as most abundant. Statistical tests showed a non-significant difference in chemical composition of these two oils, but a significant difference in comparison with the herb from a geographically different origin. Antimicrobial tests showed strong activities of the oils against tested bacteria, thus confirming its administration in various inflammation processes as a quite effective remedy. Applying DPPH center dot and ABTS(+)center dot radical scavenging and total reducing Fe(III) to Fe(II) power assays, antioxidant characteristics of both studied essential oils were estimated as weak, though of close values. Seseli rigidum fruit essential oil was proven as a potent inhibitor of human and horse serum cholinesterase, recognizing its possible application as neural protective agent.

K. Koch	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Some broom species have the ability to modify elements of the fire regime in invaded areas. One such species, Teline monspessulana (Syn. Genista monspessulana; French Broom), has expanded notoriously in south-central Chile's Mediterranean climate. The biota of this area may be particularly vulnerable to effects of invasive species on the fire regime, as it is less adapted to wildfires. The properties of the fuel accumulated in T. monspessulana populations of different ages are characterised in this paper. For this, models were constructed to estimate fuel accumulation in T. monspessulana populations, and tests for flammability of foliage were also performed. The results show that the rapid growth of this invasive shrub ensures a significant accumulation of fuel (close to 90 ton ha(-1)) in periods shorter than a decade, which may influence the severity of wildfires. Further, the fuel has a significant accumulation of fine material and high flammability, both of which may facilitate the ignition of fires. The large volume and high flammability of the fuel accumulated in T. monspessulana populations can thus play an important role in changing the fire regime in areas where it has invaded.

Seed bank longevity and age to reproductive maturity of Calotropis procera (Aiton) WT Aiton in the dry tropics of northern Queensland	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Understanding the reproductive biology of Calotropis procera (Aiton) W.T. Aiton, an invasive weed of northern Australia, is critical for development of effective management strategies. Two experiments are reported on. In Experiment 1 seed longevity of C. procera seeds, exposed to different soil type (clay and river loam), pasture cover (present and absent) and burial depth (0, 2.5, 10 and 20 cm) treatments were examined. In Experiment 2 time to reach reproductive maturity was studied. The latter experiment included its sister species, C. gigantea (L.) W.T. Aiton, for comparison and two separate seed lots were tested in 2009 and 2012 to determine if exposure to different environmental conditions would influence persistence. Both seed lots demonstrated a rapid decline in viability over the first 3 months and declined to zero between 15 and 24 months after burial. In Experiment 1, longevity appeared to be most influenced by rainfall patterns and associated soil moisture, burial depth and soil type, but not the level of pasture cover. Experiment 2 showed that both C. procera and C. gigantea plants could flower once they had reached an average height of 85 cm. However, they differed significantly in terms of basal diameter at first flowering with C. gigantea significantly smaller (31 mm) than C. procera (45 mm). On average, C. gigantea flowered earlier (125 days vs 190 days) and set seed earlier (359 days vs 412 days) than C. procera. These results suggest that, under similar conditions to those that prevailed in the present studies, land managers could potentially achieve effective control of patches of C. procera in 2 years if they are able to kill all original plants and treat seedling regrowth frequently enough to prevent it reaching reproductive maturity. This suggested control strategy is based on the proviso that replenishment of the seed bank is not occurring from external sources (e.g. wind and water dispersal).

J	Rangel, JHD; Gardiner, CP; Burt, RL				de Albuquerque Rangel, Jose Henrique; Gardiner, Christopher Peter; Burt, Robert Lewis			DORMANCY RELEASING MECHANISMS IN SOIL SEED BANKS OF Desmanthus GENOTYPES	REVISTA CAATINGA												Desmanthus is a genus of forage legumes with potential to improve pastures and livestock production on clay soils of dry tropical and subtropical regions such as the existing in Brazil and Australia. Despite this patterns of natural or enforced after-ripening of Desmanthus seeds have not been well established. Four year old seed banks of nine Desmanthus genotypes at James Cook University were accessed for their patterns of seed softening in response to a range of temperatures. Persistent seed banks were found to exist under all of the studied genotypes. The largest seeds banks were found in the genotypes CPI 78373 and CPI 78382 and the smallest in the genotypes CPI's 37143, 67643, and 83563. An increase in the percentage of softened seeds was correlated with higher temperatures, in two patterns of response: in some accessions seeds were not significantly affected by temperatures below 80 degrees C; and in others, seeds become soft when temperature rose to as little as 60 degrees C. At 80 degrees C the heat started to depress germination. High seed production of Desmanthus associated with dependence of seeds on elevated temperatures to softening can be a very important strategy for plants to survive in dry tropical regions.																	0100-316X	1983-2125					2015	28	1					90	99									WOS:000353711000010						
J	Wallace, JM; Pavek, PLS; Prather, TS				Wallace, John M.; Pavek, Pamela L. S.; Prather, Timothy S.			Ecological Characteristics of Ventenata dubia in the Intermountain Pacific Northwest	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Ventenata dubia is an exotic winter annual grass that has invaded Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands, improved pastures, intensively managed hay fields, and rangelands within the Intermountain Pacific Northwest (PNW). Currently, producers are attempting to develop V. dubia management strategies with little knowledge of its life history traits. We conducted several studies to characterize V. dubia life history patterns. Preliminary germination trials were completed to describe primary and secondary dormancy characteristics. Field studies were conducted to evaluate (1) seed bank persistence patterns, (2) seedling emergence patterns under V. dubia litter, and (3) seedling emergence and phenological development patterns within timothy hay, CRP, and rangeland habitats. Preliminary germination trials suggest that the after-ripening period required for loss of dormancy does not exceed 30 d and that dormancy breakdown peaks at approximately 90 d, after which germination occurs over a wide range of temperatures (9 to 29 C). A small fraction (< 1%) of the seed bank remained germinable up to 3 yr after burial at 2 cm depth in a grassland habitat. Seedling emergence and survival was significantly greater under high V. dubia litter layers (100% cover) compared with bare surface during the drier study year because of higher soil moisture levels maintained under litter. Across habitat types, mean seedling emergence (50% of total) occurred between 33 and 94 growing degree days (GDD) after soil moisture rose above the permanent wilting point in the fall. Seedling emergence periodicity varied among habitat types in relation to spring seedling emergence, ranging from 0 to 13% of total emergence per year. Phenological development differed across sites and years by up to several hundred GDDs but was closely aligned to Julian days. This collection of studies improves our understanding of V. dubia life history traits and will aid integrated weed management strategies in the Intermountain PNW.

J	Cobar-Carranza, AJ; Garcia, RA; Pauchard, A; Pena, E				Cobar-Carranza, Ana J.; Garcia, Rafael A.; Pauchard, Anibal; Pena, Eduardo			Effects of high temperatures in the germination and seed survival of the invasive species Pinus contorta and two native species of South Chile	BOSQUE												Studies in South America have reported increments of invasivity of Pinus spp. after fire events. These increments are due to morphological and physiological adaptations to wildfires that some species of this specific genus presents. Pinus contorta is an invasive species in temperate ecosystems, affecting Araucaria araucana and Nothofagus antarctica forests in Malalcahuello National Reserve, Chile. In order to comprehend the regeneration response to post-fire, it is necessary to know the response and tolerance of the seeds to high temperatures. Seeds of P. contorta, A. araucana and N. antarctica were sown in pots with sand and subsequently heated at 80, 100 and 120 degrees C for five minutes. Germination and seedling survival tests were carried out in a greenhouse. Germination in N. antarctica was null. Heat treatments did not have a negative effect on the germination of P. contorta, but they did on A. araucana inhibiting the germination at temperatures over 100 degrees C. These results suggest that when undergoing a fire of high intensity, P. contorta has a competitive advantage over A. araucana and N. antarctica; the seed bank would have more possibilities to survive the effects of a wildfire.

J	Bertiller, MB; Carrera, AL				Beatriz Bertiller, Monica; Lorena Carrera, Analia			Aboveground Vegetation and Perennial Grass Seed Bank in Arid Rangelands Disturbed by Grazing	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Recruitment by seeds can be an important mechanism for recovery of plant communities following disturbance. Our objective was to assess the density and spatial patterning of perennial grass (highly preferred by herbivores) seeds in litter patches at locations with different aboveground vegetation structure in sites with different grazing history characteristic of the Patagonian Monte (Argentina). We asked whether structural differences in aboveground vegetation are reflected in the density and spatial patterning of perennial grass seeds in litter patches. We selected two study sites characteristic of the Patagonian Monte and within them three locations representing different vegetation states, resulting from different combinations of grazing and/or release from grazing history. At each location, we assessed the density of perennial grass seeds in litter patches at microsites beneath plant patches (canopy) and in interpatch areas without or with scattered vegetation (bare soil) at three dates during the reproductive and seed dispersal periods. The density of perennial grass seeds in litter patches was greater at canopy than at bare soil microsites, and the number of litter patches without seeds increased with decreasing total plant cover at both microsites. The density of perennial grass seeds in litter patches did not vary with differences in total plant cover or litter patch attributes at canopy microsites, while it was reduced with decreasing total plant cover at bare soil microsites. We concluded that differences in aboveground plant cover differentially affected the density of perennial grass seeds in litter patches at contrasting soil microsites. Thus potential microsites for perennial grass recruitment by seeds would increase from litter patches at bare soil microsites to litter patches at canopy microsites at locations with high and low aboveground plant cover, respectively. These issues should be considered for the sustainable management of these rangelands. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The mission of the SOS is to collect wildland native seed for long-term germ-plasm conservation and for use in seed research, development of native plant materials, and ecosystem restoration. Each year about 50 SOS teams are stationed across the United States to make seed collections following a single technical protocol. SOS collections are divided into a long-term conservation storage collection, which is stored at multiple USDA Agricultural Research Service seed storage facilities, and a working collection, which is stored at partner institutions and made available for research. In addition to collecting and banking native species for future uses. SOS provides seed that can be increased to provide genetically appropriate plant materials for ecological restoration of disturbed lands. Seed collection is an efficient and cost-effective method for conserving the diversity of plant species into the future. Partners located throughout the United States are critical to the success of this program.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JAN	2015	35	1					165	173		10.3375/043.035.0118							WOS:000351425000018						
J	Mesquita, MLR; de Andrade, LA; Pereira, WE				Ribeiro Mesquita, Mario Luiz; de Andrade, Leonaldo Alves; Pereira, Walter Esfrain			Soil weed seed bank in situ and ex situ at a smallholder field in Maranhao State, northeastern Brazil	ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY												The objective of this research was to assess the density, floristic composition, phytosociology and diversity of a soil weed seed bank ex situ by germination in a greenhouse and in situ by weed sampling on a smallholder corn field located in Lago Verde County, Maranhao State. Fifteen pairs of 25 m(2) plots were designated. In half of these plots, 90 soil samples were collected with an open metal template measuring 25 x 16 x 3 cm and placed in a greenhouse to germinate. In the other half, 90 weed samples were collected using the same metal template. We recorded a total of 1,998 individuals from 40 species, 31 genera and 16 families, from which 659 individuals germinated in situ and 1,339 ex situ. Density was higher ex situ, with 372 plants m(-2). The Cyperaceae family had the highest floristic richness with nine species, followed by the Poaceae with six. The dominant species based on the Importance Value Index were Lindernia crustacea (IVI 27.7%) in situ and Scleria lithosperma (IVI 37.0%) ex situ. Floristic diversity was higher ex situ, with H' = 2.66 nats ind(-1). These results could help predict infestation potential and could lead to improved weed management strategies in corn-growing areas on smallholdings in Maranhao State, northeastern Brazil.

However, due to practical limitations, most studies assess genetic variation using neutral markers while the variability of evolutionary relevant quantitative traits is typically overlooked. Here, we simultaneously assessed neutral and quantitative variation in an endangered plant to identify the mechanism behind their spatial arrangement and to propose conservation guidelines for maximizing mid- to long-term survival. Omphalodes littoralis subsp. gallaecica is a self-fertilizing therophyte with an extremely narrow and fragmented distribution. Regardless of the marker set (non-coding sequences of cpDNA or Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism loci), the five extant populations of O. littoralis subsp. gallaecica showed minimal to none neutral genetic diversity and a lack of gene flow between them. Moreover, genetic structure was identical in samples collected on two consecutive years suggesting that the seed bank cannot buffer against genetic loss. High rates of self-fertilization together with a strongly fragmented distribution and recurrent bottlenecks seem the likely mechanisms that may have led to a dramatic loss of genetic variation in a classic scenario drawn by genetic drift. Despite the extremely narrow distribution range, reciprocal transplant experiments revealed that the populations differed in several quantitative traits and that these differences likely have a genetic basis. Nevertheless, the pattern of differences among populations did not fit the expectations of local adaptation. Instead, phenotypic variation seemed another outcome of genetic drift with important implications for conservation because each population should be designated as an independent evolutionary significant unit (ESU). Our study evidences the benefits of combining neutral markers with appropriate assessments of phenotype variation, and shows that even endemics with extremely narrow ranges can contain multiple conservation units.

Effects of slash-and-burn practices on soil seed banks in secondary forest successions in Madagascar	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Forest seed bank assessments are scarce in Madagascar and thus little is known about the relationships between the seed banks and vegetation dynamics on which secondary succession processes rely. The objective of this paper is to analyse the effects of slash-and-burn agriculture on soil seed banks and their dynamics along secondary forest successions. The aim of this work is to determine the effects of agricultural practices (cropping duration, tillage regime and fallow age) on seed bank density (SBD) and diversity (SBSR) during secondary succession periods (<25 years). Cropping duration was divided into three classes: (i) short (1-2 years), (ii) medium (3-5 years) and (iii) long (6-11 years). Tillage regime during crop successions was divided into three categories: (I) no tillage (only direct sowing is observed), (2) light tillage (after direct sowing, local shallow tillage is observed) and (3) heavy tillage (after direct sowing followed by light tillage practice, complete tillage practice is observed). Fifteen fallows subdivided into three regrowth age classes (2-6, 10-12 and 14-22 years) were surveyed. Fallow age is the main driver of SBD and SBSR: they increase with fallow age, regardless of cropping duration and tillage regime. SBD and SBSR recovery always occurs but is slower under long cropping duration (3-11 years) and heavy tillage regime because cropping duration helps to maintain a high level of wind-dispersed seeds during secondary succession and tillage regime contributes to reducing the proportion of viable seeds.

Hybridisation and introgression between Brassica napus and B. rapa in the Netherlands	PLANT BIOLOGY												We used flow cytometry, chromosome counting and AFLP markers to investigate gene flow from the crop plant oilseed rape, Brassica napus (AACC) to wild B.rapa (AA) in the Netherlands. From 89 B.napus source populations investigated, all near cropping fields or at transhipment sites, only 19 contained a B.rapa population within a 2.5-km radius. During our survey we found only three populations with F1 hybrids (AAC), as recognized by their nine extra chromosomes and by flow cytometry. These hybrids were all collected in mixed populations where the two species grew in close proximity. Populations with F1 hybrids were not close to crops, but instead were located on road verges with highly disturbed soils, in which both species were probably recruited from the soil seed bank. Many plants in the F2, BC1 or higher backcrosses are expected to carry one to eight C chromosomes. However, these plants were not observed among the hybrids. We further investigated introgression with molecular markers (AFLP) and compared sympatric B.rapa populations (near populations of B.napus) with control populations of B.rapa (no B.napus within at least 7km). We found no difference between sympatric and control populations in the number of C markers in B.rapa, nor did we find that these sympatric populations closely resembled B.napus. Our data show that hybrids occur but also suggest no recent introgression of alleles from the crop plant B.napus into wild B.rapa in the Dutch populations studied.

J	Richards, JH; Abreu, A; Cordova, JR; Taylor, J				Richards, Jennifer H.; Abreu, Andrew; Cordova, Jose R.; Taylor, Jonathan			Phenology of fruit development and abortion in sawgrass, Cladium jamaicense, and its consequences for seed bank viability	AQUATIC BOTANY												The common marsh macrophyte Cladium jamaicense (sawgrass) has high levels of fruit abortion. We investigated the phenology of post-fertilization fruit development and of fruit drop in southern Florida, USA, to determine the timing of fruit abortion in relation to fruit shedding. Fruits at two sites were harvested at 2-week intervals, weighed individually and examined for potential viability (PV) to document changes in fruit biomass, morphology, and abortion rate. Fruits shed into 1/4 m(2) traps placed in sawgrass patches at two sites were counted and assayed for PV every one or two weeks in summer 2009 and 2010. Sawgrass sheds fruits from mid-July to September with peak fruit drop in late July to mid-August, 2-2.5 months after flowering. Sawgrass fruits had high rates of abortion that differed among plants and between sites and increased from mid-July through August. One-third to one-half of all fruits shed by a plant over the summer were aborted. Sawgrass plants had late fruit abortion that occurred prior to shedding but after investment in fruit development, producing persistent aborted fruits. A model for the effect of these fruits on seed bank viability predicted levels of 2% seed viability in the seed bank for 50% fruit abortion, similar to values for seed bank germination from the literature. The low percent of viable sawgrass seeds reported here provides a baseline population parameter for Everglades and other Caribbean marsh restoration and indicates the need to determine the input of viable fruits when studying seed banks and/or germination.

Seed bank dynamics and emergence pattern of weeds as affected by tillage systems in dry direct-seeded rice	CROP PROTECTION												The vertical weed seed distribution in the soil and the emergence pattern of weeds have implications for weed management in different cropping systems. Various agronomic practices have been reported to influence these factors, and tillage has a great role to play in weed management strategies. The effect of conventional tillage (CONT) and zero tillage (ZT) on the distribution of weed seeds in the soil, and the emergence pattern of different weed species was evaluated in dry direct-seeded rice in the summer (kharif) seasons of 2012 and 2013. The ZT system resulted in a higher proportion of weed seeds in 0-2 cm of the soil layer at the time of crop sowing, with 48-52% of broadleaved and 45-55% of grassy weed seeds; whereas, CONT had weed seeds buried in deeper layers, with 47-48% of broadleaved and 50-55% of grassy weed seeds in the lowermost layer (5-10 cm). At crop harvest, both tillage systems showed higher proportions of weed seeds in the upper 2 cm of the soil layer; however, this was due to seed shedding of mature weeds on the soil surface. The maximum emergence of Cyperus rotundus and Echinochloa co/ona was 33-42% and 20-26% higher in Zr than CONT. In 2012, Cyperus compressus emergence in Zr exceeded CONT by 65%, whereas Echinochloa crus-galli and Dactyloctenium aegyptium emerged 22% and 52% more in the CONT system than If. The emergence pattern of Digitaria ciliaris was not influenced by tillage systems. The information from this study will facilitate better decision making in weed management through the integration of tillage systems and other weed control measures in dry direct-seeded rice.

Resilience of Invaded Riparian Landscapes: The Potential Role of Soil-Stored Seed Banks	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We investigated the potential role of soil-stored seed banks in driving vegetation recovery under varying intensities of invasion by the alien tree Eucalyptus camaldulensis along the Berg River in South Africa's Western Cape Province. We asked: How do richness, diversity, and composition of soil-stored seed banks vary with invasion intensity? What is the difference between the seed banks and above-ground vegetation with respect to species richness, diversity, composition, and structure? To what extent do soil-stored seed banks provide reliable sources for restoring native plant communities? Through a seedling-emergence approach, we compared seedling density, richness, and diversity in plots under varying Eucalyptus cover. Seed bank characteristics were also compared with those of the above-ground vegetation. Except in terms of diversity and density, the richness and composition of native species varied significantly among invasion conditions. Despite the paucity of native tree and shrub species in the seed bank, it was more diverse than extant vegetation. Some species occurred exclusively either in the seed bank or in the above-ground vegetation. Although this ecosystem has been degraded by several agents, including Eucalyptus invasion, soil-stored seed banks still offer modest potential for driving regeneration of native plant communities, but secondary invasions need to be managed carefully. Remnant populations of native plants in the above-ground vegetation remaining after E. camaldulensis clearing provide a more promising propagule source for rapid regeneration. Further work is needed to elucidate possible effects of invasion on successional pathways following E. camaldulensis removal and the effects of hydrochory on seed bank dynamics.

Surface Temperatures and Durations Associated with Spring Prescribed Fires in Eastern South Dakota Tallgrass Prairies	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Fire and grazing are commonly used to manage nonnative grasses in the Northern Great Plains, but the effects of fire frequency and management between fire events on fire behavior in this region are poorly understood. We examined temperature and duration of prescribed spring fires at two locations where plots were treated with two fire frequencies (annual or biennial), simulated grazing (1 mo of weekly clipping in spring) and no simulated grazing. In May 2011 and 2013, soil surface fire temperatures and heat duration were monitored in treatment plots using thermocouples. Probes also were placed at 1, 2, and 3 cm depths to measure soil heat transfer. Lethal heat duration (> 60 C) at the surface tended to be longer in plots treated with biennial fires compared to plots treated with annual fires. Fires in 2011 had higher maximum temperatures than 2013. Cooler fires in 2013 were characterized by longer durations of lethal heat. However, simulated grazing increased residence time of lethal temperatures in biennial plots and reduced lethal temperature duration in annual plots. Surface heat did not influence soil temperatures even at the 1 cm depth. Greater fuel loads, characteristic of plots treated with biennial fires, generally were associated with higher maximum temperatures and longer heat durations.

To establish MucoRice-CTB for human use, here we developed hygromycin phosphotransferase selection marker-free MucoRice-CTB by using two different Agrobacterium tumefaciens, each carrying a distinct T-DNA for co-transformation. In the marker-free candidates from co-transformants by segregation in the seed progeny, we selected a line with high CTB expression, line 51A, which we advanced to the T6 generation by self-pollination to obtain a homozygous line without down-regulation of CTB expression. Southern blot analyses showed that three copies of the CTB gene, but not the backbone of the T-DNA binary vector, were inserted into the rice genome of MucoRice-CTB line 51A. By whole genome resequencing, we showed that the transgenes in this line were inserted into intergenic regions in chromosome 3 and chromosome 12. We determined that two full-length copies, each containing the CTB and RNAi expression cassettes, were inserted in a tandem reverted orientation into chromosome 3. An additional copy of the CTB over-expression cassette with a truncated RNAi cassette was inserted into chromosome 12. These findings provide useful information for the establishment of a seed bank of marker-free MucoRice-CTB for human use.

Effect of repeated burning on plant and soil carbon and nitrogen in cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) dominated ecosystems	PLANT AND SOIL												Fire has profound effects on ecosystem properties, but few studies have addressed the effect of repeated burns on soil nutrients, and none have been conducted in cold desert ecosystems where invasion by exotic annual grasses is resulting in greater fire frequency. In a 5 year study, we examined effects of repeated burning, litter removal, and post-fire seeding on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in soils, litter, and vegetation in a cheatgrass-dominated Wyoming big sagebrush ecological type. We developed a multivariate model to identify potential mechanisms influencing treatment effects and examine the influence of environmental factors such as precipitation and temperature. We found that repeated burning had strong negative effects on litter C and N contents, but did not reduce soil nutrients or vegetation C and N contents, likely due to cool fire temperatures. There were few effects of litter removal or post-fire seeding. Instead, precipitation and temperature interacted with burning and had the strongest influences on soil N and vegetation C and N contents over time. Management strategies aimed at decreasing litter and seed banks and increasing competitive interactions may be more effective at reducing cheatgrass success than approaches for reducing soil nutrients.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				JAN	2015	386	1-2					47	64		10.1007/s11104-014-2242-2							WOS:000346491000004

Will among-population variation in seed traits improve the chance of species persistence under climate change?	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimSeed traits related to recruitment have direct relevance for plant fitness and persistence. Trait variation in time and among populations may increase species resilience and ultimately reduce the risk of extinction. However, patterns of among-population variation in critical recruitment traits remain poorly known and are often disregarded when considering extinction risk under future climates. LocationGlobal. MethodsIn this paper we review and synthesize current knowledge about among-population variation in physiological and morphological traits related to plant recruitment. We outline the consequences of that variation for species persistence under climate change, and discuss the implications for conservation, management and restoration. ResultsThe evaluated studies provide compelling evidence that among-population variation in traits underpinning seedling emergence, growth and establishment is widespread. Contrary to expectations, environmental gradients do not appear to be reliable predictors of variation among populations and responses are often individualistic. Likewise, well-established cross-species patterns are not consistently reflected among populations within a species. As the pattern of this variation is unpredictable, we cannot make simple generalizations about how this variation is allocated across geographic ranges or the extent of environmental versus fixed genetic differences. Nor do these patterns clearly elucidate the potential for this variation to mitigate negative effects of climate change. Main conclusionsIf we ignore among-population variation in seed traits, or assume it will follow simple environmental clines, we do so at our own peril. The consequences of such an approach are likely to include biased forecasts of future range dynamics, hindering identification of the genetic material most appropriate for conservation, restoration and management. Further research that integrates ecology and emerging evolutionary genetic techniques to identify the distribution of seed traits within foundation species and the mechanisms driving them is urgently required to guide the management and maintenance of systems in the face of rapidly changing climates.

Predicting the temporal response of seagrass meadows to dredging using Dynamic Bayesian Networks	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2015)					21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM) held jointly with the 23rd National Conference of the Australian-Society-for-Operations-Research / DSTO led Defence Operations Research Symposium (DORS	NOV 29-DEC 04, 2015	Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA	BMT WBM, CSIRO, UNSW Australia Canberra, Griffith Univ, Deltares, Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand, Australian Soc Operat Res, DSTO, Gold Coast Tourism Corp				Predicting temporal responses of ecosystems to disturbances associated with industrial activities is critical for their management and conservation. However, prediction of ecosystem responses is challenging due to the complexity and potential non-linearities stemming from interactions between system components and multiple environmental drivers. Prediction is particularly difficult for marine ecosystems due to their often highly variable and complex natures and large uncertainties surrounding their dynamic responses. Consequently, current management of such systems often rely on expert judgement and/or complex quantitative models that consider only a subset of the relevant ecological processes. Hence there exists an urgent need for the development of whole-of-systems predictive models to support decision and policy makers in managing complex marine systems in the context of industry based disturbances. This paper presents Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) for predicting the temporal response of a marine ecosystem to anthropogenic disturbances. The DBN provides a visual representation of the problem domain in terms of factors (parts of the ecosystem) and their relationships. These relationships are quantified via Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs), which estimate the variability and uncertainty in the distribution of each factor. The combination of qualitative visual and quantitative elements in a DBN facilitates the integration of a wide array of data, published and expert knowledge and other models. Such multiple sources are often essential as one single source of information is rarely sufficient to cover the diverse range of factors relevant to a management task. Here, a DBN model is developed for tropical, annual Halophila and temperate, persistent Amphibolis seagrass meadows to inform dredging management and help meet environmental guidelines. Specifically, the impacts of capital (e.g. new port development) and maintenance (e.g.maintaining channel depths in established ports) dredging is evaluated with respect to the risk of permanent loss, defined as no recovery within 5 years (Environmental Protection Agency guidelines). The model is developed using expert knowledge, existing literature, statistical models of environmental light, and experimental data. The model is then demonstrated in a case study through the analysis of a variety of dredging, environmental and seagrass ecosystem recovery scenarios. In spatial zones significantly affected by dredging, such as the zone of moderate impact, shoot density has a very high probability of being driven to zero by capital dredging due to the duration of such dredging. Here, fast growing Halophila species can recover, however, the probability of recovery depends on the presence of seed banks. On the other hand, slow growing Amphibolis meadows have a high probability of suffering permanent loss. However, in the maintenance dredging scenario, due to the shorter duration of dredging, Amphibolis is better able to resist the impacts of dredging. For both types of seagrass meadows, the probability of loss was strongly dependent on the biological and ecological status of the meadow, as well as environmental conditions post-dredging. The ability to predict the ecosystem response under cumulative, non-linear interactions across a complex ecosystem highlights the utility of DBNs for decision support and environmental management.

J	Franczak, M; Czarnecka, B				Franczak, Magdalena; Czarnecka, Bozenna			Changes in vegetation and soil seed bank of meadow after waterlogging caused by Castor fiber	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Soil waterlogging is among abiotic stresses that influence species composition and productivity in numerous plant communities. The aim of the study was to find answer to the question of how waterlogging caused by beavers' activity induces quantitative and qualitative changes of vegetation and soil seed bank levels of variable-moist meadows. An immediate effect of the waterlogging at the level of vegetation was the decline in species richness and a decrease in the values of the biodiversity index. Water stress inhibited growth and development of plants already present and, primarily, impeded recruitment of new individuals of species characteristic of variable-moist meadows, e.g. Cirsium rivulare, Filipendula ulmaria and Lythrum salicaria, which were replaced by Carex acutiformis. Prolonged waterlogging did not induce equally substantial changes in the soil seed bank as in the vegetation. Both in the waterlogged and control patches, slightly decreased species richness and biodiversity index were recorded. After waterlogging withdrawal, the reserves of the soil seed bank were slightly higher than the initial values. The differences were not statistically significant. In the waterlogged patch, the qualitative floristic similarity between taxa identified in the soil seed bank and vegetation cover declined, which was evidenced by the value of Jaccard's index decreasing from 0.46 to 0.36. A reverse relationship was found in control patch, where the value of the similarity index slightly increased from 0.41 to 0.48.																	0001-6977	2083-9480					2015	84	2					189	196		10.5586/asbp.2015.018							WOS:000357501700004						
S	Ramesh, K		Sparks, DL		Ramesh, Kulasekaran			Weed Problems, Ecology, and Management Options in Conservation Agriculture: Issues and Perspectives	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 131	Advances in Agronomy											The unsustainable exploitation of the inelastic resources for farming has led to a widespread degradation of soil resources, which has forced us to rethink our food production strategies into conservation agriculture (CA). It would be difficult to slow down the intensive-production process keeping in view, the demographic pressure. The present-day systems are posing challenges to land, water, and atmosphere, besides the biodiversity. CA involves minimal disturbance of the land, coupled with good agronomic principles such as crop residue management and crop rotation, with the application of chemicals for weed management. With a view to sustainable development in agriculture, CA is a concept trying to reconcile ecology, economy, and performance. Tillage is practiced since ages, for the preparation of field and making weed-free conditions and is an integral component of traditional agricultural systems. However, soil erosion was inevitable. The focal theme of CA revolves around reducing tillage operations. From a weed management point of view, soil tillage brought buried seeds to the upper layer and stimulated their germination and the maintenance of crop residues hampered the herbicide efficacy. However, there are reports of shift in weed population due to the adoption of CA as compared to the conventional agricultural practices posing a formidable challenge to the CA concept. The interaction of weed-crop system becomes too complex. Reduced tillage and zero tillage allowed seed to stay on the surface so that they become prey to the predators. The crop/ cover crop residue may also release some chemicals, which may also reduce weed seed germination process. Understanding the weed seed ecology and weed ecology could aid in devising appropriate management options for successful implementation of CA. An integrated management encompassing selection of appropriate crop cultivar and cropping system coupled with CA principles would aid in the management of weeds. Understanding weed seed predation would add value to the management issues. Herbicide resistance need to be given due attention for chemical weed management.																	0065-2113		978-0-12-802136-1				2015	131						251	303		10.1016/bs.agron.2014.12.003							WOS:000393108900005

Seed bank dynamics govern persistence of Brassica hybrids in crop and natural habitats	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Gene flow from crops to their wild relatives has the potential to alter population growth rates and demography of hybrid populations, especially when a new crop has been genetically modified ( GM). This study introduces a comprehensive approach to assess this potential for altered population fitness, and uses a combination of demographic data in two habitat types and mathematical (matrix) models that include crop rotations and outcrossing between parental species. Methods Full life-cycle demographic rates, including seed bank survival, of non-GM Brassica rapa x B. napus F-1 hybrids and their parent species were estimated from experiments in both agricultural and semi-natural habitats. Altered fitness potential was modelled using periodic matrices including crop rotations and outcrossing between parent species. Key Results The demographic vital rates (i.e. for major stage transitions) of the hybrid population were intermediate between or lower than both parental species. The population growth rate (lambda) of hybrids indicated decreases in both habitat types, and in a semi-natural habitat hybrids became extinct at two sites. Elasticity analyses indicated that seed bank survival was the greatest contributor to lambda. In agricultural habitats, hybrid populations were projected to decline, but with persistence times up to 20 years. The seed bank survival rate was the main driver determining persistence. It was found that lambda of the hybrids was largely determined by parental seed bank survival and subsequent replenishment of the hybrid population through outcrossing of B. rapa with B. napus. Conclusions Hybrid persistence was found to be highly dependent on the seed bank, suggesting that targeting hybrid seed survival could be an important management option in controlling hybrid persistence. For local risk mitigation, an increased focus on the wild parent is suggested. Management actions, such as control of B. rapa, could indirectly reduce hybrid populations by blocking hybrid replenishment.

J	Joye, DA; Rey-Boissezon, A				Joye, Dominique Auderset; Rey-Boissezon, Aurelie			Will charophyte species increase or decrease their distribution in a changing climate?	AQUATIC BOTANY												Most charophyte species are threatened across Europe. Understanding their current and future distribution is a challenge for their conservation. We looked for species distribution models (SDM) and for increasing or decreasing species occurrence under a future climate scenario in Switzerland. Firstly, we modeled the occurrence of charophyte species in 1402 Swiss localities using presence-absence data and environmental variables (waterbody size, mean July temperature, July precipitation, soil calcium carbonate content and proportions of land used by agriculture and forest cover in the catchment area and in the surroundings). We used generalized additive models (GAM) to analyze the data. Secondly, based on the models, we predicted the occurrence of the species in 21,092 localities listed in Switzerland. Thirdly, we applied a climate scenario to our models (2 degrees C mean July temperature increase and 15% reduction in July precipitation) and predicted species occurrence under these new conditions. Twelve charophyte species were modeled successfully. The major driver of species distribution was the waterbody size, followed by climate and land-use variables. We detected predicted impacts of climate changes on the species occurrence and identified the potential winners and losers. About half of the species are predicted to become losers; they colonize the littoral zone of lakes. Other charophytes are potential winners; the majority of them colonize small waterbodies.

Seed Ecology and Environmental Conditions of Hypericum sinaicum, Growing in South Sinai, Egypt	CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												There are increasing threats facing the rare plants including the endemic populations. Also the potential development of the earth's vast desert areas for agriculture and other human-needs demands an awareness of the ecological characteristics and requirements of desert vegetation. Saint Catherine area has a unique location and environment. The vegetation and wild life in Saint Catherine area is subjected to great disturbance through the unmanaged human activities. In the present study we had used seed ecology in order to contribute in designing a sound long term conservation plan for the threatened endemic studied medicinal species; Hypericum sinaicum, at two levels; (a) soil seed bank and its relationship to above ground vegetation and (b) the germination response at different conditions and pretreatments on wetted substrate. Hypericum sinaicum grows in Sinai on mountainous sheltered moist crevices and in Hijaz in the extreme north-west of Saudi Arabia and in Edom in Jordan. The results revealed that seven endemic species were identified in soil seed bank; Veronica khaiseri, Hypericum sinaicum, Nepeta septemcrenata, Plantago sinaica, Origanum syriacum, Phlomis aurea, and Primula boveana. Germination treatments on Hypericum sinaicum seeds showed that calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and hot water of 50 degrees C treatment was found to be most effective to improve seed germination depending on doses, while other treatments were efficient to a lesser degree. As a general conclusion, the present study clarified that the behaviour of endemic species along environmental gradients varies greatly, as well as in its strategies in struggling for existence.																	1687-5052	2090-2786					2015	10						29	44									WOS:000424610300004

Life History Transitions in Response to Salinity Dynamics Along the Everglades-Florida Bay Ecotone	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Coastal estuaries receiving low and fluctuating freshwater flows are creating more variable salinity environments for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), including seagrasses. Some SAV species, such as Ruppia maritima L. (wigeongrass), are adapted to variable salinity, but rapid salinity changes can limit population persistence. For example, R. maritima historically dominated at the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone under greater freshwater flows, but has a more limited distribution in recent decades with greater salinity variability. While R. maritima is an indicator species for Everglades restoration, little is known about how ecotone salinity patterns drive its current limited distribution in southern Everglades estuaries. Seed production is important for population maintenance in this disturbance-tolerant species. Thus, we examined R. maritima life history transitions, including seed germination, seedling and adult survival, and sexual reproduction under site-specific salinity variability across the Everglades ecotone. Seedlings were most susceptible to fluctuating salinity with only 13 % survival at the lower more marine ecotone site under conditions of relatively large-amplitude fluctuations. Adult survival also decreased from upper (93 %) to lower (25 %) sites, resulting in a significant decline in per capita clonal reproduction rates. The markedly low survival rate at the lower ecotone was associated with rapid salinity fluctuations (2.5-20 psu) with short periodicities (<24 h). In addition, no sexual reproduction occurred at any of our ecotone sites, indicating that seed production may be limiting. Thus, hydrologic restoration targets should consider optimization of salinity levels and dynamics that promote SAV early life stage survival and sexual reproduction to restore critical coastal habitats in the Everglades and other highly dynamic estuarine systems.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JAN	2015	38	1					337	352		10.1007/s12237-014-9807-4							WOS:000347680300027

To this end, 60 samples of 30x30x5 cm topsoil were collected in the Reserva Natural Vale located in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Individuals of 25 species and 15 botanical families germinated for six months. The study found increased density of Urochloa decumbens (brachiaria) in the FR, an invasive species which inhibits the process of ecological succession, representing a problem in cases of possible disturbances. On the other hand, the presence of facilitative succession species such as Cecropia and Trema in the FR were characterized positively, because these species are responsible for forest regeneration after disturbances and they were not used during the planting of the area, that is, the forest restoration is behaving as an ecosystem that already presents resilience to disturbances such as the creation of gaps.																	2179-8087					JAN-MAR	2015	22	1					79	87		10.1590/2179-8087.096714							WOS:000442083700009						
J	Abella, SR; Springer, JD				Abella, Scott R.; Springer, Judith D.			Effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in mixed conifer forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Mixed conifer forests of western North America are challenging for fire management, as historical fire regimes were highly variable in severity, timing, and spatial extent. Complex fire histories combined with site factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great variation in understory plant communities, and management activities influence future dynamics of both overstory and understory communities. This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts to influence future fires and restore the composition and structure of mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic review of published studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in western North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria and encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in Canada. Total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) commonly declined in the short term within 4 years after treatment. This may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or fire, heavy loadings of slash, little change or even expansion of tree canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or drought. In contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5 years since treatment reported increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these long-term studies also persistently decreased tree canopy cover. Most or all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through cutting operations or fire. A model of understory response has emerged that treatments generally do not eliminate species, and often benefit species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species (e.g., Epilobium spp.) appear fire-dependent, because they are uncommon or absent in unburned mixed conifer forests and after tree cutting alone. Cutting and prescribed fire applied together resulted in the greatest invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal compared to native cover. Few studies examined influences of intensity of tree cutting or severity of prescribed fire, but overstory understory relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce overstory density from maximum values (which can exceed 3000 stems ha(-1) and 80 m(2) ha(-1) basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30-50% cover to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few studies examined understory dynamics after wildfire relative to unburned forest, and further work is warranted because wildfire is a likely eventual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad region from the southwestern United States into Canada, prescribed fire and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted native species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long term. Active management using tree cutting and fire will likely benefit both biodiversity conservation and fire management in current mixed conifer forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

VARIABLE PHYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF THYMUS VULGARIS (LAMIACEAE) TERPENES ON ASSOCIATED SPECIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Thymus vulgaris has a chemical polymorphism in which individual plants have an essential oil dominated by either nonphenolic (geraniol, a-terpineol, cis-sabinene hydrate, linalool, or 1,8-cineole) or phenolic (carvacrol and thymol) monoterpenes. Using the geraniol, cis-sabinene hydrate, and the two phenolic chemotypes, we tested three hypotheses: (1) chemotypes vary in their influences on germination and growth of associated plant species, (2) associated species respond differentially to individual chemotypes, and (3) soils under thyme canopies will influence associated species differently than do sterile soils. The study was done in Montpellier, France, in settings mimicking natural conditions. In one experiment, survival of both monocots and dicots from the seed bank was lower in soils collected from under thyme plants of the phenolic chemotypes. In a second experiment, we sowed seeds of Daucus carota, Nigella damascena, and Bromus madritensis into soil collected from under thyme plants and covered with canopies of fresh thyme of each chemotype or into control soils, The species showed differential responses in germination and/or growth to the four chemotypes. In a third experiment, germination and growth of D. carota, N. damascena, Bromus erectus, and Picris hieracoides on sterile soil covered with fresh thyme foliage and controls showed differential responses to the four chemotypes; however, these responses were less marked than those on soils collected under thyme plants. These results coupled with previous demonstrations of chemotype-influenced differential herbivory and parasitism illustrate the complex influences of genetic variability on multispecies interactions and the individuality of species responses to toxic chemicals.																	1058-5893	1537-5315				JAN	2015	176	1					20	30		10.1086/678772							WOS:000348356800003

This article describes the initial ecological conditions or baseline of an ecological restoration project from an abandoned pasture in a peri-urban landscape. The baseline was established with information about 1) history of land use, 2) temporal and spatial variability of abiotic (climate) and biotic (vegetation structure and floristic composition) characteristics of the site, and 3) the ecosystem resilience as regeneration potential from soil seed banks and seed rain. The baseline results guided the active restoration (i.e., multi-species plantations), and passive restoration (i.e., suppression of disturbance) actions. Active and passive restoration areas will be part of public displays of the Francisco Javier Clavijero Botanical Garden to inform about the long and complex process to recover a peri-urban cloud forest.

B	Koch, JM		Tibbett, M		Koch, John M.			Mining and ecological restoration in the jarrah forest of Western Australia	MINING IN ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE LANDSCAPES												The jarrah forest is a unique vegetation community restricted to the Darling Plateau in the southwest corner of Western Australia. It is flanked by the predominantly cleared coastal plain to the west and the almost totally cleared Wheatbelt to the east. Having a relatively undisturbed natural vegetation community close to Perth gives the area special significance. Alcoa is privileged to be allowed to mine in this sensitive environment and accordingly applies the highest standards of environmental management in its operations. Drinking water production, timber, conservation and recreation are the main land uses in the forest and restoration aims to reinstate these values after mining. Mining in this relatively intact natural ecosystem close to Perth requires high standards of environmental practice in all areas. This paper describes in detail, three significant aspects of environmental sensitivity and how they are managed: jarrah dieback disease, drinking water catchment and biodiversity impact. Management of jarrah dieback disease is backed by a strong history of applied research, both within and external to Alcoa. Management includes knowing where the pathogen is present, restricting vehicle movement from infested to uninfested areas, cleaning vehicles before entering uninfested areas, preventing infested and uninfested soils mixing, preventing water draining from infested to uninfested areas, training all field staff and planners, monitoring the spread of the disease attributable to mining, and investigating the causes. Extremely small rates of dieback disease spread due to mining have resulted from these management practices. Water catchment protection is underpinned by clear standards and protocols, government reporting requirements, continual monitoring, and high standards of earthworks and other engineering controls. Drinking water standards have never been compromised by Alcoa's operations in Perth's water catchment areas. Successful management and restoration of biodiversity stems from the concept that Alcoa's mining is a transient land use and that mining is not complete until restoration has been carried out. Flora is successfully returned by maximising the diversity of species originating from the natural topsoil seed bank, applied seed and planting of difficult or 'recalcitrant' species. Fauna restoration requires the return of suitable habitat for fauna species as well as removal of any barriers to animal success, in particular feral animal predation. Alcoa funds feral fox control in the jarrah forest and is actively involved in rare species re-introductions in areas within and around its mining operations. Key enablers to ensure high standards of environmental management are: Management support - Gaining financial, staff resources and moral support from senior management is probably the most important task a mine environmental scientist can achieve. Objectives, targets and auditing - Measurable targets agreed to by management are required for improvements to be made. These are standard components of any Environmental Management System ( EMS). Research - Understand the biology/ecology of the system and use this knowledge for restoration. Applying the research - This is often more difficult than the research itself and also requires management support and staffing.																			978-0-643-10636-9; 978-0-643-10635-2				2015							111	139									WOS:000427975100007						
B	Collins, M; Brundrett, M		Tibbett, M		Collins, Margaret; Brundrett, Mark			Recovery of terrestrial orchids in natural ecosystems after severe disturbance	MINING IN ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE LANDSCAPES												The ability of terrestrial orchids to recolonise ecosystems after total loss of vegetation is highly variable. Some orchids re-establish quickly, others are slow to return while some remain absent for at least several decades after disturbance. Orchid seed is minute, has been found to be readily dispersed and is not regarded as a limiting factor provided adequate rates of pollination occurs. A case study in the jarrah forest of Western Australia showed that compatible symbiotic fungi were present in a restored bauxite mine site, but inoculum levels were low and patchily distributed in soils. Comparative studies of orchids in disturbed ecosystems revealed key functional differences between early colonisers (disturbance opportunists) and disturbance intolerant species, especially concerning the degree of pollinator and fungus specificity. However more research is required to resolve the impact of microhabitats defined by soil and vegetation on orchid colonisation and how these factors change over time. In particular, there is a paucity of data on the ecological roles and habitat preferences of the fungi, and insects on which terrestrial orchids depend. Orchids that are early re-colonisers are indicators of disturbed habitats, while those that are disturbance intolerant and recolonise slowly are useful as indicators of habitats in excellent condition.																			978-0-643-10636-9; 978-0-643-10635-2				2015							141	158									WOS:000427975100008						
J	Kalinina, O; Zeller, SL; Schmid, B				Kalinina, Olena; Zeller, Simon L.; Schmid, Bernhard			Persistence of seeds, seedlings and plants, performance of transgenic wheat in weed communities in the field and effects on fallow weed diversity	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Introduction of transgenic crops to agriculture has raised concerns about their effects on agro-ecosystems. We compared nine conventional lines of spring wheat with six genetically modified (GM) lines that contained transgenes of resistance against powdery mildew (Pm3b gene) or against fungi in general (Chi and Glu genes). We assessed the persistence and performance of these lines without competition and in experimental weed Communities in the field, their seed germination in the laboratory, their survival in fallow plots and effects on post-harvest vegetation in the field. In competition with weeds, the GM lines showed reduced seed number, plant height and biomass allocation to seeds than their corresponding non-GM lines. No such performance differences were observed without competition. The seedlings of GM lines did not persist longer than those of the corresponding non-GM lines in fallow plots. In the field, GM and non-GM wheat lines had similar performance and persistence and both were able to reproduce in dense weed communities and to survive during winter on fallow plots. Stored in soil in the laboratory, the seeds of GM and non-GM lines either germinated quickly or lost their viability after 3 months. GM and non-GM lines had no differential effects on the structure and diversity of fallow plant communities within the 6-month period of monitoring. Poor seed longevity yet successful plant persistence in weed communities or on fallow plots indicate that not removing a population of growing plants presents a greater risk than allowing the build-up of a soil seed bank regarding the potential escape of transgenic wheat to the environment. Strong varietal differences in persistence point out the importance of case-by-case assessment of new GM varieties and indicate that transgenic traits should preferably be introduced into varieties with low persistence.

Recalcitrant (i.e. desiccation sensitive) seeds of many indigenous African species, e.g. must germinate shortly after shedding and hence, may not be able to avoid exposure to acid rain in polluted areas. This study investigated the effects of simulated acid rain (rainwater with pH adjusted to pH 3.0 and 4.5 with 70:30, H2SO4:HNO3) on germination, seedling growth and oxidative metabolism in a recalcitrant-seeded African tree species Trichilia dregeana Sond., growing in its natural seed bank. The results suggest that acid rain did not compromise T. dregeana seed germination and seedling establishment significantly, relative to the control (non-acidified rainwater). However, pH 3.0 treated seedlings exhibited signs of stress typically associated with acid rain: leaf tip necrosis, abnormal bilobed leaf tips, leaf necrotic spots and chlorosis, reduced leaf chlorophyll concentration, increased stomatal density and indications of oxidative stress. This may explain why total and root biomass of pH 3.0 treated seedlings were significantly lower than the control. Acid rain also induced changes in the species composition and relative abundance of the different life forms emerging from T. dregeana's natural seed bank and in this way could indirectly impact on T. dregeana seedling establishment success.																	0031-9317	1399-3054				JAN	2015	153	1					149	160		10.1111/ppl.12230							WOS:000346646800012	24835442

Such a structure exerts a strong effect on spatio-temporal patterns of the soil seed bank, which tends to accumulate under plant patches. In this study, we evaluated the recover ability of soil seed banks and possible changes in their spatial patterns during the earliest post-fire phases in a saline steppe, when the extant vegetation was temporally removed in the habitat. The study was carried out in El Saladar de Cordovilla (Tobarra, Albacete) after a fire in the late summer of 2011. To do this we proceeded to track and collect soil samples during the subsequent year and a half to fire. The seed in samples were identified and the results were subjected to various statistical analyses. The results showed that 18 months were not enough to recovery the original composition of soil seed bank in continental saline steppes, because after a fire the plant patches structure disappear temporarily, at least from original places, so their effect on spatial patterns of soil seed bank distribution are temporarily deleted.																	2310-3469						2015	3	1					31	43									WOS:000216416000004

REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												Species invasions are considered as a major threat relative to native species, especially for island systems. Eradication programs of invasive species are an alternative for the preservation of island's native biodiversity. In this context, the managers of the Port-Cros national Park have implemented in 2010 a 2 ha manual control program of ice plant (Carpobrotus sp., Aizoaceae), invasive in the Mediterranean basin and, particularly, on the island of Bagaud (Var, France). Temporal changes of plant communities (i.e. species richness and plant cover) were analysed in permanent plots (100 m(2) and 16 m(2)) before (2010-2011) and after (2013-2014) Carpobrotus sp. eradication. These plant communities were also compared with native reference plant communities of this island. Species richness and plant cover of native flora significantly increased in 2013 due to the germination of native plants seed bank. On coastal sites, the recovery of native flora is faster and matches with the halo-resistant reference plant community. On inland sites, the recovery of native flora includes low matorral and halonitrophilous species. Invasive species control must include monitoring through time of native plant species to find out whether recovery is transient or long lasting in the context of degraded ecosystems restoration or threatened species conservation.

Emergence of species of the genus Hakea. Measures for management	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												The introduction and acclimatization of exotic plant species in the South-East of France, in particular since the second half of the nineteenth century, have contributed to the domestication of wild species used in ornamental horticulture, perfume industry and landscape. A few species have naturalized, some have become invasive and are impacting the highly endemic indigenous flora. Early detection of naturalizing species and evaluation of biological invasion risk are useful for control or eradication operations. The question arises for woody plant species introduced since 1973 in a forest arboretum of the Esterel Mountains. Out of 400 species planted initially, 13 are naturalizing, among which several species of Hakea genus (Proteaceae) native of Australia. This study aims to assemble useful data for the invasion risk evaluation. These data include reproduction traits, seed bank, dispersion system and introduction history. Risk analysis confirmed that several species can become a threat to the environment if they naturalize outside the arboretum. Two of them (Hakea salicifolia (Vent.) B.L. Burtt and Hakea sericea Schrad. & J.C. Wendl.) already have an invasive status in other Mediterranean countries. Studies lead to the production of a technical itinerary and to the local operators' awareness to organize control. This method could be applied to other arboretums, especially those situated in the Mediterranean region.																	0249-7395						2015	70			12			139	150									WOS:000209955000016

It was found high genetic variability of the samples under study by ISSR markers. Also observed relatively high polymorphism for autogamous species such as andean lupine. Finally phenograms showed a relationship with the geographical location, possibly due to in situ gene flow due to the exchange or sale of seeds in markets near the collection area.

Our aim was to evaluate the influence of pregermination treatments for overcoming the dormancy of P. aculeata seeds. The seeds were submitted to the following treatments: sample - intact seeds (T-1); mechanical scarification with water sandpaper no. 80, followed by room temperature water soaking for 12 and 24 hours (T-3 e T-4, respectively); immersion in sulfuric acid for 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes (T-5, T-6, T-7 e T-8, respectively); immersion in water in 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C for one minute (T-9, T-10, T-11 e T-12, respectively). The characteristics evaluated were: percentage of emergence, emergence first count, emergence speed index, height and dry weight of seedlings. In the treatments that involved immersion in water in 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C, a low percentage of emergence was obtained. The P. aculeate seeds tegumentary dormancy is overcome with maximum efficiency by the mechanical scarification with sandpaper, suggesting that, in natural environment the movement of contraction and expansion of the soil results in a mechanical scarification of the tegument of the seeds, thus, allowing a high percentage of germination with distribution as time passes.																	1676-546X	1679-0359					2015	36	3					1191	1202		10.5433/1679-0359.2015v36n3p1191							WOS:000361044600002						
J	Kumar, V; Jha, P				Kumar, Vipan; Jha, Prashant			Control of Volunteer Glyphosate-Resistant Canola in Glyphosate-Resistant Sugar Beet	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Occurrence of glyphosate-resistant (GR) canola volunteers in GR sugar beet is a management concern for growers in the Northern Great Plains. Field experiments were conducted at the Southern Agricultural Research Center near Huntley, MT, in 2011 and 2012 to evaluate effective herbicide programs to control volunteer GR canola in GR sugar beet. Single POST application of triflusulfuron methyl alone at the two-leaf stage of sugar beet was more effective at 35 compared with 17.5 g ai ha(-1). However, rate differences were not evident when triflusulfuron methyl was applied as a sequential POST (two-leaf followed by [fb] six-leaf stage of sugar beet) program (17.5 fb 17.5 or 35 fb 35 g ha(-1)). Volunteer GR canola plants in the sequential POST triflusulfuron methyl-containing treatments produced little biomass (11 to 15% of nontreated plots) but a significant amount of seeds (160 to 661 seeds m(-2)). Ethofumesate (4,200 g ai ha(-1)) PRE followed by sequential POST triflusulfuron methyl (17.5 or 35 g ha(-1)) provided effective control (94 to 98% at 30 d after treatment [DAT]), biomass reduction (97%), and seed prevention of volunteer GR canola. There was no additional advantage of adding either desmedipham + phenmedipham + + thofumesate premix (44.7 g ha(-1)) or ethofumesate (140 g ha(-1)) to the sequential POST triflusulfuron methylonly treatments. The sequential POST ethofumesate-only (140 fb 140 g ha(-1)) treatment provided poor volunteer GR canola control at 30 DAT, and the noncontrolled plants produced 6,361 seeds m(-2), which was comparable to the nontreated control (7,593 seeds m(-2)). Sequential POST triflusulfuron methyl-containing treatments reduced GR sugar beet root and sucrose yields to 18 and 20%, respectively. Consistent with GR canola control, sugar beet root and sucrose yields were highest (95 and 91% of hand-weeded plots, respectively) when the sequential POST triflusulfuron methylcontaining treatments were preceded by ethofumesate (4,200 g ha(-1)) PRE. Growers should utilize these effective herbicide programs to control volunteer GR canola in GR sugar beet. Because of high canola seed production potential, as evident from this research, control efforts should be aimed at preventing seed bank replenishment of the GR canola volunteers.

Understanding long-term effects of topsoil removal in peatlands: overcoming thresholds for fen meadows restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: What are the long-term results of fen meadow restoration after topsoil removal on peatlands? What are the causes of slow fen-meadow vegetation recovery on peat soils after topsoil removal? Location: Drentsche Aa Nature Reserve (53 degrees 0049N, 6 degrees 3746E) in the northeast Netherlands, with extensive natural and partially restored fen meadows (ca. 10,000ha). Methods: Restoration measures consisted of removal of acidified and fertilized topsoil and improvement of local hydrology by blocking or removing drainage ditches. The effects of shallow (20cm) and deep (40cm) topsoil removal were compared. We monitored vegetation changes after restoration measures in permanent plots over a 13-yr period, and analysed changes in species composition over time with ordination techniques (multivariate analysis: PCA and RDA). Soil conditions over time were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The vegetation and environment shifted over time in response to restoration. At first the vegetation stagnated in a species-poor phase for 5yr, but eventually fen-meadow species re-established. At the end of the observation period, after 14yr, the vegetation after both shallow and deep peat removal was similar. Soil acidification occurred immediately after topsoil removal (within the first 2-3yr) due to pyrite oxidation when the soil was exposed to air after site excavation and the peat was temporarily desiccated. Conclusions: We found poor re-establishment of fen-meadow vegetation and persistence of species-poor communities during the first 5yr after topsoil removal, probably resulting from internal soil acidification. After further rewetting, a rapid shift towards the target community composition was observed. The positive shift in development of fen-meadow vegetation probably occurred due to increased groundwater discharge after successful hydrological measures were applied. Appropriate hydrological conditions (strong discharge of groundwater) are important for the success of restoration of these fen meadows, especially if pyrite is present in shallow soil layers.

J	Helsen, K; Hermy, M; Honnay, O				Helsen, Kenny; Hermy, Martin; Honnay, Olivier			Changes in the species and functional trait composition of the seed bank during semi-natural grassland assembly: seed bank disassembly or ecological palimpsest?	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionUnlike above-ground plant community assembly, the processes that govern assembly of the soil seed bank following severe habitat disturbance are poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been put forward in this context: (1) the ecological palimpsest hypothesis' assumes a gradual accumulation of species in the seed bank; and (2) the community disassembly hypothesis' assumes a gradual deterministic loss of species from the seed bank. Here, we investigated which hypothesis is applicable to the seed bank assembly of semi-natural grasslands, following forest clearance. Furthermore, we asked whether seed bank community divergence occurred at the species and at the functional trait level. LocationRestored and ancient (old) calcareous grasslands in south Belgium. MethodsThe species composition of 106 seed bank samples from three restoration age classes were obtained through a germination experiment. Community-weighted means were calculated for 26 functional traits. We evaluated changes in species and functional composition with increasing grassland age. Differentiation in species and trait composition was compared between age groups. Finally, we tested for the occurrence of nestedness of the seed bank communities according to age. ResultsSeed bank species richness decreased with time since restoration, at the trait level reflected by the replacement of traits associated with generalist therophytes by traits typical for chamaephytes and grassland specialists. Whereas species differentiation remained relatively constant, trait differentiation decreased with time since restoration. The seed bank composition of old grasslands was a nested subset of that of young grasslands. ConclusionsOur results suggest that the community disassembly hypothesis' is applicable to the community assembly of semi-natural grasslands. Directly following forest clearance, a diverse seed bank is formed, followed by a gradual net loss of species. Surprisingly, this species loss is not governed by seed persistence traits but by functional changes in the above-ground community. This disassembly process results in one deterministic end state at the trait level, but not at the species level.

Polyphenol oxidase as a biochemical seed defense mechanism	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Seed dormancy and resistance to decay are fundamental survival strategies, which allow a population of seeds to germinate over long periods of time. Seeds have physical, chemical, and biological defense mechanisms that protect their food reserves from decay-inducing organisms and herbivores. Here, we hypothesize that seeds also possess enzyme-based biochemical defenses, based on induction of the plant defense enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PRO), when wild oat (Avena fatua L.) caryopses and seeds were challenged with seed-decaying Fusarium fungi. These studies suggest that dormant seeds are capable of mounting a defense response to pathogens. The pathogen-induced PRO activity from wild oat was attributed to a soluble isoform of the enzyme that appeared to result, at least in part, from proteolytic activation of a latent PRO isoform. PRO activity was also induced in wild oat hulls (lemma and palea), non-living tissues that cover and protect the caryopsis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that seeds possess inducible enzyme-based biochemical defenses arrayed on the exterior of seeds and these defenses represent a fundamental mechanism of seed survival and longevity in the soil. Enzyme-based biochemical defenses may have broader implications since they may apply to other defense enzymes as well as to a diversity of plant species and ecosystems.

Innovative approaches to the preservation of forest trees	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The recent acceleration of actions to conserve plant species using ex situ and in situ strategies has revealed the need to understand how these two approaches might be better developed and integrated in their application to tree species. Here we review some of the recent successes relating mainly to tree seed biology that have resulted in the development and application of innovative actions across five areas: (i) the expansion of living collections to conserve threatened tree species in sufficient numbers to ensure a broad genetic diversity in their progeny; (ii) the generation of viability constants to enable estimates to be made of storage longevity of tree seeds in the dry state; (iii) improvement in the diagnosis of tree seed storage behaviour through the development of predictive models, reliable prognoses of desiccation tolerance and use of botanical information systems, such as GIS, to correlate information on species distribution and their physiological characteristics; (iv) advances in storage preservation biotechnology to enhance the future application of cryopreservation procedures to recalcitrant species in biodiversity hot-spots where many are under threat of extinction; and (v) integration of ex situ and in situ conservation approaches to ensure that best practice in horticultural and forestry are combined to maintain or enhance genetic diversity, especially in high value species and those with small and vulnerable populations. These actions can lead to greater impact if supported by greater efforts to create seed banks and to collate data-bases world-wide so that data, knowledge and collections are more available to the scientific, forestry and NGO communities. Throughout this review we have used examples from the mega-biodiversity countries of Brazil and China, as a way of illustrating wider principles that can be applied in many countries. Future development of current research approaches, the adherence to conservation policy and the expanding needs for education are also considered briefly. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Embryo maturity plays an important role for the successful cryopreservation of coconut (Cocos nucifera)	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT												Genetic diversity of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is being lost due to a combination of pest and disease attack, urban encroachment, natural disasters, as well as introgression with exotic genetic types. Consequently, there is a need to undertake germplasm conservation before further loss occurs. Since coconut has a large, recalcitrant seed (sensitive to desiccation), it cannot be stored in traditional ways in a seed bank. Cryopreservation of zygotic embryos is now seen as an important storage approach although published techniques are still not reliable. Given the importance of embryo maturity to the success of cryopreservation in other species, the effect of coconut embryo maturity on cryopreservation success was investigated using four cultivars ('Nias Yellow Dwarf', 'Tebing Tinggi Dwarf', 'Takome Tall', and 'Bali Tall'). After cryopreservation, using a new four-step protocol (rapid desiccation, rapid freezing, rapid thawing, and recovery and acclimatization for 4 mo in the glasshouse), we found that the embryos isolated from an 11-mo-old fruit gave the highest number of normal seedlings (similar to 28%) when compared to counterparts excised from younger fruits. In addition, the results showed that fruit could be stored for up to 3 wk prior to embryo isolation before their performance in cryopreservation was compromised.				sisunandar, sisunandar/C-9998-2016	sisunandar, sisunandar/0000-0002-4776-6412												1054-5476	1475-2689				DEC	2014	50	6					688	695		10.1007/s11627-014-9633-1							WOS:000346637300003						
J	Iannucci, A				Iannucci, Anna			Soil seed-bank germination patterns in natural pastures under different mineral fertilizer treatments	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Degraded native grasslands in Mediterranean areas can be improved by encouraging seedling regeneration from soil seed banks using chemical fertilization. The effect of mineral fertilizers on soil seed banks was studied in natural pastures at two locations in southern Italy: Carpino and Rignano Garganico. The aim was to determine if nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and combined nitrogen and phosphorus (NP) fertilization can promote increased soil seed density. The seed-bank size and composition were analysed over two growth cycles (2004-2006) at two periods of the year: at the early summer and at the early autumn. The plant species were classified into three functional groups: grasses, legumes and other species (all other dicots). A two-pool model (ephemeral and base pools) derived from the germination patterns was developed to quantify the dynamics of the germinated seed populations. The mean total seed number in the seed bank ranged from 2,915 to 4,782 seed m(-2) with higher values in early summer than in early autumn. Mineral fertilizer applications increased the seed-bank size (by 27%, 23% and 46%, for N, P and NP, respectively) and modified the composition in both localities. The three plant functional groups showed different potentials for ephemeral and persistent seed-bank production; however, within each plant group, the proportion between the ephemeral and base pool fractions did not change with fertilizer application. These data show that mineral fertilization can have positive effects on the seed-bank size of ungrazed natural pastures, and can be used to improve degraded Mediterranean pastures.																	1695-971X					DEC	2014	12	4					1018	1028		10.5424/sjar/2014124-6852							WOS:000346393700014

Its spread in introduced and native ranges often occurs on roadsides, where it builds stable and rapidly growing populations. The most sustainable way of controlling the population size of this species is to prevent seed production in order to deplete the soil seed bank. Populations on roadsides are submitted to regular mowing management, which can even exacerbate the situation by inducing resprouting after cutting or by accidentally spreading seeds along the road. The population density in the juvenile stages of development could play an important role in the success of cutting regimes, as it might influence the resprouting capacity of this plant. The influence of the juvenile population density and of seven cutting regimes, differing in the timing and frequency of cuts, on easily measurable reproductive traits was investigated in a glasshouse experiment. The cutting regimes had a strong influence on the reproductive success and on the phenology of the development stages of ragweed. The population density in the juvenile stages did not play a role in further phenological development, but did influence the reproductive traits. The reproduction of ragweed can be lowered by locally adapted combinations of the timing and frequency of mowing. As the optimal management option for the reduction of both the male and female flowers, the authors suggest a first cut just before the start of male flowering, followed by subsequent cuts every 3-4weeks.

In this study, we tested the effects of artificial soil disturbances on diversity of annual and perennial vascular plants and bryophytes in a field experiment in 86 agricultural grasslands differing in land use in two regions of Germany. On each grassland, we implemented four treatments: three treatments differing in application time of soil disturbances and one control. One year after experimental disturbance, we recorded vegetation and measured biomass productivity and bare ground. We analysed the disturbance response taking effects of region and land-use-accompanied disturbance regimes into account. Region and land-use type strongly determined plant species richness. Experimental disturbances had small positive effects on the species richness of annuals, but none on perennials or bryophytes. Bare ground was positively related to species richness of bryophytes. However, exceeding the creation of 12% bare ground further disturbance had a detrimental effect on bryophyte species richness, which corresponds to the IDH. As biomass productivity was unaffected by disturbance our results indicate that the disturbance effect on species richness of annuals was not due to decreased overall productivity, but rather due to short-term lowered inter- and intraspecific competition at the newly created microsites. Generally, our results highlight the importance of soil disturbances for species richness of annual plants and bryophytes in agricultural grasslands. However, most grasslands were disturbed naturally or by land-use practices and our additional experimental soil disturbances only had a small short-term effect. Overall, total plant diversity in grasslands seemed to be more limited by the availability of propagules rather than by suitable microsites for germination. Thus, nature conservation efforts to increase grassland diversity should focus on overcoming propagule limitation, for instance by additional sowing of seeds, while the creation of additional open patches by disturbance might only be appropriate where natural disturbances are scarce.

Influence of Item Distribution Pattern and Abundance on Efficiency of Benthic Core Sampling	WETLANDS												Core sampling is a commonly used method to estimate benthic item density, but little information exists about factors influencing the accuracy and time-efficiency of this method. We simulated core sampling in a Geographic Information System framework by generating points (benthic items) and polygons (core samplers) to assess how sample size (number of core samples), core sampler size (cm(2)), distribution of benthic items, and item density affected the bias and precision of estimates of density, the detection probability of items, and the time-costs. When items were distributed randomly versus clumped, bias decreased and precision increased with increasing sample size and increased slightly with increasing core sampler size. Bias and precision were only affected by benthic item density at very low values (500-1,000 items/m(2)). Detection probability (the probability of capturing a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 1 item in a core sample if it is available for sampling) was substantially greater when items were distributed randomly as opposed to clumped. Taking more small diameter core samples was always more time-efficient than taking fewer large diameter samples. We are unable to present a single, optimal sample size, but provide information for researchers and managers to derive optimal sample sizes dependent on their research goals and environmental conditions.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2014	34	6					1109	1121		10.1007/s13157-014-0570-x							WOS:000345613300006

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different weed control strategies on weed flora and composition under conservation agriculture (CA) systems in Zimbabwe. This study was conducted at three on-station trial sites namely Domboshawa Training Centre (DTC), University of Zimbabwe farm (UZ farm) and Henderson Research Station (HRS) in a maize soybean rotation for four seasons from 2009-2010 to 2012-2013 seasons. Hand weeding was done whenever weeds were 10 cm tall or 10 cm in circumference for weeds with a stoloniferous growth habit. Weed identification was done up to the weed species level, and the Shannon-Weiner diversity and evenness index was used to determine the response of weed flora to herbicides. Results showed that there were more weeds in the early years which decreased gradually until the final season. Weed species diversity was not affected by herbicide application and the results indicated that weed species diversity was small in CA systems. Annual weed species constituted a greater proportion of species, and species richness decreased with the duration of the study. Richardia scabra L and Galinsoga parviflora Cav, were the most common dominant weed species at all sites and in all seasons. Moreover, herbicide application had no effect on the evenness of weeds in the plots but site characteristics had a significant effect on the distribution of weed species (weed species evenness). The results presented in this study suggest that herbicide application facilitates a depletion of weed seed bank/number of weeds over time. Thus, herbicide application in CA has potential to reduce weed density, species richness and species diversity in the long term which may lead to more labour savings and larger yields.

J	Comte, J; Lindstrom, ES; Eiler, A; Langenheder, S				Comte, Jerome; Lindstrom, Eva S.; Eiler, Alexander; Langenheder, Silke			Can marine bacteria be recruited from freshwater sources and the air?	ISME JOURNAL												There is now clear evidence that microorganisms present biogeographic patterns, yet the processes that create and maintain them are still not well understood. In particular, the contribution of dispersal and its exact impact on local community composition is still unclear. For example, dispersing cells may not thrive in recipient environments, but may still remain part of the local species pool. Here, we experimentally tested if marine bacteria can be retrieved from freshwater communities (pelagic and sediment) and the atmosphere by exposing bacteria from three lakes, that differ in their proximity to the Norwegian Sea, to marine conditions. We found that the percentage of freshwater taxa decreased with increasing salinities, whereas marine taxa increased along the same gradient. Our results further showed that this increase was stronger for lake and sediment compared with air communities. Further, significant increases in the average niche breadth of taxa were found for all sources, and in particular lake water and sediment communities, at higher salinities. Our results therefore suggests that marine taxa can readily grow from freshwater sources, but that the response was likely driven by the growth of habitat generalists that are typically found in marine systems. Finally, there was a greater proportion of marine taxa found in communities originating from the lake closest to the Norwegian Sea. In summary, this study shows that the interplay between bacterial dispersal limitation and dispersal from internal and external sources may have an important role for community recovery in response to environmental change.

J	Brandt, M				Brandt, Marisa			Zapatista corn: A case study in biocultural innovation	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE												In November 2001, Nature published a letter in which University of California Berkeley's biologists claimed to have found evidence of genetically modified (GM) DNA in regional varieties of maize in Oaxaca, even though the Mexican government had banned transgenic corn agriculture in 1998. While urban protesters marched against the genetic contamination' of Mexican corn by US-based agricultural biotech firms, rural indigenous communities needed a framework for understanding concepts such as GM before they could take action. This article analyzes how the indigenous organization, the Zapatistas, mobilized a program to address this novel entity. Their anti-GM project entailed educating local farmers about genetics, importing genetic testing kits, seed-banking landrace corn and sending seeds to solidarity growers' around the world. This article explores material-semiotic translations to explain one of the central aspects of this project, the definition and circulation of Zapatista corn - an entity defined not only through cultural geography, but also technological means. Through its circulation, Zapatista corn serves to perform a biocultural engagement with Zapatista's political project of resistance to neoliberalism. While much has been written about both regulatory policy and consumer activism against GM in the Global North, Zapatista corn also provides a case study in indigenous, anti-GM activism founded on biocultural innovation and the creation of alternative networks for circulating corn.																	0306-3127	1460-3659				DEC	2014	44	6					874	900		10.1177/0306312714540060							WOS:000345573700004	25608442

Two kinds of persistent soil seed banks in an amphi-basicarpic cold-desert annual	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Several studies have compared seed banks of the different morphs of heteromorphic species, but none of them was on an amphi-basicarpic species. Our primary aim was to compare the relative ability of aerial and basal diaspores of an amphi-basicarpic species to form a seed bank. We compared the seed-bank dynamics of basal and aerial diaspores of three populations of the cold-desert annual Ceratocarpus arenarius growing in the Junggar Desert in north-western China. A 2.5-year experimental garden study compared germination phenology and retention of viability in basal (a) and aerial (c and f) morphs. Aerial morphs formed a modified Thompson and Grime type III seed bank (small proportion of seeds carried over to next year) and the basal morph a modified type IV seed bank (large proportion of seeds carried over to next year). Seeds germinated only in spring, and cumulative germination percentages were f > c > a (year 1), f = c > a (year 2) and f = c = a (year 3). The relationship between length of germination period, retention of viability during burial and relative ability to form a persistent seed bank was basal morph > aerial morphs. The results of this seed-bank study on C. arenarius are in full agreement with those published previously on seed dispersal and dormancy in this species. Thus, strong additional support is provided for a high risk-low risk germination strategy in this cold-desert annual.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				DEC	2014	24	4					293	300		10.1017/S0960258514000270							WOS:000344935900003

This reserve contributes to plant population persistence in unpredictable environments; thus, determining its presence is basic to understanding recruitment patterns and population dynamics. Studies of soil seed banks in the Cactaceae are scarce, although these plants are ecologically dominant in American arid and semi-arid environments. Most studies have inferred the presence of seed banks by analysing morphological seed traits or germination of seeds stored in the laboratory for different periods of time. Few studies have determined their presence through evaluation of distribution, density and longevity of seeds in the field. To fill this information gap, we determined the existence of, and studied, the soil seed bank of Stenocereus stellatus, a columnar cactus endemic to central Mexico. This study reports the evaluation of these characteristics in the field and discusses whether this species forms a soil seed bank. We found a higher number of seeds under shrubs than in areas lacking vegetation. Recently dispersed seeds did not germinate because they have primary dormancy. This dormancy was broken after 6 months of burial in the soil. Seeds buried for 10 months entered secondary dormancy and they were not viable at 24 months, probably because of pathogen attack. Considering dormancy and seed longevity, we suggest that S. stellatus has the potential to form a short-term persistent seed bank. However, this should be confirmed by conducting studies on other S. stellatus populations throughout their geographical distribution.

Distribution ranges of species have been proven to be affected by climate anomalies. Detecting the extent of protected species response to climate change can help formulate flexible conservation strategies to overcome the changing climate. Using species distribution modeling and high resolution climate data, we simulated current distribution patterns of 233 protected plants in China. Those patterns were then projected into future suitable habitats for each species under nine climate change scenarios, with no migration or full migration hypotheses. Under the most extreme climate change scenario (CGCM-B2a), we evaluated species extinction risks. Sixteen percent of protected plants are expected to lose more than 30 % of their current ranges. By calculating areal shifts, hotspots for emigrants, immigrants, and persistent species were identified under climate change. Flexible conservation strategies were addressed for those regions. Those strategies strongly depend on the migration types of species and sensitivity of the hotspots to changing climate. In hotspots for emigrants, the main conservation strategy is ex situ protection; protected species from these regions should be stored in seed banks or botanical gardens. For hotspots of immigrants, enough space should be maintained for new species, and some measures are necessary to assist dispersal. For hotspots of persistent species, more natural reserves are needed. We highlight related fields that can help conserve protected species in the future, such as conserving the soil seed bank and understanding of the effects of migration ability and interactions between protected species.																	1001-6538	1861-9541				DEC	2014	59	34					4652	4659		10.1007/s11434-014-0642-6							WOS:000344614800003

The germination strategies of widespread annual plants are unrelated to regional climate	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimEnvironmentally cued germination and seed banking are strategies employed by annual plants to persist in unpredictable climates. Moreover, such strategies may be key to persistence under more extreme and variable future climates. In regions with a mediterranean climate, cold-cued germination can allow populations to avoid germinating under unfavourable conditions and seed banks can buffer population growth in the face of inter-annual climate variability. Using widespread native annual plant species in the California Floristic Province (CFP), we ask: (1) How common are cold-cued germination and persistent seed banks? (2) Does the prevalence of cold-cued germination and seed bank maintenance shift predictably with climate? (3) Are germination strategies taxonomically linked? LocationCalifornia, USA. MethodsWe assessed seed bank persistence and temperature-cued germination in c. 175 populations of 42 species (eight families) from across California in the 2006 growing season. We then tested for evidence that the prevalence of these adaptations correlated with latitude, increasing climate variability and taxonomy. ResultsOnly 19% of populations had significantly cold-cued seed germination and only 52% of populations had detectable seed banks. There were no significant relationships between the prevalence of cold-cued germination and any climate factor. Seed banking was significantly more common in regions with warm, dry conditions in the preceding year, but was not related to long-term climate averages. Variance in temperature-cued germination was best explained at the species level, with no variance explained by family. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that germination of annual plants in the CFP is dominated by general risk aversion strategies rather than locally adaptive strategies linked to long-term climate factors. High germination variability within and among populations, coupled with increased seed banking under less favourable conditions, suggests that germination strategies are unlikely to limit this flora's persistence under an increasingly harsh and unpredictable climate.

J	Borkowska, L				Borkowska, Lidia			A seed bank inside a clonal plant: the case of the sedge Carex cespitosa on an unmowed grassland	PLANT ECOLOGY												This study examined a non-soil seed bank deposited inside the tussock cores of Carex cespitosa, a perennial plant with a tussock growth form. Based on the vertical structure of the seed bank in 20 tussock cores, the history of changes in plant species composition during succession in an unmowed grassland in the BiaowieA1/4a National Park was reconstructed. Three horizontal layers were distinguished in each tussock core: upper (corresponding to the initial forest stage), middle (transitory stage-forb and swamp communities) and bottom (early successional stage-grassland). The results showed that seeds of both the parental species and other species were stored inside the C. cespitosa tussock cores. More than 50,000 seedlings were found, representing 42 vascular plant species. The highest number of seedlings was recorded in the middle layer. Seedlings of swamp species were dominant in the upper layer, whereas seedlings of grassland species were dominant in the other layers. The highest number of C. cespitosa seedlings was observed in the upper layer. The most common seedlings in the middle layer belonged to the species Epilobium palustre, Lythrum salicaria and Cirsium palustre. In the bottom layer, the most common species of seedlings were grassland species, e.g. Lychnis flos-cuculi and Ranunculus repens. The protected seed bank inside this tussock species reflected recorded changes in species composition of these grasslands through time. Seed banks in this and other tussock-forming species represent a potentially useful tool for reconstructing recent developmental history of plant communities.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				DEC	2014	215	12					1423	1432		10.1007/s11258-014-0399-7							WOS:000344810900005

Implications of crude oil pollution on natural regeneration of plant species in an oil-producing community in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												The study evaluated the impact of crude oil pollution on natural regeneration of plant species in a major oil-producing community in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Three sites unpolluted site (US), polluted and untreated site (PUS), and polluted and treated site (PTS)-were purposively chosen for the study. The seedling emergence method was used to evaluate soil seed banks in the various sites at two depths, 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 20 cm. Woody-plant species richness, abundance, and diversity were higher in the US seed bank than in the PUS and PTS seed banks. The highest number of non-woody plants was observed in the US, followed by the PTS, and then the PUS. Both species richness and diversity of non-woody plants were highest at the US, followed by the PUS, and lowest in the PTS. Woody species in the US seed bank were 87.5% and 80% dissimilar with those of the PUS and PTS at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm respectively. No variation was observed between woody species in the PUS and PTS seed banks. Non-woody species at 0-10 cm US seed bank were 73.08% dissimilar with those of PUS at the two soil depths and 81.48/88.46% dissimilar with those of the 0-10/10-20 cm of the PTS respectively. At 10-20 cm, non-woody species of the US were 69.66% dissimilar with those from each of the two soil depths in PUS; and 73.91/81.82% dissimilar with those of 0-10/10-20 cm of the PTS respectively. Non-woody species variation between the PUS and PTS was higher at 10-20 cm than 0-10 cm. The poor seed bank attributes at the polluted sites demonstrates that crude oil pollution negatively affected the natural regeneration potential of the native flora because soil seed banks serve as the building blocks for plant succession. Thorough remediation and enrichment planting are recommended to support the recovery process of vegetation in the polluted areas.

Evaluating the restoration status of these plantations is essential for their long-term management. Based on our previous work, we used an ecological memory (EM) approach to evaluate four 26-year-old plantations that represent four common kinds of plantations in subtropical China, i.e., mixed broad-leaved plantation (MBP), mixed coniferous plantation (MCP), eucalyptus plantation (EP), and mixed legume plantation (MLP). Comparing them with the regional climax community, i.e., monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (BF), all four plantations accumulated nearly the same pattern of EM during succession. EM was > 50 % for soil minerals, light conditions, soil age, soil animals, and soil microbes. EM was about 25 % for soil pollen and 10 % for birds, soil seed bank, and plant species. The total EM value of the four plantations ranged from 50.96 to 52.54, which indicated that all four plantations were in the regional, natural trajectory of succession and between the early and medium successional stages. The results indicated that natural succession processes are unlikely to be accelerated by planting late-stage tree species without sufficient EM. The results also demonstrated that all four plantations were in positive successional trajectories, and the positive succession dynamics were greater in the MLP and MCP. We suggest that the entire natural succession trajectory be used to evaluate the restoration of a site and that the ultimate restoration target be divided into several milestones along the reference trajectory to monitor progress. Forest restoration may be accelerated by starting with a minimum dynamic unit supporting sufficient EM.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2014	186	12					8229	8247		10.1007/s10661-014-4000-6							WOS:000344349200014	25145281

In this article we provide an overview of the field of ex situ seed storage. We describe the basic guidelines of seed storage and how seed banks operate and manage genetic diversity. Focusing on the rare, wild plants of California, we examine the progress that has been made in long-term genetic conservation. We report data showing the numbers of rare taxa currently in seed bank storage, and show which institutions currently house seeds of Californian rare plant taxa. Using accession data from these institutions, we show that rare taxa with legal protection status under federal or state law have been relatively well covered in ex situ storage facilities (59% of taxa), while rare plants not afforded state or federal listing status have lower coverage (17% of taxa).																	0008-1078					WIN	2014	100	1			SI		79	85									WOS:000343275500009

Post-wildfire recovery of water yield in the Sydney Basin water supply catchments: An assessment of the 2001/2002 wildfires	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Wildfire is a recurring event which has been acknowledged by the literature to impact the hydrological cycle of a catchment. Hence, wildfire may have a significant impact on water yield levels within a catchment. In Australia, studies of the effect of fire on water yield have been limited to obligate seeder vegetation communities. These communities regenerate from seed banks in the ground or within woody fruits and are generally activated by fire. In contrast, the Sydney Basin is dominated by obligate resprouter communities. These communities regenerate from fire resistant buds found on the plant and are generally found in regions where wildfire is a regular occurrence. The 2001/2002 wildfires in the Sydney Basin provided an opportunity to investigate the impacts of wildfire on water yield in a number of catchments dominated by obligate resprouting communities. The overall aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a difference in water yield post-wildfire. Four burnt subcatchments and 3 control subcatchments were assessed. A general additive model was calibrated using pre-wildfire data and then used to predict post-wildfire water yield using post-wildfire data. The model errors were analysed and it was found that the errors for all subcatchments showed similar trends for the post-wildfire period. This finding demonstrates that wildfires within the Sydney Basin have no significant medium-term impact on water yield. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Schwarz, D; Thompson, AJ; Klaring, HP				Schwarz, Dietmar; Thompson, Andrew J.; Klaering, Hans-Peter			Guidelines to use tomato in experiments with a controlled environment	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is the most important horticultural crop worldwide. Low polymorphism at the DNA level conflicts with the wealth of morphological variation. Fruits vary widely in size, shape, and color. In contrast, genetic variation between the 16 wild relatives is tremendous. Several large seed banks provide tomato germplasm for both domesticated and wild accessions of tomato. Recently, the genomes of the inbred cultivar "Heinz 1706" (approximate to 900 Mb), and S. pimpinellifolium (739 Mb) were sequenced. Genomic markers and genome re-sequencing data are available for >150 cultivars and accessions. Transformation of tomato is relatively easy and T-DNA insertion line collections are available. Tomato is widely used as a model crop for fruit development but also for diverse physiological, cellular, biochemical, molecular, and genetic studies. It can be easily grown in greenhouses or growth chambers. Plants grow, flower, and develop fruits well at daily light lengths between 8 and 16 h. The required daily light integral of an experiment depends on growth stage and temperature investigated. Temperature must be 10-35 degrees C, relative humidity 30-90%, and, CO2 concentration 200-1500 mu mol mol(-1). Temperature determines the speed of the phenological development while daily light integral and CO2 concentration affect photosynthesis and biomass production. Seed to seed cultivation takes 100 days at 20 degrees C and can be shortened or delayed by temperature. Tomato may be cultivated in soil, substrates, or aeroponically without any substrate. Root volume, and water uptake requirements are primarily determined by transpiration demands of the plants. Many nutrient supply recipes and strategies are available to ensure sufficient supply as well as specific nutrient deficits/surplus. Using appropriate cultivation techniques makes tomato a convenient model plant for researchers, even for beginners.

Seed Dormancy, Seedling Establishment and Dynamics of the Soil Seed Bank of Stipa bungeana (Poaceae) on the Loess Plateau of Northwestern China	PLOS ONE												Studying seed dormancy and its consequent effect can provide important information for vegetation restoration and management. The present study investigated seed dormancy, seedling emergence and seed survival in the soil seed bank of Stipa bungeana, a grass species used in restoration of degraded land on the Loess Plateau in northwest China. Dormancy of fresh seeds was determined by incubation of seeds over a range of temperatures in both light and dark. Seed germination was evaluated after mechanical removal of palea and lemma (hulls), chemical scarification and dry storage. Fresh and one-year-stored seeds were sown in the field, and seedling emergence was monitored weekly for 8 weeks. Furthermore, seeds were buried at different soil depths, and then retrieved every 1 or 2 months to determine seed dormancy and seed viability in the laboratory. Fresh seeds (caryopses enclosed by palea and lemma) had non-deep physiological dormancy. Removal of palea and lemma, chemical scarification, dry storage (afterripening), gibberellin (GA(3)) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) significantly improved germination. Dormancy was completely released by removal of the hulls, but seeds on which hulls were put back to their original position germinated to only 46%. Pretreatment of seeds with a 30% NaOH solution for 60 min increased germination from 25% to 82%. Speed of seedling emergence from fresh seeds was significantly lower than that of seeds stored for 1 year. However, final percentage of seedling emergence did not differ significantly for seeds sown at depths of 0 and 1 cm. Most fresh seeds of S. bungeana buried in the field in early July either had germinated or lost viability by September. All seeds buried at a depth of 5 cm had lost viability after 5 months, whereas 12% and 4% seeds of those sown on the soil surface were viable after 5 and 12 months, respectively.																	1932-6203					NOV 14	2014	9	11							e112579	10.1371/journal.pone.0112579							WOS:000345558500061	25396423

Preston			Plant community - soil relationships in a topographically diverse grassland in southern interior British Columbia, Canada	BOTANY												The current management focus for many of British Columbia's grasslands is on sustaining their high natural and economic values in light of concerns over climate change and spread of exotic species. To that end, scientific information on plant community -soil -topographic relationships is required to assist with the often complex decisions that managers face. We collected data on vegetation, topography, and soil properties at 38 sites over a range of elevation zones and aspects at Lac du Bois Grasslands Provincial Park near Kamloops, British Columbia. Cluster analysis of the vegetation data validated the current three-zonal system used for grazing management but indicated that boundaries between adjacent plant communities are interspersed according to aspect. Principal component analysis (PCA) of environmental variables identified a gradient from the less productive, lower grasslands (higher soil bulk density, bare soil, coarse fragment content), to the more productive, upper grasslands (higher litter cover, total soil C and aggregate stability). Projection of six exotic species functional groups into the PCA-environment space showed significant associations of winter annuals with the lower grasslands, versus perennials (both clonal reproducers and seed bankers) with the upper grasslands. Our analysis showed promise in identifying fine-scale linkages between plant community patterns and key environmental factors. This approach may be useful as part of a proactive management plan for maintaining the health of British Columbia grasslands.

J	Cojzer, M; Diaci, J; Brus, R				Cojzer, Mateja; Diaci, Jurij; Brus, Robert			Tending of Young Forests in Secondary Succession on Abandoned Agricultural Lands: An Experimental Study	FORESTS												In Europe the area of forested land is increasing, largely due to forest development on abandoned agricultural lands. We compared the structure and composition of woody species in young stands undergoing secondary succession and within gaps of late-successional (LS) forest in Haloze (Slovenia) to derive management options. In a subset of plots in succession, silvicultural measures were carried out in one half, while the other half was left untreated. The attributes of crop trees and their competitor trees were monitored over five years, and a study on the time investment of tending was conducted. We found lower tree density, a larger share of pioneer and shrub species, and a higher diversity of woody plants in succession compared to regeneration within LS forest gaps. Tending resulted in greater density of crop trees, their better social position, fewer competitor trees, and a larger diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) increment, while differences in crop tree stability and quality between tending and control were not confirmed. Our results indicated great structural complexity and species diversity in young successional forests. Their tending represents a cost efficient method of recovering the long-term commercial value and ecosystem services of forests, if applied less intensively than traditional tending of LS forest.																	1999-4907					NOV	2014	5	11					2658	2678		10.3390/f5112658							WOS:000345531000005

Targeted Grazing of White Locoweed: Short-Term Effects of Herbivory Regime on Vegetation and Sheep	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												White locoweed (Oxytropis sericea Nuttall) and nontarget vegetation response to 2 yr of targeted grazing by sheep, one treatment of picloram plus 2, 4-D (HER) or no treatment (CON) were compared. Serum of sheep that grazed locoweed intermittently (IGZ, 5 d on locoweed followed by 3 d off locoweed) vs. counterparts that grazed locoweed continuously for 24 d (CGZ) was also examined. Alkaloid toxicity was inferred by serum levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and swainsonine, as well as behavior and body weight gains. Three sites were used in a randomized complete block design. IGZ, CGZ, and HER treatments reduced locoweed density (P < 0.01), canopy cover (P < 0.01), number of flower stalks (IGZ: P = 0.02, CGZ and HER: P = 0.01), and plant size (P < 0.01). White locoweed seed density in the soil seed bank was not reduced with grazing, and nontarget vegetation was mostly unaffected by treatments. Grass canopy cover increased in grazed and herbicide plots throughout the study (IGZ: P = 0.03, CGZ and HER: P < 0.01). Percentage bare ground was unchanged (IGZ: P = 0.46, CGZ: P = 0.44) in grazed plots but decreased (P = 0.03) in HER plots. After 24 d, ewes in the IGZ treatment had lower levels of serum ALKP (P < 0.01) and AST (P = 0.02) and marginally lower swainsonine levels (P < 0.07) than CGZ ewes that tended to exhibit lower serum T3 (P < 0.07) and similar serum T4 (P = 0.25) levels. Time spent feeding on locoweed tended to differ (P = 0.06) between treatments. Body weight gain was the same (P = 0.19) regardless of treatment. IGZ of locoweed-infested rangeland with sheep may be a viable short-term means of reducing locoweed density without detrimentally affecting animal health.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				NOV	2014	67	6					680	692		10.2111/REM-D-13-00035.1							WOS:000345325600010

The experimental design was a split-plot type in complete blocks with two factors: seeds buried at five different depth levels (soil surface and 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 cm) and seven exhumation dates. The blocks were allocated in natural grassland grazed by cattle, allocated in a 12-m-long transection. Fifty-four permeable nylon bags filled with 100 seeds in each division, with five vertical divisions, were buried in each row. Seven exhumation dates were used: the first on October 14, 2003 and the last on January 14, 2006. The percentage of viable seeds of E. plana, collected at seven exhumation times and set at different depths in the soil horizon, were described by simple negative exponential equations. Based on the model, the percentage of viable seeds collected at the five depths, (soil surface and 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 cm), after 2.5 years of burial, were 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 7.4 and 22.1%, respectively. Increase in depth is directly associated with physical and physiological seed integrity of E. plana. Negative simple exponential equations can be used to predict seed longevity of E. plana buried in nylon bags. This invader species accumulates soil seed-bank of high longevity.																	1806-9290					NOV	2014	43	11					561	567		10.1590/S1516-35982014001100001							WOS:000345435500001

The study documented changes in the soil seed-bank along riparian corridors before and after a major flood event in January 2011 in southeast Queensland, Australia. The study site was a major river (the Mooleyember creek) near Roma, Central Queensland impacted by the extreme flood event and where baseline ecological data on riparian seed-bank populations have previously been collected in 2007, 2008 and 2009. After the major flood event, we collected further soil samples from the same locations in spring/summer (November-December 2011) and in early autumn (March 2012). Thereafter, the soils were exposed to adequate warmth and moisture under glasshouse conditions, and emerged seedlings identified taxonomically. Flooding increased seed-bank abundance but decreased its species richness and diversity. However, flood impact was less than that of yearly effect but greater than that of seasonal variation. Seeds of trees and shrubs were few in the soil, and were negatively affected by the flood; those of herbaceous and graminoids were numerous and proliferate after the flood. Seed-banks of weedy and/or exotic species were no more affected by the flood than those of native and/or non-invasive species. Overall, the studied riparian zone showed evidence of a quick recovery of its seed-bank over time, and can be considered to be resilient to an extreme flood event.

In this study, we investigate whether signs of historical grassland management can be found in clear-cuts after at least 80years as coniferous production forest by comparing floras between clear-cuts with a history as meadow and as forest in the 1870s in Sweden. Study sites were selected using old land-use maps and data on present-day clear-cuts. Species traits reflecting high capacities for dispersal and persistence were used to explain any possible links between the plants and the historical land use. Clear-cuts that were formerly meadow had, on average, 36% higher species richness and 35% higher richness of grassland indicator species, as well as a larger overall seed mass and lower anemochory, compared to clear-cuts with history as forest. We suggest that the plants in former meadows never disappeared after afforestation but survived as remnant populations. Many contemporary forests in Sweden were managed as grasslands in the 1800s. As conservation of remaining grassland fragments will not be enough to reduce the existing extinction debts of the flora, these young forests offer opportunities for grassland restoration at large scales. Our study supports the concept of remnant populations and highlights the importance of considering historical land use for understanding the distribution of grassland plant species in fragmented landscapes, as well as for policy-making and conservation.

For plant invasions, however, the impact of invasion on soil seed bank communities has been under-studied. At six sites in southern Germany, we investigated whether areas invaded by Solidago gigantea and Solidago canadensis experienced a reduction in seed bank species richness, size and diversity, and a change in species composition compared to adjacent uninvaded areas. We found no overall effect of invasion on seed bank size, or on species richness and diversity. Seed bank size significantly decreased from 0-5 cm to 5-10 cm depth in both invaded and uninvaded areas. A significant amount of variation in species composition was explained by invasion, but it was only one-tenth of that explained solely by site effects. Our study suggests that invasion by Solidago species may not have the same impacts on the soil seed banks of native species as other invasive perennial forbs that have so far been studied.					van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701; Dawson, Wayne/0000-0003-3402-0774												1439-1791	1618-0089				NOV	2014	15	7					573	580		10.1016/j.baae.2014.08.009							WOS:000344622400003						
J	van Klinken, RD; White, AJ				van Klinken, R. D.; White, A. J.			The role of pre- and post-dispersal seed predation in determining total seed loss	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Most seed predation studies focus on either pre- or post-dispersal predation and may therefore underestimate the role of predation in regulating plant populations. We therefore estimated total seed predation of an invasive tree, mesquite (Leguminoseae: Prosopis spp.), by examining the entire seed pool from tree to seed bank. The spatio-temporal dynamics of total seed predation was examined by sampling across its Australian distribution and through time. The main predator was a host-specialist multivoltine beetle, Algarobius prosopis L. (Bruchidae), previously introduced as a biocontrol agent. Seed predation exceeded 20% in all seed stages (in pods on and off the tree, and seeds within woody endocarps (capsules) and free seeds on and in the ground) but was consistently highest in capsules on the ground (up to 90%). Pre-dispersal predation contributed little. Total seed predation rates were primarily determined by predation rates on the most persistent seed stage, in this case fallen pods if only pods are considered and seeds in capsules for the total seed pool. This pattern was consistent across the surveyed taxa, regions, years and seasonally. Predation rate was relatively unaffected by seed density, potentially because densities were always low (<150 seeds m(-2)). Average total seed predation within a region reached 55%, but we conclude that any population regulation of mesquite by seed predation will principally be through reduced seed bank persistence. Our results highlight the need to consider the entire seed pool, especially the often cryptic and overlooked long-lived stages, when determining seed loss to predation and its likely population consequences.				van Klinken, Rieks D/B-1772-2009	van Klinken, Rieks D/0000-0002-7578-8977												1439-1791	1618-0089				NOV	2014	15	7					581	589		10.1016/j.baae.2014.08.012							WOS:000344622400004

We sampled the buried seed and fern spore bank in Mabira Forest, a 300km(2) forest in central Uganda, to explore the effect of time since disturbance. Soil cores (5cm depth) were taken from 39 plots across three different classes of recovery': (1) not disturbed since 1950; (2) logged between 1950 and 1980; and (3) cleared for agriculture between 1970 and 1990 but reforested since. Plant emergence was monitored in a glasshouse. We predicted that the seed bank would reflect time since disturbance, with more pioneer species in recently disturbed stands, and that the fern spore bank would reflect stand age less closely due to greater dispersal capacity. We recorded a median 752 seeds per square meter, most of which were trees; the most abundant species was the invasive tree Broussonetia papyrifera. The fern spore bank was twice as dense, but 95 percent of fern spores were of one species, Christella parasitica. Tree seed density was significantly affected by time since disturbance with fewer seeds in the older stands. Herb seed density, fern spore density, and species richness for all groups were not significantly affected by time since disturbance. Neither seed bank nor fern spore bank closely resembled the aboveground vegetation. We compared our results to existing literature on seed banks in tropical forests, finding that our densities are relatively high for African forests, but low compared to the Neotropics and Australia. RESUME Les banques de graines contribuent a la regeneration des forets apres perturbation, mais nous savons encore peu de choses au sujet des banques de spores de fougeres, particulierement dans un contexte paleotropical. Nous avons enregistre les graines ainsi que les spores de fougeres enterrees dans la foret de Mabira, une foret de 300km(2) au centre de l'Ouganda, et explore l'impact du temps passe depuis une perturbation. Les echantillons de terre ont ete preleves jusqu'a 5cm de profondeur dans 39 parcelles caracterisees par differents degres de reconstruction: non perturbee depuis 1950, exploitee entre 1950 et 1980, et deboisee pour des fins d'agriculture entre 1970 et 1990 puis reboisee. L'emergence a ete suivie dans une serre. Nous avons predit que la banque de graines allait refleter le temps passe depuis la perturbation, avec davantage d'especes pionnieres dans les parcelles recemment perturbees, mais que ce patron serait moins remarquable pour la banque de spores en raison de meilleures capacites de dispersion. Nous avons enregistre une mediane de 752 graines par metre carre, dons la plupart etaient des graines d'arbres ; la graine la plus abondante etait le petit arbre invasif Broussonetia papyrifera. La banque de spores de fougeres etait deux fois plus dense mais 95 pourcent de ces spores appartenaient a une seule espece, Christella parasitica. La densite de graines d'arbres etait significativement affectee par le temps passe depuis la perturbation, avec moins de graines dans les parcelles les plus anciennes. La densite de graines d'herbes, la densite de spores de fougeres et la richesse specifique pour tous les groupes n'etaient pas significativement affectees par le temps passe depuis la perturbation.

Vegetation Recovery in Slash-Pile Scars Following Conifer Removal in a Grassland-Restoration Experiment	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												A principal challenge to restoring tree-invaded grasslands is the removal of woody biomass. Burning of slash piles to reduce woody residues from forest restoration practices generates intense, prolonged heating, with adverse effects on soils and vegetation. In this study, we examined vegetation responses to pile burning following tree removal from conifer-invaded grasslands of the Oregon Cascades. We quantified the longevity and magnitude of fire effects by comparing ground conditions and the cover and richness of plant species in burn-scar centers (higher-intensity fire) and edges (lower-intensity fire) with adjacent unburned vegetation 7 years after treatment. We interpreted patterns of recovery through the responses of species with differing growth forms, habitat affinities, and clonality. Cover of bare ground remained elevated at the centers, but not at the edges of scars; however, much of this effect was due to gopher disturbance. Total plant cover, consisting entirely of native species, was comparable in and adjacent to scars. However, richness remained depressed at the scar centers. Cover of grass, meadow, and non-clonal species was comparable in and adjacent to scars, but cover of forb, sedge, residual forest, and clonal species was reduced at the centers. Although scar centers had a simpler community structure (fewer but more abundant species) than the adjacent vegetation, they remained free of exotics and recovered quickly, aided by the soil-disturbing activities of gophers and the regenerative traits of native, disturbance-adapted species. Pile burning can be a viable and efficient approach to fuel reduction in the absence of exotics.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2014	22	6					731	740		10.1111/rec.12130							WOS:000344480300005

Resistance and resilience to changing climate and fire regime depend on plant functional traits	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Changing disturbance-climate interactions will drive shifts in plant communities: these effects are not adequately quantified by environmental niche models used to predict future species distributions. We quantified the effects of more frequent fire and lower rainfall - as projected to occur under a warming and drying climate - on population responses of shrub species in biodiverse Mediterranean-climate type shrublands near Eneabba, southwestern Australia. Using experimental fires, we measured the density of all shrub species for four dominant plant functional groups (resprouter/non-sprouterxserotinous/soil seed bank) before and after fire in 33 shrubland sites, covering four post-fire rainfall years and fire intervals from 3-24years. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to test our a priori hypotheses of rainfall, fire interval and plant functional type effects on post-fire survival and recruitment. At shortened fire intervals, species solely dependent on seedling recruitment for persistence were more vulnerable to local extinction than were species with both seedling recruitment and vegetative regrowth. Nevertheless, seedling recruitment was essential for population maintenance of resprouting species. Serotinous species were less resilient than soil seed storage species regardless of regeneration mode. Critically, in relation to changing climate, a 20% reduction in post-fire winter rainfall (essential for seedling recruitment) is predicted to increase the minimum inter-fire interval required for self-replacement by 50%, placing many species at risk of decline.Synthesis. Our results highlight the potentially deleterious biodiversity impacts of climate and fire regime change, and underscore weaknesses inherent in studies considering single impact factors in isolation. In fire-prone ecosystems characterized by a projected warming and drying climate, and increasing fire hazard, adaptive approaches to fire management may need to include heightened wildfire suppression and lengthened intervals for prescribed fire to best support the in situ persistence of perennial plant species and of plant biodiversity. This conclusion is at odds with the view that more managed fire may be needed to mitigate wildfire risk as climate warms.

Experimentally linking disturbance, resources and productivity to diversity in forest ground-layer plant communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Disturbance can function to maintain diversity within forest communities; however, specific mechanisms and the relationship to productivity are not well understood. We examined these linkages in forest ground-layer plant communities using a replicated, manipulative field experiment. Treatments included a range of gap sizes and untreated controls. We assessed spatial and temporal responses over the first three years following gap creation. Light transmittance and soil water content increased with gap size, while rates of colonization and species richness increased after a critical threshold. Subsequent increases in productivity were associated with declines in species richness, increased rates of local extirpation and a unimodal relationship between species richness and productivity at the individual quadrat scale (4 m(2)). The richness and productivity of vines, shrubs and especially graminoids, increased within 200-380m(2) gaps treatments. However, the productivity of forbs and tree seedlings did not, showing possible drought sensitivity overriding treatments. Spatial and temporal partitioning of gaps occurred as a result of interactions between species traits and environmental conditions. Significantly, productivity and richness showed complex relationships with canopy structure.Synthesis. Our results show that richness increases to an asymptote after a critical threshold in disturbance severity initially. Decreases in species richness over time associated with increases in productivity may eventually result in the unimodal relationship predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. However, species composition continues to differ with canopy gap size, suggesting a range of canopy gap sizes is required to maintain the greatest diversity of plant species over broader spatial and temporal scales.

Shrub recovery after fuel reduction treatments and a subsequent fire in a Spanish heathland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Fuel reduction treatments are commonly used nowadays to reduce wildfire hazard in northwestern Spain. Although prescribed fire has been widely used as a fuel reduction treatment, comparison with mechanical methods is scarce. In this study, we compared the effects of prescribed burning, clearing and mechanical shredding on shrub cover recovery, relative to untreated mature vegetation, in a heathland dominated by Erica umbellata Loefl. (L.) in Galicia (NW Spain). The fuel reduction treatments were applied in the spring of 2006, and the area was burned by an experimental fire in the spring of 2009. We evaluated shrub recovery, in comparison with an untreated control, after application of the above-mentioned fuel reduction treatments and also after an experimental fire 3 years later. Shrub cover and height remained lower than in the untreated control during the 3 years after application of the treatments, and the effects of the different treatments were not significantly different. The treatments did not affect species richness or seedling density during the 3-year interval. After the experimental fire, the only significant effect observed was an increase in grass cover in the areas treated by mechanical shredding and by prescribed fire relative to the control (untreated area); this effect lasted until the end of the study. Some consequences for management of this type of heathland are also discussed.

J	Warzecha, B; Parker, VT				Warzecha, Bernhard; Parker, V. Thomas			Differential post-dispersal seed predation drives chaparral seed bank dynamics	PLANT ECOLOGY												Animal community structure influences plant community structure in many ways, one of which is varying post-dispersal seed predation rates by different, sometimes distantly related animal taxa. In fire-prone mediterranean-climate vegetation, such as California chaparral, rodents are commonly assumed to be the most effective post-dispersal seed predators, which would render them the main driver for soil seed bank dynamics. This is a critical issue because the most dominant species of the chaparral rely on dormant, persistent soil seed banks to recruit after wildfires. Here, we used a series of exclusion experiments in combination with close video observation to show that granivorous birds are more effective than rodents in removing seeds of Ceanothus papillosus, a fire-dependent obligate seeder shrub of the California chaparral. We furthermore used seed traps and germination experiments to show that C. papillosus can have extremely high seed production and expresses strong intra and inter-annual seed bank dynamics. We conclude in contrast to other studies, that granivorous birds, in addition to rodents, are major determinants of C. papillosus seed bank densities. We also found that seed bank density increased between years, despite high seed predation rates. We conclude that high seed production in combination with small and dark seed design may help some seeds to stay undetected, thus allowing C. papillosus to build a sufficiently dense enough seed bank to regenerate after wildfire. Our results indicate that the ratio of granivorous birds to rodents has the potential to play a major role in shaping chaparral community structure by differentially impacting soil seed bank densities.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				NOV	2014	215	11					1313	1322		10.1007/s11258-014-0389-9							WOS:000344154400008						
J	Bajwa, AA				Bajwa, Ali Ahsan			Sustainable weed management in conservation agriculture	CROP PROTECTION												Sustainable crop production is necessary to ensure global food security and environmental safety. Conservation agriculture (CA) is gaining popularity around the globe due to its sustainable approaches such as permanent soil cover, minimal soil disturbance, planned crop rotations and integrated weed management. Weed control is the biggest challenge to CA adoption. Weed ecology and management is different in CA than in conventional agriculture. In CA, weeds expression, seed bank status, distribution, dispersal mechanisms, diversification, growing patterns and competition trends are complex and differ from conventional systems. It is due to reduced tillage of the soil and the flora that thrives in CA. Reduced tillage systems affect the efficacy of herbicides and mechanical weed control measures. So, it is an important task to find out the differences and to fabricate new management options. In this review, changing weed dynamics have been framed. A novel aspect of this review is the comprehensive account of sustainable weed management strategies in relation to CA. Modified tillage operations, improved cultural practices, bioherbicides, chemical herbicides, allelopathy, and crop nutrition have been identified as suitable weed management tools. None of these offers complete control but the integration of these tools in suitable combinations works efficiently. Weeds dominating CA and their responses to CA components are highlighted. For example, small seeded and perennial weeds are more abundant in CA. The role of herbicide resistance in weeds and herbicide tolerant (HT) crops in CA is also highlighted. Allelopathy and crop nutrition are discussed as modern weed management tools for CA. A detailed account of weed responses to fertilizer management options is also given. Integrated weed management compatible to cropping patterns and climatic conditions offers the best results in CA. Future efforts must be directed towards the optimization and integration of these weed management practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Limits to Understory Plant Restoration Following Fuel-Reduction Treatments in a Pion-Juniper Woodland	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												National fuel-reduction programs aim to reduce the risk of wildland fires to human communities and to restore forest and rangeland ecosystems to resemble their historical structure, function, and diversity. There are a number of factors, such as seed bank dynamics, post-treatment climate, and herbivory, which determine whether this latter goal may be achieved. Here, we examine the short-term (2 years) vegetation response to fuel-reduction treatments (mechanical mastication, broadcast burn, and pile burn) and seeding of native grasses on understory vegetation in an upland pion-juniper woodland in southeast Utah. We also examine how wildlife herbivory affects the success of fuel-reduction treatments. Herbaceous cover increased in response to fuel-reduction treatments in all seeded treatments, with the broadcast burn and mastication having greater increases (234 and 160 %, respectively) in herbaceous cover than the pile burn (32 %). In the absence of seeding, herbaceous cover only increased in the broadcast burn (32 %). Notably, fuel-reduction treatments, but not seeding, strongly affected herbaceous plant composition. All fuel-reduction treatments increased the relative density of invasive species, especially in the broadcast burn, which shifted the plant community composition from one dominated by perennial graminoids to one dominated by annual forbs. Herbivory by wildlife reduced understory plant cover by over 40 % and altered plant community composition. If the primary management goal is to enhance understory cover while promoting native species abundance, our study suggests that mastication may be the most effective treatment strategy in these upland pion-juniper woodlands. Seed applications and wildlife exclosures further enhanced herbaceous cover following fuel-reduction treatments.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2014	54	5					1139	1152		10.1007/s00267-014-0338-3							WOS:000344387800015	25064466

Cunn. ex G. Don	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Acacia cyclops is a widespread invader in Mediterranean-climate regions. However, although its naturalization in the Mediterranean Basin dates back only a few years ago, and the invasion process has not been studied hitherto. We investigated seedlings recruitment strategy adopted by A. cyclops in a small island (Lampedusa, Italy) where its natural regeneration was strictly confined under mother plants canopy. Healthy plants (DCP), plants at incipient senescence (SCP) and dead plants (DP) were distinguished according to vitality and canopy status. Living plants were also characterized in relation to leaf C and N isotope composition. Regeneration pattern (seedlings and saplings abundance) was related to the microclimatic differences (soil temperature, air temperature and humidity, soil nutrients, light) observed between canopies and adjacent open areas, and among canopy types. Living canopies ensure milder conditions, reducing extreme values as well as fluctuations between night and day. However, beneath canopies (DP, SCP and DCP) seedlings may benefit from significantly higher soil nutrients content than in the outside, while light availability was much higher under DP. Saplings to seedlings ratio was found to be around 12 under DP, while under SCP it was slightly higher than 1, and just less than 0.5 under DCP. Moreover, saplings growth was significantly higher under SCP and DP, suggesting a prominent role of light in driving seedlings recruitment. Stable isotope analyses of C and N provided ecophysiological information in relation to changes in canopies structure. Thus, while seedling stage appears to be more nutrient-limited, subsequent sapling stage is much more light-limited. Although the species is not yet displaying an invasive spreading on the island, our study provides clear evidence that senescent canopies are better facilitators than healthy in preserving the invasive potential of A. cyclops. This finding suggests some best practices in order to gradually reduce the presence of the alien species within its pristine nuclei of introduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, L; Gao, G; Tang, XM; Shao, KQ				Zhang, Lei; Gao, Guang; Tang, Xiangming; Shao, Keqiang			Can the freshwater bacterial communities shift to the "marine-like" taxa?	JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY												A mesocosm experiment was used to study the response of a freshwater bacterial community to increasing salinity. Bacterial community composition in the control and saline groups was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the 16S rRNA genes, followed by clonal sequencing of eight selected samples. Cluster analysis and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bacterial communities in pre- and post-salt addition samples were significantly different. Detailed analysis showed: (i) the existing bacterial taxa markedly declined from freshwater to hypersaline habitats, although some taxa maintain balanced growth over a small salinity range through inter-genus changes in community structures; (ii) the addition of salt induced a clear shift in the community structure toward a striking increase in the relative abundance of the latent "marine-like" genera (e. g., Alcanivorax and Roseovarius). The reasons may be that freshwater bacteria adapt to live in low salt concentrations and low osmotic pressure. They were not adapted to high concentrations of salt, and their acute response to increasing salinity resulted in significantly decreased numbers. However, as the salinity increases, rare members of the ever-present community (rare or dormant bacterial taxa in the "microbial seed bank") rise to the fore, while previous dominant members drop away. This study provides direct evidence for bacterial succession from halosensitive taxa in freshwater to halotolerant ones in response to water salinization.																	0233-111X	1521-4028				NOV	2014	54	11					1264	1272		10.1002/jobm.201300818							WOS:000345212400015	24687773

Could recently locally extinct population patches of Astragalus nitidiflorus regenerate from the soil seed bank?	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Persistence, distribution, and dynamics of Astragalus nitidiflorus soil seed bank, a critically endangered species of southern Spain, were studied during four consecutive years to determine their importance to regenerate locally extinct patches of the only known A. nitidiflorus population worldwide. The spatial distribution of seeds in the soil was highly influenced by the presence/absence of adult plants and by the indehiscent trait of the fruit. Results showed that most seeds were present on the soil surface, inside the fruit and close to the mother plant. Seed longevity was low, but higher for seeds protected by fruit than for single ones after two years buried in the soil. This species is able to form a short-term persistent soil seed bank that is strongly influenced by environmental factors and population fluctuations. Based on these results, natural regeneration of local patches where plants of A. nitidiflorus are no longer present is unlikely from the soil seed bank and population recovery should be attempted by sowing seeds or planting new specimens.

The development of herbicides based on natural metabolites from microbial and plant origin, targeting early stages on parasitic plant development, might contribute to the reduction of broomrape seed bank in agricultural soils. Therefore, the effect of metabolites belonging to different classes of natural compounds on broomrape seed germination and radicle development was assayed in vitro. Among the metabolites tested, epi-sphaeropsidone, cyclopaldic acid, and those belonging to the sesquiterpene class induced broomrape germination in a species-specific manner. epi-Epoformin, sphaeropsidin A, and cytochalasans inhibited germination of GR24-treated broomrape seeds. The growth of broomrape radicle was strongly inhibited by sphaeropsidin A and compounds belonging to cyclohexene epoxide and cytochalasan classes. Broomrape radicles treated with epi-sphaeropsidone developed a layer of papillae while radicles treated with cytochalasans or with sphaeropsidin A turned necrotic. These findings allow new lead natural herbicides for the management of parasitic weeds to be identified.

Seed arrival and persistence at the tidal mudflat: identifying key processes for pioneer seedling establishment in salt marshes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Salt marshes are highly valuable ecosystems that provide numerous important ecosystem services. Given the global marsh decline, there is a pressing need to understand the natural bottlenecks and thresholds to their establishment and long-term ecological maintenance. Seed presence in the right place and time is a prerequisite for pioneer establishment. We performed field surveys and manipulative seed-bank experiments on 2 mudflats with different levels of exposure in the Westerschelde, The Netherlands, to identify patterns of seed arrival and persistence and their role in determining seed bank abundance. Seed arrival decreased with distance from the seed-source area, i.e. the salt marsh, resulting in seeds being deposited on the mudflat close to the marsh edge. Once arrived, most of the surface seeds were washed away during subsequent tides, with retention of <20%. However, seed burial enhanced seed retention nonlinearly with increasing burial depth. Predation was not a major cause of seed loss. These results point to the importance of hydro dynamic and morphodynamic processes to both lateral seed dispersal and vertical seed burial on tidal flats and, therefore, suggest that saltmarsh establishment and expansion are closely linked to the physical dynamics of the entire estuarine system.

Recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks, wildfire severity, and postfire tree regeneration in the US Northern Rockies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Widespread tree mortality caused by outbreaks of native bark beetles (Circulionidae: Scolytinae) in recent decades has raised concern among scientists and forest managers about whether beetle outbreaks fuel more ecologically severe forest fires and impair postfire resilience. To investigate this question, we collected extensive field data following multiple fires that burned subalpine forests in 2011 throughout the Northern Rocky Mountains across a spectrum of prefire beetle outbreak severity, primarily from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae). We found that recent (2001-2010) beetle outbreak severity was unrelated to most field measures of subsequent fire severity, which was instead driven primarily by extreme burning conditions (weather) and topography. In the red stage (0-2 y following beetle outbreak), fire severity was largely unaffected by prefire outbreak severity with few effects detected only under extreme burning conditions. In the gray stage (3-10 y following beetle outbreak), fire severity was largely unaffected by prefire outbreak severity under moderate conditions, but several measures related to surface fire severity increased with outbreak severity under extreme conditions. Initial postfire tree regeneration of the primary beetle host tree [lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia)] was not directly affected by prefire outbreak severity but was instead driven by the presence of a canopy seed-bank and by fire severity. Recent beetle outbreaks in subalpine forests affected few measures of wildfire severity and did not hinder the ability of lodgepole pine forests to regenerate after fire, suggesting that resilience in subalpine forests is not necessarily impaired by recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks.

The role of macrobiota in structuring microbial communities along rocky shores	PEERJ												Rocky shore microbial diversity presents an excellent system to test for microbial habitat specificity or generality, enabling us to decipher how common macrobiota shape microbial community structure. At two coastal locations in the northeast Pacific Ocean, we show that microbial composition was significantly different between inert surfaces, the biogenic surfaces that included rocky shore animals and an alga, and the water column plankton. While all sampled entities had a core of common OTUs, rare OTUs drove differences among biotic and abiotic substrates. For the mussel Mytilus californianus, the shell surface harbored greater alpha diversity compared to internal tissues of the gill and siphon. Strikingly, a 7-year experimental removal of this mussel from tidepools did not significantly alter the microbial community structure of microbes associated with inert surfaces when compared with unmanipulated tidepools. However, bacterial taxa associated with nitrate reduction had greater relative abundance with mussels present, suggesting an impact of increased animal-derived nitrogen on a subset of microbial metabolism. Because the presence of mussels did not affect the structure and diversity of the microbial community on adjacent inert substrates, microbes in this rocky shore environment may be predominantly affected through direct physical association with macrobiota.

Large scale germplasm screening for identfication of novel rice blast resistance sources	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Rice is a major cereal crop that contributes significantly to global food security. Biotic stresses, including the rice blast fungus, cause severe yield losses that significantly impair rice production worldwide. The rapid genetic evolution of the fungus often overcomes the resistance conferred by major genes after a few years of intensive agricultural use. Therefore, resistance breeding requires continuous efforts of enriching the reservoir of resistance genes/alleles to effectively tackle the disease. Seed banks represent a rich stock of genetic diversity, however, they are still under-explored for identifying novel genes and/or their functional alleles. We conducted a large-scale screen for new rice blast resistance sources in 4246 geographically diverse rice accessions originating from 13 major rice-growing countries. The accessions were selected from a total collection of over 120,000 accessions based on their annotated rice blast resistance information in the International Rice Genebank. A two-step resistance screening protocol was used involving natural infection in a rice uniform blast nursery and subsequent artificial infections with five single rice blast isolates. The nursery-resistant accessions showed varied disease responses when infected with single isolates, suggesting the presence of diverse resistance genes/alleles in this accession collection. In addition, 289 accessions showed broad-spectrum resistance against all five single rice blast isolates. The selected resistant accessions were genotyped for the presence of the Pi2 resistance gene, thereby identifying potential accessions for isolation of allelic variants of this blast resistance gene. Together, the accession collection with broad spectrum and isolate specific blast resistance represent the core material for isolation of previously unknown blast resistance genes and/or their allelic variants that can be deployed in rice breeding programs.

Vertical Distribution of Euphorbia davidii Subils Seedbank in Agricultural Lots in the Center of Buenos Aires Province Argentina	PLANTA DANINHA												Euphorbia davidii Subils a summer annual weed, that is present in the center of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Field studies were conducted to determine the seed banks and the vertical distribution of this specie in agricultural lots, in Azul and Olavarria. Two hundred forty soil samples, from 60 randomly distributed points were extracted at four soil depths: 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm. Extractions were carried out twice a year, in May and September. Samples were processed and seeds separated by wet sieving. Germination and viability were assessed by triphenyltetrazolium test. Were quantified 30,000 and 15,000 seeds m(-2) in Azul and Olavarria, respectively. In Olavarria, 79% of the seeds were found of 0-5 cm depth, 14% of 5-10 cm and the remaining 7% of 10-20 cm depth. In Azul a more homogeneus vertical distribution was observed. The 55% of seeds were found at 0-5 cm, 24% depth; 24% at 5-10 cm, 16% at 10-15 cm and 5% in the deepest sampling. Differences in distribution were related to flock management. In both sites the viability of seeds from the surface layer exceeded 70%. In Olavarria seeds collected of superficial layers immediately after dehiscence showed dormancy. In return, in seeds from Azul collected at the same time of sampling. Dormance was not be observed.					Chantre, Guillermo/0000-0002-4424-0204												0100-8358	1806-9681				OCT-DEC	2014	32	4					709	718									WOS:000348367500005

BUILDING A FOUNDATION: LAND-USE HISTORY AND DENDROCHRONOLOGY REVEAL TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF A TSUGA CANADENSIS (PINACEAE) FOREST	RHODORA												We used historical documents, stand mapping, and new methods of dendrochronological analysis to reconstruct 250 y of land-use history of the Simes Tract in Petersham, MA. These data were then used to interpret the origin of the current forest's stand structure within the experimental plots of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment within the Simes Tract, an experiment that examines the effects of the ongoing decline of Tsuga canadensis on forest ecology. Data from tree cores revealed that the trees in the experimental plots were < 150 y old. These trees have established continually since the 1870s, with recruitment pulses following successive episodes of land division and re-aggregation, logging, irruptions of nonnative insects and pathogens, two moderate droughts, and the 1938 "Great Hurricane''. Our new method of dendrochronological analysis used generalized additive models and focused on year-to-year dynamics to highlight associations between fine-scale changes in tree growth, and both episodic (pulse) and longer-term environmental and biotic drivers. Tsuga canadensis, hypothesized to be a foundation species in this system, achieved its current dominance at the Simes Tract by responding rapidly, both positively and uniformly across age classes, in the 1920s to three concomitant environmental changes that had occurred in the preceding two decades: loss of Castanea dentata to the chestnut blight; selective logging; and a similar to 7 y drought. In contrast, Betula lenta, Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum, and Pinus strobus have declined in importance since the early 1900s in stands otherwise dominated by T. canadensis. Acer rubrum and P. strobus were selectively harvested or severely damaged by the 1938 hurricane, the peak of B. lenta establishment followed the 1938 hurricane, and Q. rubra growth was impacted by the severe 1981 gypsy moth outbreak. Together, the data illustrate the contingent nature of the establishment dynamics of a foundation species in a New England forest and suggest a more nuanced approach to the role of T. canadensis as a foundation species.

J	Ward, MJ; Ryan, MR; Curran, WS; Law, J				Ward, Meredith J.; Ryan, Matthew R.; Curran, William S.; Law, Jeffrey			Giant Foxtail Seed Predation by Harpalus pensylvanicus (Coleoptera: Carabidae)	WEED SCIENCE												The utility of biological control for weed management in agroecosystems will increase with a greater understanding of the relationships between common weed and granivore species. Giant foxtail is an introduced, summer annual grass weed that is common throughout the United States and problematic in numerous crops. Harpalus pensylvanicus (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Carabidae) is a common, native, omnivorous carabid beetle with a range that overlaps giant foxtail. In 2004 and 2005, H. pensylvanicus was captured from farm fields in Centre County, PA, and subjected to laboratory feeding trials to test the preference of giant foxtail and other species on predation by H. pensylvanicus. Weed species seed preference experiments that included "Choice" and "No Choice" treatments were conducted using giant foxtail, common lambsquarters, and velvetleaf. When given a choice amongst the three weed species, H. pensylvanicus preferred giant foxtail and common lambsquarters seeds equally compared to velvetleaf seeds. When given the choice, H. pensylvanicus preferred newly dispersed giant foxtail seeds over field-aged seeds. Phenology of giant foxtail seed shed relative to H. pensylvanicus activity density was also quantified in field experiments in 2005 and 2006. Giant foxtail seed rain was determined by collecting shed seeds from August through October using pan traps. Activity density of H. pensylvanicus was monitored for 72-h periods using pitfall traps from June to October. Peak activity density of H. pensylvanicus occurred at the onset of giant foxtail seed shed in both years; however, giant foxtail seed shed peaked approximately 30 to 50 d after H. pensylvanicus activity density. Future research should focus on management practices that enhance and support H. pensylvanicus populations later in the growing season to maximize suppression of giant foxtail and other weeds that shed palatable seeds later in the season.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				OCT-DEC	2014	62	4					555	562		10.1614/WS-D-14-00010.1							WOS:000346362900001

Assessing Status, Capacity, and Needs for the Ex Situ Conservation of the Hawaiian Flora	PACIFIC SCIENCE												The flora of the Hawaiian Islands has one of the highest rates of endemism in the world, and over half of all taxa are at risk of endangerment or extinction. When in situ management alone cannot protect plant populations, maintaining viable germplasm using ex situ storage methods will prevent species extinctions. Germplasm collections with high conservation value are genetically diverse, representative of taxa and populations, and have a well-documented history in cultivation. Ex situ facilities and conservation agencies were surveyed to determine if existing ex situ capacity was sufficient to represent Hawai'i's species of conservation importance (SCI) and to identify limiting factors. SCI were defined and their representation in ex situ collections quantified, the number of wild plants and populations were estimated, and the attempted ex situ methods were recorded. There are 724 SCI, 528 of which are located in at least one facility. Sixty-four percent of the secured taxa are represented by collections from only 10% or fewer of the wild plants. Seed banks have secured more SCI, and with better in situ representation, than any other ex situ method. Seventy-eight percent of SCI have seeds with long-term storage potential. Existing seed storage facilities are currently inadequate for representing all SCI and should be expanded. SCI with low long-term potential in conventional seed storage can be represented in cryopreservation, micropropagation facilities, nurseries, and botanical gardens. Recommendations include establishing a network to coordinate collections, improve data management, and draft conservation plans with ex situ collection goals. This type of assessment can be applied to other regions that do not have a unified and consistent method of tracking ex situ representation.																	0030-8870	1534-6188				OCT	2014	68	4					525	536		10.2984/68.4.6							WOS:000345309400006

Vegetation Dynamics after Spring and Summer Fires in Red and White Pine Stands at Voyageurs National Park	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Conducting dormant season or springtime prescribed fire treatments has become a common practice in many regions of the United States to restore ecosystems to their natural state. Despite the knowledge that historically, fires often occurred during the summer, the application of summer burns has been deterred, in part, by a lack of understanding of fire season effects on vegetation. We explored the differences in fire effects between spring and summer burns at Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. The fire season effects on the ground layer vegetation were clearly different among the treatments: pre-burn, spring, and summer. Vegetation composition of pre-burn and after spring fires was similar, but differed significantly from the summer fires. Spring fires propagated the same species that were present prior to the fire, whereas summer fires promoted a new suite of species through the germination of seedbank and high seed dispersal species. Cover and richness of seed bank and intolerant species were greatest after the summer fires, which contributed to the peak in richness found across all reproductive and tolerance attributes five years after these fires. Post summer fire composition showed shifts in composition through time. Substantial differences in the effects of burn seasonality on ground layer vegetation should be considered in long term restoration efforts to help maintain species diversity in red and white pine forest ecosystems.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				OCT	2014	34	4					443	458		10.3375/043.034.0406							WOS:000344601800006						
J	Griffith, AB				Griffith, Alan B.			Secondary Dispersal in Aeschynomene virginica: Do Floating Seeds Really Find a New Home?	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Aeschynomene virginica is a freshwater, tidal plant ranging from southern New Jersey to central North Carolina. This plant is listed as threatened in the United States. Population sizes vary greatly from year to year and population sites are often unoccupied several years before re-establishment. Despite long-term population monitoring and experiments, it is not clear if seed banks and seed dispersal or only seed banks re-establish unoccupied population sites. The removal of a dam on Vandell Preserve, New Kent County, Virginia, created a natural experiment that helps clarify the role of seed bank and seed dispersal processes. The establishment of new A. virginica populations on long-covered soils devoid of a seed bank would indicate successful seed dispersal. I review the seed bank and seed dispersal research for A. virginica and map populations before and after dam removal. Past research suggests A. virginica forms only a short-term seed bank that does not persist in buried or inundated soils. A survivorship model of buried seeds indicates maximum seed survival of eight years. Dispersal studies show that seeds leave populations floating on tidal streams, but the fate of these floating seeds is unknown. After dam removal, populations established on soils that had been covered by the dam or water for approximately 60 years. Hence, seeds can and do disperse from existing populations, float to unoccupied population sites, and establish populations. This knowledge will allow us to focus questions regarding the dynamics of re-established population sites. In addition, the results of this natural experiment show that A. virginica populations form metapopulations, in which the seed bank and seed dispersal jointly impact population extinction and re-establishment.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				OCT	2014	34	4					488	494		10.3375/043.034.0411							WOS:000344601800011

Habitat Factors and Species' Traits Influence Riparian Community Recovery Following Removal of Bohemian Knotweed (Polygonum x bohemicum)	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Removal of invasive plants to restore native community structure and function is an important component of riparian management in the Pacific Northwest, USA. However, little is known about the role of habitat factors and species' traits in mediating recovery of native riparian systems following removal of invasives. We experimentally investigated the response of riparian understories to removal of Bohemian knotweed (Polygonum x bohemicum). We measured abundance, diversity, and composition of herbaceous and woody species before and for two years after removal. Knotweed removal resulted in rapid and abundant colonization of native woody species and of native and non-native forbs. Variation in the responses of these groups was most commonly associated with two habitat factors, height above channel and depth of knotweed litter. Knotweed litter benefited native forbs (predominantly forest perennials) relative to non-native forbs (predominantly light-demanding annuals). Natives, which are adapted to natural burial by canopy litterfall, showed a neutral response to litter depth, but non-natives showed a negative response. These results illustrate that knotweed removal can be highly effective in initiating riparian understory recovery. The conditions under which post-removal legacies of invasive species can improve native community recovery is a fertile area for research and speaks to the importance of understanding the ways in which species' traits can influence management outcomes.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				OCT	2014	88	3					246	260		10.3955/046.088.0307							WOS:000344487100006

Sediment samples from one lake (Lake FS, Russia, oblast Tscheljabinsk; 50 degrees-54 degrees N, 59 degrees-62 degrees E) contained oospores of Characeae which were transferred to water containers to test their viability. Oospores of Nitella mucronata (A. Braun) Miguel (Characeae) germinated and completed their lifecycle coming from a sediment depth of more than 50 cm. Radiocarbon datings derived from seeds of the same depth of the lake sediments imply an age over 300 years (339 +/- 33 uncal. BP (1469-1641 cal. AD) and 386 +/- 36 uncal. BP (1440-1633 cal. AD).

They can serve as effective tools in achieving the goal of restoring wetland vegetation. Potamogeton coloratus, an aquatic plant of shallow, calcareous waters, has become critically endangered or vanished in large regions of its mainly European range. In the Czech Republic, it was observed in 1977 for the last time (prior to our restoration project) and has been classified as an extinct species. We successfully re-established one population of it, and also established a new one, both located in a fen complex from which it has been absent for more than 30 years. One population was restored in a desilted pool in which the species had occurred previously; the other was established in a newly created pool by means of transferring soil, including the seed bank, from a pool in which the species formerly occurred. Monitoring of these sites over subsequent years confirmed establishment and increase of the populations. Along with the target species, other rare, native aquatic plants (e.g. Utricularia vulgaris and Chara hispida) were found growing in the newly created pool. Propagules of these species were also detected in the sediment collected in the old pool prior the desilting and subjected to soil seed bank analysis. Although altogether 26 plant species were identified in the soil seed bank, no propagules of P. coloratus were detected, most likely due to their small number in the sediment analyzed.

Use of coir rolls for habitat enhancement of urban river walls	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Heavily engineered urban rivers suffer from a lack of riparian habitat that compromises the diversity and composition of plant assemblages that could exist within such ecosystems. Ecological engineering techniques may be a valuable way of facilitating a greater range of species to exist on artificial surfaces such as flood defence walls, where other habitat enhancement opportunities are severely limited. The first step in determining the applicability of wall modifications is to establish what the potential species pool might be. In this study, coir seed traps were established at 12 sites along the River Thames through central London to determine the diversity and composition of the seeds deposited in comparison to those species spontaneously colonising the walls. Limited similarity (47% overall, mean of 20 % per site) of species was recorded, indicating that there is substantial opportunity for improvement of the wall flora if suitable habitat could be provided. Coir acted as effective seed traps, though deposition was influenced by trap height on the wall surface and distance downstream. Coir may therefore act as an effective medium for seed trapping and germination within particular environmental boundaries, for the improvement of flood defence walls using ecological engineering modifications.

We recorded the number of flower stems in the vegetation in relation to light attenuation along an encroachment series progressing from open alvar through small gaps inside dense scrub of Juniperus communis (cover of 60%) to intact dense scrub (cover of 100%) on the island of oland, Sweden. This measurement of potential reproduction (number of flower stems) was then compared to the number of species in the soil seed bank at each site along the alvar encroachment series. Scrub encroachment results in light attenuation between and under the shrubs. The total number of flower stems averaged over all species was similar between gaps and open alvar, but that of alvar species was significantly lower in the gaps, indicating that light attenuation could reduce their seed set. Shading in gaps is related to depletion of the soil seed bank and loss of alvar species, particularly those that do not form a persistent soil seed bank.

Tangible variations in grassland areas in regions susceptible to landslides can only be found within collections of trees. A landslide area in the Sule Watershed was investigated. Relative illuminance results reveal that the Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) biomass in this landslide area increases with relative illuminance. A comparison of regions with tree islands indicates that the size of the grassland areas decreased and the number of tree islands increased during 2005-2010. Furthermore, a germination experiment in a soil-seed bank indicates that more woody plant species exist around the tree island than in other areas in the landslide region. Trees in a tree island change the micro-climate of the landslide region, and they gather as many nutrients and as much moisture as possible, enabling vegetation to expand around the tree island. Additionally, the area with Rhodes grass and its biomass declined annually in the tree island region. Investigation results show that tree islands and soil-seed banks are suited to reforestation in landslide regions. The pioneering research will assist regional landslide management in Taiwan.																		2071-1050				OCT	2014	6	10					6766	6780		10.3390/su6106766							WOS:000344355700014

Don and Betula pubescens Ehrh.: tree growth, understorey biomass and vascular plant biodiversity	FORESTRY												In the European Union, the majority of afforestation is carried out on former agricultural land. This afforestation causes fundamental changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, with the trees intercepting light and precipitation, producing litterfall and competing for soil nutrients. All of these effects could potentially have a negative impact on understorey biomass and vascular plant biodiversity in a relatively short time span. This study aims to evaluate the effects of afforestation with Pinus radiata D. Don (Monterey pine: pine) and Betula pubescens Ehrh. (Downy birch: birch), established at two different densities (2500 and 833 trees ha 21) and sown with two different pasture mixtures (Dactylis glomerata L. + Trifolium repens L. + Trifolium pratense L. and Lolium perenne L. + T. repens L. + T. pratense L.), on understorey biomass, alpha plant biodiversity, life cycle type (annuals vs. perennials) and beta biodiversity over a period of 11 years. Pine showed better development than birch throughout the study, although both species were very sensitive to tree density. While increasing density increased pine height and decreased pine diameter, both aspects of birch development were reduced by higher tree densities. Aboveground biomass increased throughout the study. Alpha plant biodiversity was drastically reduced under pine established at high density, 11 years after afforestation. However, the similarities in species richness, species composition and the low beta growth rates found under pine at low density, and birch at both high and low density suggest that, in these cases, the choice of canopy tree has little consequence for understorey biodiversity at this stage of system development.

Non-serotinous woody plants behave as aerial seed bank species when a late-summer wildfire coincides with a mast year	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1 Trees which lack obvious fire-adaptive traits such as serotinous seed-bearing structures or vegetative resprouting are assumed to be at a dramatic disadvantage in recolonization via sexual recruitment after fire, because seed dispersal is invariably quite constrained. We propose an alternative strategy in masting tree species with woody cones or cone-like structures: that the large clusters of woody tissue in a mast year will sufficiently impede heat transfer that a small fraction of seeds can survive the flaming front passage; in a mast year, this small fraction would be a very large absolute number. 2 In Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, we examined regeneration by Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), a non-serotinous conifer, after two fires, both of which coincided with mast years. Coupling models of seed survivorship within cones and seed maturation schedule to a spatially realistic recruitment model, we show that (1) the spatial pattern of seedlings on a 630 m transect from the forest edge into the burn was best explained if there was in situ seed dissemination by burnt trees; (2) in areas several hundred meters from any living trees, recruitment density was well correlated with local prefire cone density; and (3) spruce was responding exactly like its serotinous codominant, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). 3 We conclude that non-serotinous species can indeed behave like aerial seed bank species in mast years if the fire takes place late in the seed maturation period. Using the example of the circumpolar boreal forest, while the joint probability of a mast year and a late-season fire will make this type of event rare (we estimate P = 0.1), nonetheless, it would permit a species lacking obvious fire-adapted traits to occasionally establish a widespread and abundant cohort on a large part of the landscape.

J	Sanchez-Yelamo, MD				Sanchez-Yelamo, M. D.			Characterisation of wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) based on isoenzyme data. Considerations on the current status of this taxon in Spain	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												As a part of a wide project to determine the conservation status and collecting expeditions of wild plant genetic resources of genus Brassica (species n = 9) of the Iberian Peninsula, twenty-nine wild populations of Brassica oleracea L. were characterised using the isoenzymatic profiles of seeds collected from their natural habitats. The zymograms, obtained using bulking seeds, identified samples faster than other methodologies, which could be useful in seed bank management as well as the regular monitoring of the status of in situ conservation. Five isoenzymatic systems were analysed considering the electrophoretic phenotype of the whole population (not individuals). Using enzymatic bands as qualitative characters, data were evaluated using phenetic clustering methods unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages. The enzyme systems showed high polymorphism levels, and each studied population of B. oleracea showed a characteristic zymogram in each of the assayed enzyme systems. The clustering analysis using the Dice coefficient showed that most of the studied populations can be considered significantly different from each other. This study proposes a rapid screening strategy for obtaining the electrophoretic profiles of samples and comparing population patterns. Two main of conclusions can be drawn from the results of this work: (1) compared to other molecular techniques and the efficiency and reliability of isoenzyme analyses, this method appears to be a useful tool for a rapid characterisation of samples; (2) in situ observations of populations suggest that conservation status of wild B. oleracea in their natural habitat in Spain can be considered satisfactory.																	0925-9864	1573-5109				OCT	2014	61	7					1295	1306		10.1007/s10722-014-0111-8							WOS:000343288500005						
J	McCormick, PV; Gibble, RE				McCormick, Paul V.; Gibble, Rebekah E.			Effects of Soil Chemistry on Plant Germination and Growth in a Northern Everglades Peatland	WETLANDS												Vegetation patterns across the Florida Everglades peatland are influenced by anthropogenic gradients in both hydrology and chemistry. These gradients often overlap, making it difficult to isolate specific causes of vegetation change. We examined whether differences in plant communities between the minimally impacted interior and the impacted perimeter of the northern Everglades could be attributed to soil chemistry as opposed to other factors such as hydrology or seed-bank composition. Seedling establishment from soil seed banks collected from interior locations was examined under conditions that reflected either the phosphorus (P)- and calcium-carbonate (CaCO3)-depleted chemistry of the peatland interior or enriched conditions around the perimeter. Three soil moisture treatments were used to increase seed-bank expression. The interior seed bank contained viable seeds of both interior and perimeter taxa, but distinct plant assemblages established in the two chemistry treatments. Perimeter species germinated in both chemistry treatments, but only survived under enriched conditions. Establishment of these species in the interior is likely limited by low P availability. Germination and survival of some interior species were reduced by enrichment, likely due to elevated CaCO3 levels. Protection from both increased P and CaCO3 loads thus appears important to maintain plant communities in mineral-poor remnants of the Everglades.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2014	34	5					979	988		10.1007/s13157-014-0562-x							WOS:000343057700012						
J	Bargmann, T; Maren, IE; Vandvik, V				Bargmann, Tessa; Maren, Inger E.; Vandvik, Vigdis			Life after fire: smoke and ash as germination cues in ericads, herbs and graminoids of northern heathlands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWhat is the impact of the fire cues smoke and ash on seed germination of important functional groups in the heathland system, namely ericads, herbs and graminoids? We predict that if germination from heathland seed banks is in part regulated by fire cues, there should be stronger responses to fire cue treatments in seed bank samples taken from heath that has not been recently burned in comparison with samples taken from newly burned heath, where seed banks have been exposed to the same cues in situ. LocationLygra, Lindas commune, western Norway. MethodsThe efficacy of smoke, charred wood, ash and heat in promoting germination has been documented in a wide range of species and systems, but relatively little work has been done on fire-related cues in northern European heathlands under anthropogenic fire regimes. We studied fire experimentally by testing the effects of aqueous smoke solution, ash and a combination of the two treatments, on the germination of graminoids, herbs and ericads. A greenhouse germination trial compared seed banks from old heath (28yr since the last fire) with seed banks from newly burned heath (burned the previous year), where we expected that fire-cued germination had already occurred. ResultsWe found that both ericads and graminoids responded to fire cues, whereas herbs did not. In line with our predictions, responses were stronger in the old heath than in the young heath. Further, the smoke treatment is a more effective cue than ash across all functional groups. ConclusionsThe prevalence of positive fire cue responses across functional groups underscores the importance of fire in the ecology of these heathlands, and hence of burning as a central tool for their management. The finding that the germination response is stronger in naive seed banks than in seed banks that have already been exposed to recent fire cues through in situ fires further supports the role of fire in the successional dynamics of these heathlands.

J	Pirk, GI; De Casenave, JL				Pirk, Gabriela I.; Lopez De Casenave, Javier			Effect of harvester ants of the genus Pogonomyrmex on the soil seed bank around their nests in the central Monte desert, Argentina	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. The abundance and composition of soil seed banks is a key determinant of plant community structure. Harvester ants can remove huge quantities of preferred seeds close to the nest affecting composition and spatial distribution of plants. 2. In the central Monte desert (Argentina) ants of the genus Pogonomyrmex have high seed removal rates, especially of the five main grasses. The aim of this study was to establish if their foraging activity affects spatial patterns of the soil seed bank around their nests. Our hypotheses were: (1) removal by ants decreases seed abundance of preferred species in the soil; and (2) the effect varies in time. 3. Soil seed abundance was assessed at different distances from Pogonomyrmex nests in the litter and in bare soil at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the season (late spring-early autumn). 4. A lower seed abundance of preferred species was observed close to the nest in the litter at the end of the season. Non-preferred species showed no distance gradient. 5. The lower foraging activity and seed consumption at the beginning of the season could explain the temporal variation of the spatial effect. This was only observed in the litter, probably because of the higher removal frequency in this substrate. 6. Colonies of Pogonomyrmex spp. could enhance the heterogeneity of soil seed banks in the central Monte desert from the summer to the beginning of the autumn. Implications for vegetation dynamics depend on the degree to which seed density limits perennial grasses recruitment after ant activity season.																	0307-6946	1365-2311				OCT	2014	39	5					610	619		10.1111/een.12140							WOS:000342982000010

Here, we quantify the extent of convergence of five key life-history traits (adult fire survival, seed storage, degree of sexual dimorphism, pollination mode, and seed-dispersal mode) and test hypotheses about their correlated evolution in the genus Leucadendron (Proteaceae) from the fire-prone South African fynbos. We reconstructed a new molecular phylogeny of this highly diverse genus that involves more taxa and molecular markers than previously. This reconstruction identifies new clades that were not detected by previous molecular study and morphological classifications. Using this new phylogeny and robust methods that account for phylogenetic uncertainty, we show that the five life-history traits studied were labile during the evolutionary history of the genus. This diversity allowed us to tackle major questions about the correlated evolution of life-history strategies. We found that species with longer seed-dispersal distances tended to evolve lower pollen-dispersal distance, that insect-pollinated species evolved decreased sexual dimorphism, and that species with a persistent soil seed-bank evolved toward reduced fire-survival ability of adults.

J	Weber, EA; Gruber, S; Claupein, W				Weber, Ernst Albrecht; Gruber, Sabine; Claupein, Wilhelm			Emergence and performance of volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in different crops	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Volunteer oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L) causes various agronomic problems in crop rotations and can contribute to gene dispersal by pollen and by seed admixture. A 4-year field experiment (2008-2011) was set up in south-west Germany to investigate the performance of volunteers derived from two OSR cultivars with different levels of seed dormancy. Volunteers of a high-dormancy (HD) and a low-dormancy (LD) OSR cultivar were deliberately generated by spreading 10,000 seeds m(-2) on a field in August 2008 and 2009. Four different crops were grown on that area in the first year following the seed rain: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), winter turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.). In the second year, maize (Zea mays L.) was sown uniformly across all plots. Numbers of OSR seedlings emerging in early autumn shortly after seed rain were not connected with the size of the soil seed bank in early spring of the following year. The seeds of the HD-cultivar formed a much greater soil seed bank (up to 14% of the initially spread seed number) compared with the LD-cultivar (up to 1.3%) in the soil layer of 0 to 30 cm in early spring 2009 and 2010). Across all crops, considerably more volunteers of the HD-cultivar than of the LD-cultivar were present at several survey dates in the first year following seed rain. The highest number of volunteers originated from the HD-cultivar with up to 11 volunteers m(-2) in winter turnip rape compared with a maximum of 0.48 plants m(-2) in the other crops. Cultivar-specific differences in volunteer density were observed as well in maize two years after OSR seed rain. Flowering and seed setting volunteers were only present in 2010 and the-flowering time was crucially overlapping with that of sown winter OSR The reproductive ability (seeds produced m(-2)) of the LD-volunteers Was five times lower in winter turnip rape than of the HD-volunteer; a similar trend was observed for the OSR volunteers in the other host crops. Strategies to definitely reduce unwanted effects of OSR volunteers, such as gene flow, should include the use of LD-cultivars with a low potential to form a soil seed bank, particularly if selective herbicides are not available, for instance in broad-leaved crops, or if the volunteers are herbicide-tolerant.

Crop rotations were continuous dryland wheat (Wd), continuous irrigated wheat (Wi), wheat-sugarbeet (WS) and wheat-chickpea (WCh). Nearby pastures (P) and orchards (Or) were also studied for comparison purposes. Estimates of the density of seed banks ranged from 52779 seed m(-2) in P to 9906 seeds m(-2) in Wd. A total of 114 plant species from 24 families were identified from seeds collected from different farms. 33 weed species were at high frequency in weed communities. Crop rotations were dominated by annual weed species, while the weed species dominated in P were mostly not found in any crop rotation. The two weed species Roemeria refracta and Eragrostis cilianensis were frequently present in all the study sites. Amaranthus chlorostachys and Euphorbia esula were more abundant in the areas of moderate to high disturbance. In SW and WS rotations, due to use of grass herbicides and hand weeding, winter annual broadleaves such as Lactuca serriola and Anchusa italica were the prominent species in the seed bank. Results showed that a number of weed species are adapted to a specific crop sequences and disturbance levels. Weed species richness, seed bank abundance and diversity in soil depths are highly dependent on disturbance levels. The current study highlights the importance of agricultural practices including crop sequences or disturbance levels in determining the characteristics of weed populations. This provides useful information to improve methods for maintaining plant population balance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been proposed that it may be no use to compare the genetic diversity between seed bank and above ground plants if there was no habitat fragmentation. Whether this prediction holds for aquatic plants is still unknown. Here, ISSR analysis of a common wetland species Heleocharis valleculosa (Cyperaceae) was conducted to evaluate if the seed bank has higher, equal or lower genetic variation than the above ground vegetation. Our results showed high genetic diversity in the seed bank, so the seedbank can act as a storehouse of genetic variation for the above ground vegetation, especially in unfavorable conditions. Thus, unlike terrestrial habitats where genetic diversity is often low, wetlands that are connected with water flow can accumulate many genotypes in the seed bank and the question of how genetic diversity varies above and below ground is still open.

Overcoming ecological barriers to tropical lower montane forest succession on anthropogenic grasslands: Synthesis and future prospects	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20 m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration strategy.

J	Pausas, JG; Keeley, JE				Pausas, Juli G.; Keeley, Jon E.			Evolutionary ecology of resprouting and seeding in fire-prone ecosystems	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												There are two broad mechanisms by which plant populations persist under recurrent disturbances: resprouting from surviving tissues, and seedling recruitment. Species can have one of these mechanisms or both. However, a coherent framework explaining the differential evolutionary pressures driving these regeneration mechanisms is lacking. We propose a bottom-up approach in addressing this question that considers the relative survivorship of adults and juveniles in an evolutionary context, based on two assumptions. First, resprouting and seeding can be interpreted by analogy with annual versus perennial life histories; that is, if we consider disturbance cycles to be analogous to annual cycles, then resprouting species are analogous to the perennial life history with iteroparous reproduction, and obligate seeding species that survive disturbances solely through seed banks are analogous to the annual life history with semelparous reproduction. Secondly, changes in the selective regimes differentially modify the survival rates of adults and juveniles and thus the relative costs and benefits of resprouting versus seeding. Our approach provides a framework for understanding temporal and spatial variation in resprouting and seeding under crown-fire regimes. It accounts for patterns of coexistence and environmental changes that contribute to the evolution of seeding from resprouting ancestors.

J	de Andrade, LAZ; Miranda, HS				Zago de Andrade, Luciana Aparecida; Miranda, Heloisa Sinatora			The dynamics of the soil seed bank after a fire event in a woody savanna in central Brazil	PLANT ECOLOGY												The seed-bank dynamics of cerrado, a savanna-like vegetation type in central Brazil, was monitored for a year after a fire event in the mid-dry season. Fifty paired soil and litter samples were collected 1 day before and 1 day after the fire to record the immediate effects on the seed bank, and thereafter at monthly intervals to investigate the post-fire seed bank dynamics. The samples were hand-sorted and the intact seeds were classified as monocot or dicot and counted. All seeds underwent germination trials in a germination chamber for 1 month. Seeds that did not germinate were checked for the presence and viability of the embryo. The sorted soil samples were placed in a greenhouse for 6 months, and the count of emerging seedlings was added to the number of germinated and dormant seeds from the germination trials to estimate the total number of viable seeds per sample. The fire did not affect the total seed-bank density: 63 +/- A 8 seeds m(-2) before the fire, and 83 +/- A 20 seeds m(-2) (mean +/- A se) immediately after it. Although monocots represented 65 % of the pre-fire seed bank, 1 year after the fire, the monocot seed density did not reach the pre-fire value, whereas the density of dicot seeds increased threefold. After the fire, the viable seed density and species richness, decreased with the onset of the rainy season coinciding with germination in the field. Therefore, post-fire recruitment increases genetic variability and contributes to the persistence of plant populations in cerrado communities.

A significant proportion of the seasonally flood-pulsed Okavango Delta is inundated for part of each year. Variation in hydroperiod, driven by the interaction of climate and ecological factors, results in a mosaic of vegetation communities. These communities are highly dynamic over temporal and spatial scales. This study aimed to identify quantitative relationships between hydroperiod components and floodplain vegetation, to better understand the potential effects of hydrological change. A stratified random sample of 30 floodplains was surveyed for species composition and abundance. Hydroperiod components for sample quadrats were estimated from remote sensing and field measurement. Ordination demonstrated strong correlations between species composition and flood frequency, duration, years-since-last-flood and depth. Eight statistically discrete vegetation communities were derived from cluster analysis. Generalized linear models of species distributions along hydrological gradients were used to derive frequency and duration optima. Means of these parameters differed significantly between communities. Increasing hydroperiod corresponded with a progression from grasslands through sedge-dominated to aquatic communities. Species in infrequently flooded areas indicated disturbance and a succession trend towards open woodland. In the sedgelands, average depth was the strongest correlate, while in grasslands and aquatic communities, this was duration.

J	Jarvis, JC; Moore, KA; Kenworthy, WJ				Jarvis, Jessie C.; Moore, Kenneth A.; Kenworthy, W. Judson			Persistence of Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) seeds in the sediment seed bank	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Two separate field experiments in the Newport River/Back Sound, North Carolina (NC) and the lower Chesapeake Bay (CB), Virginia were conducted in 2007 and 2008 to quantify the effects of time (6, 12, 15 months), seed source (mixed-annual, perennial NC; perennial CB), site (local environmental factors), and sediment type (fine, coarse) on the persistence of Zostera marina seeds in the sediment seed bank. It is here, at the southern limit of the species distribution along the western Atlantic, that the probability of population loss may be high and the importance of a seed bank in the resilience and recovery of these populations great Experimental results indicate that viability of both NC and CB seeds decreased significantly after just 6 months in the sediment following the seasonal period of maximum germination and continued to decline over time with no seeds viable remaining in CB cores and <5% of seeds remaining viable after 15 months in NC treatments. In these experiments time was the overriding factor affecting the persistence Z. marina seed banks for all treatments in both NC and CB and viability was not significantly affected by seed source, site, or sediment type. Based on the results of the in situ experiments, mixed-annual and perennial Zostera marina populations in North Carolina and perennial populations in Virginia produce transient seed banks (seeds viable <12 months). The lack of a persistent seed bank may reduce the resilience of Z. marina at the limits of the species distribution to repeated stress events. As a result these populations may be particularly susceptible to disturbance with only a limited capacity for recovery if sexual reproduction is impaired. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Contrasting Patterns of Genetic Structuring in Natural Populations of Arabidopsis lyrata Subsp petraea across Different Regions in Northern Europe	PLOS ONE												Level and partitioning of genetic diversity is expected to vary between contrasting habitats, reflecting differences in strength of ecological and evolutionary processes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider processes acting on different time scales when trying to explain diversity patterns in different parts of species' distributions. To explore how historical and contemporary factors jointly may influence patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation, we compared genetic composition in the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea from the northernmost parts of its distribution range on Iceland to that previously documented in Scandinavia. Leaf tissue and soil were sampled from ten Icelandic populations of A. lyrata. Seedlings were grown from soil samples, and tissue from above-ground and seed bank individuals were genotyped with 21 microsatellite markers. Seed bank density in Icelandic populations was low but not significantly different from that observed in Norwegian populations. While within-population genetic diversity was relatively high on Iceland (H-E = 0.35), among-population differentiation was low (F-ST = 0.10) compared to Norwegian and Swedish populations. Population differentiation was positively associated with geographical distance in both Iceland and Scandinavia, but the strength of this relationship varied between regions. Although topography and a larger distribution range may explain the higher differentiation between mountainous Norwegian relative to lowland populations in Sweden, these factors cannot explain the lower differentiation in Icelandic compared to Swedish populations. We propose that low genetic differentiation among Icelandic populations is not caused by differences in connectivity, but is rather due to large historical effective population sizes. Thus, rather than contemporary processes, historical factors such as survival of Icelandic lineages in northern refugia during the last glacial period may have contributed to the observed pattern.

The germination rate of the soil seed bank was higher in the indoor experiment compared with that in the outdoor experiment, whereas the number and destiny of the germinated seedlings were greater in the outdoor experiment. The species diversity and number, as well as the richness and evenness indices, were higher in the urbanized region compared with the reclaimed region. However, the dominance and Sorensen similarity indices were greater in the reclaimed region compared with those indices in the urbanized region. Higher salinity and Cadmium (Cd) levels could inhibit seed germination; however, their suitable ranges (i.e. [0-2000 mg kg(-1)] for salinity and [0-4.0 mg kg(-1)] for available Cd) can activate seedling emergence, and more seedlings germinated under the intersectional levels at 0.34 mg kg(-1) available Cd and 778.6 mg kg(-1) salinity. Seawater intrusion caused by the sea level rise will possibly result in the salt-tolerant community in this area due to increasing salinity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus the analysis of bacterial population genetics is in large part a collection of explanations for anomalies in relation to classical population genetic models such as the Wright-Fisher model and the Kingman coalescent that do not adequately describe bacterial population genetics, genomics or evolution. The concept of "species" as an evolutionary coherent biological group that is genetically isolated and shares genetic information through recombination among its members cannot be applied to any bacterial group. Recently, a simple probabilistic model considering the role of strong seed-bank effects in population genetics has been proposed by Blath et al. This model suggests the existence of a genetic pool with high diversity that is not subject to classical selection and extinction. We reason that certain bacterial population genetics anomalies could be explained by the prevalence of strong seed-bank effects among bacteria. To address this possibility we analyzed the genome of the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii and show that genes that code for functions that are essential for the bacterium biology do not have a relation of ancestry with closely related bacteria, or are ORFan genes. The existence of essential genes that are not inherited from the most recent ancestor cannot be explained by classical population genetics models and is irreconcilable with the current view of genes acquired by horizontal transfer as being accessory or adaptive.

Dry matter production of L. perenne and the weed community that emerged from the soil seed bank were measured each year in treatments that ranged from cultivar monocultures to three- and six-way cultivar mixtures, all sown at a constant seeding rate. Mean L. perenne dry matter production increased with increasing cultivar diversity and was highest in mixtures that contained cultivars representing the greatest additive trait range (calculated on rankings of three traits: winter hardiness, heading date, and tolerance to grazing). Mixtures had greater yields than those predicted by the mean of their component monoculture yields, but there was evidence that highly productive cultivars may have dampened over-yielding in mixtures. Weed abundance was correlated with L. perenne dry matter, but not L. perenne cultivar diversity. These results suggest that multi-cultivar mixtures may have utility as an approach to ecologically intensifying perennial forage production. Additional research will be necessary to determine the mechanisms responsible for the over-yielding observed in this study and the generality of these findings.

Seed Bank Effects on Recovery after Disturbance in Reconstructed Tallgrass Prairies	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Litter-removing disturbances such as fire in grasslands temporarily increase available resources for plants, opening a window of opportunity for new establishment as communities recover. At this time, new individuals or species could be added to the community as a result of germination from the local seed bank. In reconstructed grasslands this may be problematic, as the seed bank may contain a suite of undesired species reflective of prior and surrounding land uses. In two, 25-year-old, low-diversity reconstructed grasslands, we tested the effect of local seed bank establishment following litter-removing disturbance using seedling removal plots (1m(2)) and plots where natural seedling establishment was allowed. Following disturbance, the vegetation was either left intact or hayed to enhance seedling establishment (a common practice following inter-seeding efforts). Although the seed bank and seedling community were dominated by resident grasses (Andropogon gerardii and Poa pratensis), recruitment from the seed bank increased species richness and reduced evenness through the addition of forb species (including Cirsium arvense) in one of the study sites. Haying temporarily altered the abundances of the dominant grasses, but did not consistently affect seedling recruitment. Disturbances that facilitate seed bank recruitment may promote establishment of undesired species within reconstructed grassland communities, and we need to take steps to better manage the contributions into and recruitment from the seed bank to reconstruct sustainable grasslands.

Plant Recruitment and Soil Microbial Characteristics of Rehabilitation Seedings Following Wildfire in Northern Utah	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												One goal of post-fire native species seeding is to increase plant community resistance to exotic weed invasions, yet few studies address the impacts of seeding on exotic annual establishment and persistence. In 2010 and 2011, we investigated the influence of seedings on exotic annuals and the underlying microbial communities. The wildfire site in northern Utah was formerly dominated by Artemisia tri-dentata ssp. wyomingensis, but burned in September 2008. Experimental seeding treatments were installed in November 2008 to examine strategies for establishing native species using two drills, hand broadcasts and different timing of seed applications (resulting in 13 seeding treatments). We collected aboveground biomass of invasive annuals (Halogeton glomeratus, Salsola kali, and Bromus tectorum), other volunteer plants from the extant seed bank, and seeded species from all treatments in the second and third years after fire. We sampled soils within microsites beneath native perennial bunchgrass and exotic annuals to characterize underlying soil microbial communities. High precipitation following seeding led to strong seedling establishment and we found few differences between seeding treatments established with either drill. All seeded treatments reduced exotic biomass by at least 90% relative to unseeded controls. Soil microbial communities (phospholipid fatty acid analysis), beneath B. tectorum, Poa secunda, and Pseudoroegneria spicata microsites differed little 3 years after fire. However, microbial abundance beneath P. spicata increased from June to July, suggesting that microbial communities beneath successful seedings can vary greatly within a single growing season.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2014	22	5					598	607		10.1111/rec.12112							WOS:000344479800006						
J	Mathur, M				Mathur, Manish			Does Adaptive Strategy for Delayed Seed Dispersion affect Extinction Probability of a Desert Species? an Assessment using the Population Viability Analysis and Glass House Experiment	BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY												Canopy seed bank is an important adaptive evolutionary trait that provides various types of protection to the seeds. However, costing of such evolutionary trait on plant survival is largely unknown. Present investigation provided a new insight on the serotonious habit of Blepharis sindica associated with its endangerment status. Extinction probabilities of two available population of B. sindica were quantified using two types of census data, i.e., fruiting body number and actual population size. Population Viability Analysis (PVA) revealed that delayed seed release tendency (higher fruiting body number) was not synchronized with actual ground conditions (lower population size). PVA analysis based on actual population size indicated that both the available populations would vanish within 20 years. The mean time of extinction calculated from both type census data indicated its extinction within 48 years. For assessing the conservation criteria, a glass house experiment was carried out with different soil types and compositions. Pure sand and higher proportions of sand -silt were more suitable compared to clay; further, gravelly surface was the most unsuitable habitat for this species. Collection of the seeds from mature fruits/capsule and their sowing with moderate moisture availability with sandy soil could be recommended.

J	Goggin, DE; Powles, SB				Goggin, Danica E.; Powles, Stephen B.			Fluridone: a combination germination stimulant and herbicide for problem fields?	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: Problem weeds in agriculture, such as Lolium rigidum Gaud., owe some of their success to their large and dormant seed banks, which permit germination throughout a crop-growing season. Dormant weed seed banks could be greatly depleted by application of a chemical that stimulates early-season germination and then kills the young seedlings. Fluridone, a phytoene desaturase-inhibiting herbicide that can also break seed dormancy, was assessed for its efficacy in this regard. RESULTS: The germination of fluridone-treated Lolium rigidum seeds was stimulated on soils with low organic matter, and almost 100% seedling mortality was observed, while the treatment was only moderately effective on a high-organic-matter potting mix. Seedlings from wheat, canola, common bean and chickpea seeds sown on fluridone-treated sandy loam were bleached and did not survive, but lupins and field peas grew normally. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study with fluridone suggests that it may be possible to design safe and effective molecules that act as germination stimulants plus herbicides in a range of crop and soil types: a potentially novel way of utilising herbicides to stimulate seed bank germination and a valuable addition to an integrated weed management system.

Melaleuca parvistaminea Byrnes (Myrtaceae) in South Africa: Invasion risk and feasibility of eradication	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We document and assess management options for the first reported invasion of Melaleuca parvistaminea Byrnes (initially identified as M. ericifolla) in the world, in the context of a South African wetland ecosystem. Delimitation surveys indicate that the entire invasion is restricted to three sites between Tulbagh and Wolseley and that populations are only associated with areas currently or previously covered by pine plantations (primarily Pinus radiata). To estimate abundance we surveyed 42% of the three identified areas and found similar to 26,000 plants over 1800 ha (condensed canopy area of 1.15 ha). At least 63% of recorded plants were seedlings or juveniles, mostly <4 yrs old, and most occurred in seasonally inundated (but not waterlogged) habitats. M. parvistaminea creates monospecific stands that overtop the native shrubland vegetation (Breede Shale Renosterveld) and is thus considered a potential transformer species. Species distribution modelling also revealed large areas of climatically suitable habitat in the Western Cape, pointing to substantial invasion debt for the species in South Africa. Felling triggers seed release from serotinous capsules, resulting in prolific seedling recruitment after winter rains (up to similar to 18,000 seedlings/m(2)). No evidence of a soil-stored seed bank was found, and when plants are cut at ground level or treated with herbicide after cutting, plants do not resprout The invasive populations of this water-dispersed species are close to major rivers (the Berg and Breede), but the intervening countryside is largely transformed and is unfavourable for establishment. Much of the area downstream from the invaded area is open vegetation that is unsuitable for major recruitment but easy to survey and detect small plants. Consequently, although the extent of invasion is large (potentially 9185 ha), the invasion can be delimited with some confidence, and eradication is considered achievable since seeds only survive for about a year, seedlings achieve maturity after 4 years, and because the species is an obligate reseeder. Given the threats posed, eradication is desirable and M. parvistaminea should be listed as a category-1a invader (requiring compulsory control) under the proposed invasive species regulations under South Africa's National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (10/2004). We estimate that search and destroy operations could eradicate the species by 2021 at a cost of ZAR 3 475 000 (US$ 355 400). (C) 2014 SAAB. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The seed ecology of an ornamental wattle in South Africa - Why has Acacia elata not invaded a greater area?	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Australian Acacia species introduced to South Africa as ornamentals have notably smaller invasive ranges than those introduced for forestry or dune stabilization. We asked whether the relatively small invasive extent of Acacia elata, a species used widely for ornamental purposes, is due to low rates of reproduction. Age at reproductive maturity, seed dispersal, annual seed production, seed bank dynamics and seed germination and viability were assessed at five sites in the Western Cape. Results indicate that A. elata has similar traits to other invasive Australia Acacia species: annual seed input into the leaf litter was high (up to 5000 seeds m(-2)); large seed banks develop (>20,000 seeds m(-2)) in established stands; seed germinability is high (>90%); seeds accumulate mostly in the top soil layers but can infiltrate to depths of 40 cm; and seed germination appears to be stimulated by fire. However the age at the onset of reproduction (similar to 4 years) is longer than most widespread invaders (similar to 3 years) and dispersal is fairly limited (seeds fell up to distances of 6 m from the parent canopy; the highest density of seed rain was found directly under the canopy with over 20% of seeds falling directly under the terminal branches). We suggest that the current limited distribution of invasive A. elata populations is the result of the relatively small size of initial populations (cf. large plantations and widespread plantings for forestry and dune stabilization species), the species' apparent lack of secondary dispersal vectors, and the planting of trees in gardens and urban settings offer limited opportunities for recruitment, proliferation and spread. The species is, however, increasing in abundance and range. We propose methods to improve management of invasions of the species. Management to reduce seed production of this species through classical biological control, as has been achieved for other Australian Acacia species in South Africa, should be prioritised.

Wild flower harvesting on the Agulhas Plain, South Africa: Impact of harvesting intensity under a simulated commercial harvesting regime for two re-seeding and two re-sprouting fynbos species	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We present a simple method for assessing the medium-term sustainability of different flower harvesting intensities (i.e. percentage of number of stems harvested per individual) for two re-seeders and re-sprouters of fynbos plants on the Agulhas Plain in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. We interpret our results from an ecological point of view, looking at impacts of harvesting on vegetative re-growth and survival of frequently harvested fynbos species, and an economic point of view, determining the cumulative number of stems harvested per year. We analysed the impact of different harvesting intensities on two obligate re-seeding (Erica corifolia (L.) and Erica imbricata (L.) and two strongly re-sprouting species (Brunie laevis (Thunb.) and Staavia radiata (L Dahl)) on different flower farms. Seventy-five randomly selected plants of each species were experimentally harvested in the same way as is done by flower harvesters. Fifteen plants of each species were left as controls (un-harvested) and 15 each were harvested (cut 15-20 cm below the inflorescence) such that 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the inflorescences were removed. Harvested stems were labelled and the number of new shoots counted. Additionally we recorded plant height and mortality. 100% harvesting resulted in high mortality rates for both re-seeders (for both species 100% of the individuals were dead at the end of the experiment) and resprouters (for one species all 15 individuals were dead at the end of the experiment and for the other species 4 of 15). Re-seeders in particular were highly susceptible to harvesting below the first branching node, which generally also resulted in plant death. Both guilds can survive up to 75% harvesting (resprouters experienced no mortality for one species, while in the other 4 out of 15 died; of the re-seeders, 9 out of 15 died in the one species, while only 1 out of 15 in the other) and are still able to grow in height. For both seeders and resprouters we recommend that flower harvesters do not harvest in young veld. To ensure sufficient seed set and to avoid seed bank depletion we recommend to preferably only harvest between 25 and 50% of stems per individual. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We compared species richness and composition of regularly mown and abandoned wooded meadows in Estonia and established species groups with respect to their response to abandonment. These meadows were very species rich with a maximum of 43 species per 0.25 m(2). Species whose populations are maintained by mowing constituted > 60 % of the floristic diversity of the mown wooded meadows. Abandonment suppressed species with a preference for dry infertile open habitats. Response to abandonment was related to clonality, height and growth form. The greatest negative response was associated with low graminoids, short-lived and non-clonal species, rosette and semi-rosette growth form. Weak competitors with low height and light seeds exhibited a slow decline; perennial life span and clonality enable a delay in local extinction of these species. Response groups had similar persistence at a national level, revealing that earlier assessment of species dynamics at larger spatial scales could underestimate the number of threatened species. Application of restoration measures could avoid local extinctions of many mowing-supported species, whereas some of the mowing-dependent species likely need reintroduction.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				SEP	2014	215	9					953	962		10.1007/s11258-014-0347-6							WOS:000342073000002						
J	Hoban, S; Schlarbaum, S				Hoban, Sean; Schlarbaum, Scott			Optimal sampling of seeds from plant populations for ex-situ conservation of genetic biodiversity, considering realistic population structure	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												As habitat loss accelerates, there is pressing need to preserve plant genetic diversity in ex situ conservation collections. Population structure (i.e. subdivision), which is common in plants, may be an important consideration when planning such collections because it results in locally restricted alleles or traits, which have high conservation, ecological, or economic value. Nonetheless, common protocols for ex situ collections do not consider population structure. To help inform collection decisions, we utilize computer simulations with different levels of realistic hierarchical population structure to evaluate the expected performance of an array of sample sizes and several spatial distributions of sampled populations. We quantify how population structure affects the expected probability of capturing alleles (especially rare alleles). We also test the effect of family-level structure due to pollen pool composition (e.g., sibling clusters). Our findings suggest that when range-wide population structure exists, the spatial distribution of sampled populations is crucial: sampling one population per region (dispersed sampling) captured up to 175% more alleles than sampling all populations in one region (constrained sampling), and nearly as much as sampling all existing populations. The spatial effect is strongest for poorly-connected (low gene flow) species. Under realistic population structure, moderate sampling (25-30 individuals per population) from few but widely-spaced populations performs optimally; this differs from previous recommended guidelines that do not consider structure. There is smaller effect of the pollen pool composition on collection performance. We conclude that seed collection plans should incorporate spatial considerations, especially for poorly-connected taxa. Our simulation approach can be extended to particular species and other spatial patterns. We use the butternut tree as a case study for collection planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Eliasova, A; Munzbergova, Z				Eliasova, Anezka; Muenzbergova, Zuzana			Higher seed size and germination rate may favour autotetraploids of Vicia cracca L. (Fabaceae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The phenotypic effect of increased cell size in polyploid angiosperms has been repeatedly described; the ecological consequences of the gigas effect are, however, relatively poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of cytotype, seed weight, and inter-population variation on seedling germination and growth in diploid and autotetraploid Vicia cracca L. in a common garden experiment. Seeds used in this study originated in the contact zone of the cytotypes in Central Europe. Tetraploids had heavier seeds than diploids and greater germination rates irrespective of seed size. Both seed weight and germination rate displayed high inter-population variation. Further, tetraploids seem to germinate earlier and deposit fewer reserves into the seed bank than diploids. Mean above-ground biomass and seedling height were similar in the two cytotypes of V. cracca. Nonetheless, the tallest tetraploid seedlings were taller than the tallest diploid seedlings, which may be advantageous under strong competition in dense vegetation. This study thus demonstrates that tetraploids of V. cracca may have superior competitive ability to diploids in certain habitats. It also suggests the necessity of studying multiple populations per cytotype when comparing diploids and polyploids, as the effect of population may be of similar or even higher magnitude than the effect of cytotype.

However, information on the soil seed bank also is important for restoration of species-rich vegetation, but this subject has received little attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the aboveground vegetation and the soil seed bank of an alpine meadow along a fertilization gradient that can germinate in spring. We determined species richness, density, life form and functional groups in the soil seed bank and in the aboveground vegetation along an N-P fertilization gradient from 0 to Fer(120) (120 g/m(2); i.e. 25.4 g N and 28.2 P m(2)/yr). Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to test the similarity between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation. Species richness of both soil seed bank and vegetation declined in response to 9 years of fertilization, but rate of decline in the seed bank was slower than that in the vegetation. Seed density did not differ along the fertilization gradient except for Fer(30), which had the highest seed density. Plant density in the vegetation declined along the fertilization gradient. Proportion of annuals increased both in the vegetation and the soil seed bank along a fertilization gradient. Percentage of different functional groups in the soil seed bank changed but less than that in the vegetation. The similarity between soil seed bank and vegetation increased from Fer(0) to Fer(90) and then decreased in Fern. Fertilization influenced species composition of the soil seed bank, but the effect was smaller than that on the aboveground vegetation. The seed bank present in spring provides high species richness and high seed densities for restoration, but restoration to the non-fertilized state would be difficult due to the shift to a higher proportion of annuals and to a low proportion of sedges along the fertilization gradient.

J	Baldridge, AK; Lodge, DM				Baldridge, Ashley K.; Lodge, David M.			Long-term studies of crayfish-invaded lakes reveal limited potential for macrophyte recovery from the seed bank	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												In situ seed banks are a promising avenue for restoration of plant communities damaged by anthropogenic changes. The invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) has had well documented effects on macrophytes in north temperate lakes. To understand mechanisms of macrophyte recovery from the seed bank, we examined seed banks from lakes with different durations of exposure to O. rusticus and compared these findings to longterm macrophyte surveys. We cored littoral-zone sediments at sediment depths of 0-5,5-10, and 10-15 cm to test whether deeper layers hold viable seeds that can be used to restore macrophytes. The seed bank in uninvaded lakes contained a higher number and richness of viable seeds than did the seed bank in invaded lakes. Number and richness of viable seeds decreased with sediment depth in all lake categories, and most seeds were found in the top 10 cm. Among all lakes, at most, 33% of the species recorded in field surveys of standing vegetation were represented in the seed bank. We conclude that the seed bank has only modest potential to contribute to natural recovery. Natural regeneration of the macrophyte community is more likely to rely upon vegetative propagules from remnant stands in invaded lakes, especially from very soft-bottom areas avoided by crayfish. Our results emphasize the importance of preventing destruction of macrophytes, especially in lakes without habitats likely to constitute a refuge for macrophytes.

J	Ochoa-Hueso, R; Manrique, E				Ochoa-Hueso, Raul; Manrique, Esteban			Impacts of altered precipitation, nitrogen deposition and plant competition on a Mediterranean seed bank	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Do increased nitrogen (N) fertilization, altered water supply and increased competition by a nitrophilous plant species alter the establishment of the plant community developed from the soil seed bank present in a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem under greenhouse conditions? Does the nitrophilous plant respond in the same way to N addition under field conditions? Location: The kermes oak/rosemary shrubland in the Nature Reserve El Regajal-Mar de Ontigola, central Spain. Methods: In September 2008, native soil seed bank was collected in open areas dominated by rosemary shrubs. Seeds of the nitrophilous Diplotaxis siifolia were collected in early summer 2008. Pots with aliquots of soil were distributed among eight treatments, which resulted from combinations of two levels of N fertilization, water supply and density of D. siifolia in the seed bank. The plant community was left to grow for 3 mo, when chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and harvests were made. In summer 2008, the soil seed bank density of 0 and 50 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) plots was also manipulated in the field by broadcasting seeds to a density of 8000 D. siifolia seeds.m (2). Results: Increased N and competition tended to reduce soil water content in 'high water' pots. High water and N fertilization increased total above- and below-ground plant biomass production. Nitrogen fertilization reduced plant root: shoot ratio, had a negative effect on plant richness and, coupled with 'high competition' and 'high water', reduced forb biomass productivity. The competition treatment decreased chlorophyll fluorescence in grasses. Under field conditions, N fertilization increased D. siifolia density and this effect was dependent on soil phosphorus availability. Conclusions: Our results show that nitrophilous plant species such as D. siifolia can be a threat to local plant communities in the context of increased N deposition and altered precipitation events. In particular, local plant communities from semi-arid Mediterranean climates, and especially the forb element, may suffer more from competition in highly polluted and invaded sites during unusually wet years. Finally, we predict a future increase in the relative dominance of these species in semi-arid Mediterranean environments where forb species typically adapted to low-nutrient environments will fail to successfully compete with weeds.

We found that dung beetles also move buried seeds upwards, with positive consequences for seedling establishment. In the Lacandon rain forest of southern Mexico we conducted field experiments to address three questions: (1) What proportions of different-sized seeds buried by dung beetles are exhumed by them? (2) Does upward relocation of seeds caused by dung beetle activity promote seedling establishment? (3) Does recurrent beetle activity increase seedling establishment? Using 4-mm, 8-mm and 12-mm beads as seed mimics, embedded in howler-monkey dung, we found that 2-6% of buried beads were later exhumed by beetles, with smaller beads exhumed more often. In small plots (N = 100) where beetles were allowed to bury dung and seed rain was excluded, seedling establishment was over three times higher compared with plots without beetle activity. In plots (N = 8) where we placed dung on four occasions in 1 mo, seedling establishment was more than twice as high compared with plots with single-time dung placement. We believe that our findings open up interesting research opportunities to help further elucidate this newly discovered ecological function of dung beetles.

Humidity-regulated dormancy onset in the Fabaceae: a conceptual model and its ecological implications for the Australian wattle Acacia saligna	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and aims Seed dormancy enhances fitness by preventing seeds from germinating when the probability of seedling survival and recruitment is low. The onset of physical dormancy is sensitive to humidity during ripening; however, the implications of this mechanism for seed bank dynamics have not been quantified. This study proposes a model that describes how humidity-regulated dormancy onset may control the accumulation of a dormant seed bank, and seed experiments are conducted to calibrate the model for an Australian Fabaceae, Acacia saligna. The model is used to investigate the impact of climate on seed dormancy and to forecast the ecological implications of human-induced climate change. Methods The relationship between relative humidity and dormancy onset was quantified under laboratory conditions by exposing freshly matured non-dormant seeds to constant humidity levels for fixed durations. The model was field-calibrated by measuring the response of seeds exposed to naturally fluctuating humidity. The model was applied to 3-hourly records of humidity spanning the period 1972-2007 in order to estimate both temporal variability in dormancy and spatial variability attributable to climatic differences among populations. Climate change models were used to project future changes in dormancy onset. Key Results A sigmoidal relationship exists between dormancy and humidity under both laboratory and field conditions. Seeds ripened under field conditions became dormant following very short exposure to low humidity (<20%). Prolonged exposure at higher humidity did not increase dormancy significantly. It is predicted that populations growing in a temperate climate produce 33-55% fewer dormant seeds than those in a Mediterranean climate; however, dormancy in temperate populations is predicted to increase as a result of climate change. Conclusions Humidity-regulated dormancy onset may explain observed variation in physical dormancy. The model offers a systematic approach to modelling this variation in population studies. Forecast changes in climate have the potential to alter the seed bank dynamics of species with physical dormancy regulated by this mechanism, with implications for their capacity to delay germination and exploit windows for recruitment.

Information on impact of these plants and of flood on the soil seed bank dynamics of grassland vegetation regarding distribution and diversity are yet scarce. The aim of this work was to evaluate species similarity of soil seed bank of native and cultivated grassland in the Pantanal, under effects of flood levels, season and species invasion, evaluating effects of ecological filter upon distribution and diversity of flora. The soil seed bank was sampled in 1 km 2 in native and 1 km 2 in cultivated grassland. To test the hypothesis regarding flood gradient, we collected soil samples of 20 x 20 cm, 3 cm deep, at three ground levels (bottom, intermediate and top). To analyze species invasion, soil samples were collected in native and in cultivated grassland (Urochloa humidicola), a total of 120 in the dry season and 120 in the flood season. The soil seed bank was evaluated through emergence in trays in a greenhouse. From the soil seed bank emerged 91 species, of 22 families. The most representative species in density were Richardia grandiflora (< 7,558 seedling m(-2)) and Hyptis brevipes (< 6,725 seedlings m(-2) ). We conclude that flood influences distribution and diversity of species in native and cultivated grassland, the vegetation varies according to the gradient, similarity being higher among species in the rainy season. We also conclude that the soil seed bank is not dominated by exotic weedy species, what is attributed to flood action as an ecological filter hindering their establishment.

SEEDS	CRYOLETTERS												BACKGROUND: Grapefruit is an economically important fruit worldwide, but our knowledge of its seed biology is rather poor. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to develop techniques for banking and cryopreservation of grapefruit seeds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Grapefruit seeds with the exotesta removed were used. Seeds were desiccated to three moisture levels between 5-9% and stored at 15 degrees C, 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C for up to 24, months to investigate seed lifespan in conventional seed bank. Meanwhile seeds desiccated by silica gel or saturated salt solution and embryonic axes by flash drying were employed to develop cryopreservation protocols. RESULTS: It was confirmed that grapefruit seeds have some intermediate properties, being able to withstand removal of type II water up to 7% MC, but sensitive to -20 degrees C storage. For cryopreservation, the excised embryonic axes had a wider moisture window between 5% and 15%, with a maximum past-thaw emergence of 95%, while seeds survived only with a maximum past-thaw emergence of 50% or 70% from a much narrow moisture window. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous reports on another type II seed, coffee, we found that citrus seeds desiccated by silica gel had better post-thaw viability than those subjected to equilibrium desiccation with saturated salt solutions. Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to variable cryopreservation tolerance.																	0143-2044	1742-0644				SEP-OCT	2014	35	5					418	426									WOS:000345495800009	25397957

Effects of flooding on the seed bank and soil properties in a conservation area on the Han River, South Korea	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Flooding can have a major impact on riverside plant communities, and this is likely to be especially important in monsoonal climates, where large floods occur after heavy rain. In urban areas where riparian vegetation remnants are the only vegetation of conservation interest remaining, understanding the impacts that floods have on these ecosystems is needed to inform their future conservation. Accordingly, we assessed the impact of a flood caused by Typhoon "Ewiniar" on the soil seed bank of five plant communities of the only remaining fragment of high-quality riverine habitat within the Seoul city stretch of the Han River (South Korea). We surveyed the seed bank composition of the five dominant plant communities before and after the flood. We also measured selected soil physico-chemical properties in each community. We used univariate and multivariate methods to examine the effect of the flood on both seed bank and soil physico-chemical properties. Flooding resulted in variable deposition of sediment within the plant communities; four communities varied from 14.6 to 18.8 cm but the fifth (dominated by Miscanthus sacchariflorus) had much less sediment (4.8 cm). The physico-chemical properties of the surface soil also changed after the flood, with the sediment particle size being the most affected. The species richness and composition of the seed bank suffered significant changes after the flood. In both cases there was a homogenization process, with was also impinged on species with different life-forms (annuals and perennials). Our results suggest that an extreme flood can affect the riparian vegetation seed bank by removing wetland plant species and allowing common and ruderal species to establish. There may also be different interactions between the different plant communities in terms of sediment capture and this translates into altered soil conditions and seed banks. These results are of use to conservation policy-makers aiming to conserve a native flora within severely modified urban rivers, and these remnant areas can provide an important seed source of wetland plants to aid restoration of riparian ecosystems.

Across the six major plant communities fringing a large salt lake within this zone, topsoil (0-5cm depth) was collected from 12 to 36 sites per community. Samples were dried, spread out on a bed of vermiculite in seedling trays and placed in a well-watered glasshouse to determine the readily germinable component of the soil seed bank. Subsamples of topsoil were treated with smoke water, hot water or flooding to help determine seed bank of species with dormancy mechanisms. As with other studies of arid seed banks, large numbers of grasses and forbs emerged from the topsoil, with relatively small numbers of woody perennial species and hummock grasses (Triodia spp.) present, even in communities where such species were dominant. There were, however, a few exceptions where a reasonable density of dominant trees/shrub seed was present in topsoil. Soil treatment generally had limited effect on composition and density of emergent seedlings. Although floristic similarity between soil seed banks and corresponding above-ground vegetation was modest, there were clear differences in soil seed bank composition between communities. The implications of the results for using topsoils to restore landforms of the study area after mining or other disturbance are discussed.				van Etten, Eddie/AAC-2612-2020	van Etten, Eddie/0000-0002-7311-1794												1442-7001	1442-8903				SEP	2014	15	3					239	242		10.1111/emr.12119							WOS:000342577500010

Gap ecology in the Florida scrubby flatwoods: effects of time-since-fire, gap area, gap aggregation and microhabitat on gap species diversity	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: The ecology of landscape gaps is important for the maintenance of species diversity in a variety of plant ecosystems. In the scrubby flatwoods community type of the pyrogenic Florida scrub, we aimed to identify the relationship between time-since-fire, gap area, quality (microhabitat) and aggregation (structural connectivity) with neighbouring gaps on gap species diversity and occupancy. Location: Archbold Biological Station (ABS), Lake Wales Ridge, south-central Florida, USA. Methods: We measured species diversity, gap area, aggregation and microhabitat (percentage bare sand) in 120 gaps divided evenly amongst 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 26 yrs since fire in the scrubby flatwoods of ABS (typical fire return interval of 5-20 yrs) throughout the summer of 2011. Results: Gap area and aggregation were significantly highest in the first 4 yrs after fire, but decreased and remained fairly constant at longer times-since-fire. Percentage bare sand gradually decreased with time-since-fire until a strong decline at the 26-yr mark, where litter cover was significantly higher than all previous years. Gap area strongly and positively predicted species richness (total and herb spp.) and total species diversity (H'). Bare sand content was positively correlated with the richness of species that are obligate seeders post-fire. Gap aggregation was generally a poor predictor of diversity components, although it positively influenced the occurrence of Stipulicida setacea, a seeder species that occasionally resprouts after fire. Overall, species richness and diversity peaked at intermediate times-since-fire, probably because long-unburned gaps were too small and inundated with litter to sustain higher richness of herbs and obligate seeders. Conclusion: In a prior gap ecology study, in neighbouring more xeric rosemary scrub, gaps were larger, more persistent and had higher bare sand cover, resulting in higher levels of total species richness and diversity for decades longer after fire than gaps in this study. In both these types of Florida scrub, the threat of fire suppression and its adverse effects on gap area and microhabitat may be detrimental for several endemic species that depend on gaps.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				SEP	2014	25	5					1235	1246		10.1111/jvs.12170							WOS:000340572700016						
J	Braz, MIG; Rodin, P; de Mattos, EA				Guedes Braz, Maria Isabel; Rodin, Patricia; de Mattos, Eduardo Arcoverde			Soil seed bank in a patchy vegetation of coastal sandy plains in southeastern Brazil	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Large seed banks have been found in tropical dry forests and also in habitats with high seasonality in rainfall. However, patchily structured vegetation could induce great spatial variation in the seed bank. We characterized the seed bank in a patchy vegetation of restinga, a common type of coastal vegetation found in the Atlantic forest biome. We also evaluated whether there is any spatial variation between the litter and soil layer, bare sand, and the edge and center of vegetation patches with distinct species dominance. We found 104 seeds/m(2) in the seed bank using a 5-cm-depth sampling. Seven out of 16 species found in the restinga seed bank germinated; two of these were found in the early stages of vegetation patches. We found a higher number of seeds at the edge than in the center of vegetation patches. However, there were no significant differences in the number of seeds in the seed bank between the litter and soil layer, and between vegetation patches with distinct species dominance. Bare sandy soils had lower seed bank densities than vegetation patches. A small seed bank size might be explained by the low proportion of seeds from herbaceous and woody species, which are pioneers in the Atlantic forest. However, seed bank might play an important role in the early stages of the successional process, due to the occurrence of the few species that are able to colonize new young vegetation patches.																	0913-557X	1442-1984				SEP	2014	29	3					E40	E47		10.1111/1442-1984.12033							WOS:000341131700005

The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal nitrogen and drought stress on the seed dormancy and germinability of A. retroflexus. Field experiment was carried out in a factorial based on randomized complete block design, with four potential levels of soil water (-2, -6, -8 and -10 bar) and three levels of nitrogen (0, 100 and 200 kg/ha). The germination characteristics of the seeds were measured at three different times (1 month, 6 months and 1 year after harvesting). Results showed that drought stress had positive effects on breaking of A. retroflexus seed dormancy until 6 months after seed harvesting. Seeds that were developed under severe water stress exhibited the highest germination percentage and germination rate. The results obtained from this study revealed that application of 100 kg/ha nitrogen during seed development increases germinability of A. retroflexus, whereas application of 200 kg/ha nitrogen induced seed dormancy. Furthermore, 100 kg/ha nitrogen application in the field along with 200 ppm gibberellic-acid treatment during seed after-ripening showed the highest germination percentage and germination rate for seeds after 6 months harvesting. Results also indicated that after-ripening significantly increased seed germination and germination rate of A. retroflexus. These findings indicate that long-term management of the soil seed bank in this species requires more stringent control due to the changes in germination timing, as detected in this study.

Seedling Ecology and Restoration of Blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) in the Mojave Desert, United States	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Increases in fire frequency are disrupting many ecological communities not historically subjected to fire. In the southwestern United States, the blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) community is among the most threatened, often replaced by invasive annual grasses after fire. This long-lived shrub is vulnerable because it recruits sporadically, partially due to mast seeding and the absence of a seed bank. The goal of this study was to evaluate if shrub restoration can be enhanced by identifying and ameliorating recruitment limitations. Specifically, we tested the effect of encapsulating seeds in predation-deterring "seed balls." We also tested the effects of nurse plants and mammalian exclusion cages on seedling emergence, growth, and survivorship. These experiments were conducted in a full-factorial design across three sites differing in elevation. Over 2 years, 13% of all planted seeds emerged and the effect of seed balls was overwhelmingly negative because of low emergence. Nurse plants had overall positive effects at Low Elevation, but negative effects at Mid- and High Elevation. Emergence and survival were highest in caged plots everywhere, and effect sizes increased with elevation. Interactions between the cage and the nurse plant treatments indicated that nurse plants tended to attract mammalian predators, lowering emergence and seedling survivorship, particularly at higher elevations. Findings conform to the stress-gradient hypothesis in that interactions among seedlings and mature plants shifted from facilitation to competition as environmental stress decreased with increasing elevation, suggesting that they are transferable to ecologically similar communities elsewhere. Knowledge of site-specific recruitment limitations can help minimize ineffective restoration efforts.

Effect of seed storage on germination, seedling growth and survival of Mimosa foliolosa (Fabaceae): implications for seed banks and restoration ecology	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Our goal was to examine the effects of seed storage on seed germination, seedling growth and survival of Mimosa foliolosa (Fabaceae). Fresh and stored seeds were set to germinate under optimum conditions after 12, 24 and 36 months of artificial storage. Fresh and 12 month old seeds were sown under greenhouse conditions and seedling growth and survival between the two types of seedlings were compared for a period of seven months. The germinability of stored and scarified seeds was not affected by storage, suggesting high longevity. However, seed storage did reduce germination time indicating alleviation of seed dormancy with time. There were no significant differences in seedling survival or relative growth rates for seedling height and number of leaves. We discuss the implications of seed storage behaviour for seed bank formation under natural conditions and for restoration ecology of rupestrian grasslands using M. foliolosa seeds.

We ask: 1) Does this conventional sampling strategy limit the detection of seeds of woody species? 2) Are large sample areas and sample sizes needed for higher recovery of seeds of woody species? We collected 100 samples that were 10 cm (length) x10 cm (width) x10 cm (depth), referred to as larger number of small-sized samples (LNSS) in a 1 ha forest plot, and placed them to germinate in a greenhouse, and collected 30 samples that were 1 m x 1 m x10 cm, referred to as small number of large-sized samples (SNLS) and placed them (10 each) in a nearby secondary forest, shrub land and grass land. Only 15.7% of woody plant species of the forest stand were detected by the 100 LNSS, contrasting with 22.9%, 37.3% and 20.5% woody plant species being detected by SNLS in the secondary forest, shrub land and grassland, respectively. The increased number of species vs. sampled areas confirmed power-law relationships for forest stand, the LNSS and SNLS at all three recipient sites. Our results, although based on one forest, indicate that conventional LNSS did not yield a high percentage of detection for woody species, but SNLS strategy yielded a higher percentage of detection for woody species in the seed bank if samples were exposed to a better field germination environment. A 4 m(2) minimum sample area derived from power equations is larger than the sampled area in most studies in the literature. Increased sample size also is needed to obtain an increased sample area if the number of samples is to remain relatively low.																	1932-6203					AUG 20	2014	9	8							e105235	10.1371/journal.pone.0105235							WOS:000342687200065	25140738

Core functional traits of bacterial communities in the Upper Mississippi River show limited variation in response to land cover	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Taxonomic characterization of environmental microbial communities via high-throughput DNA sequencing has revealed that patterns in microbial biogeography affect community structure. However, shifts in functional diversity related to variation in taxonomic composition are poorly understood. To overcome limitations due to the prohibitive cost of high-depth metagenomic sequencing, tools to infer functional diversity based on phylogenetic distributions of functional traits have been developed. In this study we characterized functional microbial diversity at 11 sites along the Mississippi River in Minnesota using both metagenomic sequencing and functional-inference-based (PICRUSt) approaches. This allowed us to determine how distance and variation in land cover throughout the river influenced the distribution of functional traits, as well as to validate PICRUSt inferences. The distribution and abundance of functional traits, by metagenomic analysis, were similar among sites, with a median standard deviation of 0.0002% among tier 3 functions in KEGG. Overall inferred functional variation was significantly different (P <= 0.035) between two water basins surrounded by agricultural vs. developed land cover, and abundances of bacterial orders that correlated with functional traits by metagenomic analysis were greater where abundances of the trait were inferred to be higher. PICRUSt inferences were significantly correlated (r = 0.147, P = 1.80 x 10(-30)) with metagenomic annotations. Discrepancies between metagenomic and PICRUSt taxonomic-functional relationships, however, suggested potential functional redundancy among abundant and rare taxa that impeded the ability to accurately assess unique functional traits among rare taxa at this sequencing depth. Results of this study suggest that a suite of "core functional traits" is conserved throughout the river and distributions of functional traits, rather than specific taxa, may shift in response to environmental heterogeneity.

Evidence for herbaceous seed dispersal by small-bodied fishes in a Pantanal seasonal wetland	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												We analysed the germination of seeds after their passage through the digestive tract of small floodplain fishes. Samples were collected in five open flooded fields of the northern Pantanal in March 2011. All fishes were sacrificed and their intestinal contents were removed. The fecal material was weighed and stored at 4 degrees C in a GF/C filter wrapped in aluminum foil. The material was then transferred to a receptacle containing sterilised soil from the sampling area. The fecal samples were kept in a germination chamber for 68 days and then transferred to a greenhouse for another 67 days. We collected a total of 45 fish species and 1014 individuals which produced a total amount of 32g of fresh fecal mass and 11 seedlings. We were able to identify six seedlings: two Banara arguta, two Steinchisma laxa, one Hymenachne amplexicaulis and one Luziola sp.. The fish species that produced samples with seedlings were Astyanax assuncionensis, Metynnis mola, Plesiolebias glaucopterus, Acestrorhyncus pantaneiro and Anadoras wendelli. With the exception of B. arguta the remaining plant species and all fish species were not known to be associated with the seed dispersal process of these plants. We found a ratio of 0.435 seedlings. g(-1) of fresh fecal material, which is 100 times higher than the amount of seedlings encountered in fresh soil mass (92,974 grams) in seed bank studies conducted in the same study area. In particular, Astyanax assuncionensis and Metynnis mola were among the most frequent and most abundant fish taxa in the area. Together with the high seed concentration in the fish fecal material, this evidence allows us to conclude that such fish species may play an important role in seed dispersal in the herbaceous plants of the Pantanal.

Weed seed-bank responses to long-term fertilization in a rice-wheat rotation system	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT												We studied the heterogeneity of soil weed seed-bank in a rice-wheat rotation system after long-term application of different organic or non-organic fertilizers, and the effects of major nutrients on the characteristics of the weed seed-bank. The soil was sampled in the Taihu area after a 31-year long-term fertilization experiment. Weed seeds were identified and counted in the surface soil of 12 differentially treated areas using microscopic examination, and analyzed by the Simpson, Shannon, Margalef, and Pielou indexes. The long-term application of organic fertilizers could significantly reduce the density of soil weed seed-bank; non-organic fertilizers and a combination of non-organic and organic fertilizers had a significant influence on the number of species and diversity of weeds. The application of organic fertilizers improved the Simpson, Shannon and Pielou indexes of soil weed seed-bank community and stabilized the community structure. In terms of the soil nutrient system itself, the soil organic materials and total nitrogen content are the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of soil weed seed-bank.																	1214-1178	1805-9368				AUG	2014	60	8					344	350		10.17221/871/2013-PSE							WOS:000341120700002

Aerial and soil seed banks enable populations of an annual species to cope with an unpredictable dune ecosystem	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Simultaneous formation of aerial and soil seed banks by a species provides a mechanism for population maintenance in unpredictable environments. Eolian activity greatly affects growth and regeneration of plants in a sand dune system, but we know little about the difference in the contributions of these two seed banks to population dynamics in sand dunes. Methods Seed release, germination, seedling emergence and survival of a desert annual, Agriophyllum squarrosum (Chenopodiaceae), inhabiting the Ordos Sandland in China, were determined in order to explore the different functions of the aerial and soil seed banks. Key Results The size of the aerial seed bank was higher than that of the soil seed bank throughout the growing season. Seed release was positively related to wind velocity. Compared with the soil seed bank, seed germination from the aerial seed bank was lower at low temperature (5/15 degrees C night/day) but higher in the light. Seedling emergence from the soil seed bank was earlier than that from the aerial seed bank. Early-emerged (15 April-15 May) seedlings died due to frost, but seedlings that emerged during the following months survived to reproduce successfully. Conclusions The timing of seed release and different germination behaviour resulted in a temporal heterogeneity of seedling emergence and establishment between the two seed banks. The study suggests that a bet-hedging strategy for the two seed banks enables A. squarrosum populations to cope successfully with the unpredictable desert environment.

J	Listl, D; Reisch, C				Listl, Daniela; Reisch, Christoph			Genetic variation of Sherardia arvensis L. - How land use and fragmentation affect an arable weed	BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY												The distribution of arable weeds extends over regions, where the species occur naturally in different kinds of habitats and regions, where they are mainly limited to arable fields. Here, we present a comparative study on the genetic struchire of the arable weed Sherardia arvensis L comprising populations from Mediterranean grasslands in Southern France and populations from arable fields in Germany. Enhanced by intensified land use since the 1960th, overall population density in Germany is very low compared to the density of populations in Southern France. We tested whether genetic variation within and among populations differ between France and Germany due to different patterns of distribution and land use. Therefore, we analysed 231 individuals of S. arvensis from 24 populations using AFLPs. Based on fragment analysis data we compared spatial genetic structure and genetic variation of populations from the two regions. Genetic variation within populations from the two regions (Shannon Index = 0.13 for both) and genetic variation among populations (26.8% and 30.0% in an analysis of molecular variance) were comparable. In both regions a drift-migration model supported the assumption of gene flow between populations. However, a clear correlation of geographical and genetic distances could only be reported for the indigenous populations from France (r = 0.46; P = 0.02), whereas in Germany a spatial genetic relationship between populations was missing (r = 0.16; P = 0.21). Our study revealed that neither French nor German populations are genetically impoverished. For French populations further the spatial genetic structure suggests that there is current gene flow between populations through pollinators and seed dispersal by cattle. For German populations comparable levels of genetic diversity and gene flow were detected, but gene flow was random. This can be traced back in all likelihood to diffuse dispersal by agriculture and the mechanical reshuffling of the individuals from the soil seed bank. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, W				Li, Wei			Environmental opportunities and constraints in the reproduction and dispersal of aquatic plants	AQUATIC BOTANY												This paper focuses on the opportunities provided by aquatic environments for successful reproduction and effective dispersal of aquatic plants, and how the environment alters the reproductive and dispersal mechanisms of aquatic plants compared to their terrestrial predecessors. The removal of water stress allows aquatic plants to exhibit greater diversity in their reproduction systems. While aquatic environments reduce the success of sexual reproduction in aquatic plants, the dominance of asexual reproduction, as well as their continuous production, blurs the distinction between growth and reproduction in land plants. Asexual propagules should be included in reproductive allocation analysis of aquatic plants. Aquatic plants show special adaptations for water dispersal. Two different levels are suggested when discussing the reproduction and dispersal of aquatic plants: The evolutionary and ecological time scale. It is suggested that asexual reproduction in aquatic plants may assure population maintenance, thus work mainly at the ecological time scale. In contrast, sexual reproduction might in most cases be a luxury investment, responsible for population restoration from extreme events and primarily working at the evolutionary time scale. Different animals, especially birds, are able to disperse aquatic plants. Humans have a long-standing association with aquatic plant dispersal. Moreover, economic development also stimulates the long-distance dispersal of plants and increases the risk of biological invasions. There are few data about seed longevity but studies on seed banks and germination requirements suggest that many aquatic plants may possess special mechanisms to keep their seed viability under natural conditions. More research is needed on the allocation of resources between vegetative and sexual reproduction in aquatic plants. Propagule biology (vegetative and seeds) may provide new information about the adaption of plants to aquatic environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Net ecosystem carbon exchange and the greenhouse gas balance of tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Tidal wetlands are productive ecosystems with the capacity to sequester large amounts of carbon (C), but we know relatively little about the impact of climate change on wetland C cycling in lower salinity (oligohaline and tidal freshwater) coastal marshes. In this study we assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere, microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The tidal freshwater marsh was a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (similar to 22 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)). There were large interannual differences in plant production and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in tidal marsh ecosystems.

Life-history traits predict perennial species response to fire in a desert ecosystem	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The Mojave Desert of North America has become fire-prone in recent decades due to invasive annual grasses that fuel wildfires following years of high rainfall. Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in this system, and post-fire shifts in species composition have been substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life-history traits could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of life-history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a consistent fire-response. Six life-history traits varied significantly between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long-term (up to 52 years) post-fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan, seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were classified into three PFTs based on combinations of life-history traits. Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were characterized by short lifespans, small, wind-dispersed seeds, low height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves. Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by long lifespans, large non-wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our results show that PFTs based on life-history traits can reliably predict the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert. Dominant, long-lived species of this region possess a combination of traits limiting their ability to recover, presenting a clear example of how a novel disturbance regime may shift selective environmental pressures to favor alternative life-history strategies.

Rare but active taxa contribute to community dynamics of benthic biofilms in glacier-fed streams	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Glaciers harbour diverse microorganisms, which upon ice melt can be released downstream. In glacier-fed streams microorganisms can attach to stones or sediments to form benthic biofilms. We used 454-pyrosequencing to explore the bulk (16S rDNA) and putatively active (16S rRNA) microbial communities of stone and sediment biofilms across 26 glacier-fed streams. We found differences in community composition between bulk and active communities among streams and a stronger congruence between biofilm types. Relative abundances of rRNA and rDNA were positively correlated across different taxa and taxonomic levels, but at lower taxonomic levels, the higher abundance in either the active or the bulk communities became more apparent. Here, environmental variables played a minor role in structuring active communities. However, we found a large number of rare taxa with higher relative abundances in rRNA compared with rDNA. This suggests that rare taxa contribute disproportionately to microbial community dynamics in glacier-fed streams. Our findings propose that high community turnover, where taxa repeatedly enter and leave the 'seed bank', contributes to the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems with continuous environmental perturbations, such as glacier-fed streams.

J	Zhong, X; Jacquet, S				Zhong, Xu; Jacquet, Stephan			Differing assemblage composition and dynamics in T4-like myophages of two neighbouring sub-alpine lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Bacteriophages play an important role in plankton population dynamics and biogeochemical cycling, but their community dynamics and diversity are still poorly known, especially in fresh waters. 2. We conducted a 1-year investigation of the T4-like bacteriophages in the surface waters of two Western European peri-alpine lakes (lakes Annecy and Bourget), using fingerprinting and cloning-sequencing approaches targeting the major capsid protein g23 gene. 3. Our results suggest that T4-like bacteriophages are diverse (we found several new sequences) and differed substantially between the two lakes. Further, these phages displayed seasonal patterns with marked shifts in community composition. 4. Examining the dynamics of some individual constituents (e. g. DGGE bands), we found that (i) the majority of these myoviruses were rare (mean relative abundance <1%) and only a few were abundant (mean relative abundance >5%); (ii) the dominance of the most abundant DGGE bands changed throughout the year and their dynamics were very different between the two lakes; (iii) only a few bands (e. g. <20%) were detectable throughout the year and their proportion was higher in the oligomesotrophic Lake Bourget. 5. Our results suggest a highly dynamic T4-like myoviral assemblage. T4-like-viruses seem to conform to a standard model of community organisation and a common type of species abundance curve, with mainly rare organisms that occasionally may become abundant (termed a 'seed bank' for virus assemblages).																	0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2014	59	8					1577	1595		10.1111/fwb.12365							WOS:000339385100002

Windows of opportunity for germination of riparian species after restoring water level fluctuations: a field experiment with controlled seed banks	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Restoration activities aiming at increasing vegetation diversity often try to stimulate both dispersal and germination. In wetlands, dispersal and germination are coupled as water and water level fluctuations (WLF) simultaneously influence seed transport and germination conditions (soil moisture). Water regime shifts have been shown to affect vegetation composition. However, the interactions between WLF, dispersal and subsequent germination as drivers of such changes are still poorly understood, especially within the complexity of a field situation. 2. We tested the effect of soil moisture on ten riparian species in the greenhouse and sowed these species on 135 field locations in nine wetlands with recently restored WLF. We used quantile regressions to test the effects of WLF on the window of opportunity for germination from sown seeds and other seeds naturally dispersed to our plots, as well as on community diversity. 3. Soil moisture significantly affected germination both in the greenhouse and in the field. In the complexity of a field situation, a flooding depth just below the soil level, an intermediate flooding duration and a high flooding frequency provided the best opportunities for maximal germination. This was because these conditions enhanced germination from the seed bank as well as increasing germination from dispersed seeds. Seedling diversity showed identical patterns. 4. Other known (i.e., light conditions) and unknown factors played a role as we found low and variable germination, even under optimal conditions. We found evidence that WLF can affect vegetation zonation as flooded seedling communities contained more species with high moisture affinity. 5. Synthesis and applications. Water level fluctuations provide clear windows of opportunity for germination both from the seed bank and from dispersed seeds. Water regime changes are therefore likely to strongly affect recruitment opportunities and subsequent community assembly in riparian ecosystems, for instance through climate change or management. Water level fluctuations can be used as management tool to stimulate plant recruitment and seedling diversity in riparian wetlands.

J	Lee, SY; Rhie, YH; Kim, KS				Lee, Seung Youn; Rhie, Yong Ha; Kim, Ki Sun			Underdeveloped Embryos and Dormancy Type in Seeds of Two Heloniopsis Species Endemic to Korea	KOREAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Heloniopsis koreana and Heloniopsis tubiflora (Melanthiaceae) are endemic herbaceous species of the Korean Peninsula. The Melanthiaceae family has been described as having seeds with small, underdeveloped embryos at the time of dispersal, and morphological (MD) or morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). However, there are few reports on embryo growth, morphology, and seed germination in Heloniopsis species. The aims of this study were to investigate embryo growth and seed dormancy, and to determine the type of dormancy exhibited by these species. The effects of incubation temperatures, light conditions, and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) on dormancy break and seed germination were tested. Freshly matured seeds of the two species had small embryos that occupied about 9-11% of the length of the endosperm, and which increased by more than 300% in length before radicle emergence, indicating that the embryos are underdeveloped at the time of dispersal. Embryos in the seeds grew under warm temperature regimes (between 25/15 degrees C and 30/20 degrees C). GA(3) application (tested only in the light) overcame seed dormancy and promoted germination. Approximately 30% of the seeds of H. koreana and approximately 40% of the seeds of H. tub/flora germinated in suitable environmental conditions (light and temperature) within 4 weeks. Therefore, 30-40% of the seeds of the two species exhibited MD, and the rest of the seeds had non-deep simple MPD. Light was found to be one of the critical factors for germination because no seed of either of the two Heloniopsis species germinated under constant dark conditions, and thus, these species have the potential to form a persistent soil seed bank. Understanding these germination requirements will help in development of effective strategies to increase the establishment of seedlings in their native habitat.																	1226-8763					AUG	2014	32	4					550	557		10.7235/hort.2014.14025							WOS:000342247000017						
J	Marteinsdottir, B				Marteinsdottir, Bryndis			Seed Rain and Seed Bank Reveal that Seed Limitation Strongly Influences Plant Community Assembly in Grasslands	PLOS ONE												Dispersal is an important factor in plant community assembly, but assembly studies seldom include information on actual dispersal into communities, i.e. the local propagule pool. The aim of this study was to determine which factors influence plant community assembly by focusing on two phases of the assembly process: the dispersal phase and the establishment phase. At 12 study sites in grazed ex-arable fields in Sweden the local plant community was determined and in a 100-m radius around the centre of each site, the regional species pool was measured. The local seed bank and the seed rain was explored to estimate the local propagule pool. Trait-based models were then applied to investigate if species traits (height, seed mass, clonal abilities, specific leaf area and dispersal method) and regional abundance influenced which species from the regional species pool, dispersed to the local community (dispersal phase) and which established (establishment phase). Filtering of species during the dispersal phase indicates the effect of seed limitation while filtering during the establishment phase indicates microsite limitation. On average 36% of the regional species pool dispersed to the local sites and of those 78% did establish. Species with enhanced dispersal abilities, e.g. higher regional abundance, smaller seeds and dispersed by cattle, were more likely to disperse to the sites than other species. At half the sites, dispersal was influenced by species height. Species establishment was however mainly unlinked to the traits included in this study. This study underlines the importance of seed limitation in local plant community assembly. It also suggests that without information on species dispersal into a site, it is difficult to distinguish between the influence of dispersal and establishment abilities, and thus seed and microsite limitation, as both can be linked to the same trait.

J	Tessler, N; Wittenberg, L; Provizor, E; Greenbaum, N				Tessler, Naama; Wittenberg, Lea; Provizor, Ella; Greenbaum, Noam			The influence of short-interval recurrent forest fires on the abundance of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) on Mount Carmel, Israel	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The increasing number of fires, fire size, and decreasing fire recurrence intervals are major environmental factors in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, and are known to affect Aleppo pine (Pious halepensis) forests. The fact that in the Mediterranean basin most fires are man-made increases the danger of fires recurring at short intervals. P. halepensis is a lowland Mediterranean species with a disjunct east-Mediterranean population in Israel and Jordan, with the Mount Carmel population as one of the few native pine forests in Israel. Here we assess the effect of recurrent fires on the regeneration and spatial distribution of P. halepensis, as reflected by the number of trees at 18 sites, according to the number of previous fires and the time elapsed since the last fire. At each site, 100 x 1 m(-2) squares were randomly placed to record numbers of trees. Results indicate that in most cases the number of pines per unit area is inversely proportional to the number of fires. For example, tree density in sites that were last burnt during the spring of 2005, varied between 1.2 trees m(-2) (single-fire), and 0.25 and 0.39 trees m(-2) in two- and three-fire sites, respectively, while in the unburnt control sites pine density was 0.46 trees m(-2). The effect of recurrent fires, however, was particularly evident when the time interval between two successive fires was shorter than 20 years - the time needed for P. halepensis trees to mature and produce an adequate canopy seed bank. Apparently, not only the number of fires, but also the fire season has a major effect on regeneration dynamics. Although frequent recurrent fires reduce the number of pines at the site, their total elimination from any site never occurred, demonstrating the resilience of this species and its accommodation to short-interval recurrent fires. These results are crucial for establishing post-fire management programmes in fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Population dynamics of Aster pyrenaeus Desf., a threatened species of temperate forest edges: A view of meso- and micro-scales	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The effect of forest edges on population viability is one of the most unexplored aspects of plant conservation, and questions arise as to the most adequate management model for preserving species in these habitats. Here, we investigate the population dynamics of a high-priority species (Aster pyrenaeus) related to temperate forest edges in northern Spain. One isolated population was monitored during a 6-year period to analyse its response to habitat configuration at different scales. The effect of the sun-shade gradient was tested at the micro-scale using vegetation cover classes, and stochastic simulations were conducted at the meso-scale using spatially explicit models. At the micro-scale, monitored individuals were preferably located in sunny and semi-shady habitats, where population growth was greater. Species presence at the meso-scale was restricted to mixed shady vegetation, showing a null extinction risk in all the tested scenarios but a high probability of decline under past land use. The studied population seems to have persisted on historical remnants with habitat heterogeneity, supporting the hypothesis that the species has its proper ecological niche in grassland-forest edges. We conclude that the conservation management of plant populations dependent on forest edges should consider the maintenance of heterogeneous habitats.

IN MARANHAO STATE, NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL	REVISTA ARVORE												The objective of this research was to identify and assess community structure and diversity of herbaceous invasive species present in the soil seed bank in subsistence cropping areas in the municipalities of Bacabal, Lago Verde, Sao Luis Gonzaga and Vitorino Freire, located in parts of the Ombrophilous Open Forest with Babassu, in Maranhao State, northeastern Brazil. Fifteen 50 m2 plots were laid out in each municipality from which 90 soil samples were taken with an open metal template of 25 x 16 x 3 cm and placed in trays in the greenhouse. Data assessed were individual and species number; relative values of density, frequency, abundance and the importance value of each species. Data were submitted to the Analysis of Variance and to the Principal Coordinate Analysis. The diversity was computed by the Shannon's Diversity Index. The highest floristic richness in the seed bank was observed in Bacabal with 50 species from 34 genera and 17 families, which also had the highest number of individuals, with 11.541. The highest floristic similarity was observed between Lago Verde and Vitorino Freire. The dominant species based in the importance value were: Ludwigia octovalvis (VI = 34,8%) in Bacabal, Scleria lithosperma (VI = 37.0%) in Lago Verde and Boerhavia erecta (VI = 40.4%), in Sao Luis Gonzaga and (VI = 57.0%) in Vitorino Freire. Diversity reached the highest value in Bacabal with H'=2.66 nats ind(-1). The results may be used to forecast invasive species infestations in municipalities of the studied region.

J	Walsh, MJ; Powles, SB				Walsh, Michael J.; Powles, Stephen B.			High Seed Retention at Maturity of Annual Weeds Infesting Crop Fields Highlights the Potential for Harvest Weed Seed Control	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Seed production of annual weeds persisting through cropping phases replenishes/establishes viable seed banks from which these weeds will continue to interfere with crop production. Harvest weed seed control (HWSC) systems are now viewed as an effective means of interrupting this process by targeting mature weed seed, preventing seed bank inputs. However, the efficacy of these systems is directly related to the proportion of total seed production that the targeted weed species retains (seed retention) at crop maturity. This study determined the seed retention of the four dominant annual weeds of Australian cropping systems - annual ryegrass, wild radish, brome grass, and wild oat. Beginning at the first opportunity for wheat harvest and on a weekly basis for 28 d afterwards the proportion of total seed production retained above a 15 cm harvest cutting height was determined for these weed species present in wheat crops at nine locations across the Western Australian (WA) wheat-belt. Very high proportions of total seed production were retained at wheat crop maturity for annual ryegrass (85 %), wild radish (99 %), brome grass (77 %), and wild oat (84 %). Importantly, seed retention remained high for annual ryegrass and wild radish throughout the 28 d harvest period. At the end of this period, 63 and 79 % of total seed production for annual ryegrass and wild radish respectively, was retained above harvest cutting height. However, seed retention for brome grass (41 %) and wild oat (39%) was substantially lower after 28 d. High seed retention at crop maturity, as identified here, clearly indicates the potential for HWSC systems to reduce seed bank replenishment and diminish subsequent crop interference by the four most problematic species of Australian crops.

EFFECT OF PERIOD OF SUGARCANE CULTIVATION ON THE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF WEED SEEDS IN THE SOIL PROFILE	PLANTA DANINHA												An experiment was laid down in a screen house to determine the distribution of weed seeds at different soil depths and periods of cultivation of sugarcane in Ilorin, Nigeria. Soil samples from different depth levels (0-10 cm, 11-20 cm and 21-30 cm) were collected after harvesting of canes from three different land use fields (continuous sugarcane cultivation for > 20 years, continuous sugarcane cultivation for < 10 years after long fallow period and continuous sugarcane cultivation for < 5 years after long fallow period) in November, 2012. One kilogram of the sieved composite soil samples was arranged in the screen house and watered at alternate days. Germinating weed seedlings were identified, counted and then pulled out for the period of 8 months. Land use and soil depth had a highly significant (p <= 0.05) effect on the total number of weeds that emerged from the soil samples. The 0-10 cm of the soil depth had the highest weed seedlings that emerged. There was an equal weed seed distribution at the 11-20 cm and 21-30 cm depths of the soil. Sugarcane fields which have been continuously cultivated for a long period of time with highly disturbing soil tillage practices tend to have larger seed banks in deeper soil layers (11-20 cm and 21-30 cm) while recently opened fields had significantly larger seed banks at the 0-10 cm soil sampling depth.

J	Eager, EA; Rebarber, R; Tenhumberg, B				Eager, Eric Alan; Rebarber, Richard; Tenhumberg, Brigitte			Modeling and Analysis of a Density-Dependent Stochastic Integral Projection Model for a Disturbance Specialist Plant and Its Seed Bank	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												In many plant species dormant seeds can persist in the soil for one to several years. The formation of these seed banks is especially important for disturbance specialist plants, as seeds of these species germinate only in disturbed soil. Seed movement caused by disturbances affects the survival and germination probability of seeds in the seed bank, which subsequently affect population dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic integral projection model for a general disturbance specialist plant-seed bank population that takes into account both the frequency and intensity of random disturbances, as well as vertical seed movement and density-dependent seedling establishment. We show that the probability measures associated with the plant-seed bank population converge weakly to a unique measure, independent of initial population. We also show that the population either persists with probability one or goes extinct with probability one, and provides a sharp criteria for this dichotomy. We apply our results to an example motivated by wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus) populations, and explore how the presence or absence of a "storage effect" impacts how a population responds to different disturbance scenarios.																	0092-8240	1522-9602				JUL	2014	76	7					1809	1834		10.1007/s11538-014-9978-y							WOS:000340928600012	24916367

ROLES OF MATERNAL EFFECTS AND NUCLEAR GENETIC COMPOSITION CHANGE ACROSS THE LIFE CYCLE OF CROP-WILD HYBRIDS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: The fitness of an offspring may depend on its nuclear genetic composition (via both parental genotypes) as well as on genetic maternal effects (via only the maternal parent). Understanding the relative importance of these two genetic factors is particularly important for research on crop-wild hybridization, since traits with important genetic maternal effects (e.g., seed size) often differ among crops and their relatives. We hypothesized that the effects of these genetic factors on fitness components would change across the life cycle of hybrids. Methods: We followed seed, plant size, and reproductive traits in field experiments with wild and four crop-wild hybrids of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), which differed in nuclear genetic composition and maternal parent (wild or F1 hybrid). Key results: We identified strong genetic maternal effects for early life cycle characteristics, with seeds produced on an F1 mother having premature germination, negligible seed dormancy, and greater seedling size. Increased percentages of crop alleles also increased premature germination and reduced dormancy in seeds produced on a wild mother. For mature plants, nuclear genetic composition dominated: greater percentages of crop alleles reduced height, branching, and fecundity. Conclusions: Particular backcrosses between hybrids and wilds may differentially facilitate movement of crop alleles into wild populations due to their specific features. For example, backcross seeds produced on wild mothers can persist in the seed bank, illustrating the importance of genetic maternal effects, whereas backcross individuals with either wild or F1 mothers have high fecundity, resulting from their wild-like nuclear genetic composition.

Large-scale bloom of Akashiwo sanguinea in the Northern California current system in 2009	HARMFUL ALGAE												Significant seabird mortality on the Oregon (OR) and Washington (WA) coast in 2009 has been attributed to a massive bloom of the dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea (K. Hirasaka) G. Hansen & O. Moestrup. Initial, albeit limited, observations suggested this bloom began in WA and reached OR waters through southward transport. Here, we explore a combination of remote sensing products and an exceptional latitudinal dataset of plankton counts collected in the surfzone and offshore in OR and WA coastal waters. Records of satellite ocean color for this period support the new finding that blooms were concurrent in OR and WA waters, with no evidence for latitudinal propagation as had been previously suggested. Plankton analyses further indicate that there was a rapid and synchronized increase of A. sanguinea between late August and mid-September of 2009 along wide swaths of the OR and WA coasts. Bloom onset occurred during a prolonged quiescent and warm period in late August-early September, near the end of the March-October upwelling phase. An upwelling event in October likely contributed to foam production through vertical mixing of A. sanguinea rich waters. Bloom intensity peaked earlier and at higher levels in WA waters as compared to OR with cell concentrations exceeding 1.5 x 10(6) cells L-1 (WA) and similar to 350,000 cells L-1 (OR). In OR samples, A. sanguinea cells comprised upwards of 90% of dinoflagellate cell counts and similar to 30% of total phytoplankton cells. At some locations, A. sanguinea persisted well into November-December of 2009, during which time satellite sea surface temperature records indicated anomalously warm surface waters (up to similar to 5 degrees C greater than climatological means). Taken together, the data reveal a HAB event of a magnitude unprecedented in over a decade of observations. We hypothesize that these blooms originated from either a cryptic cyst bed and/or a pelagic seed bank of viable vegetative cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Enari, H; Sakamaki-Enari, H				Enari, Hiroto; Sakamaki-Enari, Haruka			Synergistic effects of primates and dung beetles on soil seed accumulation in snow regions	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												This study aimed to reveal the soil seed accumulation processes for endozoochorous plants in the heavy-snowfall forests of Japan, where seed dispersal agents are few when compared to tropical forests. We assessed (1) primary seed dispersal by Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) by identifying dispersed seeds found in their feces, and (2) secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles by using beads (as seeds mimics) of different sizes, to quantify the frequency of seed burial and burial depths. We studied this diplochorous system in different forest types (undisturbed beech forest, conifer plantation, and secondary beech-oak forest) and during the spring and summer seasons. The key findings were as follows: (1) macaques dispersed the seeds of 11 and 14 plant species during spring and summer, respectively; (2) seeds dispersed by macaques in the spring were smaller and twice as abundant than those dispersed in the summer; (3) although no differences were observed in the amount of beads buried by beetles between seasons, all bead sizes tended to be buried in deeper soil layers in the spring than in the summer; and (4) the seed supply to the soil in undisturbed beech forest and conifer plantation was greater than the one in secondary beech-oak forest. Similar to what has been observed in tropical forests, seeds defecated by frugivorous mammals can be successfully incorporated into the underground soil seed bank through a diplochorous macaque-beetle system in temperate forests of deep snow regions.

J	Ma, MJ; Ma, Z; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Ma, Zhen; Du, Guozhen			Effects of Water Level on Three Wetlands Soil Seed Banks on the Tibetan Plateau	PLOS ONE												Background: Although the effect of water level on germination in soil seed banks has been documented in many ecosystems, the mechanism is not fully understood, and to date no empirical studies on this subject exist. Further, no work has been done on the effect of water level on seed banks of drying and saline-alkaline wetlands in alpine areas on the Tibetan Plateau. Methodology: We examined the effects of water level (0 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm) on seed germination and seedling establishment from soil seed banks at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths in typical, drying, and saline-alkaline wetlands. We also explore the potential role of soil seed bank in restoration of drying and saline-alkaline wetlands. Principal Findings: Species richness decreased with increase in water level, but there almost no change in seed density. A huge difference exists in species composition of the seed bank among different water levels in all three wetlands, especially between 0 cm and 5 cm and 0 cm and 10 cm. Similarity of species composition between seed bank and plant community was higher in 0 cm water level in drying wetland than in the other two wetlands. The similarity was much higher in 0 cm water level than in 5 cm and 10 cm water levels in all three wetlands. Species composition of the alpine wetland plant community changed significantly after drying and salinization, however, species composition of the seed bank was unchanged regardless of the environment change. Conclusions/Significance: Water level greatly affects seed bank recruitment and plant community establishment. Further, different water levels in restored habitats are likely to determine its species composition of the plant community. The seed bank is important in restoration of degraded wetlands. Successful restoration of drying and salinization wetlands could depend on the seed bank.

This restoration is usually approached from the perspective of plant cover regeneration, ignoring plant-soil interactions and the consequences for plant growth. The addition of a 30 cm layer of topsoil is a common practice in roadslope restoration projects to increase vegetation recovery. However topsoil is a scarce resource. This study assesses the effects of topsoil spreading and its depth (10 to 30 cm) on two surrogates of microbial activity (beta-glucosidase and phosphatase enzymes activity and soil respiration), and on plant cover, plant species richness and floristic composition of embankment vegetation. The study also evaluates the differences in selected physic-chemical properties related to soil fertility between topsoil and the original embankment substrate. Topsoil was found to have higher values of organic matter (11%), nitrogen (44%), assimilable phosphorous (50%) and silt content (54%) than the original embankment substrate. The topsoil spreading treatment increased microbial activity, and its application increased beta-glucosidase activity (45%), phosphatase activity (57%) and soil respiration (60%). Depth seemed to affect soil respiration, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activity. Topsoil application also enhanced the species richness of restored embankments in relation to controls. Nevertheless, the depth of the spread topsoil did not significantly affect the resulting plant cover, species richness or floristic composition, suggesting that both depths could have similar effects on short-term recovery of the vegetation cover. A significant implication of these results is that it permits the application of thinner topsoil layers, with major savings in this scarce resource during the subsequent slope restoration work, but the quality of topsoil relative to the original substrate should be previously assessed on a site by site basis.

Using Precision Prairie Reconstruction to Drive the Native Seeded Species Colonization Process	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoring forb richness to the northern tallgrass prairie (U.S.A.) is often problematic. A potential solution is the establishment of native forb-seeded patches that can serve as colonization sites. This study was designed to determine the following: (1) the success at which native forbs sown in small patches can colonize the surrounding vegetation matrix and (2) whether soil amendments (C additions, P fertilization, and seed bank reduction) applied to the seeded sites can facilitate such colonization (patch quality). Colonization was investigated at (1) the immediate surrounding (1 m belt transect, BT) of the seeded sites and (2) in disturbed but not seeded patches located 3 m from the seeded site (out-plots). Soil amendments did not affect colonization, but native forb density in the BT and out-plots was correlated to the density of forbs in the seeded sites (r(2) = 0.3, p < 0.01). Seeded native forb density in the out-plots was higher than in the adjacent BT (19 vs. 5 plants/m(2)), suggesting that competition from the matrix vegetation may be more important in forb colonization than distance from the source. Taller forbs with larger seeds showed advantages in colonization success. This study showed that the colonization of matrix vegetation with native forbs from seeded patches is a viable method for prairie reconstruction but requires the availability of disturbed sites. In most prairies, animal-generated soil disturbances are common. In their absence, disturbances of the vegetation matrix will need to be added to the management plan.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				JUL	2014	22	4					465	471		10.1111/rec.12088							WOS:000339662400005

Biogenic ethylene promotes seedling emergence from the sediment seed bank in an ephemeral tropical rock pool habitat	PLANT AND SOIL												Ethylene has been increasingly implicated as a regulatory mechanism in plant germination, growth, and development, and is produced from the sediments of freshwater habitats. In this paper, we analyse the production and origin of ethylene from ephemeral freshwater rock pool sediments, and explore the role of ethylene in regulating seedling emergence from the seed bank. The production of ethylene from rock pool sediments subjected to variable moisture content and antibiotic treatments was assessed through gas chromatography, and the role of ethylene in regulating seedling emergence was determined by seedling emergence assays and seed germination experiments. Biogenic ethylene production from rock pool sediments occurred rapidly (3-6 h) following inundation, with the majority of seedling emergence occurring between 36 and 72 h. Inoculation of sediments with streptomycin and amphotericin B resulted in significantly reduced ethylene production (up to 60 % and 84 % respectively), and completely inhibited seedling emergence. Additionally, the exposure of dormant seeds to ethylene resulted in significantly increased seed germination percentage in five out of six rock pool species. Biogenic ethylene production may play an important role in regulating seed dormancy and the timing of seedling emergence from the sediment seed bank following inundation events in rock pools and other freshwater aquatic communities.

J	Stevens, N; Seal, CE; Archibald, S; Bond, W				Stevens, Nicola; Seal, Charlotte E.; Archibald, Sally; Bond, William			Increasing temperatures can improve seedling establishment in arid-adapted savanna trees	OECOLOGIA												Plant species are shifting their ranges in response to global climate change, thus intensifying the need to predict such changes accurately. As the environmental requirements controlling plant distribution act differently at each developmental stage, there is a need to acquire a demographic-specific understanding of the factors which determine these distributions. Here we investigated the germination niche of two common savanna species Acacia nigrescens and Colophospermum mopane, with the aims to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on seed germination and establishment and to explore the impact of higher temperatures on the establishment success of savanna trees. Under laboratory conditions, we used thermal gradient plates to determine the thermal germination niche of both species, and a water stress experiment was conducted on C. mopane to account for water-temperature interactions. Using these data we parameterised a soil-moisture model to determine germination and establishment success under field conditions at current and future temperatures (+4 A degrees C). Based on this model, higher future temperatures will not limit germination directly, but they will reduce the number of germination events by reducing the time window of suitable available soil water. Conversely, warmer conditions will accelerate the rate of radicle extension and increase the frequency of seedling establishment events. An additional advantage of higher temperatures is that fewer seeds will germinate, resulting in slower seed bank depletion when successful seedling establishment events do occur.

Habitat and microsite influence demography of two herbs in intact and degraded scrub	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Identifying environmental factors associated with vital rate variation is critical to predict population consequences of environmental perturbation. We used matrix models to explore effects of habitat and microsite on demography of two widespread herbs, Chamaecrista fasciculata (partridge pea) and Balduina angustifolia (yellow buttons). We evaluated models simulating population dynamics in common microsites (shrub, litter, bare sand) within two habitats (intact, degraded Florida scrub) using data on experimental populations initiated by sowing seeds, and natural seed production. Models included four stages (seed bank, small vegetative, large vegetative, reproductive) and three vital rates (survival, growth, fecundity), summarized in sixteen transitions. We conducted life table response experiments to assess contributions of each habitat and microsite to population growth rates. We found that (1) C. fasciculata had greatest population growth in degraded habitat and litter microsites, (2) B. angustifolia had similar population growth between habitats and greatest in bare sand microsites, (3) advancing growth transitions of C. fasciculata had greatest elasticity on population growth in degraded habitat, shrub, and litter, as did seed survival in intact habitat and bare sand, (4) seed survival and advancing growth transitions of B. angustifolia had greatest elasticity on population growth in both habitats, as did seed survival in shrub and litter, and advancing growth in bare sand. Greater population growth of C. fasciculata in degraded scrub is probably explained by release from belowground competition; B. angustifolia may be most affected by competition with shrubs. Microsites in intact scrub were not ecologically equivalent to those in degraded scrub emphasizing that intact scrub is ecologically complex and critical to preserve.

J	Karlik, P; Poschlod, P				Karlik, Petr; Poschlod, Peter			Soil seed-bank composition reveals the land-use history of calcareous grasslands	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We compared soil seed banks and vegetation of recent (established on abandoned arable fields) and ancient (continuously managed as pastures at least since 1830) calcareous grasslands if there is any impact of former arable field use. The study was carried out in two regions of Southern Germany with well-preserved dry grassland vegetation: the western Jurassic mountains (Kaltes Feld) and the climatically drier eastern part of Southern Germany (Kallmunz). Total number of species in the seed bank was similar in both regions, but species composition partly differed, reflecting phytogeographical differences between the regions. The total number of emerged seedlings showed a large disparity (5457 compared to 2523 seedlings/m(2) in Kaltes Feld and Kallmunz, respectively). Though there were differences in seed bank composition and size, we found a uniform pattern of plant traits (affiliation to phytosociological groups, Raunkiaer plant life-forms and seed longevity), which depended on the age of the grassland. The main conclusion is that seed banks in contemporary calcareous grasslands still reflect the history of former land use - in this case arable cultivation, even though it occurred a long time ago (up to 150 years). Indicators of former arable fields are germinable seeds of weeds which have persisted in the soil to the present. By contrast, weedy species are completely absent from the seed banks of ancient grasslands. Soil seed banks of recent grasslands may be of substantial conservation importance because they may store seeds of rare and endangered weed species such as Kickxia spuria, Silene noctiflora and Stachys annua, the majority of which have already gone extinct from the current vegetation of the study sites.

This work is part of a long-term experimental protocol initiated in 2003. We tested the effects of various management practices, such as summer crop systems (soybean vs. maize-soybean rotation), stocking methods (continuous vs. rotational) and grazing intensities (low vs. moderate), on Italian ryegrass pasture establishment. In addition, we tested resilience of the system by testing pasture's ability to re-establish following a year without seed head production. The experiment consisted in the rotation, on the same area, of Italian ryegrass pasture grazed by sheep during the winter and up to the end of the grass production cycle, and soybean or soybean-maize grain crops rotation cultivated during the summer. The pasture established itself by self-seeding since 2005. Data were collected in 2011 and 2012 stocking season. The soybean summer crop, continuous stocking and low grazing intensity, all positively affected the production of reproductive tillers in 2011. Grazing intensity in 2011 strongly influenced early vegetative tiller densities (before crop harvest) in 2012. However, none of the grazing intensity or the stocking method treatments affected herbage mass at the end of pasture establishment in 2011 or 2012. On the other hand, the soybean summer crop positively affected pasture establishment, both in term of tiller densities and herbage mass at the end of pasture establishment. The removal of all seed heads in 2011 (preventing seed production) resulted in the total failure of pasture establishment in 2012. Overall, Italian ryegrass establishment by self-seeding relies on the annual replacement of the soil seed bank. This experiment demonstrated that under various stocking methods, moderate grazing intensity and maize or soybean summer crop, Italian ryegrass pasture establishment by self-seeding remains successful even when the stocking periods extended up to the end of the grass production cycle. Self-seeding with moderate grazing intensity ensures successful pasture establishment, reduces labour and costs and allows to increase the stocking period and so animal live weight gain over the grazing season.

Seasonal fluctuations in rodent seed caching and consumption behaviour in fynbos shrublands: Implications for fire management	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The consumption and dispersal of seeds by rodents play an important role in the seed bank dynamics of many plant species. Seed dispersal versus consumption patterns may however vary seasonally with food availability. We investigated whether the fate of Leucadendron sessile seeds was seasonally variable, and whether it could be explained by food availability. First we established that the seeds of most non-serotinous, large-seeded plants were released in early summer. Then we monitored seed dispersal and consumption behaviour, primarily by the nocturnal seed caching and dispersing rodent, Acomys subspinosus over one year. To investigate seasonal fluctuations in the diet of A. subspinosus, we conducted regular faecal analyses of this rodent and compared them to those of Rhabdomys pumilio, a diurnal rodent which is known to consume seeds but not cache them. While the diet of R. pumilio does not appear to fluctuate greatly across seasons, the diet of A. subspinosus does. A. subspinosus changes its diet from an insect dominated diet in winter and spring to a diet with a strong seed component in summer and autumn. Corresponding to this dietary shift, A. subspinosus changes its primary foraging behaviour from seed consumption to seed burial. These results suggest that a plentiful bank of seeds in autumn encourages seed caching but that by winter, the seed bank is so depleted that A. subspinosus consumes whatever it finds until summer when the seed bank is replenished. Our results suggest that A. subspinosus seed dispersal and consumptive behaviour fluctuates during the year and this appears to be related to seed availability. This is likely to cause temporal fluctuations in the seed bank, and consequently the timing of fires will have strong effects on seed germination. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Eager, EA; Rebarber, R; Tenhumberg, B				Eager, Eric Alan; Rebarber, Richard; Tenhumberg, Brigitte			Global asymptotic stability of plant-seed bank models	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												Many plant populations have persistent seed banks, which consist of viable seeds that remain dormant in the soil for many years. Seed banks are important for plant population dynamics because they buffer against environmental perturbations and reduce the probability of extinction. Viability of the seeds in the seed bank can depend on the seed's age, hence it is important to keep track of the age distribution of seeds in the seed bank. In this paper we construct a general density-dependent plant-seed bank model where the seed bank is age-structured. We consider density dependence in both seedling establishment and seed production, since previous work has highlighted that overcrowding can suppress both of these processes. Under certain assumptions on the density dependence, we prove that there is a globally stable equilibrium population vector which is independent of the initial state. We derive an analytical formula for the equilibrium population using methods from feedback control theory. We apply these results to a model for the plant species Cirsium palustre and its seed bank.																	0303-6812	1432-1416				JUL	2014	69	1					1	37		10.1007/s00285-013-0689-z							WOS:000337044900001	23712394

Seed-bank longevity was determined from germination trials of seeds exhumed from extinct and extant sites via a 10-year glasshouse trial and by in situ sowing experiments. From 27 populations, 98 cohorts were followed and matrix models of transitions from seeds to adults were used to evaluate the intrinsic rate of population growth against disturbance histories. Ten populations (38 cohorts) with different disturbance histories were used to evaluate sensitivities in vital rates. Most populations had few individuals (similar to 30) and were transient (< 5 years above ground). The intrinsic population growth rate was rarely > 1 and all but two populations were extinct at year 20. Seeds were short-lived in situ. Although > 1000 seeds per plant were produced annually in most populations, sensitivity analysis showed that the transition to the seed bank and the transition from the seed bank to seedlings are key vulnerabilities in the life-cycle. Seedling establishment is promoted by recent disturbance. Increasing the number of disturbance events in populations, even severe disturbances that almost extirpate populations, significantly increases longer-term population persistence. Only populations that were disturbed annually survived the full 20 years of the study. The results show that translocated populations of O. flocktoniae will fail to persist without active management.																	0305-7364	1095-8290				JUL	2014	114	1					85	96		10.1093/aob/mcu082							WOS:000339809600006	24844983

Invasive plants as drivers of regime shifts: identifying high-priority invaders that alter feedback relationships	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim A major challenge for invasion ecology is to identify high-impact invaders to guide prioritization of management interventions. We argue that species with the potential to cause regime shifts (altered states of ecosystem structure and function that are difficult or impossible to reverse) should be prioritized. These are species that modify ecosystems in ways that enhance their own persistence and suppress that of native species through reinforcing feedback processes. Methods Using both systems analysis and meta-analysis approaches, we synthesized changes to ecosystems caused by 173 invasive plant species. For the systems analysis, we examined published studies of impacts of invasive plants to determine which presented evidence consistent with a reinforcement of feedback processes. For the meta-analysis, we calculated the effect size ratio between standardized changes in recipient ecosystem and in the status of introduced species as an indication of a reinforcing feedback in particular species-environment combinations. The systems analysis approach allowed us to conceptualize regime shifts in invader-dominated landscapes and to estimate the likelihood of such changes occurring. The meta-analysis allowed us to quantitatively verify the conceptual model and the key invader-context feedbacks and to detect the strength and direction of feedbacks. Results Most reinforcing feedbacks involve impacts on soil-nutrient cycling by shrub and tree invaders in forests and herbaceous invaders in wetlands. Feedbacks resulting in regime shifts were most likely related to processes associated with seed banks, fire and nutrient cycling. Results were used to derive a key for identifying high-impact invaders. Main conclusions Identifying combinations of plant life-forms and ecosystems most likely to result in regime shifts is a robust approach for predicting high-impact invasions and therefore for prioritizing management interventions. The meta-analysis revealed the need for more quantitative studies, including manipulative experiments, on ecosystem feedbacks.

Cross-biome syntheses are hindered by the fact that the outcomes of disturbance studies are strongly affected by the choice of diversity measures, and the spatial and temporal scales of measurements. The aim of this study is to overcome these weaknesses by applying a wide range of diversity measures to a data set derived from identical sampling in three distinct ecosystems. We analyzed three fence-line contrasts (heavier vs. lighter grazing intensity), representing different degrees of aridity (from arid to semiarid) and precipitation regimes (summer rain vs. winter rain) in southern Africa. We tested the impact of grazing intensity on multiple aspects of plant diversity (species and functional group level, richness and evenness components, alpha and beta diversity, and composition) at two spatial scales, and for both 5-yr means and interannual variability. Heavier grazing reduced total plant cover and substantially altered the species and functional composition at all sites. However, a significant decrease in species alpha diversity was detected at only one of the three sites. By contrast, alpha diversity of plant functional groups responded consistently across ecosystems and scales, with a significant decrease at heavier grazing intensity. The cover-based measures of functional group diversity responded more sensitively and more consistently than functional group richness. Beta diversity of species and functional types increased under heavier grazing, showing that at larger scales, the heterogeneity of the community composition and the functional structure were increased. Heavier grazing mostly increased interannual variability of alpha diversity, while effects on beta diversity and cover were inconsistent. Our results suggest that species diversity alone may not adequately reflect the shifts in vegetation structure that occur in response to increased grazing intensity in the dryland biomes of southern Africa. Compositional and structural changes of the vegetation are better reflected by trait-based diversity measures. In particular, measures of plant functional diversity that include evenness represent a promising tool to detect and quantify disturbance effects on ecosystems.

Granivory of invasive, naturalized, and native plants in communities differentially susceptible to invasion	ECOLOGY												Seed predation is an important biotic filter that can influence abundance and spatial distributions of native species through differential effects on recruitment. This filter may also influence the relative abundance of nonnative plants within habitats and the communities' susceptibility to invasion via differences in granivore identity, abundance, and food preference. We evaluated the effect of postdispersal seed predators on the establishment of invasive, naturalized, and native species within and between adjacent forest and steppe communities of eastern Washington, USA that differ in severity of plant invasion. Seed removal from trays placed within guild-specific exclosures revealed that small mammals were the dominant seed predators in both forest and steppe. Seeds of invasive species (Bromus tectorum, Cirsium arvense) were removed significantly less than the seeds of native (Pseudoroegneria spicata, Balsamorhiza sagittata) and naturalized (Secale cereale, Centaurea cyanus) species. Seed predation limited seedling emergence and establishment in both communities in the absence of competition in a pattern reflecting natural plant abundance: S. cereale was most suppressed, B. tectorum was least suppressed, and P. spicata was suppressed at an intermediate level. Furthermore, seed predation reduced the residual seed bank for all species. Seed mass correlated with seed removal rates in the forest and their subsequent effects on plant recruitment; larger seeds were removed at higher rates than smaller seeds. Our vegetation surveys indicate higher densities and canopy cover of nonnative species occur in the steppe compared with the forest understory, suggesting the steppe may be more susceptible to invasion. Seed predation alone, however, did not result in significant differences in establishment for any species between these communities, presumably due to similar total small-mammal abundance between communities. Consequently, preferential seed predation by small mammals predicts plant establishment for our test species within these communities but not between them. Accumulating evidence suggests that seed predation can be an important biotic filter affecting plant establishment via differences in consumer preferences and abundance with important ramifications for plant invasions and in situ community assembly.

Effects of Disturbance Associated With Seismic Exploration for Oil and Gas Reserves in Coastal Marshes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Anthropogenic disturbances in wetland ecosystems can alter the composition and structure of plant assemblages and affect system functions. Extensive oil and gas extraction has occurred in wetland habitats along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast since the early 1900s. Activities involved with three-dimensional (3D) seismic exploration for these resources cause various disturbances to vegetation and soils. We documented the impact of a 3D seismic survey in coastal marshes in Louisiana, USA, along transects established before exploration began. Two semi-impounded marshes dominated by Spartina patens were in the area surveyed. Vegetation, soil, and water physicochemical data were collected before the survey, about 6 weeks following its completion, and every 3 months thereafter for 2 years. Soil cores for seed bank emergence experiments were also collected. Maximum vegetation height at impact sites was reduced in both marshes 6 weeks following the survey. In one marsh, total vegetation cover was also reduced, and dead vegetation cover increased, at impact sites 6 weeks after the survey. These effects, however, did not persist 3 months later. No effects on soil or water properties were identified. The total number of seeds that germinated during greenhouse studies increased at impact sites 5 months following the survey in both marshes. Although some seed bank effects persisted 1 year, these effects were not reflected in standing vegetation. The marshes studied were therefore resilient to the impacts resulting from 3D seismic exploration because vegetation responses were short term in that they could not be identified a few months following survey completion.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2014	54	1					30	50		10.1007/s00267-014-0274-2							WOS:000337285900005	24788940

Investigating Lag Phase and Invasion Potential of Vitex rotundifolia: A Coastal Dune Exotic	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												After initial establishment in nonnative environments, exotic species are often found in low numbers for long periods of time. After a lag phase, a transition to an exponential growth phase is characteristic. A broad question remains: Can we identify factors that contribute to the lag phase or assess the potential for additional invasion? Our approach employed a case study of V. rotundifolia (beach vitex), a nonnative dune plant introduced in the late 1980s to North and South Carolina. We performed manipulative and observational experiments on the sexual and asexual reproductive ecology, mating system, seed ecology, and pollination ecology to assess the possibility of additional invasion potential and to gain an understanding of potential among population variation and among site ecological variation that could contribute to a transition from lag to exponential spread phases. We found that vegetative reproduction, sexual reproduction, and viable seed set rates are high, and there is future potential for spread through vegetative reproduction as not all the ovules set seed. Pollinator activity varied by year and was consistent with increased fruit and seed set, indicating a likely mechanism contributing to current sexual reproductive success. Germination rate was low, but given the high numbers of seeds produced per square meter, we estimate an average of 13 new germinants m(-2) y(-1). On the basis of our observations, we found the potential for increased reproductive success and increased invasion potential. Management practices that minimize vegetative expansion from nearby sites and through seed dispersal are the highest priority.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2014	30	4					815	824		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00117.1							WOS:000339366800015

Hydrology, shore morphology and species traits affect seed dispersal, germination and community assembly in shoreline plant communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Seed dispersal and germination are two primary processes influencing plant community assembly. On freshwater shores, water levels regulate both processes. However, it is still unclear how water levels, shore morphology and species traits interactively affect seed dispersal and germination, and how these interactions determine plant community assembly. We hypothesize that a drawdown water regime enhances seed establishment compared to a year-round stable water level, that this increases species richness and diversity, and that this is modulated by species traits and shore morphology. 2. Germination of 20 wetland plant species with different dispersal capacities (floating capacity expressed as seed floatation half-time) and soil moisture preferences for germination (Ellenberg F) was tested on artificial shores in 24 outdoor ponds in two complementary experiments over 8 weeks. The 'dispersal experiment' tested the effect of water regime on recruitment of hydrochorously dispersing seeds. The 'seed bank experiment' tested the effect of water regime on germination from a sown seed bank, on steep and gradual shores. 3. In the dispersal experiment, the drawdown regime increased recruitment and species richness. Longer floating species colonized a larger shoreline section. Soil moisture preference for germination did not determine colonization patterns. 4. In the seed bank experiment, the drawdown regime increased the number of seedlings on gradual sloping shores, but not on steep shores. The number of germinating seedlings corresponded to the area subjected to the drawdown regime in both shore types. Species richness was not affected by water regime or shore morphology, and species traits did not determine shoreline colonization. Most seeds germinated in moist soil conditions for all species. 5. Synthesis. A spring drawdown instead of stable water regime stimulates establishment of hydrochorously dispersing seeds in temperate wetlands, leading to higher species richness and diversity. Germination from the seed bank is more affected by water regime and shore surface than by the tested species traits. Species traits, water levels and shore morphology together determine wetland plant community assembly, with dispersal as the main driver of seedling community diversity. Water-level regulations and shore morphology can be used to influence plant communities in wetland restoration.

Waterproofing Topsoil Stockpiles Minimizes Viability Decline in the Soil Seed Bank in an Arid Environment	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Topsoil is a valuable resource for revegetation of mine sites as it contains seeds of plant species indigenous to the local environment. As mine site restoration is undertaken after the completion of mining, it is a common practice to stockpile topsoil in preparation for restoration activities. While many studies have found a decrease in seedling emergence with increasing stockpile age in temperate regions around the world, a few examine the effect of stockpile age on topsoil seed bank and seedling recruitment in arid environments. Seed longevity is promoted under dry conditions whereas viability loss is increased under warm and moist conditions. Here in a study in Australia's Great Sandy Desert, the effect of topsoil storage age and method of storing topsoil (under-cover and exposed) on seedling recruitment was examined for a major gold mining site. There was a trend for lower seedling emergence (68% lower) and species richness (30% lower) from topsoil stored for 2 years than from topsoil direct returned and topsoil stored for 1 year. Seedling emergence from topsoil stockpiled for 2 years was more than 3.5-fold higher from covered topsoil stockpiles than uncovered topsoil stockpiles. For two ecologically dominant species, after 2 years of storage, seedling emergence of the grass Triodia basedowii was 13% of direct returned topsoil and seedling emergence of the shrub Acacia stellaticeps was 68% of direct returned topsoil. The implication of the decline in seedling emergence from topsoil stockpiling on mine site revegetation in a biodiverse arid region is discussed.

We allocated 16 contiguous plots of 25 x 25 m, covering the entire forest area (1 ha). In each plot, we collected five samples of surface soil (0.30 x 0.30 x 0.05 m) to evaluate the seed bank by germination method and a sample of 1.0 m(2) litter for evaluation of accumulated litter. We performed the classification of individuals and species of seedlings of the seed bank as for successional category, dispersion syndrome and life form. 5,555 seedlings were recorded, belonging to 32 families and 93 species and morphotype which grouped all the vines. We recorded the predominance of zoochoric dispersion syndrome and, as for life form, a higher percentage of herbs, at the species level (48.6%) and individuals (44.8%). Among the shrub-arboreal species, we observed a higher percentage of successional category pioneer, species level (75.1%) and individuals (85.1%). The accumulated litter average was of 3,432 kg ha(-1), with the leaf fraction representing 65% and significant correlation with basal area (p = 0.031, R-2 = 0.29) of the tree stratum. The results indicate that the soil seed bank of forest restored after 40 years of its implementation is similar, as for ecological relations, to the areas of stational semidecidual forest in the same region and other restored areas that were also used for planting seedlings.																	0100-6762					JUL-AUG	2014	38	4					609	620		10.1590/S0100-67622014000400004							WOS:000343605400004

Contrasting recovery of shallow and deep water seagrass communities following climate associated losses in tropical north Queensland, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Tropical seagrass decline and recovery from severe storm impacts was assessed via quarterly measurements of seagrass biomass, species composition and experimental investigations of recovery in north Queensland. Shallow and deep seagrass meadows suffered major declines. Significant recovery in the two years following loss only occurred at deeper sites. Halophila spp. in deep water areas had a high capacity for recovery through the availability of seed banks. In contrast, the shallow species did not recover quickly from experimental disturbance, had poor seed reserves and relied on asexual propagation. The potential for shallow species to recover rapidly from widespread losses was limited as seed banks were limited or non-existent. Understanding inter- and intra-specific differences in seagrass recovery and how this interacts with location is critical to predict the consequences of climate events to tropical seagrasses. This is especially important as more frequent severe storms are predicted as a consequence of climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nichols, TC				Nichols, Theodore C.			Integrated Damage Management Reduces Grazing of Wild Rice by Resident Canada Geese in New Jersey	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Tidal freshwater marshes of the Maurice River, New Jersey, USA, have been long renowned for robust stands of wild rice (Zizania aquatica). During the 1990s, these marshes experienced an apparent decline in wild rice. During 2000-2002, I used paired fenced exclosures and open control plots to measure herbivory by the Atlantic Flyway Resident Population of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on wild rice and response of rice to an integrated damage management program (IDMP). The IDMP consisted of rendering goose nests unhatchable, shooting, and culling molting geese. The IDMP reduced the number of goslings by 60% during the first year and essentially eliminated recruitment during the second year. Prior to the IDMP, grazing by geese reduced the density of rice by 78% and the height of plants surviving grazing by 17%. With implementation of an IDMP, rice density between exclosures and control plots did not differ. Wetland managers should consider the grazing impacts that resident population Canada geese can incur on native plant communities and develop a plan for mitigating that damage.

Conventional repair techniques include acquiring additional land, reducing the slope angle, installing drainage improvements, soil nailing and/or providing structural support. All of these methods have technical limitations and most cause considerable environmental disturbance. However, new stabilisation options that are more effective and economical than traditional approaches are becoming available, one of which is electrokinetic geosynthetic treatment of failing or failed slopes. The benefits of electrokinetic geosynthetic treatment in terms of engineering sustainability include reduced cost, reduced 'carbon dioxide footprint', fewer heavy goods vehicle movements, zero waste removal, minimal material import, reduced noise and vibrations, improved air quality, preservation of the seed bank and soil environment, minimal vegetation clearance with almost all trees being retained, no visual impacts, no disruption to passing motorists and less damage to root protection areas. Protection of the habitat is also beneficial to nesting birds, amphibians, dormice and reptiles. The paper provides a brief description of the electrokinetic geosynthetic treatment method and illustrates the engineering sustainability with two case histories.																	1478-4629	1751-7680				JUN	2014	167	3					95	107		10.1680/ensu.13.00015							WOS:000343385800002

Natural Plant Establishment along an Urban Stream, Onondaga Creek, New York	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Urbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances.																	1092-6194	1938-5307				JUN	2014	21	2					303	322		10.1656/045.021.0211							WOS:000342488100011

When natural predation and hunting levels are too low to control deer populations, a resource-driven negative feedback is expected. Such a feedback assumes that the remaining resources do not match the energy requirements of a current herbivore population, thereby limiting herbivore abundance. Here we take advantage of a well-documented, long-term study of abundant predator-free populations of black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada) to assess the ability of a heavily browsed forest habitat to sustain abundant deer populations. For two deer populations, we: 1) compared the energy provided by various resource pools to the energy required by deer; and 2) identified what components of the environment contributed most to support them. Qualitatively, our results are robust to the many assumptions and uncertainties and identify the resources currently available that allow these abundant deer populations to meet their energy needs despite the apparent paucity in resources. Resources are provided by a flux of hardly visible plant tissue produced by perennial species highly tolerant of herbivory and able to survive via underground structures (e. g. rhizomes), and by subsidies provided by canopy trees or by plants in refuges (i.e. litterfall and seed bank). We discuss the possibility of a resource-driven feedback that may ultimately occur in the long term as a result of changes in recruitment, productivity and fertility of plants. The possible lack of resource-driven feedback in the short or medium term should be considered by managers when assessing the need for active deer population control in situations without carnivores or hunting.

Therefore, knowledge of seed reservoirs in the soils of aquatic communities should provide useful tools for conservation and restoration efforts. This study was conducted in the Lerma marshes, one of the last remnants of the vast wetlands that were once in the Mexican Central Plateau. The main objective was to determine the composition and abundance of seed bank and its relationship with established vegetation of the three Lerma marshes. In each marsh, we systematically selected 18 to 40 sampling sites. In each site, the composition of vascular plant vegetation was evaluated in two 10m lines perpendicular to the shore. Every 0.5m, we determined the coverage of species by measuring the intercepted length for each plant or group of plants. At each sampling site where we had evaluated the established vegetation, we collected a sample of the top 10cm of sediment; the soil cores were divided into an upper layer (0-5cm) and a lower layer (5-10cm). These samples were used to evaluate the seed bank by the seedling emergence method. All samples were placed in a greenhouse at 20-25 degrees C and remained flooded for 15 weeks. Forty-nine species were recorded in the vegetation. Chiconahuapan had the richest and most diverse flora and the greatest number of perennial species. A life-forms analysis showed that perennial herbs, especially rooted-emergent hydrophytes, dominated in the three wetlands. Sixty-one species were identified in the total seed bank; Chimaliapan had the most diverse total seed bank, whereas the mean seedling density was higher in Chignahuapan. Only two species of the total seed bank of each marsh had a density greater than 10% of the total, and more than half were uncommon. The upper layer of sediment (0-5cm) contained two times more seeds/m(2) and species per sample than the lower layer (5-10cm), and there was a significant decrease of seed density with depth. The detrended correspondence analysis produced a clear separation between the composition of the seed banks and established vegetation. In general, in each marsh there was less species diversity in the established vegetation than in the seed bank. Dominance by a few species in the seed bank, the presence of opportunistic species, and the low representation of established species in the seed bank suggest wetland degradation and a low probability of regenerating the natural communities from the seed bank. To ensure the permanence of these marshes, their biodiversity, and therefore the environmental services they provide, up to date planning is a must, and efforts to control and monitor hydrology, water quality, and the influence of human activities are suggested.

Arrested recovery in a sandy woodland correlates with a lack of heavy and long seeds in the seed bank	ECOSPHERE												The spontaneous recovery of habitats to pre-disturbance species' assemblages rarely occurs following major disturbances such as land clearing. The mechanisms filtering the recruitment of plant species into post-disturbance habitats are poorly understood. We set out to determine why some species do not return after large scale disturbances. We compared the trajectory of spontaneous recovery of an endangered woodland community in Eastern Australia every 6 months over 3.5 yr using 29 x 1 ha plots and three habitat conditions (cleared, degraded, intact woodlands, n = 348 plant species). We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to ordinate the floristics and we compared changes over time using PERMANOVA and Procrustes rotation. We also compared recruitment for 38 woody species. Seed bank composition was determined from (1) germination trials conducted over 75 weeks and (2) sieve and search retrievals. Seed morphologies (shape, mass, dormancy mechanisms) found in the above-and belowground vegetation were compared. We found large differences in species composition between the cleared habitats and both the degraded and intact habitats due to a lack of native species in the cleared habitats. Initially cleared areas had similar rates of recruitment as degraded and intact habitats but in the last four monitoring visits recruitment in cleared habitats stalled. Overall few woody species recruited into cleared areas. For the seed bank, 23% of species were only found above ground and were not present in the seed bank, including many woody species. The majority of these species have a dormancy mechanism-so we excluded transiency as an explanation for their absence in the seed bank. However, these species were found to have significantly larger and longer seeds than species found below-ground only. Furthermore of the woody species that failed to recruit into habitats, 57% of these were seldom found in the seed bank, even though they were present in the above-ground vegetation, and all but one of these species had seeds in the top 20% of heavy-seeded species. We propose that large-seeded species experience higher levels of predation than smaller-seeded species and this filtering process is skewing the recovery of this endangered ecological community.

Ajmal; Lovett-Doust, Jon			Interaction Between "Safe Sites" and "Safe Sides" for Germination of Neurada procumbens (Neuradaceae) in the Middle East	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												The seed bank of Neurada procumbens, a prostrate annual common in sandy desert habitats, is vulnerable to surface disturbances. Moreover, its seeds are highly heteromorphic, having both spinose and non-spinose sides, which affects both the vertical distribution of seeds and diaspores, and the precise position in which they lie in the soil. Here we explore the ecological implications of two factors, "safe sites" within habitats and seed orientation or "safe sides", on seedling establishment and the seed bank. In three natural populations, the vertical distribution of buried, germinable diaspores decreased with soil depth. Most diaspores occurred at the surface (0-1 cm below the surface), while none were observed below 10 cm. Seedling emergence decreased with depth and reached zero in diaspores below 5 cm. Seedling emergence also proved highly sensitive to the orientation of diaspores in soil. Diaspores lying on their smooth side with the spinose upper side directed upwards reached the highest seedling emergence of 61 %. Root length ranged from 10 to 16 cm, and the root to shoot ratio varied between 22.8 and 30.3 cm, depending on diaspore size. Diaspores near the surface may constitute a more transient component of the seed bank, as few of these remained viable for more than a year. Persistence of Neurada seed banks seems to depend not only on vertical movement of diaspores among habitat "safe sites" but also on different seed position alternatives.				Khan, M.

Spatial and temporal variability in recruitment of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in an oligotrophic lake	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Recruitment from dormant stages in the benthos can provide a critically important inoculum for surface populations of phytoplankton, including bloom-forming cyanobacteria. For example, water-column populations of the large (1-3-mm diameter) colonial cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (Smith) P. Richter can be strongly subsidized by benthic recruitment. Therefore, understanding controls on recruitment is essential to an investigation of the factors controlling Gloeotrichia blooms, which are increasing in low-nutrient lakes across northeastern North America. We quantified surface abundances and recruitment from littoral sediments at multiple near-shore sampling sites in oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, USA, during the summers of 2005-2012 and used this data set-the longest known record of cyanobacterial recruitment-to investigate potential drivers of interannual differences in Gloeotrichia recruitment. We found extensive spatiotemporal variability in recruitment. Recruitment was higher at some sites than others, and within seasons, recruitment into replicate traps at the same site was generally more similar than recruitment at different sites. These data suggest that local factors, such as substrate quality or the size of the seed bank, may be important controls on recruitment. Benthic recruitment probably accounted for <4%, but possibly up to 8%, of pelagic populations, within the range observed in previous studies. Across years, higher seasonal recruitment rates were associated with greater lake mixing during August, including deeper thermoclines, lower Schmidt stability, lower minimum air temperatures, and greater variability in water temperature. Taken together, our data suggest that interannual variation in Gloeotrichia recruitment may be related to regional climatic variability.

Seasonal changes in germination and dormancy of buried seeds of endemic Brazilian Eriocaulaceae	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seeds can synchronize their germination and dormancy cycles to regular seasonal environmental changes. The present work sought to evaluate the in-situ longevity of the buried seeds of two species of Syngonanthus and two species of Comanthera (Eriocaulaceae) in the region of natural occurrence (Serra do Cipo Range, south-eastern Brazil), and to relate their germination responses to seasonal climatic changes. Samples were exhumed bimonthly and germination was tested under a 12-h photoperiod (30 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) at optimal germination temperature. The seeds of Comanthera showed high deterioration after the first year of burial, especially C. elegans, which reflects their incapacity to form viable soil seed banks. The buried seeds of C. bisulcata, S. anthemidiflorus and S. verticillatus acquired secondary dormancy during the rainy season (spring/summer, higher temperatures) which was alleviated during the subsequent dry season (autumn/ winter, lower temperatures). It is concluded that C. bisulcata, S. anthemidiflorus, and S. verticillatus formseed banks of the persistent type and demonstrate consecutive cycles of germination/dormancy, accompanying annual seasonal changes for at least 2 years.

J	Rahman, A; James, T; Trolove, M				Rahman, Anis; James, Trevor; Trolove, Michael			Characteristics and control of dicamba-resistant common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album)	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The expansion of atrazine-resistant Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters) since the 1980s has forced New Zealand's maize-growers to use an additional postemergence herbicide application. The frequent use of dicamba for this has selected for a common lambsquarters population with reduced sensitivity to dicamba. Initial greenhouse experiments with seeds that had been collected from the plants that survived field applications of dicamba showed that these plants could tolerate 1.2kgha-1, fourfold the recommended rate. These dicamba-resistant plants were morphologically distinct from the susceptible population. The leaves of the resistant plants were less dentate and a lighter shade of green. The resistant plants were shorter, had a lower biomass and growth rate and flowered 19days earlier than the susceptible plants. When grown together in various density ratios, the average biomass of both the susceptible and the resistant plants increased as the number of susceptible plants decreased in the mixture. The field experiments demonstrated that the resistant population tolerated dicamba at 2.4kgha-1, eightfold the recommended rate. Postemergence applications of bromoxynil, pyridate, nicosulfuron and mesotrione effectively controlled both populations. Nicosulfuron and mesotrione provided long-term residual control, with nicosulfuron being more effective on the grass weeds. High rates of dicamba damaged the maize plants, resulting in an increased weed cover and reduced grain yield. The number of viable common lambsquarters seeds in the soil seed bank at the end of the growing season declined in the treatments in which common lambsquarters was controlled effectively.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				JUN	2014	14	2					88	98		10.1111/wbm.12036							WOS:000337706200002

Environmentally induced transgenerational changes in seed longevity: maternal and genetic influence	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Seed longevity, a fundamental plant trait for ex situ conservation and persistence in the soil of many species, varies across populations and generations that experience different climates. This study investigates the extent to which differences in seed longevity are due to genetic differences and/or modified by adaptive responses to environmental changes. Methods Seeds of two wild populations of Silene vulgaris from alpine (wA) and lowland (wL) locations and seeds originating from their cultivation in a lowland common garden for two generations (cA(1), cL(1), cA(2) and cL(2)) were exposed to controlled ageing at 45 degrees C, 60% relative humidity and regularly sampled for germination and relative mRNA quantification (SvHSP17.4 and SvNRPD12). Key Results The parental plant growth environment affected the longevity of seeds with high plasticity. Seeds of wL were significantly longer lived than those of wA. However, when alpine plants were grown in the common garden, longevity doubled for the first generation of seeds produced (cA(1)). Conversely, longevity was similar in all lowland seed lots and did not increase in the second generation of seeds produced from alpine plants grown in the common garden (cA(2)). Analysis of parental effects on mRNA seed provisioning indicated that the accumulation of gene transcripts involved in tolerance to heat stress was highest in wL, cL(1) and cL(2), followed by cA(1), cA(2) and wA. Conclusions Seed longevity has a genetic basis, but may show strong adaptive responses, which are associated with differential accumulation of mRNA via parental effects. Adaptive adjustments of seed longevity due to transgenerational plasticity may play a fundamental role in the survival and persistence of the species in the face of future environmental challenges. The results suggest that regeneration location may have important implications for the conservation of alpine plants held in seed banks.

J	Kinugasa, T; Oda, S				Kinugasa, Toshihika; Oda, Shozo			Effects of vehicle track formation on soil seed banks in grasslands with different vegetation in the Mongolian steppe	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Dirt road formation caused by the passage of off-road vehicles can lead to intense disturbances in underdeveloped regions. The natural recovery of vegetation after the abandonment of dirt roads depends largely on the soil seed banks, although the amount of damage to the seed bank composition, which determines the natural revegetation potential caused by dirt road formation, is unclear. We investigated the vertical distributions of seed banks in two grasslands in the Mongolian steppe with different above-ground vegetation, i.e., annual- and perennial-dominated grasslands, and we evaluated the effects of dirt road formation. The soil seed banks mostly comprised annual species of Chenopodium, irrespective of the above-ground vegetation, and the soil seed banks were larger in the annual grassland than in the perennial grassland. However, vehicle track formation removed the upper soil layers, which contained an abundance of buried seeds; therefore, the seed banks were small below the tracks, and almost the same size in the two grasslands. Our results suggest that natural revegetation through seedling emergence depends largely on annuals in the Mongolian steppe. Vehicle track formation damages seed banks severely; thus, artificial manipulations such as seeding or transplanting are required to facilitate the rapid revegetation of abandoned roads, irrespective of the above-ground vegetation.

Considering population demography within-population cohorts, the greatest number of individuals was recruited in the mid-season cohort that received intermediate amount of rainfall compared to the early-season and the late-season population cohorts. Individuals of A. hierochuntica belonging to the same population cohort showed that spatial pattern varied between clumped and random distribution, with minimum separation distance not exceeding 10 cm. The spatial pattern within-population cohorts showed decreased overdispersion from the early-season toward the late-season individuals. Considering the spatial relationships between the within-population cohorts, the spatial relationships between early-season and mid-season, and mid-season and late-season cohorts varied between segregation and random distributions. The gene diversity and the number of recruited individuals were found to be not correlated with the amount of rainfall in the study regions. Nei's genetic identity and distance varied among sites and population cohort groups. The overall genetic diversity was lower in the mid-season cohort group than in the early- and late-season cohorts. The variations of genetic characters and spatial patterns among and within-population cohorts of A. hierochuntica are regulated by recruitment of individuals from persistent seed output produced from overlapping generations.

(annual bluegrass) is the only non-native flowering plant species that has successfully established a breeding population in the maritime Antarctic and has been shown to maintain a soil seed bank. The characteristic of the spatial structure of the Antarctic population of this species is the formation of distinct dense clumps-tussocks. In the temperate zone the species is only loosely tufted. We focused on the characteristics of seed deposition associated with the tussocks and some aspects of the spatial heterogeneity of the soil seed bank of P. annua in the Antarctic. We wanted to assess the microspatial structure of the soil seed bank of annual bluegrass at Arctowski Station. Therefore we compared the number of seeds deposited underneath and in the vicinity of P. annua clumps. Our results indicate that P. annua in the Antarctic maintains a soil seed bank comparable to species typical for the polar tundra. The microspatial structure of P. annua soil seed bank in the Antarctic is highly associated with the presence of tussocks. Seeds are deposited underneath the tussock rather than in the vicinity of the clump. Our results also indicate that seeds are able to survive the Antarctic winter and readily germinate under optimal conditions.

The aims of this study are to identify the regeneration traits linked to the response to disturbance of tree species of a montane cloud forest in order to define regeneration types and to explore whether disturbance intensity acts to select specific regeneration types that can colonize disturbed plots. A theoretical model was developed and evaluated using structural equation modeling to link two latent variables: regeneration type and vulnerability to disturbance. We studied two plots that were subjected to different intensities of disturbance and one plot of mature forest. Shade tolerance, dispersal mode, and the capacity to form a seed bank were the traits that determine regeneration type. There was a trend for re-sprouting capacity to be associated with the regeneration types dominant in disturbed plots. Regeneration types were differentially distributed among the sites. There was evidence that disturbance intensity has a filtering effect on the colonization of disturbed plots. Species vulnerability to disturbance depends on specific combinations of regeneration traits. Structural equation modeling is useful for exploring plant response to disturbance using key parameters linked to plant persistence.

It is an exceptionally species-rich habitat and a local biodiversity hotspot. However, it has been strongly fragmented due to land use intensification during the last centuries. We analysed the impact of fragmentation on the genetic variation of a typical renosterveld species, the annual herb Nemesia barbata. For our investigation we selected populations of the species in 20 renosterveld fragments of different sizes in the Cape lowlands and determined genetic variation within and between populations using amplified fragment polymorphsims (AFLPs). We expected genetic pauperisation within small and isolated fragments and a lack of gene flow between these fragments. We observed considerable genetic variation within but only a low level of variation between populations. Genetic variation within populations was not correlated with the size of the fragment or the distance to the nearest adjacent fragment. However, genetic variation between populations was positively correlated with geographic distance between fragments, indicating historical and/or actual gene flow. Based upon our results, we conclude that habitat fragmentation does not yet influence the genetic variation of N. barbata. Historical and possibly actual gene flow, combined with buffering effects of the soil seed bank, appear to have minimized the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation on genetic variation of this renosterveld species.

This framework has been supported and rejected by empirical data, and thus, conclusive evidence is lacking. We expanded the seed size-persistence framework to include seed-coat thickness, a defence trait previously correlated with seed survival in soil. To do this, we used Abutilon theophrasti accessions with varied evolutionary histories and we quantified associations among seed traits including morphology, size, coat thickness, dormancy (percentage of viable seeds that fail to germinate under optimum conditions) and seed-bank persistence (percentage of viable seeds remaining after 1 year of burial). Statistical models were developed to test the hypothesis that combined measurements of seed-coat thickness and seed size better explain variability in seed-bank persistence than seed-size data alone. Results indicated that measurements of seed size (length, width, mass) were negatively correlated with coat: width ratio (coat thickness relative to seed width) and coat: mass ratio (coat thickness relative to seed mass). Accessions characterized by smaller seeds with proportionally thicker seed coats were more dormant and more persistent in soil than accessions characterized by larger seeds with proportionally thinner seed coats. Seed-coat thickness data improved the explanatory power of logistic regression models for seed-size effects on both seed-bank persistence and dormancy. These results indicate that supplementing seed-size data with seed-defence data may clarify previously reported contradictory results regarding trade-offs between seed size and seed-bank persistence.

The purpose was to assess the species composition, diversity and the regeneration status of woody plants. A total of 27 plots of 20 m x 20 m were sampled along the line transects laid down the altitudinal gradient from the edge of the forest encompassing the lake to the edge of the lake in eight aspects. In each plot, woody species were counted and. the diameter at breast height and the height of trees and shrubs were measured. A total of 50 woody species belonging to 31 families were found, of which 17 (34%) were trees, 7 (14%) trees or shrubs, 23 (46%) shrubs and 3 (6%) lianas. The overall Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness indices of woody species were 2.74 and 0.7, respectively. Clausena anisata had the highest relative density (23.5%). Rapanea rhododendroides the highest relative frequency (6.5%) and Prunus africana the highest relative dominance (45%) and importance value index (IVI, 51.6). The total basal area and density of woody plants were 22.3 m(2).ha(-1) and 2,202 individuals.ha(-1), respectively. The population structure showed variations among woody plants and revealed varied regeneration patterns of different species. The importance value index and population structure revealed that some species are threatened and need prioritization for conservation measures. The results suggest that remnant forest patches in the highlands of northern Ethiopia host several woody plant species that are almost disappearing in other areas due to deforestation.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				JUN	2014	25	2					329	336		10.1007/s11676-013-0420-3							WOS:000335279100011

Fate of recruiting populations of two rare fire-dependent Geranium species after forest fire	PLANT ECOLOGY												Fire ephemerals are few in the boreal forest despite a long history of recurrent fires, which suggests such a life-history pose problems here. We analysed the fate of recruiting populations of two rare and fire-dependent annual Geranium species at burnt forest sites in South-eastern Sweden, to extract vital information on their life-history. Seedlings emerged from the soil seed bank only in the year of fire but spread over several weeks. At sites that burnt early in the season, some seedlings exhibited a summer-annual life-cycle, but those were less successful than plants at the same sites that delayed reproduction until the following year (winter-annuals). Herbivory was frequent in the fire year and until the following spring, but later almost absent, and thus hit seed production in summer-annuals badly. Winter mortality was highly variable for rosette-stage winter-annuals, with some populations nearly obliterated. Reproductive success varied greatly between populations mainly due to pre-reproductive mortality, with a return of 0.2-395 (average 79) seeds per seedling. The vast majority of seeds (92-100 %) were produced by the primary generation, emerging from the seed bank. Out of this first seed crop, 0.2-2.5 % germinated within the study period, resulting in secondary generations. Plants in these later generations were small and produced few seeds, showing that the opportunity for high reproductive success is essentially restricted to one year only. This makes populations highly vulnerable to local near-complete reproductive failure due to winter mortality and herbivory and may be the ultimate reason why strict fire ephemerals are so few in northern forests.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				JUN	2014	215	6					613	624		10.1007/s11258-014-0327-x							WOS:000335316200003

Management of roadside populations of invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia by mowing	WEED RESEARCH												Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) is a highly allergenic alien weed in Europe, which spreads rapidly along roadsides. Road verges are subject to frequent mowing, which further increases the spreading of the plants' seeds. Ambrosia artemisiifolia reacts to cutting by producing new shoots, which are able to develop flowers and ultimately new seeds. An effective mowing regime that would decrease the production of seeds and their dispersal is desirable to control the spread of the plant, but an appropriate way of mowing has yet to be found. In this study, we explored how the reproductive traits of A.artemisiifolia plants in seven spontaneous roadside populations reacted to the application of different mowing regimes over 3years. The mowing regimes that were applied differed in the timing and frequency of cuttings. We found that the cutting regime, if appropriately timed, can strongly influence the production of male inflorescences (i.e. allergenic pollen), of female flowers (i.e. seeds) and had an impact on the phenological development of the plant. Based on our findings, we suggest that the optimal management of the plant along roadsides must be adjusted to its phenological development. The most effective mowing method of control consists of a first cut shortly before male flowering, to limit the quantities of released pollen, followed by subsequent cuts before the onset of new flowers on the resprouting lateral shoots.

Soil seed bank community structure of pastures and hayfields on an organic farm	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Understanding the composition of seed banks in pasture soils would help farmers anticipate and manage for weed problems. We characterized the soil seed bank in eight pastures and hayfields [two alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and two predominantly grass hayfields; two recently established and two permanent pastures] within an organic dairy farm in southeastern New Hampshire. Seed banks were sampled in the upper 5 cm of soil in each field at a point scale in 2007 and 2010. In 2010, the seed bank was characterized at the field scale by taking soil samples on six 52-m transects in each field. Seed banks sampled at the field scale in 2010 contained 66 plant species. The total number of seeds in the seed bank ranged from 1560 m(-2) in grass hayfields in autumn to more than 20 000 m(-2) in alfalfa hayfields in summer. Annual forbs dominated the seed bank of alfalfa fields and recently established pastures, whereas perennial graminoids dominated in one grass hayfield and the permanent pastures. These results suggest that management history affects soil seed bank composition and abundance, and these effects should be considered before implementing management practices that could stimulate recruitment from the seed bank.

SOIL SEED BANK CHARACTERISTICS BENEATH AN AGE SEQUENCE OF CARAGANA MICROPHYLLA SHRUBS IN THE HORQIN SANDY LAND REGION OF NORTHEASTERN CHINA	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												To understand how shrub cover affects the spatiotemporal patterns of the soil seed bank and to assess the role of vegetation in the restoration of desertified land in a semi-arid region of China, we investigated the species composition and seed density of the soil seed bank under and outside the canopies over two seasons for an age sequence of Caragana microphylla shrubs in the Horqin Sandy Land region, Inner Mongolia. The results showed that a total of 24 plant species seeds were present in the soil seed bank, of which 20 were annuals or biennials. The seed densities in the soil seed bank were in the range of 830-13882 center dot 5 seeds m-2 at 10cm depth. Species richness in the soil seed bank did not increase as the shrubs aged, whereas the seed densities increased significantly. Five annual species: Setaria viridis, Eragrostis pilosa, Chenopodium acuminatum, Chenopodium glaucum and Corispermum acuminatum, contributed above 90 per cent of the seeds to the soil seed bank. On the basis of seed characteristics and seed reduction amount during the growing season, we concluded that it represents a mixture of persistent and transient seeds in different proportions. More seeds accumulated under the canopies than outside the mature shrub cover, but no significant difference was found the younger cover. These results suggest that shrub size and age had an important role in augmenting seed abundance of the soil seed bank but not the species richness. We confirmed the important effects of shrub cover on seed accumulation and vegetation recovery, especially the value of more mature age vegetation for countering land degradation.

Simulated Genetically Modified Triticale: Adventitious Presence from Volunteers in Four Cropping Systems	CROP SCIENCE												Harvesting volunteer genetically modified (GM) crops is a likely source of adventitious presence (AP) that could preclude coexistence with conventional crops. Spring triticale (xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus) is proposed as a biofuel and, with genetic modifications, as a platform crop for bioindustrial products. We investigated seed production of simulated volunteer triticale in four western Canadian cropping systems: glyphosate-resistant (GR) canola (Brassica napus L.); glufosinate-resistant (GLUR) canola; field pea (Pisum sativum L.); and imidazolinone-resistant (IR) wheat, in 2006 and 2007 at two locations, and quantified crop yield losses, triticale seed viability, and AP of triticale in harvested crops. Fecundity of volunteers in the absence of herbicides varied between locations, from 3506 to 9280 seeds m(-2), and with crop: GLUR canola = GR canola < IR spring wheat < field pea. Herbicides applied preseeding (PRE) reduced triticale densities between 30 and 80%, and survivors produced between 178 and 2052 seeds m(-2). Herbicides applied in-crop (POST) were more effective and reduced triticale densities between 8 and > 99% and fecundity between < 1 and 1231 seeds m(-2). The combination of PRE and POST applications reduced fecundity below that of PRE or POST alone in 3 of 16 crop years. The AP was > 1% of the crop (weight/weight) in 3 of 13 crop years when both PRE and POST herbicides were applied. Volunteer triticale is a probable source of AP in subsequent crops that may reduce acceptability in some GM sensitive markets.																	0011-183X	1435-0653				MAY-JUN	2014	54	3					1087	1096		10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0529							WOS:000336747200025

Interim Responses of Floodplain Wetland Vegetation to Phase I of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project: Comparisons of Vegetation Maps from Five Periods in the River's History	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Phase I of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project (KRRP) reestablished intermittent inundation of the river's floodplain by backfilling 12km of the C-38 flood control canal in 2001. We compared floodplain vegetation maps based on 2003 and 2008 aerial imagery (2 and 7years following completion of Phase I, respectively) to vegetation maps from 1954 (pre-channelization), 1974 (3years after channelization), and 1996 (25years after channelization) to evaluate broad-scale vegetation responses to Phase I restoration. Results indicate that the extent of wetland plant communities expanded rapidly, more than doubling in area within 2years after completion of Phase I, and that by 2008 wetlands had nearly recovered to pre-channelization levels. However, full reestablishment of the pre-channelization wetland mosaic has not yet occurred. Prior to channelization, much of the floodplain was dominated by a broadleaf marsh (BLM) community associated with extended, deep annual flooding, while shorter-hydroperiod communities dominated the floodplain in 2003 and 2008. Prior to restoration construction, the reestablishment of BLM was predicted to be slow because suitable hydrology is dependent on project components that will not be in place until all restoration components are completed (projected for 2019). Hydrologic data indicate that the duration and variability of floodplain inundation have not yet achieved restoration targets over the entire Phase I study area. Other factors affecting vegetation responses are likely involved, including the age and viability of soil seed banks, the rarity of relict propagule sources following the channelized period, and competition from an invasive wetland shrub species.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				MAY	2014	22	3					397	408		10.1111/rec.12074							WOS:000336842500018

Field evidence of smoke-stimulated seedling emergence and establishment in Mediterranean Basin flora	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question In many plant species from fire-prone ecosystems germination is promoted by smoke. Mediterranean Basin (MB) flora is no exception. However, most information regarding germination response to smoke in the MB comes from a few experiments performed in laboratory conditions. This approach does not consider factors that occur in the field, such as species interactions, density-dependent processes or the fact that seeds spent time in the soil seed bank. In addition, species selection has been biased (e.g. there is a lack of information about annual species). Hence the importance of smoke relative to other fire cues is not clear, and we have a biased knowledge of post-fire community assembly in the MB. In this framework, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) smoke enhances seedling emergence and establishment from the soil seed bank of MB species, and (2) annual species are an important component of this smoke-stimulated flora. Location Mediterranean fire-prone shrublands in eastern Spain. Western Mediterranean Basin. Methods We performed a field experiment in which we applied a liquid smoke treatment and tracked seedling emergence and seedling establishment during 1yr. Differences between smoke and control subplots with respect to seedling emergence and seedling establishment were analysed at different scales: community, growth form (annual or perennial), family and species level. Results At the community level, smoke played a clear role in seedling recruitment, increasing seedling emergence and seedling establishment. In addition, for most plots, families and species, establishment was higher in smoke subplots compared to the control. Annual species establishment was clearly stimulated by smoke but no effect was detected for perennials. Conclusions Smoke derived from wildfires has a key effect on plant recruitment and hence on community assembly in the MB vegetation.

J	Auffret, AG; Plue, J				Auffret, Alistair G.; Plue, Jan			Scale-dependent diversity effects of seed dispersal by a wild herbivore in fragmented grasslands	OECOLOGIA												Dispersal limitation between habitat fragments is a known driver of landscape-scale biodiversity loss. In Europe, agricultural intensification during the twentieth century resulted in losses of both grassland habitat and traditional grassland seed dispersal vectors such as livestock. During the same period, populations of large wild herbivores have increased in the landscape. Usually studied in woodland ecosystems, these animals are found to disperse seeds from grasslands and other open habitats. We studied endozoochorous seed dispersal by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in fragmented grasslands and grassland remnants, comparing dispersed subcommunities of plant species to those in the established vegetation and the seed bank. A total of 652 seedlings of 67 species emerged from 219 samples of roe deer dung. This included many grassland species, and several local grassland specialists. Dispersal had potentially different effects on diversity at different spatial scales. Almost all sites received seeds of species not observed in the vegetation or seed bank at that site, suggesting that local diversity might not be dispersal limited. This pattern was less evident at the landscape scale, where fewer new species were introduced. Nonetheless, long-distance dispersal by large wild herbivores might still provide connectivity between fragmented habitats within a landscape in the areas in which they are active. Finally, as only a subset of the available species were found to disperse in space as well as time, the danger of future biodiversity loss might still exist in many isolated grassland habitats.

Effects of fire regime shift in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems: changes in soil seed bank composition among functional types	PLANT ECOLOGY												We studied the soil seed bank in a possible scenario of fire regime shift and asked: (1) Does high fire frequency impact the density of seeds stored, species richness and evenness? (2) Overall, does high fire frequency produce changes in the presence-absence and abundance of species? The study was implemented in a Mediterranean Basin ecosystem in plots with increasing fire frequency (unburned, burned once and burned twice in the last 66 years). The number of seeds increased with fire frequency for all life forms (shrub, scrub, perennial forb, annual forb and perennial graminoid). Species richness of annual forbs also increased. Evenness of shrubs diminished because the number of seeds in all the species decreased, except C. albidus, which increased. Overall, differences in the abundance of species were found, mainly by depleting shrubs and increasing forbs. There were no differences in the presence-absence data. In conclusion, high fire frequencies act as a filtering factor for species of a larger size and advanced maturity age. In contrast, life forms of small size and rapid onset of reproductive maturity can be enhanced. This community conversion from woody to herbaceous soil seed banks is fundamental to identify vegetation changes in future regimes of high fire frequency.

Alien grass disrupts reproduction and post-settlement recruitment of co-occurring native vegetation: a mechanism for diversity decline in invaded forest?	PLANT ECOLOGY												Invasive plants significantly threaten native plant biodiversity, yet the mechanisms by which they drive species losses and maintain their own dominance are poorly known. We examined the effects of alien grass invasion (Stenotaphrum secundatum) on (1) abundance and frequency of occurrence, (2) reproductive effort (flowering) and output (fruit production) and (3) soil seed banks for three focal native plants that are characteristic of endangered coastal forest of south-eastern Australia. First, we sampled and compared the foliage cover abundance and frequency (proportion of sites occupied) of the focal natives across invaded and non-invaded (reference) sites (n = 20). We then intensively sampled reproductive effort and output (range of 5-9 sites per species), and density of propagules within the soil (using a standard glasshouse 'emergence' method; n = 26) for each species. Invasion was associated with reduced population sizes of all species within the standing vegetation but did not affect population frequency (i.e. proportion of sites where each species was present). Reproductive effort and output were about 75 % lower at invaded than native sites for all species. However, invasion had no effect on propagule densities of the focal natives within the seed bank, despite the substantial reduction in their reproduction. This indicates that the ultimate driver of population declines across invaded landscapes is post-settlement recruitment limitation from the seed bank (e.g. low rates of germination and seedling survival) rather than a reduction in the arrival and storage of propagules at invaded sites. Removal of Stenotaphrum alone might thus be sufficient to stimulate the recovery of native populations from the seed bank.

J	Prider, J; Williams, A				Prider, Jane; Williams, Anna			Using dazomet to reduce broomrape seed banks in soils with low moisture content	CROP PROTECTION												Dazomet (Basamie(R)) is a dry powder formulation that releases the toxic gas methyl isothiocyanate for the control of soil borne pests and weed seeds when applied to moist soils. We evaluated its efficacy for destroying Phelipanche mutelii (branched broomrape) seed banks. Dazomet is typically used where effectiveness can be improved with the addition of water but we examined its performance in soils with low moisture content in container experiments and field trials. In containers, less than 10% of P. mutelii seed remained viable 30 days after dazomet applications of 112.8-338.4 kg ha(-1) at soil moisture content from 0.05 to 0.15 g g(-1). Seeds buried at a depth of 5 cm needed to be in contact with the product for longer than one week before viability was affected. An initial field trial did not detect a decline in seed viability 7 days after dazomet application. Viability assessments in a second field trial were made 30 days after dazomet application with an airseeder at a rate of 338.4 kg ha(-1). Less than 10% of P. mutelii seeds at a depth of 5 cm survived and dazomet was as effective as two other soil fumigants, methyl bromide and a methyl iodide/chloropicrin mixture. The release of methyl isothiocyanate is reduced in soils in containers with low soil moisture content but occurs over a long time period. Methyl isothiocyanate dissipated more rapidly in soils in containers with higher soil moisture content and at lower dazomet application rates. A higher application rate is required in the field to ensure the dazomet powder is evenly distributed through the soil profile and there is adequate methyl isothiocyanate resident in the top soil layer to achieve seed kill. This has consequences for plant back times in fumigated land following dazomet application. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seed dispersal in time can counteract the effect of gene flow between natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Plants may escape unfavorable environments by dispersing to new sites, or by remaining in an ungerminated state at a given site until environmental conditions become favorable. There is limited evidence regarding the occurrence, interplay and relative importance of dispersal processes in time and space in plant populations. Thirty-six natural populations of the annual ruderal species Arabidopsis thaliana were monitored over five consecutive years, sampling both seed bank and above-ground cohorts. We show that immigration rates are considerably higher than previously inferred, averaging 1.7% per populationyr(-1). On the other hand, almost one-third of the individuals in a given above-ground cohort result from seeds shed 2 or 3yr back in time in 10 of the studied populations. Populations that disappeared one year were recolonized by regeneration from the seed bank the subsequent year. Thus, dispersal in both time and space is an important contributor to the structuring of genetic variability in natural populations of A.thaliana, where a high dispersal rate in time may partly counteract the homogenizing effects of spatial seed and pollen dispersal.

We studied the seed-bank dynamics of weedy rice for three consecutive years and analyzed the relationship between seed-bank density and population density in order to predict future weedy rice infestations of direct-seeded rice at six sites along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, China. RESULTS The seed-bank density of weedy rice in all six sites displayed an increasing trend with seasonal fluctuations. Weedy rice seeds found in the 0-10 cm soil layer contributed most to seedling emergence. An exponential curve expressed the relationship between cultivated rice yield loss and adult weedy rice density. Based on data collected during the weedy rice life-cycle, a semi-empirical mathematic model was developed that fits well with the experimental data in a way that could be used to predict seed-bank dynamics. CONCLUSIONS By integrating the semi-empirical model and the exponential curve, weedy rice infestation levels and crop losses can be predicted based on the seed-bank dynamics so that a practical control can be adopted before rice planting.

Alternating temperature requirements in Leucospermum R.Br. seed germination and ecological correlates in fynbos	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The effect of germination incubation regimes, which were chosen on the basis of temperature patterns found within the fynbos (Mediterranean fire-prone shrubland-type) habitat in the Cape Floristic Region during the autumn germinative period, was tested on seeds of 6 Leucospermum species over 5 taxonomic sections (L. cordifolium, L. cuneiforme, L. erubescens, L. glabrum, L. reflexum, L. vestitum). Seeds of each specieswere scarified, soaked in water and incubated at 15 combinations of diurnal low(16 h) and high (8 h) temperatures. The results indicated that Leucospermum seeds generally require alternating temperatures for germination. Regression analysis of germination percentage responses were used to estimate provisional optimum low [T-O(LOW)] and optimum high [T-O(HIGH)] temperature requirements for individual species. These requirements differed markedly among species, and across species they averaged 9.9 and 21.2 degrees C, respectively. Individual requirements correlated positively with mean late autumn air temperatures obtained from weather stations near the natural habitats of species. We conclude that a diurnal alternating temperature requirement is a character syndrome in Leucospermum in which the T-O(LOW) and T-O(HIGH) components are narrowly adaptive, independent and genetically stable characters relating to the known ecophysiological roles of low and high temperature requirements (Brits, Cutting, Brown and Van Staden, 1995). Ecological and adaptive roles of these requirements are compared with those in some persistent small-seeded soil-stored seed banks. (c) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Neidich-Ryder, C; Kennelly, P				Neidich-Ryder, Carole; Kennelly, Patrick			Mapping prairie remnants on the Hempstead Plains, Long Island, New York	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Hempstead Plains, located in Nassau County, New York, contains remnants of the only naturally occurring prairie east of the Appalachian Mountains. It originally encompassed approximately 12,500 ha. Although the area receives higher amounts of rainfall for a typical tall-grass prairie ecosystem, approximately 114 cm of precipitation per year, its well-drained, dark-colored soil sited above glacial out-wash, available natural seed bank, and history of fires enabled development of a tall-grass prairie. This study identified prairie remnants within the historical extent of the Hempstead Plains delineated by the 1928 soil survey from the United States Department of Agriculture. Image analysis of infrared color 8-bit orthophotographs was used for an unsupervised classification on a 156-ha primary study area containing a known prairie remnant, centered on the Red Golf Course at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow. The resulting 16 classes were combined into six more general classes before undergoing an error assessment based on field and orthoimagery ground-truthing of 1,000 random points. As confirmed by site visits, analysis was generally able to distinguish prairie grass from non-native grasses using remote sensing, as native warm-season prairie grasses are dormant from late fall to early spring. Overall accuracy for the six classes was 89 %. Accuracy of the warm-season grass class was 81 % for producer's accuracy and 83 % for user's accuracy. This study identified additional sites containing warm-season grasses and potential prairie remnants in Nassau County.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2014	186	5					3011	3022		10.1007/s10661-013-3597-1							WOS:000333801200029	24415063

( Apiaceae)	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Ancient plant species surviving in isolated small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction, therefore understanding their population dynamics is necessary for conservation. The iteroparous perennial relic endemic Ferula sadleriana Ledeb. (Apiaceae) is restricted to seven distant localities in the Carpathian Basin, where it inhabits rocky hills. We monitored the species' largest population on the Pilis Hill, Hungary, over 14-19 years (depending on trait) between 1979 and 2010, and relationships were sought between climatic properties and population attributes. The population of 4000 +/- 1509 emergent individuals underwent large interannual fluctuations, with the vegetative stage displaying sevenfold and the reproductive stage twenty-eight-fold differences. Spring and early summer precipitation had a marked influence on abundances and seed set. Alternating years of high and low counts of reproductive plants suggest costs of reproduction that most probably incur prolonged dormancy and retrogression to the vegetative stage. Seed set was positively influenced by number of reproductive plants over years and by plant size within a year. Ungulates nullify yearly reproductive output by grazing on reproductive individuals. This is particularly intense in dry summers, when reproductive output is already low. The strong precipitation response of abundance, absence of clonal propagation and soil seed bank, and geographical isolation of the populations place F.sadleriana at considerable risk under an increasingly variable and extreme climate. Management should seek to maintain the species' original habitat mosaic (potentially compensating for climate variation), minimize grazing damage and anthropogenic disturbance, and establish ex situ conservation programs to provide propagules for eventual reintroduction.

J	Franzese, J; Ghermandi, L				Franzese, Jorgelina; Ghermandi, Luciana			Seed longevity and fire: post- germination responses of Rumex acetosella L. in northwest Patagonian grasslands ( Argentina)	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												The cosmopolitan herb Rumex acetosella forms persistent soil seed banks and increases in cover after fire. We investigated how the interaction between seed age and fire affects seedling growth by exposing different-aged seeds to heat, smoke, charcoal, and ash treatments. We measured growth of germinated seedlings that were transplanted and allowed to grow for 65days in a greenhouse. Seedlings from seeds >8years old did not reach an appropriate radicle length for transplantation. Seedling growth decreased with increasing temperature of the heat treatment. As seed age increased, growth decreased with smoke and charcoal, and increased with ash treatment. Height was negatively correlated with seed age. Our results suggest that fire and seed age could affect demographic responses of R.acetosella seedling populations. Post-fire recruitment could be partially favored by the positive effect of nutrient input from ash on seedling growth. High fire intensities, however, would be detrimental to seedling vigor.																	0913-557X	1442-1984				MAY	2014	29	2					202	206		10.1111/1442-1984.12012							WOS:000333705000010

A continental-scale study of seed lifespan in experimental storage examining seed, plant, and environmental traits associated with longevity	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Management of seed banks conserving the biodiversity of phylogenetically diverse species requires insight into seed longevity. This study determined the seed longevity of 172 species sourced from across the mega-diverse flora of the Australia continent. Seeds were aged via a controlled ageing experiment through storage at 45 A degrees C and 60 % RH, or 60 A degrees C and 60 % RH, and regularly tested for germination. Relative seed longevity between species was determined by comparing the time to 50 % viability loss (p (50)), calculated via probit analysis of seed survival curves. Seed, plant, and environmental traits were examined for associations with longevity. The p (50) values varied between species from 3.0 to 588.6 days. Serotinous species, and woody trees and shrubs, had significantly longer-lived seeds than geosporous species, and species of herbaceous habit. Seeds that possess physical dormancy, and seeds with large embryos with little endosperm, were also long-lived. There was a weak, but significant, positive correlation between seed mass and longevity. Seeds sourced from regions of higher mean annual temperature and rainfall were significantly longer-lived than seeds from cooler and drier regions, although both environmental factors were weakly associated with longevity. Compared with species from other regions of the world, prolonged longevity is a feature of many Australian species. Nevertheless, seed life-spans vary substantially between species and close consideration of seed traits along with biotic and abiotic components of the plants and their environment can assist to differentiate between potentially long- and short-lived seeds.

J	Fennell, M; Gallagher, T; Vintro, LL; Osborne, B				Fennell, Mark; Gallagher, Tommy; Vintro, Luis Leon; Osborne, Bruce			Using soil seed banks to assess temporal patterns of genetic variation in invasive plant populations	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Most research on the genetics of invasive plant species has focused on analyzing spatial differences among existing populations. Using a long-established Gunnera tinctoria population from Ireland, we evaluated the potential of using plants derived from seeds associated with different soil layers to track genetic variation through time. This species and site were chosen because (1) G.tinctoria produces a large and persistent seed bank; (2) it has been present in this locality, Sraheens, for similar to 90years; (3) the soil is largely undisturbed; and (4) the soil's age can be reliably determined radiometrically at different depths. Amplified fragment length polymorphic markers (AFLPs) were used to assess differences in the genetic structure of 75 individuals sampled from both the standing population and from four soil layers, which spanned 18cm (estimated at similar to 90years based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating). While there are difficulties in interpreting such data, including accounting for the effects of selection, seed loss, and seed migration, a clear pattern of lower total allele counts, percentage polymorphic loci, and genetic diversity was observed in deeper soils. The greatest percentage increase in the measured genetic variables occurred prior to the shift from the lag to the exponential range expansion phases and may be of adaptive significance. These findings highlight that seed banks in areas with long-established invasive populations can contain valuable genetic information relating to invasion processes and as such, should not be overlooked.																	2045-7758					MAY	2014	4	9					1648	1658		10.1002/ece3.1043							WOS:000335267000012	24967082

The spatial distribution of nests of the harvester ant Messor barbarus in dryland cereals	INSECTES SOCIAUX												The harvester ant Messor barbarus can be responsible for substantial losses of weed seeds in arable fields in NE Spain. The spatial distribution of nests can have consequences for biological weed control, because foraging intensities decline with distance from the nest. The probability that seeds will escape harvesting will be lower if nests occur regularly distributed. We here investigated 'large'-scale variability (up to 150 m), caused by habitat heterogeneity, and 'small'-scale spatial variability (up to 12 m), caused by interactions between colonies, in nest distribution in a 50 x 150 m area in a cereal field in NE Spain, in 2009 and 2010. Large-scale variability was present in the data, but could not be explained by elevation, distance to the nearest field edge, or interpreted as simple trends across the area. Small-scale interactions could successfully be described by a multi-type/hard core Strauss process model, indicating territoriality among nests. Exclusion and interaction zones were identified, with radii that were smaller for small than for large colonies, and smaller for 2009 than for 2010. There was close resemblance between the observed and fitted spatial structure up to a radius of 3-4 m. Large-scale spatial variability, but not small-scale interactions, may be responsible for the existence of areas with few or no nests, where weed seeds have a higher probability of escaping the ants and entering the seed bank. Identifying and understanding the factors that influence the large-scale trends is, therefore, essential for optimizing weed control.

Critical transitions in disturbance-driven ecosystems: identifying Windows of Opportunity for recovery	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Vegetation recovery in disturbance-driven ecosystems is difficult to predict. We demonstrate a concept to analyse time series for short-term variability in external forcing that can identify potential events for sudden vegetation recovery in biogeomorphic ecosystems such as saltmarshes, mangroves, dunes or floodplains. Time series of external forcing (i.e. water level and wind speed) were analysed for 'Windows of Opportunity' (WoO), defined as disturbance-free periods of a critical minimal duration directly following potential diaspore dispersal, which allow seedling establishment and can induce a sudden shift to a new persistent vegetation cover. Across different ecosystems, the minimal required WoO duration determines how many WoO events are available for seedling establishment. The distribution of WoO along an elevation gradient on riverbanks and in tidal systems, for example, is defined by the combination of the overall disturbance regime (e.g. seasonal vs. tidal flooding cycles) and the stochastic deviations from that regime (e.g. changes in weather conditions). Standardizing the WoO for the frequency of the regular disturbance regime shows that tidal and river systems have a similar relation between the required WoO length and the elevation suitable for establishment. WoO analysis correctly predicted a sudden vegetation recovery event in a saltmarsh case study. Synthesis. Time-series analysis for 'WoO' offers an important tool towards predicting the establishment of vegetation cover in disturbance-driven ecosystems and may have broader implications for understanding critical transitions in general. Quantifying the effects of stochastic external forcing on critical transitions in ecosystems is crucial for restoration efforts and to assess the effects of anthropogenic and global change.

Environment sensing in spring-dispersed seeds of a winter annual Arabidopsis influences the regulation of dormancy to align germination potential with seasonal changes	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												<list list-type="bulleted" id="nph12694-list-0001"> Seed dormancy cycling plays a crucial role in the lifecycle timing of many plants. Little is known of how the seeds respond to the soil seed bank environment following dispersal in spring into the short-term seed bank before seedling emergence in autumn. Seeds of the winter annual Arabidopsis ecotype Cvi were buried in field soils in spring and recovered monthly until autumn and their molecular eco-physiological responses were recorded.DOG1 expression is initially low and then increases as dormancy increases. MFT expression is negatively correlated with germination potential. Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) signalling responds rapidly following burial and adjusts to the seasonal change in soil temperature. Collectively these changes align germination potential with the optimum climate space for seedling emergence. Seeds naturally dispersed to the soil in spring enter a shallow dormancy cycle dominated by spatial sensing that adjusts germination potential to the maximum when soil environment is most favourable for germination and seedling emergence upon soil disturbance. This behaviour differs subtly from that of seeds overwintered in the soil seed bank to spread the period of potential germination in the seed population (existing seed bank and newly dispersed). As soil temperature declines in autumn, deep dormancy is re-imposed as seeds become part of the persistent seed bank.

J	Colbach, N; Busset, H; Roger-Estrade, J; Caneill, J				Colbach, Nathalie; Busset, Hugues; Roger-Estrade, Jean; Caneill, Jacques			Predictive modelling of weed seed movement in response to superficial tillage tools	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Weed seed burial and excavation by tillage determines seed depth, seed survival, germination and pre-emergent seedling mortality. However, quantitative estimates of seed burial are available for only a few tools and often without reference to soil structure, moisture or tillage depth. This study proposes a conceptual model for predicting weed seed movements during superficial tillage in response to the type of tool, tillage depth and soil structure. The proposed model was calibrated with field data collected using coloured plastic beads as weed seed proxies. Beads were placed at different vertical and horizontal positions before tillage, using augers to preserve soil structure and collected after tillage by opening trenches and counting beads found at different depths. Approximately 33% of the beads were retrieved and used to establish bead distributions from which model parameters were estimated. Cross-validation showed that prediction quality was satisfactorily (modelling efficiency = 0.85, minimum rMSEP = 0.11) with most of the error associated with using a harrow in compacted soil. Subsequently, the new model was integrated into the existing weed dynamics model FLORSYS, and simulations were run to predict weed emergence and dynamics for different tillage practices. With a surface seed bank, total emergence was highest for shallow operations (harrow, discs) and lowest for deep operations (chisel, mouldboard plough). Emergence was also lower in compacted soils. Differences among tillage tools persisted when weed dynamics were simulated over several years, with mouldboard ploughing generally having the lowest density even though this tool was only used every three years. Superficial tillage which left seeds closest to the soil surface resulted in the highest weed density. Also, for species with heavy seeds densities generally increased with ploughing. These simulations confirm the utility of the new model, but additional studies are needed to examine other tillage, management practices and weed species combinations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Diverse molecular signatures for ribosomally 'active' Perkinsea in marine sediments	BMC MICROBIOLOGY												Background: Perkinsea are a parasitic lineage within the eukaryotic superphylum Alveolata. Recent studies making use of environmental small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequencing methodologies have detected a significant diversity and abundance of Perkinsea-like phylotypes in freshwater environments. In contrast only a few Perkinsea environmental sequences have been retrieved from marine samples and only two groups of Perkinsea have been cultured and morphologically described and these are parasites of marine molluscs or marine protists. These two marine groups form separate and distantly related phylogenetic clusters, composed of closely related lineages on SSU rDNA trees. Here, we test the hypothesis that Perkinsea are a hitherto under-sampled group in marine environments. Using 454 diversity 'tag' sequencing we investigate the diversity and distribution of these protists in marine sediments and water column samples taken from the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) and sub-surface using both DNA and RNA as the source template and sampling four European offshore locations. Results: We detected the presence of 265 sequences branching with known Perkinsea, the majority of them recovered from marine sediments. Moreover, 27% of these sequences were sampled from RNA derived cDNA libraries. Phylogenetic analyses classify a large proportion of these sequences into 38 cluster groups (including 30 novel marine cluster groups), which share less than 97% sequence similarity suggesting this diversity encompasses a range of biologically and ecologically distinct organisms. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the Perkinsea lineage is considerably more diverse than previously detected in marine environments. This wide diversity of Perkinsea-like protists is largely retrieved in marine sediment with a significant proportion detected in RNA derived libraries suggesting this diversity represents ribosomally 'active' and intact cells. Given the phylogenetic range of hosts infected by known Perkinsea parasites, these data suggest that Perkinsea either play a significant but hitherto unrecognized role as parasites in marine sediments and/or members of this group are present in the marine sediment possibly as part of the ` seed bank' microbial community.

In this study, classic models based on compound interest law, which exists in many natural phenomena, were reunified, and a seed bank dynamics model of annual plants was developed. We found an intrinsic relationship between the compound interest of unit period and density dependence, and the relationship was interpreted using evolutionary stability strategies of a single seed. Based on the relationship, a seed bank dynamic model of annual plants was constructed, and compound interest of the unit period and discrete-time dynamic processes, by which a new density-dependence based on the benefit balance of storage and investment (defined as the compound interest law) was derived. Our model not only can be used to reunify the three classic models (Cohen's, Goldberg's, and Fulmer's) but can also support different levels of density dependence in the seed bank dynamics of annual plants. Our study has shown that the compound interest law interprets seed bank dynamics more clearly than the traditional power law, not only because there are close relationships between the compound interest law and the power laws in numerical simulations but also because the compound interest law can be directly interpreted by the evolutionary stability theory. Our study provides new insight into the bet hedging theory and the life-history evolution of plants with seed banks by adding a compound interest term to the fitness function of annual plants. We suggest that if the interest rate of delaying growth can be defined by compensating for delayed growth, compound interest of the unit period will play an important role in biology and ecology.

The Gut of Geographically Disparate Ciona intestinalis Harbors a Core Microbiota	PLOS ONE												It is now widely understood that all animals engage in complex interactions with bacteria (or microbes) throughout their various life stages. This ancient exchange can involve cooperation and has resulted in a wide range of evolved host-microbial interdependencies, including those observed in the gut. Ciona intestinalis, a filter-feeding basal chordate and classic developmental model that can be experimentally manipulated, is being employed to help define these relationships. Ciona larvae are first exposed internally to microbes upon the initiation of feeding in metamorphosed individuals; however, whether or not these microbes subsequently colonize the gut and whether or not Ciona forms relationships with specific bacteria in the gut remains unknown. In this report, we show that the Ciona gut not only is colonized by a complex community of bacteria, but also that samples from three geographically isolated populations reveal striking similarity in abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) consistent with the selection of a core community by the gut ecosystem.

Soil Seed Bank in Nantucket's Early Successional Communities: Implications for Management	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Globally rare sandplain grassland and coastal heathland plant communities of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, merit high conservation priority because they support many rare and endangered species. Management (brush-cutting, grazing, and prescribed fire) has been effective in maintaining these communities, but less successful in transforming overgrown native scrub oak shrubland to diverse grassland. These scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia Wangenh.) communities may lack a seed bank of grassland species in their soil. To examine this on Nantucket, we used the seedling emergence method to compare the soil seed bank of grassland, heathland, and scrub oak sites. We classified seedlings by growth form (graminoid, forb, or woody) and identified them to genus and species when possible. We observed that seedling density declined along a successional gradient, with the highest total density and highest graminoid density at grassland sites and the lowest at one of the scrub oak sites. A nMDS ordination grouped grassland sites with dominant graminoids and heathland sites with dominant woody species and forbs. Seeds of key grassland dominants were absent from scrub oak and heathland samples but were found in grassland samples. Our results suggest that lack of seed bank of desirable grassland species may be a limiting factor in restoration projects intended to convert scrub oak shrubland to sandplain grassland. Scarcity of grassland species in the scrub oak seed bank highlights the importance of maintaining existing grassland communities, rather than attempting to restore them once they are gone.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2014	34	2					188	199		10.3375/043.034.0208							WOS:000342875800007

This patchiness, however, is not usually taken into account in fire ecology studies. We show that a dry-season fire may result in small-scale patchiness in the population structure of the common shrub Miconia albicans, mostly by differential topkill and resprouting. We related fire severity to population structure parameters of the study species and assessed the effects of fire on its soil seed bank. Basal area of non-woody live stems and of dead stems increased with fire severity, whereas that of woody live stems decreased, indicating topkill and resprouting. However, there was no relationship between fire severity and the total number of live or dead plants, showing that mortality in the fire was low. We found very few seedlings, indicating that resprouting, not germination from the soil seed bank, is the main recovery strategy of this species. The fire also affected the soil seed bank, as there were fewer seedlings emerging from soil collected in burned patches. Although this study was performed with a single species, it is likely that other species, especially those with basal resprouting, will show similar patterns of post-fire patchiness in population structure. This patchiness, in turn, may affect the spatial distribution of future fires, and should be taken into account in studies of fire ecology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	James, EA; Jordan, R				James, E. A.; Jordan, R.			Limited structure and widespread diversity suggest potential buffers to genetic erosion in a threatened grassland shrub Pimelea spinescens (Thymelaeaceae)	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Pimelea spinescens is a critically endangered species of the temperate grasslands of southeastern Australia. Two subspecies are recognised. Subspecies, P. spinescens subsp. spinescens, formerly common and widespread, is found in isolated remnants of previously extensive grasslands. The second subspecies, subsp. pubiflora, is thought to have been historically rare with only two geographically-isolated extant populations. The grassland communities exist now as fragmented remnants representing < 1 % of their extent prior to European settlement in the early 1800s. Conservation management strategies for species in these critically endangered ecosystems rely on an understanding of genetic diversity and population structure to ensure long-term evolutionary potential. We used chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and microsatellite markers to examine the population genetic structure of both subspecies. Analysis of cpDNA revealed 14 haplotypes with high divergence between the single haplotype found in subsp. pubiflora and most remaining haplotypes restricted to subsp. spinescens. Microsatellites also indicated high genetic differentiation between subspecies but little evidence of sub-structuring within either subspecies. Results suggest that seed dispersal has not been as limited as previously thought. In this fragmented habitat, a lack of genetic structure suggests buffers to genetic erosion, with current patterns reflecting genetic diversity prior to fragmentation. Plant longevity and the presence of seed banks may contribute to the maintenance of these patterns, resulting in a lag between fragmentation and genetic erosion. Whilst factors such as longevity and seed banks may be preserving historic genetic diversity, management is required to ensure the maintenance of this diversity into the future.																	1566-0621	1572-9737				APR	2014	15	2					305	317		10.1007/s10592-013-0539-y							WOS:000332758900006

Restoration actions have been introduced in many places to improve the habitat conditions and increase the area to prevent any further losses of their ecological values. However, given the limited resources and long time span needed for successful restoration, it is essential to target activities on sites having a suitable initial state and where the effects of restoration are most beneficial for the habitat network. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for evaluating the restoration potential of partially overgrown and selectively managed semi-natural grasslands in a moderately transformed agricultural environment in south-western Finland. On the basis of the spatio-temporal landscape trajectory analysis, we construct potential restoration scenarios based on expected semi-natural grassland characteristics that are derived from land productivity, detected grassland continuum, and date of overgrowth. These scenarios are evaluated using landscape metrics, their feasibility is discussed and the effects of potential restoration are compared to the present extent of open semi-natural grasslands. Our results show that landscape trajectory analysis and scenario construction can be valuable tools for the restoration planning of semi-natural grasslands with limited resources. The approach should therefore be considered as an essential tool to find the most optimal restoration sites and to pre-evaluate the effects.

Factors affecting host range in a generalist seed pathogen of semi-arid shrublands	PLANT ECOLOGY												Generalist pathogens can exhibit differential success on different hosts, resulting in complex host range patterns. Several factors operate to reduce realized host range relative to potential host range, particularly under field conditions. We explored factors influencing host range of the naturally occurring generalist ascomycete grass seed pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda. We measured potential host range in laboratory experiments at high inoculum loads with 26 grass species, including the primary host Bromus tectorum, and developed models to predict susceptibility and tolerance based on host traits, including germination speed, seed hardness, seed size, and phylogenetic relations. We also examined pathogen and host density effects on infection and mortality. All species tested were at least somewhat susceptible to the pathogen at high inoculum loads, but both infection and mortality varied widely. Species more closely related to the original host (B. tectorum) were more susceptible to infection, whereas species with slower germination were less tolerant and therefore more likely to suffer mortality. Infection and mortality were sharply reduced as inoculum load was reduced. Intermediate loads had major negative impacts on dormant B. tectorum seeds but generally minimal effects on native species. In addition, field seed bank studies determined that P. semeniperda rarely exploits native grass species as hosts. This marked reduction in realized host range relative to potential host range indicates that laboratory host range studies are potentially a poor predictor of either the current or possible future realized host range for wildland plant pathogens.

Location La Crau area, southeast France (Provence). Methods After the rehabilitation of a 357-ha herbaceous, sheep-grazed rangeland suitable for threatened steppe birds in a formerly abandoned industrial orchard in the last French Mediterranean steppe (La Crau area), four experimental treatments were applied, with or without topsoil removal. Topsoil was removed on a 5000-m(2) area and the four treatments (control, nurse species seeding, hay transfer and soil transfer) were applied within this area where topsoil was removed and within the area where topsoil was not removed. Three years later, soil chemistry, soil seed bank, vegetation cover and height, plant species richness, composition and diversity were compared. Results Removing topsoil partly restored soil conditions and significantly reduced the non-target seed bank. Moreover, species richness and similarity to the reference steppe was significantly increased with topsoil removal. Topsoil removal, combined with soil transfer and hay transfer, created a community that most closely resembled the reference during the study period. Conclusion In order to restore plant community composition, topsoil removal is a relevant method to increase the efficiency of other ecological restoration techniques, especially those that strengthen dispersal processes.

Does increasing topsoil removal depth increase the success of plant material transfer establishment? Location The Camargue, Rhone delta, France. Methods A small-scale restoration experiment involving Mediterranean meso-xeric grasslands was conducted in a former rice field area. During 3yr, plant species richness and composition were compared on permanent plots subject to the following four treatments: 5cm topsoil removal, 20cm topsoil removal, 5cm topsoil removal with plant material transfer, and 20cm topsoil removal with plant material transfer. Additionally, the seed bank at 0- to 5-cm deep, at 5- to 20-cm deep and at 20- to 40-cm deep were studied in order to evaluate the effect of topsoil removal. Results After 4mo, species richness, number of target species and similarity to the reference Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland significantly increased with plant material transfer relative to the no transfer treatment (topsoil removal without transfer). However, we found no significant difference in plant species number between the two depths of topsoil removal. This can be explained by the absence of any variation in soil seed bank between 5cm and 20cm. The species richness and number of target species decreased significantly in transfer treatment between the first and the second monitoring. Despite this general decrease in the first year, the plant material transfer treatment showed significantly more target species than the no transfer treatment and a higher similarity to the Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland. Conclusion In order to restore a Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland plant community, plant material transfer combined with topsoil removal appears to be a relevant method. Removing 5cm of topsoil eliminates half of the density of the undesired seed bank in a former rice field. However, the ability of target species to establish and persist in restored vegetation communities will require good management. Conditions with low competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential for transferred species to persist, and appropriately timed grazing and adequate stocking rates will be needed to limit the negative effects of competition.

To what degree does the share of typical flooded meadow species in the soil seed bank change during secondary succession from traditionally managed hayfields to stages overgrown by woody vegetation? Location Flooded meadows in Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, central Estonia (26 degrees 14 ' E, 58 degrees 33 ' N). Methods The species composition of above-ground vegetation and the persistent soil seed bank were investigated with PerMANOVA and non-metric multidimensional scaling in mown, 25-yr abandoned and 50-yr abandoned sedge and tall forb meadows subjected to annual flooding. Particular attention was given to typical flooded meadow species in the persistent soil seed bank. General linear models and non-parametric tests were used to assess successional trends in seed bank richness, density, similarity to target vegetation and percentage of flooded meadow species to assess the restoration potential of the soil seed bank. Results The cessation of traditional management has led to considerable changes in both above-ground and seed bank communities, differences between successional stages being more pronounced in the soil seed bank. The density of the seed bank was higher in abandoned meadows. Diversity in the vegetation and soil seed bank was lowest in the 25-yr abandoned tall forb meadows. Although the soil seed bank similarity to above-ground mown meadows (locally defined target vegetation) was relatively low across different successional stages, the proportion of flooded meadow species in the seed bank remained high - even after 50-yr abandonment, on average 42% of emerged seeds from sedge meadow and 34% from tall forb meadow were typical flooded meadow species. Conclusions Abandoned floodplain meadows in central Estonia still contain a relatively large grassland community species pool, including a large and effective soil seed bank. The soil seed bank could thus play an important role in the restoration of abandoned and overgrown meadow communities. Targeted experiments addressing the optimal techniques for activating the soil seed bank in flooded meadow soil are needed.

K.; Cardina, John			Ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality, regeneration, and seed bank dynamics in mixed hardwood forests following invasion by emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis) has killed millions of ash trees and threatens ash throughout North America, and long-term persistence of ash will depend on the potential for regeneration. We quantified ash demography, including mortality and regeneration, of Fraxinus americana (white ash), Fraxinus pennsylvanica (green ash), and Fraxinus nigra (black ash) in mixed hardwood forests near the epicenter of the EAB invasion in southeastern Michigan and throughout Ohio. Plots were established across a gradient of ash densities. Ash was the most important species in hydric sites, and ranked second among all species in mesic and xeric sites. In sites nearest the epicenter in Michigan, ash mortality exceeded 99 % by 2009, and few or no newly germinated ash seedlings were observed, leaving only an "orphaned cohort" of established ash seedlings and saplings. As ash mortality increased, the number of viable ash seeds in soil samples decreased sharply, and no viable seeds were collected in 2007 or 2008. In Ohio sites farther from the epicenter, densities of new ash seedlings were much higher in plots with healthy ash trees compared to plots where trees had died. EAB was still present in low densities in Michigan and Ohio stands in 2012 where average mortality of ash was nearly 100 %. The future of ash at these sites will depend on the outcome of the dynamic interaction between the orphaned cohort of previously established ash seedlings and saplings and low density EAB populations.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2014	16	4					859	873		10.1007/s10530-013-0543-7							WOS:000333011700011

Ferry			Major declines of woody plant species ranges under climate change in Yunnan, China	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimA wide range of forests distributed across steep environmental gradients are found in Yunnan, southwest China. Climate change could profoundly change these forests by affecting species ranges. We produce predictions about species suitable habitat shifts and use these to (1) evaluate species range size change, loss and turn-over under no- and full-dispersal and nine climate change scenarios and (2) identify environmental variables responsible for current species richness and future local species losses. LocationYunnan Province, Southwest China. MethodsUsing MaxEnt, we modelled current distributions of 2319 woody plant species, corrected for collecting bias and found that 1996 had significant spatial association with environmental factors. Using three General Circulation Models (GCMs: CGCM, CSIRO and HADCM3) for the years 2070-2099 (2080s), based on three emission scenarios for each GCM (A1b, A2a and B2a), we predicted the future geographic position of suitable habitat for each species. ResultsAlthough most species were predicted to persist within Yunnan, with a maximum extinction rate of c.6% under the most extreme climate change scenario, up to 1400 species (of the 1996 tested) are expected to lose more than 30% of their current range under the most extreme climate change scenario. Assuming no- or unlimited dispersal minimally affected these outcomes. Species losses were associated with increasing temperature variability and declining precipitation during the dry season. Main conclusionsTo conserve Yunnan's woody flora, management efforts should focus on providing elevational migration routes at local scales, with priority for those areas located within previously identified conservation hotspots. As almost all species show range contractions, storage of genetic diversity in seed banks and botanical gardens would be sensible. A change in Yunnan's conservation policy will be needed to counter the predicted negative impacts of climate change on its flora.

J	Volis, S				Volis, Sergei			Dormancy-Related Seed Positional Effect in Two Populations of an Annual Grass from Locations of Contrasting Aridity	PLOS ONE												In grasses, variation in seed size and dormancy often results from a seed's position within a dispersal unit. In this paper, I asked whether seed positional effect within a spikelet contributes to ecotypic differentiation between two populations of Avena sterilis having different species range position and associated aridity. I created experimental seed banks in which germination of seeds (florets) having different positions within a spikelet was examined over three years. In addition, two germination tests were conducted under controlled conditions. The two populations were found to have a short-living soil seed bank due to sequential germination of the florets. Although positional seed dormancy effect in A. sterilis does not appear to be a specific desert adaptation against unpredictability of rainfall events, this trait does contribute to ecotypic differentiation between desert and Mediterranean populations. Consistent with bet hedging buffering against rainfall unpredictability, germination fractions in the first year were higher in the Mediterranean than in the desert population, while seeds of the desert origin had stronger dormancy and more sequential germination of florets.																	1932-6203					MAR 27	2014	9	3							e93061	10.1371/journal.pone.0093061							WOS:000333677500068	24675719

Thus far, most nebkha research has focused on individual plants. Here, we aimed to explore population-scale processes (up to scales of about 100 m) that might explain an observed nebkha landscape pattern. We mapped the Rhazya stricta Decne. population in a 3 ha study site in a hyper-arid region of Saudi Arabia. We compared the spatial patterns of five different cohorts (age classes) of observed nebkha host plants to those expected under several hypothesized drivers of recruitment and intraspecific interaction. We found that all R. stricta cohorts had a limited fractional vegetation cover and established in large-scale clusters. This clustering weakened with cohort age, possibly indicating merging of neighboring vegetation patches. Different cohort clusters did not spatially overlap in most cases, indicating that recruitment patterns changed position over time. Strong indications were found that the main drivers underlying R. stricta spatial configurations were allogenic (i.e. not driven by vegetation) and dynamic. Most likely these drivers were aeolian-driven sand movement or human disturbance which forced offspring recruitment in spatially dynamic clusters. Competition and facilitation were likely active on the field site too, but apparently had a limited effect on the overall landscape structure.

Deer Browsing Delays Succession by Altering Aboveground Vegetation and Belowground Seed Banks	PLOS ONE												Soil seed bank composition is important to the recovery of natural and semi-natural areas from disturbance and serves as a safeguard against environmental catastrophe. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations have increased dramatically in eastern North America over the past century and can have strong impacts on aboveground vegetation, but their impacts on seed bank dynamics are less known. To document the long-term effects of deer browsing on plant successional dynamics, we studied the impacts of deer on both aboveground vegetation and seed bank composition in plant communities following agricultural abandonment. In 2005, we established six 15615 m fenced enclosures and paired open plots in recently fallowed agricultural fields near Ithaca, NY, USA. In late October of each of six years (2005-2010), we collected soil from each plot and conducted seed germination cycles in a greenhouse to document seed bank composition. These data were compared to measurements of aboveground plant cover (2005-2008) and tree density (2005-2012). The impacts of deer browsing on aboveground vegetation were severe and immediate, resulting in significantly more bare soil, reduced plant biomass, reduced recruitment of woody species, and relatively fewer native species. These impacts persisted throughout the experiment. The impacts of browsing were even stronger on seed bank dynamics. Browsing resulted in significantly decreased overall species richness (but higher diversity), reduced seed bank abundance, relatively more short-lived species (annuals and biennials), and fewer native species. Both seed bank richness and the relative abundance of annuals/biennials were mirrored in the aboveground vegetation. Thus, deer browsing has long-term and potentially reinforcing impacts on secondary succession, slowing succession by selectively consuming native perennials and woody species and favoring the persistence of short-lived, introduced species that continually recruit from an altered seed bank.

Changing economic or conservation priorities are increasingly leading to the removal of these plantations, but the ability of these stands to recover into natural communities varies across ecosystems. In this study, we assessed the recovery of open and closed grasslands over five years following the removal of alien pine plantations through burning at an inland sand dune system in Hungary. We compared soil characteristics, plant species richness, cover, and community composition of recovering and control grasslands at two elevation zones. We found minor differences in soil characteristics between recovering and control grasslands suggesting that abiotic conditions were unlikely to limit vegetation recovery. Plot-level species richness and total cover did not differ between control and recovering plots. Open sand grassland species, which dominated high-zone control grasslands, recovered in both zones in terms of species richness, but not in cover. Closed grassland species, which dominated low-zone control grasslands, did not recover except for a native weed, Calamagrostis epigeios, most likely primarily due to the decline of the water table in the region. The differential recovery of the two grassland types and the dominance of weedy perennials led to biotic homogenization. We conclude that conservation planning should (1) view these recovering stands as valuable secondary grasslands that develop towards open grasslands, and (2) focus on the preservation of primary closed grasslands in order to maintain the landscape-scale mosaic of open and closed grasslands in the region.

J	Gooden, B; French, K				Gooden, Ben; French, Kris			Impacts of alien grass invasion in coastal seed banks vary amongst native growth forms and dispersal strategies	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Alien plant invaders frequently reduce biodiversity of native communities, but the mechanisms of impact remain poorly understood. We used the seedling emergence method to assess impacts of invasion by an alien, clonal grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) on endangered coastal swamp forest seed banks of eastern Australia. We asked: do impacts vary amongst native plant growth forms and dispersal strategies, and are impacts driven by propagule or recruitment limitation? Invasion was associated with significant reductions in seed bank species richness and increased dissimilarity between the seed bank and standing vegetation. The rate of species loss was more than two times greater within the standing vegetation than seed bank, however, indicating that the primary mechanism of community change is limited recruitment from the seed bank rather than a reduction in the arrival and storage of propagules to invaded sites. Overall, species losses were observed for herbs, graminoids and vertebrate-dispersed species, whilst wind and water dispersed and woody species were unaffected by invasion. Overall, seed banks were substantially richer than the standing vegetation across both invaded and non-invaded sites, indicating a high potential for unassisted reestablishment of a species-rich standing vegetation from the seed bank following S. secundatum removal, although one unlikely to resemble the original community in structure, function and identity of species. Differential impacts across functional groups may result in regenerating communities relatively dominated by woody species, which may prevent subsequent recolonisation by herbs and graminoids. Monitoring will be required to identify whether these and other species require assisted reintroduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We assessed the density of seeds in the soil seed bank and the percentage of germination in botanic garden experiments for samples obtained from three invaded sites. We performed essays outdoors for soil samples, and in germination chamber for seeds collected directly from plants and for seeds obtained from the soil seven years before the experiment. Seeds density in the soil ranged from 600 to 4411 seeds/m(2). Germination percentage for soil samples was 68.33 +/- 26.66%. For chamber experiments, mechanical scarification lead to the germination of all the seeds in the case of those collected from the plants, compared to just 7 +/- 5.7% for the control and figures even smaller for heath shock and combination of heath shock and mechanical scarification. The experiment with seeds form the soil bank resulted in a percentage of germination of 88.73 +/- 11.16% for those seeds previously treated with mechanical scarification, 85.77 +/- 10.50% for heath shock, 40.30 +/- 10.14% for imbibitions and 43.20 +/- 12.01% for the control. Brief exposition to high temperatures, mechanical breakage of the seed cover and soil disturbances significatively favor germination and stimulate invasion.																	1851-2372					MAR	2014	49	1					67	76									WOS:000335608200007

In central Veracruz, Mexico, the soil seed bank was determined en five fallows and two forests. Seed bank decreased from fallow to forest (1,303 to 101 seeds m(-2)); herbs and grasses predominated, thus the similarity between species composition of seed bank and vegetation was low. Seed removal and germination were evaluated for Acacia cochliacantha, Caesalpinia cacalaco, Ipomoea wolcottiana, and Senna atomaria, in contrasting habitats represented by pasture, fallow and forest. Seed removal was determined under treatments of total access, rodent exclosure, and insect exclosure. Caesalpinia (largest seeds) showed the lowest seed removal (5%), whereas Senna (63%) and Ipomoea (29%) showed the highest. Rodent exclosure reduced seed removal for Ipomoea (medium-sized seeds); and insect exclosure reduced removal for Senna and Acacia (small seeds). With the exception of Senna (18% germination), the scarified seeds displayed the highest germination percentage (53-99%). For all species, germination was higher in forest than in open habitats, only Senna seeds presented the lowest germination percentage in the forest habitat. Results suggested that in the dry forest of Veracruz, current seed removal may not limit forest regeneration. We suggest seed scarification of some species for use in restoration activities.

Temperature thresholds of physically dormant seeds and plant functional response to fire: variation among species and relative impact of climate change	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Variation in dormancy thresholds among species is rarely studied but may provide a basis to better understand the mechanisms controlling population persistence. Incorporating dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds into existing trait frameworks could improve predictions regarding seed bank persistence, and subsequently species resilience in response to fire, climate change and anthropogenic management. A key ecological strategy for many species from fire-prone ecosystems is the possession of a long-lived seed bank, ensuring recovery after fire. Physical dormancy is dominant in these ecosystems and maintaining this dormancy is directly linked to seed bank persistence. We identified a suite of seed-related factors relevant to maintaining populations in fire-prone regions for 14 co-occurring physically dormant species. We measured variation in initial levels of dormancy and then applied experimental heating treatments, based on current seasonal temperatures and those occurring during fires, to seeds of all study species. Additionally, higher seasonal temperature treatments were applied to assess response of seeds to temperatures projected under future climate scenarios. Levels of germination response and mortality were determined to assess how tightly germination response was bound to either fire or seasonal cues. Six species were found to have dormancy cues bound to temperatures that only occur during fires (80 degrees C and above) and were grouped as having obligate pyrogenic dormancy release. The remaining species, classified as having facultative pyrogenic dormancy, had lower temperature dormancy thresholds and committed at least 30% of seeds to germinate after summer-temperature treatments. Evidence from this study supports including dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds as an attribute for identifying functional types. High temperature thresholds for breaking dormancy, found in our obligate pyrogenic group, appear to be a fire-adapted trait, while we predict that species in the facultative group are most at risk to increased seed bank decay resulting from elevated soil temperatures under projected climate change.

J	de Oliveira, MNS; Cruz, LI; Tanaka, MK				Sousa de Oliveira, Maria Neudes; Cruz, Lana Ivone; Tanaka, Mario Kiichiro			Collection time and seed germination of commercialized Comanthera (Eriocaulaceae) from Serra do Ambrosio, Minas Gerais	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												(Collection time and seed germination of commercialized Comanthera (Eriocaulaceae) from Serra do Ambrosio, Minas Gerais). Comanthera suberosa (Giul.) L. R. Parra and Giul., C. brasiliana (Giul.) L. R. Parra and Giul., C. magnifica (Giul.) L. R. Parra and Giul. are everlasting plants Eriocaulaceae on lists of endangered species and usually collected for sale between June and August. Inflorescences of the three species were collected in the Serra do Ambrosio mountains in June, August, and October 2009. Two morphotypes of C. magnifica, known locally as Branquinha and Brancona, were evaluated separately. Evaluations included the biometrics of inflorescences and seeds, the number of seeds per capitulum and germination and postseminal development. Capitula of the species collected in June showed no seeds. Of those collected in August, only C. magnifica (morphotype Branquinha) and C. suberosa had seeds with germination rates of 31.6 and 85.83 %, respectively. In October, capitula of C. brasiliana, C. suberosa, and Branquinha e Brancona had a germination rate of 87.5, 72.5, 20.7, and 23.7 %, respectively. The number of seeds per capitulum varied from 0 to 20; 17 to 40; 40 to 220; 102 to 356 for C. suberosa, C. brasiliana, Branquinha and Brancona, respectively. Considering the collection period of the species for commercialization (between June and August), the collection that begun in June compromised seed production in all species; in August the most collected species, C. suberosa and C. magnifica (morphotype Branquinha), already produced seeds, but the collection of C. brasiliana and C. magnifica (morphotype Brancona) prevented forming seed banks and may compromise populations sustainability.																	0100-8404	1806-9959				MAR	2014	37	1					19	27		10.1007/s40415-013-0045-y							WOS:000332825700003

RESERVOIR FLOODPLAINS SUPPORT DISTINCT FISH ASSEMBLAGES	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Reservoirs constructed on floodplain rivers are unique because the upper reaches of the impoundment may include extensive floodplain environments. Moreover, reservoirs that experience large periodic water level fluctuations as part of their operational objectives seasonally inundate and dewater floodplains in their upper reaches, partly mimicking natural inundations of river floodplains. In four flood control reservoirs in Mississippi, USA, we explored the dynamics of connectivity between reservoirs and adjacent floodplains and the characteristics of fish assemblages that develop in reservoir floodplains relative to those that develop in reservoir bays. Although fish species richness in floodplains and bays were similar, species composition differed. Floodplains emphasized fish species largely associated with backwater shallow environments, often resistant to harsh environmental conditions. Conversely, dominant species in bays represented mainly generalists that benefit from the continuous connectivity between the bay and the main reservoir. Floodplains in the study reservoirs provided desirable vegetated habitats at lower water level elevations, earlier in the year, and more frequently than in bays. Inundating dense vegetation in bays requires raising reservoir water levels above the levels required to reach floodplains. Therefore, aside from promoting distinct fish assemblages within reservoirs and helping promote diversity in regulated rivers, reservoir floodplains are valued because they can provide suitable vegetated habitats for fish species at elevations below the normal pool, precluding the need to annually flood upland vegetation that would inevitably be impaired by regular flooding.

J	Jaunatre, R; Buisson, E; Dutoit, T				Jaunatre, Renaud; Buisson, Elise; Dutoit, Thierry			Can ecological engineering restore Mediterranean rangeland after intensive cultivation? A large-scale experiment in southern France	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Ecological restoration has been identified as one of the possible ways to replace biodiversity loss. While ecological engineering methods can successfully restore some ecosystem attributes, restoration is generally incomplete, mainly due to lack of target species propagule dispersal, unsuitable abiotic conditions and negative biotic interactions, especially after intensive cultivation. How best to restore reference ecosystems is therefore a vital research objective, not only on a small experimental scale but also on a large scale. This study aimed to determine which ecological engineering techniques are the most suitable for large-scale restoration of a low-productive species-rich ecosystem after intensive cultivation. Experiments were carried out at La Crau in southern France, within a 357 ha land rehabilitation project whose aim was to recreate a herbaceous sheep-grazed habitat. We investigated: (i) covering species seeding, (ii) topsoil removal, (iii) hay transfer, and (iv) soil transfer as methods to restore a steppe plant community in this rehabilitated area, using the last remaining French Mediterranean steppe as a reference ecosystem. Species-richness, diversity and composition of vascular plant communities were monitored over three years. The rehabilitation made it possible to recover a large area dominated by grasses but with vegetation different from that of the steppe. Hay transfer was successful in transferring some target species, but the number of target species did not significantly increase by the end of the third year. Covering species seeding seemed to provide a suitable area for target species colonization, but probable competition with grasses needs to be monitored. The greatest similarity in richness, diversity, and composition with the reference ecosystem was obtained with topsoil removal and soil transfer, which made it possible to recover the species-richness and, to some extent, the composition of the steppe. Our findings show that current ecological restoration and ecological engineering techniques can lead to at least partial restoration of some ecosystem attributes. However, they also underline the importance of in situ conservation of natural habitats rather than restoring them after their destruction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Srivastava, R; Singh, KP				Srivastava, Rajani; Singh, K. P.			Diversity in weed seed production and the soil seed bank: Contrasting responses between two agroecosystems	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study was carried out to compare the diversity in seed production and the soil seed bank in a dryland and an irrigated agroecosystem in the dry tropics. Both agroecosystems showed a comparable number of species, but only 25% and 38% similarity during the winter and rainy cropping seasons, respectively. In the irrigated agroecosystem, the amount of seed production diversity was almost double in the winter season, compared to the rainy season. The weed seedbank diversity was low but was sensitive to cropping practices and seasons in both agroecosystems. A considerably smaller soil seedbank size in the irrigated agroecosystem (cf. dryland) was related to lowered weed seed production. The dryland agroecosystem showed a greater accumulation of the seeds of broad-leaved weeds, whereas the irrigated agroecosystem accumulated more seeds of the grasses or sedges. About three-fourths of the seeds during the winter season were accounted for by Anagallis arvensis and Chenopodium album in the dryland agroecosystem and by C. album and Melilotus indica in the irrigated agroecosystem. However, during the rainy season, Ammannia baccifera, Echinochloa colona and Cyperus rotundus dominated in both agroecosystems. The changes in the weed seed bank and its diversity are mainly attributed to differences in water management, which tends to reduce species diversity, especially at a lower depth, but leads to the dominance of some potentially noxious weeds (e.g. Phalaris minor and M. indica). Approximately double the soil seedbank size and a greater diversity at a lower depth might indicate an adaptive mechanism in the storage of weed seeds in the dryland agroecosystem.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				MAR	2014	14	1					21	30		10.1111/wbm.12029							WOS:000332067700003						
J	Tavsanoglu, C; Gurkan, B				Tavsanoglu, Cagatay; Gurkan, Behzat			Long-term post-fire dynamics of co-occurring woody species in Pinus brutia forests: the role of regeneration mode	PLANT ECOLOGY												Regeneration mode is one of the key attributes determining population structure and dynamics of plant species. We investigated long-term patterns after fire in the cover of plant species in a 100-year chronosequence of burned Pinus brutia forests in a humid Mediterranean climate region in Turkey. Significant trends were present in the change of cover in major species through post-fire chronosequence, and species with similar trends were clustered in relation to their regeneration modes. Obligate resprouters increased their cover from the early post-fire years to the later stages, while cover of obligate seeders with a soil seed bank increased in the early years, but then decreased through time. Facultative resprouters were at an intermediate position, with an increase in cover until mid-successional stages and then a decrease through time. The cover of the only obligate seeder with a canopy seed bank (P. brutia) followed a linear increasing trend during the succession. When species with the same regeneration mode were grouped, the same trends were observed with more explained variances. A few life-history traits were enough to explain the observed trends. Our study shows that regeneration mode is an explanatory functional grouping system for describing long-term post-fire dynamics of Mediterranean Basin woody species. We suggest that regeneration mode must be a major component of any vegetation or forest stand dynamics model in the Mediterranean Basin. This result has important implications for the management of Mediterranean Basin ecosystems, and can potentially be extrapolated to other Mediterranean-type fire-prone ecosystems.

Incorporating risk mapping at multiple spatial scales into eradication management plans	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The success of pro-active management of invasive plants depends on the ability to rapidly detect invasive populations and individuals. However, the factors important for detection depend on the spatial scale examined. We propose a protocol for developing risk maps at national, landscape, and local scales to improve detection rates of invasive plant species. We test this approach in the context of developing an eradication plan for the invasive tree Acacia stricta in South Africa. At a national scale we used bioclimatic models coupled with the most likely sites of introduction (i.e. forestry nursery plantations) to identify areas where national-scale surveillance should be focussed. At the landscape and local scales we correlated the presence of A. stricta populations to various attributes. Regional populations were found in forestry plantations only, and mostly on highly used graded roads along which seeds are spread by road maintenance vehicles. Locally, previously recorded plant localities accurately predicted individuals in subsequent surveys. Using these variables, we produced a map of high-risk areas that facilitated targeted searches-which reduced the required search effort by ca. 83 %-and developed recommendations for site-specific surveying. With the high visibility of plants, and relatively small seed banks, long-term annual clearing should achieve eradication. We propose that such multi-scale risk mapping is valuable for prioritising management and surveillance efforts, though caution that the approach is correlative and so it does not represent all the sites that can be invaded.

The area included 12 islands, each consisting of six jute bags with 20 kg of substrate (cattle manure and soil transposed from forest fragments). In six of these bags, native plants and seeds were also included. Six additional islands were selected randomly in the vicinity as the control. The process of evaluation was monitored through the chemical and granulometric soil analysis and surveys of survival, biometrics, floristic and phytosociological vegetation. An improvement in soil properties was observed where the model was implemented, which could be attributed to the substrate and revegetation. In the floristic and phytosociological studies, out of the 118 identified species, 65 were observed in the first floristic inventory and 86 in the second floristic inventory with similarities between the subfields of 27.69% and 11.36%, respectively. The influence of the substrate seed bank in the implemented islands was also observed. Increased diversity was only significant in the subareas with the model. It was concluded that this technology was effective in accelerating the succession and promoting the beginning of the restoration.

Lawrence			Bet hedging in desert winter annual plants: optimal germination strategies in a variable environment	ECOLOGY LETTERS												In bet hedging, organisms sacrifice short-term success to reduce the long-term variance in success. Delayed germination is the classic example of bet hedging, in which a fraction of seeds remain dormant as a hedge against the risk of complete reproductive failure. Here, we investigate the adaptive nature of delayed germination as a bet hedging strategy using long-term demographic data on Sonoran Desert winter annual plants. Using stochastic population models, we estimate fitness as a function of delayed germination and identify evolutionarily stable strategies for 12 abundant species in the community. Results indicate that delayed germination meets the criteria as a bet hedging strategy for all species. Density-dependent models, but not density-independent ones, predicted optimal germination strategies that correspond remarkably well with observed patterns. By incorporating naturally occurring variation in seed and seedling dynamics, our results present a rigorous test of bet hedging theory within the relevant environmental context.																	1461-023X	1461-0248				MAR	2014	17	3					380	387		10.1111/ele.12241							WOS:000329823300013	24393387

Effects of plant pathogens on population dynamics and community composition in grassland ecosystems: two case studies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												Grassland ecosystems comprise a major portion of the earth's terrestrial surface, ranging from high-input cultivated monocultures or simple species-mixtures to relatively unmanaged but dynamic systems. Plant pathogens are a component of these systems with their impact dependent on many interacting factors, including grassland species population dynamics and community composition, the topics covered in this paper. Plant pathogens are affected by these interactions and also act reciprocally by modifying their nature. We briefly review these features of disease in grasslands and then introduce the 150-year long-term Park Grass Experiment (PGE) at Rothamsted Research in the UK. We then consider in detail two plant-pathogen systems present in the PGE, Tragopogon pratensis-Puccinia hysterium and Holcus lanata-Puccinia coronata. These two systems have very different life history characteristics: the first, a biennial member of the Asteraceae infected by its host-specific, systemic rust; the second, a perennial grass infected by a host-non-specific rust. We illustrate how observational, experimental and modelling studies can contribute to a better understanding of population dynamics, competitive interactions and evolutionary outcomes. With Tragopogon pratensis-Puccinia hysterium, characterised as an "outbreak" species in the PGE, we show that pathogen-induced mortality is unlikely to be involved in host population regulation; and that the presence of even a short-lived seed-bank can affect the qualitative outcomes of the host-pathogen dynamics. With Holcus lanata-Puccinia coronata, we show how nutrient conditions can affect adaptation in terms of host defence mechanisms, and that co-existence of competing species affected by a common generalist pathogen is unlikely.

However, existing knowledge is based on studies of rotation-aged tree crops. We investigated how Eucalyptus afforestation of agricultural land affected plant species composition and biodiversity across a range of plantation ages (1-10 years). We also studied whether the soil seed bank could contribute to regeneration of existing vegetation in such plantations. We used a chronosequence approach to evaluate plant and seed species composition and diversity in forests and soil seed banks. We also quantified the similarity of seed banks and aboveground vegetation within plantation sites of a given age. Plantation sites were also compared to a nearby, mature pine forest. Total plant species number, density and diversity in Eucalyptus grandis plantations increased for the first 3 years plantation establishment, then stabilized or decreased for the next 1-2 years and then increase significantly over the following years. Species number and density in soil seed bank increased significantly with plantation age only after an initial 6-year decrease. Shannon-Wiener index of total species diversity did not significantly differ with plantation age. The understory vegetation and soil seed bank were dominated by pioneer species in the first 3 years, but intermediate-successional and shade-tolerant species gradually invaded as plantations developed further. After 7 years, E. grandis plantation understories were composed of mainly shade-tolerant species. Nevertheless, the diversity of the diversity of intermediate-successional in soil seed banks were higher than that of shade-tolerant species in soil seed banks at this age range (7-10 year). Among species successfully germinated from soil seed banks, 48 % were not found in the aboveground plant community. Similarities between the species in the soil seed bank and the aboveground vegetation were low for both plantation and control forests and did not significantly change with plantation ages. E. grandis likely produces a changing microclimate during plantation development, which in turn drives composition and diversity dynamics in understory vegetation and soil seed banks after the afforestation of agricultural land. The first 4 years after plantation establishment is associated with lower plant and soil seed bank diversity, meriting a greater focus on biodiversity stabilization and possibly longer rotation periods.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				MAR	2014	376	1-2					307	325		10.1007/s11104-013-1954-z							WOS:000331960300020

To measure seed longevity, we performed an aging treatment at 45 A degrees C on seeds maintained at 14 % moisture content for 14 days. We measured the percentage germination of both treated and normal seeds at 25 A degrees C as a control of seed longevity using four replications over 2 years. In total, 140 accessions from a core collection with diverse origins were genotyped using 204 SSR markers, which distributed into 12 chromosomes, to identify marker-trait associations with seed longevity. An analysis of the population structure revealed four subgroups. The r (2) values ranged from 0.0 to 0.8901 for all intrachromosomal loci pairs, with an average of 0.0773. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between linked markers decreased with distance and displayed a substantial drop in LD decay values between 20 and 50 cM. Marker-trait associations were investigated using a mixed linear model approach, considering both population structure (Q) and kinship (K). Twelve marker-trait associations (P < 0.01) were common between the two germination treatments and over the 2-year study, explaining more than 10 % of the total variation. These ten different markers were distributed on five chromosomes. The significant associated SSR markers identified will be useful to seed-bank managers to ensure collections are maintained at high levels of viability to avoid loss of genotypes from the population and for marker-assisted selection.																	0378-2697	2199-6881				MAR	2014	300	3					389	402		10.1007/s00606-013-0889-4							WOS:000330988400001

This study evaluated the effects of different light intensities on seed germination from the soil seed bank from a 30 years old secondary forest. 20 composite samples of soil (25 x 25 x 5 cm) were collected, divided into equal parts and allocated in sowings covered by polyethylene screen of 15% shading (T15%) and 70% shading (T70%), during 120 days. 118 species were found, distributed among 35 botanic families. Regarding the habit, we found 59 herbaceous species, 10 grasses, 7 trees, 15 shrubs and 12 vines. In the shading of 15%, 2.042 seeds germinated (544,5 seeds./m(2)) of which 766 were grasses, 149 shrubs and 315 trees. The most abundant families were Cyperaceae (24%) and Poaceae (13%). Cyperus rotundus (24,7), Cecropia pachystachya (22.4), Cyperus sp.2 (18,7), Poaceae sp.1 (14,4) and Phyllanthus niruri (13,4) were the most important species. In the shading of 70% 3.940 seeds germinated (1,048.8 seeds/m(2)) of which 520 were grasses, 882 shrubs and 613 trees. The most abundant families were Melastomataceae (19%), Rubiaceae (15%), Urticaceae (13%), Asteraceae (10%) e Piperaceae (7%). Clidemia urceolata (27,3), Rubiacaceae sp.5 (23,8), Cecropia pachystachya (22,2), Buddleja stachioides (12,3) e Piper sp.1 (12,3) were the most important species. The decrease of light intensity on the soil seed bank from disturbed areas can ensure the success of spontaneous restoration,as it positively influenced the germination of shrubs, pioneer and early secondary tree species.

J	Golivets, M				Golivets, Marina			Ecological and biological determination of invasion success of non-native plant species in urban woodlands with special regard to short-lived monocarps	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Today's urban green space is exposed to a constant flow of newly introduced exotic plant species, resulting from multiple, intentional and inadvertent introductions. A substantial share of introduced plant species are represented by potential invaders of plant communities, which allows considering that the risk of rapid dispersion by aggressive plant species to be today's most serious threat to the urban biodiversity. Alien plant species with a short life span (monocarps, therophytes, annuals and biennials) are the most successful invaders across anthropogenically transformed landscapes. These species can have a significant impact on the functioning of previously disturbed ecosystems. At the same time, it is still unclear which mechanisms enable short-lived monocarps to invade under specific conditions of urban forest interiors. Therefore, I have conducted a literature analysis aiming at identifying possible biological and ecological determinants of monocarpic plants' invasive success in urban woodlands. The analysis was made at three qualitative levels taking into account characteristics of the urban environment, those of different types of urban woodlands as well as traits of non-native monocarpic species. Considering the city level, the main ecological factors are the high level of human-induced disturbance and propagule pressure on the urban-woodland interface sites. The level of invasion as well as invasibility of urban woodlands is mainly determined by the landscape context, whereas the habitat type, species composition and spatial structure play a less important role. In the forest environment, where competition for light and nutrients is the main shaping factor of the phytocoenosis, short-lived alien species must possess a certain level of competitive ability. These findings indicate that this ability may be due to such traits as high fecundity rates, effective dispersal mechanisms, early germination, high rate of growth and the overall big size of plants, presence of autonomous pollination and high shade-tolerance.

This study was conducted to assess the effects of smoke on the weed species Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyard grass). Plant-derived smoke was produced from Bauhinia variegata using a newly designed furnace and then applied to the weed species. The results showed that plant-derived smoke solution significantly increased the germination rate (70-92.3%), germination percentage (31-47%), fresh weight (30-69%), shoot and root length (10-14.9%, 35-44%), germination index (50-100%) and vigour index (114-157%) of barnyard grass relative to the control. Treatment with plant-derived smoke solution also significantly reduced the endogenous abscisic acid of seeds, while alpha-amylase activity increased significantly compared to the control. Overall, these findings indicate that stimulation and quick emergence from a dormant soil seed bank of barnyard grass can be induced by plant-derived smoke solution followed by chemical control through known weedicide/herbicide treatments as an eco-friendly alternative method of weed control.

Can harvesting for timber in tropical forest enhance timber tree regeneration?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												It has been suggested that the disturbance caused by logging of tropical forests impairs timber tree regeneration, whilst foresters view logging as a means to stimulate both the growth of the residual trees and the germination and establishment of new recruits. Whilst substantial increases in tree seedlings after logging have been shown, there have been no direct tests of whether this initial enhancement is maintained. We tested if the initial response to logging in a tropical forest in Ghana resulted in increases in seedling recruitment relative to unlogged parts of the same forest and whether subsequent seedling mortality was greater in areas disturbed by logging. We also compared seedling composition, density, species diversity and height 7 y after logging to see if disturbed areas differed from unlogged areas. Timber tree species seedling recruits were assessed after logging in 160 sample plots randomly located on skid trails, felling gaps and in unlogged parts of the same forest. Recruits were named, tagged, mapped, counted and heights measured on five occasions spanning 7 y after logging had ceased. Seedling recruitment was initially enhanced by logging disturbance, principally by Pioneer species, but after 1 y Non-Pioneers dominated the recruits. Mortality of recruits was initially greater in unlogged areas but declined over the 7 y of the study converging on that of disturbed areas to an annualised rate of 0.2. The resultant densities of surviving recruits declined after the initial increase, especially amongst Pioneers. After 7 y, Pioneers were least abundant. Species diversity was initially enhanced by logging disturbance but declined on skid trails after 3 y. In unlogged forest, diversity of recruits increased steadily, and converged on disturbed samples by 7 y. Species composition of recruits initially differed between unlogged and logged samples, but showed convergence after 3 y. The initial effects of disturbance were, however, still detectable at 7 y. The results confirm the initial enhancement of timber tree recruitment after logging disturbance which suffered no greater mortality than unlogged areas. Within 7 y of logging, however, most measures of seedling dynamics were similar in logged and unlogged forest presumably due to canopy closure. Whilst most of the tallest trees at 7 y were Pioneer timber species, Non-Pioneers were numerically dominant. We conclude that appropriately controlled logging does not impair timber tree regeneration. The benefits appear to be securing the establishment and fast growth of Pioneer timber species whose regeneration might be less successful in unlogged forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pol, RG; Sagario, MC; Marone, L				Pol, Rodrigo G. yy; Cecilia Sagario, M.; Marone, Luis			Grazing impact on desert plants and soil seed banks: Implications for seed-eating animals	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We assess whether the knowledge of livestock diet helps to link grazing effects with changes in plant cover and soil seed bank size, aiming at inferring the consequences of grazing on seed-eating animals. Specifically, we test whether continuous and heavy grazing reduce the cover, number of reproductive structures and seed reserves of the same grass species whose seeds are selected and preferred by granivorous animals in the central Monte desert, Argentina. Grass cover and the number of grass spikes usually diminished under grazing conditions in the two localities studied (Telteca and Nacunan), and soil seed bank was consistently reduced in all three years evaluated owing to a decline of perennial grass and forb seeds. In particular, the abundance of those seeds selected and preferred by birds and ants (in all cases grass species) declined 70-92% in Nacunan, and 52-72% in Telteca. Reduction of perennial grass cover and spike number in grazed sites reinforced the causal link between livestock grazing and the decline of grass soil seed reserves throughout failed plant reproduction. Grass seed bank depletion suggests that grazing may trigger a "cascade" of mechanisms that affect the abundance and persistence of valuable fodder species as well as the availability of seed resources for granivorous animals.

Modeling loss and recovery of Zostera marina beds in the Chesapeake Bay: The role of seedlings and seed-bank viability	AQUATIC BOTANY												Loss and recovery processes following a documented large scale decline in Zostera marina beds in the York River, Virginia in 2005 were modeled by coupling production and sexual reproduction models. The reproduction model included formulations for reproductive shoot production, seed production, seed-bank density, seed viability, and seed germination. After the model was calibrated and validated using in situ water quality and plant performance measurements from two different sites, model scenarios were run for three years (1 year pre-decline, 2 years post-decline) to quantify the effects of (1) the presence or absence of sexual reproduction, (2) increases in water temperatures from ambient to ambient +5 degrees C in 1 degrees C increments, and (3) the potential interactive effects of light and temperature conditions on bed maintenance and re-establishment. Model projections of 1 marina production following the decline corresponded to in situ measurements of recovery only when sexual reproduction was added. However, a 1 degrees C increase in temperature resulted in a complete loss of biomass after two consecutive years of temperature stress following the depletion of the viable sediment seed bank. Interactions between light and temperature stress resulted in overall lower production and resilience to declines under lower light conditions due to corresponding decreases in photosynthetic rates and increases in respiration. Model results highlight (1) the need to incorporate sexual reproduction into Z. marina ecosystem models, (2) the projected sensitivity of established beds to consecutive years of stress, and (3) the negative effects of multiple stressors on Z. marina resilience and recovery.

Relationship between redox potential and the emergence of three submerged macrophytes	AQUATIC BOTANY												Sedimentation may have large negative effects on aquatic vegetation as burial of propagules can reduce emergence. Burial changes the redox potential around the propagules and this might be the mechanism that causes the observed burial effects. We conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the effect of redox potential on the emergence of three aquatic macrophytes from their propagules. Different redox potential treatments were applied by burying propagules of Potamogeton pusillus and Chara cf. contraria at three different depths and with two different sediments (loamy mud and sand). Propagules of Zannichellia palustris were also buried at three depths, but only with sand. Emergence of P. pusillus and Z. palustris decreased with increasing burial depth, while burial up to 5 cm depth had almost no effect on Chara cf. contraria. Burial with sand reduced emergence of P. pusillus more than burial with loamy mud, while composition of the burial sediment did not affect Chara cf. contraria. The redox potential treatments explained emergence of P. pusillus better than burial depth or composition of the burial sediment separately. There was a strong relationship between mean emergence of P. pusillus per treatment and redox potential of the treatment. Burial caused high mortality of the non-emerged propagules of P. pusilnis and Z palustris within a relatively short period of time. Our results show that redox potential could be an important factor in causing the effect of burial on emergence. On longer time scale, sedimentation has species-specific consequences potentially leading to changes in vegetation species composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, GD; Wang, M; Yuan, YX; Lu, XG; Jiang, M				Wang, Guo-dong; Wang, Ming; Yuan, Yu-xiang; Lu, Xian-guo; Jiang, Ming			Effects of sediment load on the seed bank and vegetation of Calamagrostis angustifolia wetland community in the National Natural Wetland Reserve of Lake Xingkai, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Sedimentation in wetlands due to agricultural irrigation runoff is a significant threat to the conservation of natural areas. Sediment accumulation rates in a wetland adjacent to a paddy field were much higher than in a natural wetland within Lake Xingkai, Northeast of China (0.3-1.0 cm yr(-1) vs. 0.03-0.2 cm yr(-1), respectively), which may create negative ecological impacts to the wetland system, particularly the vegetation community. We conducted a germination experiment in the greenhouse to evaluate the effects of different sediment loads on the seed bank of Calamagrostis angustifolia wetland community under two hydrological regimes (0 and 10 cm water depth), and a vegetation survey in the natural and sediment disturbed sites to investigate the changes of vegetation community with high sediment accumulation. Results revealed significant effects of sediment load on the germination rates in the greenhouse. Species richness and seedling emergence decreased significantly with the addition of 0.5 cm of sediment, and species responded differently to the addition of sediment. The number of seedlings of species such as C. angustifolia and Typha orientalis decreased significantly with 0.25 cm sediment addition level. Eleocharis mamillata and Galium trifidum decreased significantly with the addition of 0.5 cm sediment levels, while Sagittaria trifolia, Alisma orientale and Salix spp. germinated with the addition of 1 and 2 cm sediment levels. The number of species that germinated in non-flooded conditions was significantly higher than in flooded conditions. Vegetation survey showed that the number of species present in the natural wetland was higher than that in wetland adjacent to the paddy field (species richness: 20 vs. 11, respectively), some native species including two annuals (Polygonum hydropiper and Pycreus sanguinolentus) disappeared from the disturbed site. To protect and restore the wetland vegetation community in the Sanjiang Plain, irrigation and watershed management strategies designed to reduce sediment inputs into wetlands may aid in the conservation of these natural wetlands.

This work is part of a long-term experimental protocol initiated in 2003. We tested the effects of various management practices, such as summer crop systems (soybean vs. maize-soybean rotation), stocking methods (continuous vs. rotational) and grazing intensities (low vs. moderate), on Italian ryegrass pasture establishment. In addition, we tested resilience of the system by testing pasture's ability to re-establish following a year without seed head production. The experiment consisted in the rotation, on the same area, of Italian ryegrass pasture grazed by sheep during the winter and up to the end of the grass production cycle, and soybean or soybean-maize grain crops rotation cultivated during the summer. The pasture established itself by self-seeding since 2005. Data were collected in 2011 and 2012 stocking season. The soybean summer crop, continuous stocking and low grazing intensity, all positively affected the production of reproductive tillers in 2011. Grazing intensity in 2011 strongly influenced early vegetative tiller densities (before crop harvest) in 2012. However, none of the grazing intensity or the stocking method treatments affected herbage mass at the end of pasture establishment in 2011 or 2012. On the other hand, the soybean summer crop positively affected pasture establishment, both in term of tiller densities and herbage mass at the end of pasture establishment. The removal of all seed heads in 2011 (preventing seed production) resulted in the total failure of pasture establishment in 2012. Overall, Italian ryegrass establishment by self-seeding relies on the annual replacement of the soil seed bank. This experiment demonstrated that under various stocking methods, moderate grazing intensity and maize or soybean summer crop, Italian ryegrass pasture establishment by self-seeding remains successful even when the stocking periods extended up to the end of the grass production cycle. Self-seeding with moderate grazing intensity ensures successful pasture establishment, reduces labour and costs and allows to increase the stocking period and so animal live weight gain over the grazing season.

Relative influence of deterministic processes on structuring marsh plant communities varies across an abiotic gradient	OIKOS												Understanding the processes determining community structure is one of the major goals of ecological research. Both deterministic and stochastic processes may shape community structure. The challenge is to understand the relative influence of each type of process across different environmental conditions. We investigated the influence of deterministic and stochastic processes on plant community assembly in tidal marshes across a strong abiotic (salinity) gradient in three estuaries in Georgia, USA using probabilistic Raup-Crick community dissimilarity. Our results indicated that deterministic processes had an increasingly important influence on structuring plant communities in salt and brackish marshes, probably due to high heterogeneity of microhabitats produced by the interplay between abiotic stress and biotic interactions. In contrast, the influence of deterministic processes on plant community assembly decreased in tidal freshwater marshes, suggesting an increasingly important role of stochastic processes in plant community assembly in tidal freshwater marshes, probably due to the higher species richness, higher recruitment from seed, and lower levels of abiotic stress in these habitats. At the estuarine scale (across tidal freshwater, brackish and salt marshes in each estuary), our results suggested that deterministic processes also had a relatively important influence on shaping plant community structure. Our results illustrated that plant community structure in tidal marshes is influenced by both deterministic and stochastic processes, but that the relative influence of these two types of processes varies across estuarine landscapes.

M.; Meziere, Delphine; Munier-Jolain, Nicolas			Assessing innovative sowing patterns for integrated weed management with a 3D crop:weed competition model	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Weed dynamics models are needed to design innovative weed management strategies. Here, we developed a 3D individual-based model called FLORSYS predicting growth and development of annual weeds and crops as a function of daily weather and cropping practices: (1) crop emergence is driven by temperature, and emerged plants are placed onto the 3D field map, depending on sowing pattern, density, and emergence rate; plants are described as cylinders with their leaf area distributed according to height; (2) weed emergence is predicted by an existing submodel, emerged weed seedlings are placed randomly; (3) plant phenology depends on temperature; (4) a previously developed submodel predicts available light in each voxel of the canopy; after emergence, plant growth is driven by temperature; when shaded, biomass accumulation results from the difference between photosynthesis and respiration; shading causes etiolation; (5) frost reduces biomass and destroys plants, (6) at plant maturity, the newly produced seeds are added to the soil seed bank. The model was used to test different sowing scenarios in an oilseed rape/winter wheat/winter barley rotation with sixteen weed annuals, showing that (1) crop yield loss was negatively correlated to weed biomass averaged over the cropping season; (2) weed biomass was decreased by scenarios allowing early and homogenous crop canopy closure (e.g. reduced interrows, increased sowing density, associated or undersown crops), increased summer fatal weed seed germination (e.g. delayed sowing) or, to a lesser degree, cleaner fields at cash crop sowing (e.g. sowing a temporary cover crop for "catching" nitrogen); (3) the scenario effect depended on weed species (e.g. climbing species were little affected by increased crop competition), and the result thus varied with the initial weed community (e.g. communities dominated by small weed species were hindered by the faster emergence of broadcast-sown crops whereas taller species profited by the more frequent gap canopies); (4) the effect on weed biomass of sowing scenarios applied to one year was still visible up to ten years later, and the beneficial effect during the test year could be followed by detrimental effects later (e.g. the changed tillage dates accompanying catch crops reduced weed emergence in the immediately following cash crop but increased seed survival and thus infestation of the subsequent crops). This simulation showed FLORSYS to predict realistic potential crop yields, and the simulated impact of crop scenarios was consistent with literature reports. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hedberg, P; Kozub, L; Kotowski, W				Hedberg, Petter; Kozub, Lukasz; Kotowski, Wiktor			Functional diversity analysis helps to identify filters affecting community assembly after fen restoration by top-soil removal and hay transfer	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Top-soil removal followed by species introduction through hay transfer has appeared as a method to restore drained fens. This method addresses abiotic constraints by restoring hydrology and nutrient status, and biotic constraints by removing an unwanted seed bank and counteracting dispersal-limitation. Restoration works by altering environmental filters. Knowledge about the restoration actions effect on functional traits is necessary to understand which types of species may establish. In this study we analyse which factors in top-soil removal followed by hay transfer influence selection and composition of functional traits. Top-soil removal followed by hay transfer from reference sites was conducted at two sites in the Calowanie fen, 33 km SE of Warsaw, Poland. Species and abundance data were recorded for three consecutive years. These data, combined with data on functional traits were used to analyse the effect of the restoration actions on four functional diversity-indices and the community weighted mean of functional traits. Our results reveal a strong habitat filter in the restoration site that follows an elevation gradient. At low elevation this filter selects low values of autochory and specific leaf area and high values of clonal lateral spread, Ellenberg moisture values, and dispersal through hydrochory. The transferred hay differs in trait characteristics compared to the reference site vegetation by having species of higher specific leaf area, lower Ellenberg moisture value and lower dispersal by autochory and hydrochory. The result presented here has three important implications for fen restoration. First, the difference in trait-characteristics between the transferred hay and the reference site it was harvested from limits the restoration potential. Second, since for several fen species important functional traits are filtered along an elevation-gradient, careful planning regarding depth of top-soil removal is needed. Finally the results illustrate how a functional analysis can be used to detect environmental filters acting during ecological restoration. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Soil seedbanks in slash-and-burn rice fields of northern Laos	WEED RESEARCH												Crops in shifting cultivation fields often suffer from severe weed infestation when long fallow periods are replaced by short fallow periods. The soil seedbank as a source of weed infestation was studied in four fields that differed in their last fallow duration. The effect of burning was analysed by comparing adjacent pre-burn and post-burn samples (two sites). Surface vegetation was monitored from burning to harvest in the plots from which soil samples were taken to determine the fraction of the seedbank germinating (three sites). Seedbank size (1700-4000seedlingsm(-2)) varied depending on a single species, Mimosa diplotricha. Burning reduced emergence of most species, but stimulated emergence in others. Densities in the seedbank were not correlated with above-ground abundances in the field, except for some species. Most species emerging after 50days from the soil samples (40% of seedlings) were absent from the field after 190days. Whilst the data from this study are derived from only four fields, the weed problems after short-term fallowing appeared to be due to a larger fraction of the seedbank emerging, possibly due to shallow burial, and to a floristic shift towards adaption to burning, rather than the size of the seedbank per se.

De novo Genome Assembly of the Fungal Plant Pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda	PLOS ONE												Pyrenophora semeniperda (anamorph Drechslera campulata) is a necrotrophic fungal seed pathogen that has a wide host range within the Poaceae. One of its hosts is cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a species exotic to the United States that has invaded natural ecosystems of the Intermountain West. As a natural pathogen of cheatgrass, P. semeniperda has potential as a biocontrol agent due to its effectiveness at killing seeds within the seed bank; however, few genetic resources exist for the fungus. Here, the genome of P. semeniperda isolate assembled from sequence reads of 454 pyrosequencing is presented. The total assembly is 32.5 Mb and includes 11,453 gene models encoding putative proteins larger than 24 amino acids. The models represent a variety of putative genes that are involved in pathogenic pathways typically found in necrotrophic fungi. In addition, extensive rearrangements, including inter-and intrachromosomal rearrangements, were found when the P. semeniperda genome was compared to P. tritici-repentis, a related fungal species.

M.; Meziere, Delphine			A trait-based approach to explain weed species response to agricultural practices in a simulation study with a cropping system model	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The objective of the present study was to use a cropping system model to evaluate the potential impacts of modified agricultural practices ex ante on weeds and to adapt ecological analytical methods to analyse simulation output to identify species traits selected by cropping techniques. Cropping systems typical of three French regions were determined from farm surveys and a French data base monitoring agricultural practices and weeds ("Biovigilance-Flore"). Current scenarios as well as recent and probable future changes were identified in surveys and by expert opinion were simulated in each region, using the FLORSYS model and a weed flora consisting of sixteen major annual weed species. Each scenario was simulated over 24 years and repeated 10 times with randomly chosen regional weather series. The simulated weed flora was analysed with RLQ-analyses and fourth-corner analyses. These showed that longer rotations selected weed species with elongated/flattened seeds; spring crops and late-sown autumn crops favoured round seeds and species with short emergence periods; frequent mouldboard ploughing selected species with thick-coated seeds; frequent tillage favoured monocotyledons and species with a late and/or short emergence period; glyphosate before sowing in direct-drilled fields selected seeds with low area/mass ratios. The identified selection pressures could be explained by effects on life-cycle processes (e.g. thick-coated seeds survive better in the soil after burial, low area/mass ratios delay germination because of slower imbibition). The trait x practice relationships were then used to predict the behaviour of additional weed species in cropping systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Spieles, DJ				Spieles, Douglas J.			Early successional vegetation assembly in a spatially variable hydrologic regime	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Mitigation wetlands are intended to replace the ecological conditions of wetlands lost to development or drainage, resulting in a theoretical expectation that the replacement wetland will support a species composition and diversity comparable to a reference standard. I analyze a freshwater mitigation wetland in central Ohio, USA to evaluate factors that influence spatial patterns of plant community assembly in terms of floristic quality and diversity. Soil seed bank, bulk density, organic content, and pH are evaluated, along with average depth, exposure time, depth variance, and spatial location within the wetland basins, for their relationship with plant community characteristics in the first three years after wetland creation. The plant community was highly variable during the study period, with general trends toward greater diversity and more hydrophilic vegetation. The spatial distribution of nonnative cover, planted cover, mean coefficient of conservatism, and diversity in the third-year plant community were unrelated to soil and seed bank metrics; however, all were strongly related to hydrologic metrics. Shallow depth (<0.2m) and moderate depth variance were found to facilitate plant community diversity, while floristic quality is more likely in deep (>0.2m) and relatively stable water levels (<60% exposure time). Nonnative vegetation cover was particularly high at shallow locations with high depth variance and long exposure times. Geographic analysis of floristic quality and diversity indicates a weak spatial correlation between the two, suggesting that these two measures of the plant community are unlikely to coincide in early succession. The implications are that site design and hydrologic manipulation can drive the early successional vegetation characteristics, and that site design, compliance criteria, and monitoring regimes should seek to concertedly facilitate species composition, community diversity, or both.																	0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 2	2014	29	1					141	152		10.1080/02705060.2013.858375							WOS:000329776400011

This pathogen exhibits variation in virulence that is related to mycelial growth rate, but direct laboratory tests of virulence on seeds often have low repeatability. We developed a rapid and sensitive high pressure liquid chromatography method for quantification of the phytotoxin cytochalasin B in complex mixtures in order to evaluate its use in virulence screening. All 10 strains tested produced large quantities of this metabolite in solid wheat seed culture, with production varying over a fourfold range (535-2256 mg kg(-1)). No cytochalasin B was produced in liquid potato dextrose broth culture, showing that its synthesis is strongly dependent on cultural conditions. In a Bromus tectorum coleoptile bioassay, solid culture extracts showed mild toxicity similar to the cytochalasin B standard at a concentration equivalent to 10(-4) M cytochalasin B (72-95% of control), whereas at 10(-3) M equivalent, the extracts exhibited significantly higher toxicity (8-18% of control) than the cytochalasin B standard (34% of control). This suggests the possible presence of other phytotoxic metabolites. Cytochalasin B production in solid wheat seed culture exhibited the predicted significant negative correlation with mycelial growth rate on potato dextrose agar, but the correlation was not very strong, possibly because cytochalasin B production and growth rate were measured under different cultural conditions.

The Use of Association Genetics Approaches in Plant Breeding	PLANT BREEDING REVIEWS, VOL 38	Plant Breeding Reviews											Association genetics or association mapping (AM) is one of the approaches that is currently being used because of its multiple applications to many crops. Association genetics is useful as a novel strategy for discovery of new markers to use in marker-assisted selection (MAS) and breeding or for confirmation of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Even though association genetics was defined in the late 1980s, it is only in recent years that this concept has been brought into research practice for plant genetic analysis. The efficient increase of data for genotyping and the increase in computational power have promoted the use of AM. Association genetics offers an interesting approach for genetic analysis of quantitative traits because of its resolution power and the possibility to study various regions of the genome simultaneously without the construction of mapping populations. Thus, AM is a useful option for studying agronomical traits; considering that most agronomic traits are oligo-or multigenic with underlying genes of independent inheritance. The principle of association studies relies on linkage disequilibrium (LD). AM offers a high-resolution power when there is large genotypic diversity and low LD for the germplasm being investigated. This methodology was initially applied in human genetics, especially to understand the genetic basis of many complex traits, especially the inheritance of susceptibility to some diseases. Previously, most quantitative trait analyses for crop species were done exclusively by linkage mapping, but now AM offers an alternative that uses raw germplasm or breeding populations that are of interest to seed bank curators and plant improvement programs. AM has been most widely used in cereals whose wide diversity and low LD have allowed fine mapping of candidate and noncandidate genes. In this chapter, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of association genetics and mapping especially in dicotyledonous crops of the Fabaceae and Solanaceae with various genome sizes and reproductive strategies (clonal versus sexual). The main objective of this chapter is to highlight the uses of association genetics in major and minor crop species and species that have trouble being analyzed for QTL with classical methods. We discuss the utility of the approach for accelerating breeding in tropical crops, especially in the developing world.																	0730-2207		978-1-118-91686-5; 978-1-118-91683-4				2014	38						17	67			10.1002/9781118916865						WOS:000364539300002

Contribution of different bud types to community regeneration on a typical steppe under various enclosure durations in Inner Mongolia, China	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Understanding the changes in the total bud bank, and its contribution to community regeneration, in response to grassland enclosure to livestock grazing, is crucial for grassland management. Despite its importance, the contribution of the total bud bank and that of different bud types to community regeneration as a whole have been rarely explored. The vegetative offspring recruited from different bud types was investigated in grasslands having different enclosure durations to livestock grazing on a typical steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. Total vegetative offspring density was significantly higher (p<0.05) under continuous grazing than in fenced grasslands, but no significant changes were found among plots with different enclosure durations to livestock grazing. The percentage and density of tiller-ramets were significantly higher (p<0.05) under continuous grazing than in fenced grasslands. However, rhizome-ramets followed an opposite pattern (p<0.05). Bulb-ramets showed negligible differences in percentage and density among grasslands with different enclosure durations to livestock grazing and those exposed to continuous grazing. Root-derived ramets only occurred in fenced plots. Our results indicate that (1) grassland enclosure to domestic livestock reduce vegetative regeneration from belowground bud banks; (2) enclosure duration to livestock grazing showed no evident effect on the whole contribution of the belowground bud bank to vegetative regeneration, but changed the relative contribution of the different bud types, and (3) while grassland enclosure to livestock grazing reduced density of tiller-ramets, rhizome- and root-derived sapling densities were increased. Therefore, changes in the regenerative contribution of different bud types might be used to (1) predict community dynamic under disturbances and climatic changes, and (2) delineate adequate policies for grassland management and utilization				Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011													1851-5657						2014	83						407	414									WOS:000349881600050

In practical vegetation restoration transplantation of alien species is the most popular method, which will influence the stability of ecological system. The soil seed bank has the advantage ofnatural regeneration, so it will become afforestation materials. In order to enhance the feasibility of engineering application, orthogonal were set with three factors (the top soil thickness, the covering thickness and the number of adding seeds) and three levels. The results showed that: 1) compared with blank tests, the orthogonal testshad improved species richness and density of soil seed bank significantly. 2) the differences between plots in the number of germinated seedlings were very obvious, but in the number of arbor seedlings were not obvious. 3) Overall, the Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index and Pielou index were not high, the distribution of diversity indexes between nine plots was very even, the effect of three in the orthogonal testwas not obvious. 4) The dominant factors of all the three factors was the topsoil thickness, for it determined the number of contained active seedsdirectly, but the specific influenceshould be determined by range analysis.																	1660-9336		978-3-03835-287-7				2014	675-677						1146	1150		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.675-677.1146							WOS:000349279000226

Dunes can be restored to naturally functioning systems to protect human settlements and coastal strips and preserve biotopes. This study took place on the Jai dunes, on the shore of a coastal lagoon in southeastern France, which were mainly degraded by vehicles. The objectives of this work were (1) to define the reference ecosystem by gathering historical information and exploring other regional sand dunes; (2) to find out about the restoration potential of the site by studying the degraded seed bank; (3) to test the efficacy of a few basic restoration actions. Historical information was of little help in defining the reference ecosystem. The description of EU Habitat Directive habitat types and the selection of regionally less degraded sites allowed us to compile the following list of plant species that we could expect to find in the restored area: Anthemis maritima, Elytrigia juncea, Glaucium flavum and Sporobolus pungens. The seed bank of the road was mainly composed of Juncus acutus, which is not a typical dune species and therefore did not have much potential for restoration. Ploughing can therefore be used to decompact the sand road without hampering colonization from the seed bank. Ploughing was only efficient when the following other conditions were met: environmental conditions adequate for the establishment of dune vegetation, and a sufficient connection between the beach, the foredune and the restored area.

Islands are particularly good models for studying the impact of invasive species. Bagaud island (58 ha), which is part of Port-Cros National Park (southeastern France), is currently suffering an invasion of Carpobrotus. A restoration project has been established with the aim of eradicating these species to protect native ecosystems. The objective of the present study was to examine the plant composition of the local vegetation and seed bank (in litter and soil) focusing on (i) Carpobrotus patches and (ii) native plant communities, with the ultimate goal of determining whether Carpobrotus removal is followed by native plant community colonization. A further objective of this study was to help identify the most effective protocol for adequate ecological restoration. Native plant communities found around Carpobrotus patches can vary depending on whether the patch is located on the coast or inland; we can therefore expect a variety of plant communities to form following Carpobrotus removal. Even though Carpobrotus litter can frequently contain seeds of native species, such Atriplex prostrata, Frankenia sp. and Sonchus asper, it also contained many more Carpobrotus seeds (77.6%). Therefore, it is important to remove Carpobrotus litter to prevent large numbers of Carpobrotus seeds from recolonizing after eradication. We conclude that the most effective ecological restoration protocol consists of the following: (i) the removal of living Carpobrotus plants and (ii) the removal of Carpobrotus litter. This protocol can be made even more effective by following it up in the near and mid-term by periodic and thorough checks for Carpobrotus reinvasion.

J	Gomaa, NH				Gomaa, Nasr H.			Microhabitat variations and seed bank-vegetation relationships in a desert wadi ecosystem	FLORA												Due to extreme variability in patterns of rainfall, plant seed banks are an important component of desert habitats. Here I report on effects of standing vegetation and three different microhabitats (channel, bank and terrace) on the soil seed bank of a desert wadi ecosystem in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. A total of 450 soil samples at 45 stands were collected to represent the different wadi microhabitats. The germinable seed bank was estimated by controlled counts of seedling emergence. The floristic composition, functional properties and diversity of the soil seed bank, as well as its similarity with the standing vegetation varied among wadi microhabitats. Such variation could be attributed to differences in disturbance intensity among microhabitats (terrace < bank < channel) and variation of soil factors along the microtopographic gradient. Channel showed the highest species richness and size of soil seed bank, followed by bank and then terrace. Moreover the Shannon index of diversity of the seed bank and its similarity with standing vegetation were significantly greater,in both channel and bank microhabitats than in terrace. At the level of plant functional groups, number of seeds of annuals was higher in both channel and bank than in terrace. Shrubs were more abundant in seed banks of channel compared to terrace. The size and species richness of seed bank were increased with the total plant cover, annual/perennial ratio and species richness of the standing vegetation. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

How hot? How often? Getting the fire frequency and timing right for optimal management of woody cover and pasture composition in northern Australian grazed tropical savannas. Kidman Springs Fire Experiment 1993-2013	RANGELAND JOURNAL												A long-term (1993-2013) experiment in grazed semiarid tropical savannas in northern Australia tested the impact of varying the frequency (every 2, 4 and 6 years) and season (June -EDSversus October -LDS) of fire compared with unburnt controls on woody cover and pasture composition, in grassland and open woodland. Over an 18-year period, woody cover increased by 4% (absolute) in the woodland even with the most severe (i.e. frequent, late dry season) fire treatments. With less severe or no fire, woody cover increased by 12-17%. In the grassland, woody cover remained static when subjected to LDS fires every 2 or 4 years, but increased by 3-6% under other fire treatments, and by 8% when unburnt. Major shifts in understorey species composition occurred at both sites regardless of fire regime. The effect of fire on herbage mass and composition was compounded by higher grazing after fires. The herbage mass of perennial grasses declined and that of annual grasses and forbs increased following early or frequent fires. Brachyachne convergens, Gomphrena canescens and Flemingia pauciflora increased in response to fire while Aristida latifolia and Heteropogon contortus decreased. Four-yearly LDS fire provided the most effective management of woody cover and pasture composition. Although EDS fire is recommended for biodiversity management and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in wet tropical savannas, on grazed pastoral land, it can promote woodland thickening and pasture degradation. Optimal fire management, therefore, depends on vegetation type, land use and the prevailing seasonal timing and frequency of fire.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2014	36	4			SI		323	345		10.1071/RJ14030							WOS:000348699100003

Vegetation and environmental relations of ephemeral subtropical wetlands in central Queensland, Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												An extensive network of ephemeral wetlands exists within arid and semiarid Australia. These wetlands provide important resources to local and migratory species; however, they are poorly studied, particularly in terms of their vegetation-environmental relations. To better understand these relationships, a flora survey was conducted in a large complex of ephemeral, subtropical wetlands in central Queensland, in an attempt to describe the vegetation patterns present, and determine their underlying environmental conditions. In total, eight vegetation groups were identified, with water depth having the greatest influence over vegetation patterns, with slope, assumed to affect drainage, having a secondary influence. Aquatics, such as Nymphaea gigantea Hook. and Vallisneria nana R. Br., characterise the deepest zone, grasslands and sedgelands characterise intermediate depths and a herbfield including many ephemeral terrestrial species characterises the shallow zone. The geography of the wetland-dependant species indicates mostly tropical affinities. All wetland-dependant species present are broadly distributed, with none requiring special conservation considerations. There are no significant infestations of exotic species, including ponded pasture species, that have spread throughout other tropical and subtropical wetlands. The complex of wetlands extending over a large catchment area in the upper Dawson River catchment is in excellent natural condition, and as such, it forms a very important component of the network of wetlands extending along the east coast of Australia.

This study was designed to complement such investigations with novel understanding from high latitude conditions. Four experiments were designed to characterise seed loss at harvest, persistence, viability and capacity for volunteer seedling establishment, as well as impact of management measures on soil seed bank dynamics. Oilseed rape was the primary crop investigated due to the availability of GM cultivars and because of the increasing importance. Harvest losses and soil seed bank development were significant. Volunteer seedlings emerged at reasonably high rates, especially in the first autumn after harvest, but about 10% of buried seeds maintained their viability for at least three years. Soil incorporation methods had no major effect on numbers of volunteer seedlings, but herbicide treatments controlled volunteer seedlings efficiently, though not completely, due to irregular timing of seedling emergence.																	1459-6067	1795-1895					2014	23	4					327	339		10.23986/afsci.41530							WOS:000346131800008

Impact of site-specific weed management in winter crops on weed populations	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT												This work is focused on evaluating the effects of site-specific weed management (SSWM) on weed populations over a 4-year period. SSWM was used on a 3.07 ha experimental field during 2011-2014 in a rotation of winter wheat and winter oilseed rape. The area was split into application cells of 6 x 10 m and weed abundance was evaluated manually in each cell. Four different herbicide treatments were tested. Standard whole-field herbicide application ( blanket spraying) was treatment 1. Treatments 2, 3 and 4 comprised SSWM using different thresholds for post-emergent herbicide applications. SSWM resulted in herbicide savings of 6.3-100% for Galium aparine, 0-84.4% for other dicotyledonous weeds, and 31.3-90.6% for annual monocotyledonous weeds. SSWM led to significantly increased density of G. aparine and Tripleurospermum inodorum in the final experimental year when compared to the blanket treatment. Negative correlation coefficients between 2011 and 2014 plant densities found in SSWM treatments (-0.237 to -0.401) indicate that Apera spica-venti does not establish a long-term soil seed bank.

J	Kucewicz, M; Gojlo, E				Kucewicz, Magdalena; Gojlo, Ewa			Influence of achene heteromorphism on life-cycle traits in the annual weed gallant soldier (Galinsoga parviflora Cav.)	FLORA												Galinsoga parviflora (gallant soldier), Asteraceae, produces two morphologically distinct achenes in a single capitulum: peripheral and central. The morphological, phenological and generative reproduction traits of the progeny derived from peripheral and central achenes that were cultivated in greenhouse conditions were analyzed. Differences between the progeny of various morph types were manifested at different stages of life. The plants of both morph types developed at a similar rate and they entered key phenological phases at the same time except for the flowering stage. The average height of the studied plants was similar on the same days of the experiment. The study showed that plants from peripheral achenes realize the generative reproduction in other pattern than plants from central achenes. The plants from central achenes produce more capitula per plant at the beginning of the fruiting stage, whereas plants from peripheral seeds achieve the highest number of capitula per plant at later stages. Finally, on day 130 of the experiment, the number of capitula per plant of both morphs equalized. At the early fruiting stage, the number of achenes per capitulum of plants from the two morphs did not differ significantly. The number of achenes within one capitulum decreases with plant age in both populations, but the rate of that decline is greater in the progeny of peripheral seeds. The number of peripheral achenes per capitulum in plants from both achene types decreases at a comparable rate. In contrast, the number of central achenes is reduced at a faster rate in plants germinated from peripheral achenes. After day 83, the individuals from peripheral diaspores intensified their reproductive effort; they produced more capitula but with fewer number of achenes than in individuals from central diaspores. On day 130, the number of dispores per plant of the two morphs equalized. The changes of fecundity of peripheral and central progeny with the age of the plant (at different stages of the life cycle of a single plant) contribute to an intensive seed rain throughout the fruiting period. By producing a large number of less fertile capitula with a stable number of peripheral achenes, plants derived from peripheral achenes are able to supply a higher share of peripheral achenes than if they would produce fewer but more fertile capitula. This strategy increases the pool of peripheral achenes. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

It is divided into two subspecies and six botanical varieties. Genetically is an allotetraploid with two duplicated genomes. For genetic characterization of this specie, microsatellite marker would be the most appropriate. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic variation among cultivated peanut genetic resources belonging to the Active Peanut Germplasm Bank of the Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA). Twenty five accessions were genotyped with 23 microsatellite markers, of which 17 were polymorphic. Seventy five polymorphic amplified fragments were observed with an average of 4.41 alleles per locus and a range of 1 to 9 alleles. The polymorphic information content was ranged from 0.15 to 0.58. The value of average genetic diversity was 0.165. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis showed two groups, one for representative accessions of fastigiata subspecie and another of the hypogaea. Analysis of molecular variance results showed variance within and between subspecies.																	1853-8665						2014	46	2					1	13									WOS:000345379800002

SEP 10-12, 2013	Berlin, GERMANY	Julius Kuhn Inst				The European Union handed over the regulation of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) to the member states. Austrian administration started to ask for control measures, i.e. the Ministry of Agriculture and most federal states of Austria contributed financially to a 3-years national ragweed-project coordinated by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna, involving all scientific fields as well as all stakeholders and aiming at: Improvement of the knowledge about the plant to be controlled Development of practical tools for control and prevention of further spread Information of the public and initiating policy makers to install control measures The current knowledge about the biology and spreading ability of common ragweed is still not sufficient. Any sustainable control measure must focus on the reduction of seeds produced by the annual ragweed. Seed bank dimension of ragweed turned out to be a good evaluation tool for any control measure. To evaluate the importance of different spreading mechanisms of dispersal, a need for serious figures can be stated. Based on our seed trap experiments and comparable slip stream experiments by German botanists, the efficiency of vehicles in spreading ragweed over long distances was low. However, machines used by road services (cutter, moulder) turned out to spread thousands of seeds. Besides, there is serious indication that trucking agricultural food and seeds over long distances is relevant for ragweed seed dispersal. Dispersal of thousands of ragweed seeds from contaminated agricultural fields to fields not yet infested is caused by harvesters and other agricultural machines. Regulations to reduce the ragweed load in traded agricultural goods are to be implemented in future. The national RAGWEED-project listed many control options adapted for specific habitat types. Small populations of ragweed should be simply uprooted and composted as long as they bear no flowers. Ragweed biomass sampled after mid of August should be fermented professionally or burned. Based on the guidelines served by the project, policy makers but also single citizens are enabled to convey all efforts to control ragweed in Austria.

Julius-Kuhn-Archiv				Conference on Ambrosia in Germany - Can the Invasion be Halted?	SEP 10-12, 2013	Berlin, GERMANY	Julius Kuhn Inst				The dicotyledonous summer annual common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is on the one hand a noxious arable weed and on the other hand an invasive neophyte with a great potential to spread. Various possibilities are known for control of common ragweed in agricultural fields with mechanical and chemical methods. Limits are set in sunflowers because sunflower and ragweed are botanically related. Because no weed control action results in 100% efficacy, common ragweed can propagate quickly in untreated corners of the field or in other disturbed soils. The legal obligation of reporting and control introduced in Switzerland a couple of years ago allowed the development of specific distribution maps and enhanced the quality of control measures. Facts and figures from the Canton of Geneva prove that the ragweed invasion has been stopped, but the species is not eradicated. The results of Geneva represent the results of good ragweed control in the whole country. Beside agriculture, traffic infrastructure, building sites, gravel pits and urban park and garden areas are sensible to ragweed invasion. This is why the formation of "Ambrosia Groups" helps to exchange experiences and to understand factors provoking the invasion. The responsibility of individuals helps to improve control efficiency even if financial funds are small. A sustainable control success depends on the efficiency to hamper seed production. The reduction of pollen quantity in the air in a long term is part of the earnings for the control effort. Actually, the publicity of common ragweed is fed by specialist information and its distribution in the media. It would be an interesting task to develop in our fast moving era an awareness level comparable to that of the stinging nettle.																	1868-9892		978-3-95547-009-8				2014	445						34	41		10.5073/jka.2014.445.004							WOS:000344904200003

Julius-Kuhn-Archiv				Conference on Ambrosia in Germany - Can the Invasion be Halted?	SEP 10-12, 2013	Berlin, GERMANY	Julius Kuhn Inst				The aim of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the prevalence of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) in European countries in order to reduce the burden on public health, agriculture and biodiversity. This will consist of developing strategy elements for the reduction of common ragweed and its pollen in countries where the species is already established, e.g., Hungary, Slovenia, parts of Austria, and Southeastern Europe and for the prevention of further import and spread in countries not yet heavily infested, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Northern European countries. Laboratory and field experiments covered the germination biology and seed bank behaviour and the impacts of chemical and non-chemical control strategies on common ragweed. Trials on integrated control strategies like increased competition on common ragweed were conducted, too. Desk-top studies on biological control and investigations of the impact of common ragweed on the biodiversity were carried out by associated project partners. Based on these results recommendations for successful control of common ragweed in rural and non-rural areas have been developed.

Characterization of phytoplankton seed banks in the sediments of a drinking water reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The presence, abundance, and composition of algal and cyanobacterial populations in lake sediments were evaluated in Lake St. Charles (Quebec City, Canada), an urban drinking water reservoir. This water body has recently experienced cyanobacterial blooms, and we tested the hypothesis that a seed population of noxious taxa that could potentially re-inoculate the water column was present in the lake sediments. Cores were obtained from 8 sites spanning a range of depth and sediment conditions in both basins of the lake; sampling was from May to October over 2 years. Three techniques were applied: observation of the surficial sediments by epifluorescence microscopy; pigment analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); and laboratory enrichment culture of sediment samples under different light, temperature, and nutrient conditions. These analyses revealed the presence of diverse phytoplankton pigments and fluorescent cells in the sediments, with a predominance of diatoms along with dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, chlorophytes, euglenophytes, and cryptophytes. Growth of benthic filamentous cyanobacteria was induced from the sediments during the incubations, but bloom-forming genera that occurred in the lake such as Anabaena and Microcystis were not detected in any of the sediments, either before or after incubation. These observations imply that the episodic blooms of cyanobacteria in Lake St. Charles were not derived from an abundant seed population distributed throughout the surficial sediments of the lake. Alternative inoculum sources may include localized populations in sediments at sites that were not sampled in the present study, cyanobacteria that may enter via the inflows, or holoplanktonic populations that persist in the water column at low cell concentrations.

Using a set of 32 temporary ponds in northern Morocco we studied the respective importance of local (within the pond) and regional (density of ponds in landscape) factors and the impacts of different land uses on the plant species assemblages, separating pond and terrestrial species. The main hypotheses tested were that (1) species assemblages respond to both local and regional environmental factors, (2) anthropogenic pressure has a negative influence on the number of pond species, and that (3) human activities differ in their impact on pond biodiversity. The results showed that (1) local factors explain most of the variation in plant community composition, and (2) land use impacts the communities through changing local environmental conditions, leading to a loss of typical pond species. Aside from recreation, all other activities (grazing, drainage, agriculture and partial urbanisation) significantly reduced the number of pond species. The conservation strategy for rare pond species should focus on maintaining networks of oligotrophic ponds, while allowing only low-impact activities.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2014	65	10					918	929		10.1071/MF13194							WOS:000344381200008

Effect of Residue Management and Conventional and Organic Soil Management Systems on Crop Yields and Weed Biomass	I INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ORGANIC MATTER MANAGEMENT AND COMPOST USE IN HORTICULTURE	Acta Horticulturae				1st International Symposium on Organic Matter Management and Compost Use in Horticulture	APR 07, 2011	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Hort Sci				Crop residue management (RM) plays an important role in maintaining soil organic carbon (SOC) in horticulture, especially where annual crop rotations rely on frequent tillage. A trial investigating the short-term effects of sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa) residue incorporation on crop yields in a corn-cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) rotation using organic (Org) and conventional (Conv) soil management systems (SMS) was established on 14 December 2009 in two contrasting soil types (Vertosol and Chromosol). The effect of mulched corn residue incorporation on weed biomass production was also studied. Corn was grown under the two SMS and residue was retained (+RES) or removed (-RES) after harvest on 23 April 2010. Cabbage was then grown from 4 May to 14 October 2010, under the same SMS in a three-way factorial design (SMS x RM x soil type). In both systems, equal quantities of macro-nutrients were supplied. Crop yields and weed biomass and apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of soil were measured. There was no significant difference in total corn biomass for SMS or soil type. However, cabbage yield was significantly greater at the Chromosol site. The SMS x RM x soil type interaction was significant for weed biomass in cabbage, with Org having less weed biomass at the Vertosol site, especially in -RES. The +RES treatment had reduced weed biomass by 20 and 64% in conventional and organic SMS, respectively, in comparison to -RES in Chromosol. Soil ECa was significantly different for soil type only. The reduction of weed biomass in +RES treatment could be attributed to the mulching effect of the incorporated corn residue, the differences in weed seed bank and drainage between two sites. In conclusion, crop yields and soil ECa were not influenced by SMS or RM in short-term, but incorporation of residue in soil reduced weed biomass.

In Vitro Methods and Cryopreservation: Tools for Endangered Exceptional Species Preservation and Restoration	II INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT CRYOPRESERVATION	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Symposium on Plant Cryopreservation	AUG 11-14, 2013	Fort Collins, CO					Cryopreservation and in vitro culture of plant tissues are two tools that can be brought into service for ex situ plant conservation. They are especially important for the long-term preservation of genetic diversity of species for which traditional seed banking is not workable. Such species have been termed "exceptional" species, and they include species with recalcitrant seeds, as well as species that produce few or no seeds. The ability to propagate and cryopreserve tissues from multiple genotypes can bring endangered species into stable, long-term storage and provide material that can be used for restoration. Several species under study at CREW provide examples, including Asimina tetramera, Deeringothamnus pulchellus and D. rugelii, three endemic Florida pawpaws that have seeds and have been reported as recalcitrant, Hedeoma todsenii and Mespilus canescens, species from New Mexico and Arkansas, respectively, that are not producing seed, and Crotalaria avonensis and Ranunculus aestivalis, endemic species from Florida and Utah, respectively, for which few seeds have been available. These species also illustrate some of the challenges of propagating and maintaining multiple genotypes, of genotypic variation in propagation and survival through cryopreservation, and of survival through acclimatization and outplanting. However, they also illustrate the potential of these techniques for providing tissues for storage and plants for restoration when traditional methods are not adequate. As these tools are applied to more species, these methods should become more efficient and effective and more widely applied for the propagation and preservation of exceptional species as a resource for the future.																	0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62610-27-9				2014	1039						73	79									WOS:000343888800007

Herbicide Effects of Piper Extracts on a Seed Bank in Fusagasuga (Colombia)	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MEDICINAL PLANTS AND NATURAL PRODUCT S	Acta Horticulturae				International Symposium on Medicinal Plants and Natural Products	DEC 03-06, 2012	Quito, ECUADOR	Int Soc Hort Sci				For a long time, Colombian agriculture was part of the green revolution process, which has created several problems of environmental contamination, deterioration of soil quality and health of producers who handle the products of chemical synthesis. The use of plant extracts of the genus Piper can be an alternative weed management to reduce the indiscriminate use of herbicides, because these plant extracts contain secondary metabolites that can cause allelopathic effects in inhibiting germination and seedling development of weeds, contributing to generate cleaner production and lower cost. Greenhouse experiments under semi-controlled conditions were conducted at the University of Cundinamarca (Fusagasuga, Colombia) in order to evaluate the possible effect as pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicide of five extracts of the genus Piper on weeds present in the seed bank of a University farm. Application effect of Piper aduncum (wood), P. aduncum (leaves), P. hispidum (leaves), P. eriopodon (leaves) and P. holtonii (leaves) extracts was evaluated. In each type of evaluation (pre-emergence and post-emergence) we used a completely randomized design with AxB factorial arrangement with three replications. Factor A was the extract type and factor B was the applied concentration (0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg L-1). In pre-emergence, the germination percentage in different groups of weeds (dicot, monocot and Cyperaceae) was evaluated. In post-emergence, the effect of damage according to the EWRS (European Weed Research Society) scale was estimated. In pre-emergence, the highest inhibitory effect on germination of dicot weeds was presented by application of P. aduncum (leaves) extract (with a control of 59.6% inhibition of germination). In monocot weeds, the lowest percentages of germination were presented with application of extracts of P. holtonii, P. eriopodon and P. aduncum. In post-emergence, application of P. holtonii extracts produced greater phytotoxic effects in dicot weeds, while in monocot weeds, all extracts applications showed a statistically similar phytotoxic effect that was greater than the control (without extract application). Applying Piper extracts generated a pre-emergence and post-emergence bio-herbicide effect on weeds, which was evident but not as strong as that obtained with a commercial herbicide. There were differences in percentage of weed control according to extract and its concentration, type of weed (dicot, monocot, Cyperaceae) and time of application (pre-emergence and post-emergence). It highlighted the effect exerted by pre-emergence application of 3000 mg L-1 of P. aduncum leaf extract in dicot weeds.																	0567-7572		978-94-62610-16-3				2014	1030						77	82									WOS:000343869200009

Sahel Vert: a Project of Centre Mampuya, Senegal	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON URBAN AND PERI-URBAN HORTICULTURE IN THE CENTURY OF CITIES: LESSONS, CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES	Acta Horticulturae				International Symposium on Urban and Peri-Urban Horticulture in the Century of Cities - Lessons, Challenges, Opportunities	DEC 05-09, 2010	Dakar, SENEGAL	Int Soc Hort Sci				Satellite images have revealed that the areas covered by forest in zones of the Sahel near the coast of Senegal have been significantly reduced over the past 50 years. The open forest form of vegetation has practically disappeared. Much of the land in Senegal is unregulated and subject to free collective use. Today the traditional ownership structures that may have made sense in the past have led to overexploitation of land resources and a decline in biodiversity. Uncontrolled land development and the emerging pressure of urbanization from the capital along the coast require that a feasible regional landscape concept (i.e., Sahel Vert) be elaborated in order to protect the remaining resources. Centre Mampuya was founded in 2002 on the Senou hills close to Toubab Dialaw, a former fishing village 50 km to the east of Dakar. From the beginning it has focused on the reforestation and soil regeneration of 50 ha through the extensive use of large-scale commons so as to ensure the biodiversity of plants and animals in the entire region. The hill formations of Senou protected by Centre Mampuya represent a botanical refugium, a kind of living repository of genetic material for both endangered and well established and flourishing tree species. The Centre has become a model for committed people (most of whom are women) in the region and in the entire country. Since this is a project taking place in the peri-urban area of Dakar, in Toubab Dialaw, it is important to mention the situation around the Centre, which is surrounded by uncontrolled urbanization (i.e., a chaotic layout of half-developed plots going down to the sea). This unregulated urban development is the result of speculation on the part of many local and foreign investors and local field owners (farmers) following the construction of the new airport, located 8 km away; it is also partially explained by the proximity of the sea (Petite Cote). Centre Mampuya has become a model for revitalization, agro-forestry, production and preservation of seeds in specific seed-banks and the production of scions and cuttings of endangered wild plants in a tree-nursery. Working together with farmers, the Centre is developing strategies of self-reliant sustainability (www.sahel-vert.org).																	0567-7572		978-94-62610-08-8				2014	1021						367	372									WOS:000343861400033

SOIL SEED BANKS IN LOESS GRASSLANDS AND THEIR ROLE IN GRASSLAND RECOVERY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Loess grasslands are among the most species-rich grasslands in Europe. In many regions only species-poor degraded fragments of formerly species-rich loess grasslands remained due to the agricultural intensification in the last century. To preserve and restore loess grasslands it is necessary to understand, how soil seed banks can contribute to the maintenance of diversity. We studied the vegetation and seed banks of (i) a loess grassland in a semi-natural state and (ii) a degraded loess pasture. We found that species richness was significantly lower in the degraded loess pasture (10.2 species/m(2)) than in the semi-natural loess grassland (27.0 species/m(2)). Mean seed bank densities were quite similar in the two grassland types (22,800 and 20,200 seeds/m(2), respectively). Out of the frequent graminoids in the vegetation, only Poa angustifolia possessed considerable dense seed banks. Forb species having considerable seed banks were mainly disturbance-tolerant species (e.g. Euphorbia cyparissias, Galium verum or Hypericum perforatum). Most characteristic forb species possessed only sporadic seed banks (e.g. Filipendula vulgaris, Pimpinella saxifraga and Salvia nemorosa). Our results suggest that seed banks have only a limited role in the recovery of loess grasslands.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2014	12	2					537	547		10.15666/aeer/1202_537547							WOS:000342047000012

The main objective of the study was to examine if spontaneous fire in the early successional stage of pine forest causes a decrease in the number of species, diversity and density of seed banks, and an increase in the share of species forming long term persistent seed banks. Standing vegetation and soil seed banks were studied on 20 permanent plots on adjacent burnt and unburnt sites one and twelve years after spontaneous fire. One year after the fire the number of species in the seed banks of both areas was similar (11 and 12 species). In the burnt area the Shannon index and the floristical similarity between the seed bank and standing vegetation were lower, and seed density five times higher than in the unburnt area (15 691.5 m(-2) vs.3426.5 m(-2)). This was mainly the effect of the high number of seedlings of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull and Spergula morisonii Boreau germinating from the burnt plots. Twelve years after the fire the number of species in both seed banks had increased little, but seed density in the burnt area (1742.5 m(-2)) had decreased 16 times, while that of the unbumt area had changed only slightly (2875.5 m(-2)). At the same time the Shannon index for the burnt area increased considerably, whereas for the unburnt one it did not change. Our study shows that the long-term persistent soil seed bank plays a fundamental role at the beginning of the post-fire regeneration of temperate coniferous forest vegetation. Germination of Calluna seedlings from the burnt soil seed banks in several times higher numbers than from unburnt soil seed banks may suggest that heat from the fire promotes a loss of dormancy in the heather seeds.

However, the biodiversity of this region is under threat, making seed conservation through seed and/or germplasm banking particularly urgent and crucial. Seed desiccation sensitivity limits the possibility of seed banking of 47% of tropical rainforest species. Thus, knowing if a species has desiccation-sensitive seeds is an important first step in seed banking; however, often resources are limited, making it difficult to determine storage behaviour for all the species in a region. Prediction of seed sensitivity using the SCR-SM model based on seed-coat ratio (SCR) and seed dry mass (SM) might be an alternative for determining desiccation sensitivity of seeds of each species. Here, seed-desiccation sensitivity of 101 woody species from the Xishuangbanna tropical forest were analysed using this model, and physiological determinations were made for a total of 25 species. Seed storage behaviour for 59 species was used for model validation, and storage behaviour of 88% of these species was successfully predicted. Seed storage behaviour of 83% of the 59 species was successfully predicted using the 1000-seed weigth-moisture content (TSW-MC) criteria, which include seeds with 1000-seed weight >500 g and seed moisture content at shedding of 30-70%. The two predictive methods were subsequently used to predict seed desiccation sensitivity for another 42 species from Xishuangbanna whose storage behaviour was uncertain. Our results indicated that similar to 50% of the species in Xishuangbanna are likely to have desiccation-sensitive seeds.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2014	62	4					305	311		10.1071/BT14037							WOS:000341588000004						
J	Kim, SH; Kim, JH; Park, SR; Lee, KS				Kim, Seung Hyeon; Kim, Jong-Hyeob; Park, Sang Rul; Lee, Kun-Seop			Annual and perennial life history strategies of Zostera marina populations under different light regimes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The seagrass Zostera marina is genetically considered to be perennial, but annual populations of this species exist as well and are under severe environmental stress in many geographical locations. We investigated why Z. marina in Jindong Bay (Korea) exhibited a typical perennial life history at a shallow site but an annual life history at a deep site. We hypothesized that Z. marina shoots in the deep population die off after fall due to severe light reductions, and that the re-establishment of this population is completely dependent on sexual reproduction. Life histories of these populations were examined by constructing life tables using monthly measurements of shoot recruitment and mortality. In the deep population, new shoot recruitment was only achieved by seedlings, and approximately 95% of the surviving seedlings flowered. No shoots overwintered in the deep population. In contrast, shoot recruitment in the shallow population was primarily achieved by asexual reproduction. High summer water temperatures and subsequent severe underwater light reduction during summer and fall probably led to the high mortality in Z. marina shoots in the deep population, resulting in no shoot survival after fall. The deep population likely exhibits an annual life history strategy to achieve population persistence under repetitive and acute unfavorable environmental conditions. From an evolutionary perspective, the life history traits of Z. marina would define this species as an intermediate between annual and perennial.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2014	509						1	+		10.3354/meps10899							WOS:000341570100001						
J	Schulze, KA; Buchwald, R; Heinken, T				Schulze, Kiowa Alraune; Buchwald, Rainer; Heinken, Thilo			Epizoochory via the hooves - the European bison (Bison bonasus L.) as a dispersal agent of seeds in an open-forest-mosaic	TUEXENIA												Large herbivores are significant vectors for the long-distance dispersal of seeds in various habitats, both attached to animals (epizoochory) and via gut passage (endozoochory). The majority of studies on epizoochory have examined dispersal in the fur of domesticated ungulates. Studies on wild ungulates are important to understand dispersal processes in many habitats, but rare due to methodological constraints. We studied epizoochory of seeds by European bison in an open-forest-mosaic (nutrient-poor grassland and heathland, mixed forest) in NW Germany, where bison had been introduced for the purpose of nature conservation. At the study site it was possible to apply a method by which hoof material of free-ranging bison was non-invasively collected. We identified a total of 1082 seeds from 32 plant species in the hoof material. The three most abundant species were Polygonum aviculare, Agrostis capillaris and Betula spp. Seed species originated from various habitat types of the study area, while the majority of seeds derived from trampled areas. Compared to the non-dispersed plant species of the study area, dispersed plant species had a higher seed longevity index, suggesting that many seeds were picked up from the soil seed bank. Epizoochory ranking indices of dispersed seed species, classifying the importance of epizoochory, revealed that transport in the fur may be of minor importance for many species, i.e. epizoochory by the hooves turned out to be negatively correlated to epizoochory in the fur. We conclude that European bison disperses a considerable number of seed species through trampling. Further research should consider epizoochory via the hooves and include integrative approaches to understand the different dispersal mechanisms by ungulates and their long-term synergetic effect on plant communities.																	0722-494X						2014		34					131	144									WOS:000341545700008						
J	Altenfelder, S; Raabe, U; Albrecht, H				Altenfelder, Sara; Raabe, Uwe; Albrecht, Harald			Effects of water regime and agricultural land use on diversity and species composition of vascular plants inhabiting temporary ponds in northeastern Germany	TUEXENIA												Fluctuations of the water level at the edges of temporary water bodies provide favourable living conditions for annual plant communities of the phytosociological class Isoeto-Nanojuncetea. Such communities of periodically flooded ponds within the agricultural landscape of NE Germany are particularly rich in rare plant species of that class. During the past decades drainage, fertilisation and herbicides in the surrounding arable fields have led to a severe decline in diversity of these species. To develop efficient conservation strategies it is essential to understand the factors driving the species composition. Therefore, we studied how varying water regimes, soil properties and agricultural practices affect the diversity and species composition of these temporary ponds. The study was carried out in seven ponds on a conventionally managed farm in NE Brandenburg. At each of these wetlands mixed soil samples were taken to determine the pH, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. The plant species were recorded in 177 plots, each covering 1 x 1 m(2). For each plot, the water level was recorded in April, July and August 2013, respectively, resulting in five 'water level regimes'. Total species number and percentages of Isoeto-Nanojuncetea species were determined per plot, to evaluate water level effects on the vegetation. In addition, mean Ellenberg indicator values for light, moisture and nutrients were calculated to assess the environmental conditions. Kruskal-Wallis tests with subsequent multiple comparisons showed significant differences between water regimes in both total species richness and percentage of Isoeto-Nanojuncetea species. Isoeto-Nanojuncetea species established best at sites with fluctuating water levels. Fitting environmental variables to NMDS ordination axes indicated that the water regime was the most significant factor for floristic variation. In plots with a more uniform water regime the species composition was explained mainly by the soil fertility. Farming practices showed less pronounced effects on species composition.

Management of Orobanche crenata Using Trap Crops and Phytomyza orobanchia Kalt. in Broad Bean (Vicia faba) Field in Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL												Experiments were carried out to study the effect of intercropping garlic, celery, radish, flax, Egyptian clover and fenugreek with broad bean and Utilization of the fly Phytomyza orobanchia Kalt. on reducing Orobanche crenata seed bank in the soil and increase the yield of broad bean in fields infested with broomrape. The experiments were undertaken at the experimental station farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University; Abies, Alex., Egypt in two successive, growing seasons 2011/12 and 2012/13. Percentages of broomrape infestation varied among different intercropping treatments in the two seasons. Data showed some degree of natural biological control by release of three adults of P. orobanchia fly per broomrape spike. Biological control by early release of P. orobanchia alone was not enough for Orobanche control. Consequently, use of trap crops with host plant in integration with biological control by early release of P. orobanchia achieved successful control of O. crenata. Trap crop with release of Phytomyza is not only a method to avoid Orobanche damage and increased broad bean yield but also it is a method for decreasing the parasite seed bank in the field.																	1110-1768	2536-9342					2014	24	1					217	223									WOS:000340442200033

RANGELAND JOURNAL												Sticky florestina (Florestina tripteris DC.) is an annual exotic weed that has become naturalised near the townships of Tambo and Barcaldine in central western Queensland, Australia. Three experiments conducted near Barcaldine identified foliar herbicides effective in killing sticky florestina plants and in providing residual activity to reduce recruitment from the soil seed bank. An initial chemical screening experiment evaluated the efficacy of 28 herbicide treatments. The most promising herbicides were then further evaluated in two response-rate experiments. Overall, 2,4-D/picloram, aminopyralid/fluroxypyr, clopyralid, metsulfuron-methyl and triclopyr/picloram proved to be the most effective selective herbicides. Two of these, metsulfuron-methyl at 18 g active ingredient (a.i) ha(-1) and 2,4-D + picloram at 900 g a.i. ha(-1) + 225 g a.i. ha(-1) have now been included in a minor use permit (PER11920) with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for the control of sticky florestina in pasture, stock route, roadside and non-crop situations using both spot and boom-spray applications (APVMA 2010). The permit also allows the use of 2,4-D amine for the control of seedlings only.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2014	36	3					259	265		10.1071/RJ13091							WOS:000340270900006

Proximate causes and possible adaptive functions of mast seeding and barren flower shows in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) in arid regions of Australia	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Mast seeding, the intermittent production of large synchronised seed crops among plant populations, is a phenomenon that occurs at exceptionally long intervals in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) from arid regions of Australia. This is despite the reliance of these fire-sensitive plants on seeds for post-fire regeneration, and that spinifex grasslands rate among Australia's most flammable ecosystems. The proximate causes and possible adaptive functions of masting in seven species of spinifex from arid regions within the 350-mm rainfall isohyet were investigated. Specifically, the seed set percentages of 79 specimens collected between 1947 and 2012 were related to the following environmental covariates: antecedent rainfall over 6, 12 and 36 months, relative humidity, and the number of days above 40 degrees C and below 0 degrees C during anthesis. Given the potential importance of seeding events for post-fire regeneration, it was also investigated whether masting in Triodia could represent a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting, by testing whether high-yield years corresponded to years of increased fire occurrence. Examination of the dataset showed that 43% of specimens contained completely aborted inflorescences (0% seed fill), while seed set ranged from 2 to 69% in the remaining specimens. High levels of insect activity were also found, with 42% of specimens showing evidence of insect occupation. Statistical analyses showed that the main environmental driver of seed set was high precipitation over the previous 12 months, and that high-yield years were strongly related to years of increased fire likelihood. The number of days over 40 degrees Cwas a weakly significant driver of yield, while the remaining covariates were not significant. It is hypothesised that intermittent reproduction by Triodia is a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting, which maximises chances of post-fire regeneration by satiating seed predators during flammable periods (i.e. after heavy rain years). Furthermore, it is suggested that non-viable flower crops after initial low rainfalls may have an adaptive function, by diluting pre-dispersal seed predator densities with 'decoy' ovules that do not mature and lead to the starvation of developing larvae.

Most ciliated protozoa in extreme environments are cryptic in the 'seed bank'	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												This study focuses on the species richness of ciliated protozoa in inland saltpans. A low number of ciliates were found thriving under extreme high salinity; however, a diverse assemblage of ciliate species was revealed by gradually diluting the salt concentration, meaning that most ciliate species in these environments are hidden in the seed bank awaiting favourable growth conditions. In some saltpan samples, up to 100% of the ciliate species found were retrieved from the seed bank. Our results highlight the importance of ciliate seed banks as repositories of microbial diversity in the natural environment, enabling ecosystems to react to environmental change. The ability of microbial communities to respond to a changing environment depends on a large local diversity of rare and encysted species.

J	Ferreras, AE; Funes, G; Galetto, L				Elisa Ferreras, Ana; Funes, Guillermo; Galetto, Leonardo			Interannual evaluation of the regenerative strategies of the exotic invasive species Gleditsia triacanthos compared with the native Acacia aroma in the Chaco Serrano Woodland of Cordoba (Argentina)	BOSQUE												It has been proposed that exotic species, compared with native ones, differed in certain characteristics that may favor their expansion. The regenerative characteristics of exotic species may vary among reproductive seasons, modifying the patterns observed contrasted with native species and hence influencing their expansion velocity. In this work, fruit production, seed density in the soil and seedlings density around the con-specifics and in the study sites were compared between the exotic invasive Gleditsia triacanthos and the native Acacia aroma. The study was developed in at least two reproductive seasons, in areas of the Chaco Serrano Woodland of Cordoba (Argentina). In each season, the number of fruits was counted. Around the con-specifics of each species it was obtained: a) the density of seeds in the soil (in two different moments per year) and b) the density of seedlings. In addition, the density of seedlings distributed in the study sites was registered. In two of the three reproductive seasons analyzed, fruit production was higher in the exotic invasive species. In both seasons the density of seeds in the seed bank and of seedlings around the focal individuals was higher in the exotic species. The density of seedlings in the study sites did not vary between species in any of the seasons. The regenerative characteristics observed in G. triacanthos and the consistency in their response in different reproductive seasons suggest a rapid expansion of the species in the region.

Suburban districts have the lowest Shannon-Wiener Index, Ecological Dominance Index, Pielou Evenness Index. Compared with outer suburbs, the species richness in urban districts and suburban districts have decreased 66.67% and 45.23%, urbanization promotes the homogenisation of species.

Conservation genetics of edaphic endemics in naturally isolated habitats: a case study with Geocarpon minimum (Caryophyllaceae)	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Theory predicts that edaphic endemics should exhibit high levels of population differentiation due to restricted gene flow among patchily distributed habitats. Here, we tested this prediction with the federally threatened annual Geocarpon minimum, an edaphic endemic restricted to sandstone outcrops and slick spots associated with saline prairies in the Southeastern United States. We used AFLP data to quantify population genetic variation and structure in 13 G. minimum populations using a bulked sampling scheme. Modest but significant components of genetic variance are partitioned among populations (16%) and among regions (north, south; 3%). The maintenance of private bands within most G. minimum populations suggests limited gene flow among geographically isolated populations. However, a Mantel test failed to detect a pattern of isolation by distance. Estimates of within population variation in G. minimum are relatively low compared to other edaphic endemics with similar life-histories. Results suggest conservation efforts should focus on protecting genetically unique populations and ensuring that genetic variability is adequately captured in ex situ collections.

Seed dynamics and control of Pistia stratiotes in two aquatic systems in Botswana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The fruiting and seed dynamics of the alien invasive aquatic species Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce; Araceae) was investigated in the seasonally flooded Selinda Canal and Zibadianja Lake of the Kwando-Linyanti River system and in the perennial Chobe River, Botswana, in 1999-2003. The mean number of 30.3 seeds fruit-1 in the Selinda Canal is the highest ever recorded. An artificial earthen barrier or dyke was constructed on the Selinda Canal to allow manipulation of water levels downstream. By drying and subsequently reflooding a region of the stream, seed germination was stimulated, followed by the manual removal of water lettuce seedlings before their seeds reached maturity, which resulted in a decline in seed germination in surface sediment samples from 63.5% in 2002 to 31.7% in 2003. Manipulation of flooding, followed by the physical removal of P. stratiotes at regular intervals prior to anthesis and seed maturity, is considered the most viable strategy for arresting further additions to the seed bank, and could lead to its eradication in seasonally flooded areas where the biocontrol weevil Neohydronomus affinis has become locally extinct since its introduction in 1987.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2014	39	2					209	214		10.2989/16085914.2014.905449							WOS:000338829000010

Development of a thermal-time model for combinational dormancy release of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa ssp villosa)	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Seed dormancy could be a factor related to natural reseeding of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa ssp. villosa Roth.), a winter annual species cultivated for seed, pasture, hay, green manure and cover crop. The presence of combinational dormancy (physical dormancy + physiological dormancy, PY + PD) in hairy vetch was explored by a model using laboratory and field measures. At the stage of natural dispersal, dry seeds of hairy vetch were stored under laboratory conditions at 5, 10, 20 and 30 degrees C (+/-2 degrees C) or buried at 5 cm depth in an experimental field. Germination at 5, 8, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C was assessed at regular intervals up to 295 days after harvest. Following the hypothesis of the existence of a combinational dormancy mechanism, model development was based on the estimation of: (i) the fraction of non-PY seed as a function of after-ripening thermal-time accumulation, and (ii) seed population thermal parameters associated with a given level of PD. The developed model adequately described the after-ripening thermal-time requirements for PY + PD release of V. villosa. Based on model predictions, under a semi-arid thermal regime, >45% of vetch seeds shed during the summer season would be able to germinate during early autumn. Thus, the seed-bank size threshold at the end of the first growing season should be >65 seeds m(-2) in order to reach a minimum stand of 30 plants m(-2) necessary for a productive pasture.

SPECIAL ISSUE: Phragmites australis in North America and Europe Phragmites australis management in the United States: 40 years of methods and outcomes	AOB PLANTS												Studies on invasive plant management are often short in duration and limited in the methods tested, and lack an adequate description of plant communities that replace the invader following removal. Here we present a comprehensive review of management studies on a single species, in an effort to elucidate future directions for research in invasive plant management. We reviewed the literature on Phragmites management in North America in an effort to synthesize our understanding of management efforts, identify gaps in knowledge and improve the efficacy of management. Additionally, we assessed recent ecological findings concerning Phragmites mechanisms of invasion and integrated these findings into our recommendations for more effective management. Our overall goal is to examine whether or not current management approaches can be improved and whether they promote reestablishment of native plant communities. We found: (i) little information on community-level recovery of vegetation following removal of Phragmites; and (ii) most management approaches focus on the removal of Phragmites from individual stands or groups of stands over a relatively small area. With a few exceptions, recovery studies did not monitor vegetation for substantial durations, thus limiting adequate evaluation of the recovery trajectory. We also found that none of the recovery studies were conducted in a landscape context, even though it is now well documented that land-use patterns on adjacent habitats influence the structure and function of wetlands, including the expansion of Phragmites. We suggest that Phragmites management needs to shift to watershed-scale efforts in coastal regions, or larger management units inland. In addition, management efforts should focus on restoring native plant communities, rather than simply eradicating Phragmites stands. Wetlands and watersheds should be prioritized to identify ecosystems that would benefit most from Phragmites management and those where the negative impact of management would be minimal.

The effect of the following in the succession, currently dominant clonal species and necromass on the performance of the brook thistle population (presence, size of clusters and reproduction) was investigated. The regression stage, the Cirsium rivulare population had attained after mowing, was discontinued. Different kinds of influence from the contiguous species on the brook thistle population could be identified. In the case of Filipendula ulmaria and Carex cespitosa, Cirsium rivulare clusters were found to be present on the edge of the dominant patches. In case of Carex acutiformis patches brook thistle ramets did not form clusters but were present among the sedge ramets. No Cirsium rivulare ramets were found in Phragmites australis and willow (Salix cinerea, S. pentandra and S. aurita) patches. The highest number of generative brook thistle ramets were observed in a Carex acutiformis patch, whereas the highest number of inflorescences on the shoots of the analysed species were identified in the patch dominated by Filipendula ulmaria. Experimental vegetation gaps were created in patches dominated by various species to determine the effect of necromass on the presence of Cirsium rivulare seedlings. A considerable rise in the number of Cirsium rivulare seedlings was noted in Carex acutiformis and Filipendula ulmaria patches following necromass removal in comparison with plots containing necromass. On the other hand, removing the necromass and foliage did not contribute to an increase in the numbers of brook thistle seedlings in the patch dominated by Cirsium rivulare itself.

J	Abella, SR				Abella, Scott R.			Effectiveness of Exotic Plant Treatments on National Park Service Lands in the United States	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The United States created national parks to conserve indigenous species, ecological processes, and cultural resources unimpaired for future generations. Curtailing impacts of exotic species is important to meeting this mission. This synthesis identified 56 studies reported in 60 publications that evaluated effects of exotic plant treatments on National Park Service lands. Studies encompassed 35 parks in 20 states and one U.S. territory and included 157 exotic plant species. Eighty-seven percent of studies reported that at least one treatment reduced focal exotic species. Of 30 studies evaluating response of native vegetation, 53% reported that natives increased, 40% reported neutral responses, and 7% reported that natives decreased. For at least some of the neutral cases, neutrality was consistent with management objectives. In other cases, insufficient time may have elapsed to thoroughly characterize responses, or restoration might be needed. Nonfocal exotic species increased in 44% of the 16 studies evaluating them, but the other 56% of studies reported no increase. Results suggest that: (1) a range of exotic species spanning annual forbs to trees have been effectively treated; (2) developing effective treatments often required extensive experimentation and balancing nontarget impacts; (3) presence of multiple exotic species complicated treatment efforts, highlighting importance of preventing invasions; and (4) placing treatment objectives and outcomes in context, such as pretreatment condition of native vegetation, is important to evaluating effectiveness. Attaining the goal in national parks of conserving native species and ecological processes minimally influenced by exotic species will likely require comprehensive management strategies inclusive of treatment interactions with focal exotic species, other potential invaders, and native species.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JAN-MAR	2014	7	1					147	163		10.1614/IPSM-D-13-00058.1							WOS:000333491800014

Management of Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp rotundata in Western Australia	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												One of Australia's most serious weeds, Chgsanthemoides monilifira subsp. rotundata (bitou bush) was recently found for the first time in Western Australia as a well established population in Kwinana, a major port and industrial area south of Perth, the State's capital. This population is remote from other bitou bush infestations in Australia and had escaped detection despite extensive surveys in the same State for the other subspecies that is present in Australia, Chgsanthemoides monilifera subsp. monilifera (boneseed). The main reasons it went undetected are thought to be the tightly controlled access to this area because of mineral processing and port activities, the unusual invasion route via a heavy industrial area and the morphological similarity to a native species when it is not flowering. Two surveys defined the core population of 1038 plants that are spread along the coast over a 25-ha semi-circle with about a 500-m (1640 ft) diameter. Subsequent surveys of first a 500-m buffer zone and later a 1-km (0.621 mi) buffer found four additional plants, indicating that there is considerable potential for dispersal. We concluded that the survey has not delimited the distribution because of the potential and evidence for long distance dispersal. Cooperation by the various land managers has led to all plants being killed, as an initial step to management of this species. Other steps to be undertaken include an awareness campaign in the area that would need to be surveyed for delimitation of the spatial distribution and seed bank assessment to measure potential dispersal both in space and through time. It remains to be determined what is the best strategic response: eradication or containment.

In order to explain this phenomenon and establish an appropriate management strategy, the effects of constant submersion on seed viability and germination of X. sibiricum were investigated at two constant temperature regimes (25 C and 30 C) under artificial laboratory conditions. The results indicated that the seeds of X. sibiricum exhibited a high level of tolerance of submersion and up to 99% of seeds were viable in each treatment regime. The effect of submersion on germination was not obvious at 25 C until the submersion was prolonged for 180 days, while at 30 C the eventual germination rate of X. sibiricum, even after submergence for only one day, was significantly improved. The speed of germination was also consistently accelerated by prolonged periods of submersion. The proportion of seeds that germinated in all treatments combined was less that 56% due to seed dimorphism, thereby providing a seed bank. We conclude that the interaction between long-term winter flooding and high temperature in summer is the major reason that X. sibiricum was able to occupy the newly exposed drawdown area in the absence of competition. These findings provided further insight into how germination strategy and reservoir water-management regime contributed to this dramatic species outbreak.																	1505-2249						2014	62	1					25	36		10.3161/104.062.0104							WOS:000333442000003

To gain knowledge is especially crucial in stressed grasslands harbouring a unique flora and fauna, like alkali grasslands. Aboveground vegetation, seed bank and environmental factors were studied in three stands of the following alkali grassland types: (i)Artemisia dry alkali grasslands at highest elevations; (ii) Puccinellia high and (iii) Puccinellia low grasslands at medium to low elevations, and (iv) Juncus wet alkali grasslands at the lowest elevations. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) Seed bank species diversity and density are the highest in the most stressed grassland types, where regeneration by seeds could have a major importance in sustaining vegetation diversity. (ii) Seed bank density of hygrophytes increases with decreasing elevation, because the cover of hygrophytes in the vegetation increases with decreasing elevation. The mean seed bank density ranged from 30,104 up to 51,410 seeds/m(2), which is higher than in most dry grasslands. Both the lowest seed bank density and diversity were detected in the most stressed Puccinellia high grasslands; Spergularia salina was the only abundant seed bank species (possessing at least 1000 seeds/m(2)). These results not supported our first hypothesis. We detected the highest seed densities of almost all hygrophyte species in the lowest-elevated Juncus grasslands. But, we did not find a significant monotonous correlation between elevation and the overall hygrophyte seed bank density; because most of the hygrophyte species were missing from the seed bank at the medium-elevated, but most saline Puccinellia grasslands. Thus, our results only partly supported the second hypothesis. In total we detected more species in the seed bank than in the aboveground vegetation which emphasises that seed bank plays an important role in sustaining the diversity of alkali grasslands. However, characteristic graminoids possessed no considerable seed bank, except for Juncus compressus (up to 38,619 seeds/m(2)). We can conclude that persistence and establishment of most alkali grassland species are not supported by the local persistent seed bank. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zeiter, M; Preukschas, J; Stampfli, A				Zeiter, Michaela; Preukschas, Juliane; Stampfli, Andreas			Reprint of "Seed availability in hay meadows: Land-use intensification promotes seed rain but not the persistent seed bank"	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Intensification of land use in semi-natural hay meadows has resulted in a decrease in species diversity. This is often thought to be caused by the reduced establishment of plant species due to high competition for light under conditions of increased productivity. Sowing experiments in grasslands have found reliable evidence that diversity can also be constrained by seed availability, implying that processes influencing the production and persistence of seeds may be important for the functioning of ecosystems. So far, the effects of land-use intensification on the seed rain and the persistence of seeds in the soil have been unclear. We selected six pairs of extensively managed (Festuco-Brometea) and intensively managed (Arrhenatheretalia) grassland with traditional late cutting regimes across Switzerland and covering an annual productivity gradient in the range 176-1211 gm(-2). In each grassland community, we estimated seed rain and seed bank using eight pooled seed-trap or topsoil samples of 89 cm(2) in each of six plots representing an area of c. 150 m(2). The seed traps were established in spring 2010 and collected simultaneously with soil cores after an exposure of c. three months. We applied the emergence method in a cold frame over eight months to estimate density of viable seeds. With community productivity reflecting land-use intensification, the density and species richness in the seed rain increased, while mean seed size diminished and the proportions of persistent seeds and of species with persistent seeds in the topsoil declined. Stronger limitation of seeds in extensively managed semi-natural grasslands can explain the fact that such grasslands are not always richer in species than more intensively managed ones.

We used a manipulative field experiment approximating the common natural and artificial disturbance types in this area to investigate the community physiognomy, floristic composition, and 5-year recovery dynamics of the post-disturbance forest community. The results indicated that the landscape and forest structure have degraded into shrub communities, structure-damaged evergreen broadleaved communities, and so on. The post-disturbance communities presented different means of plant recruitment and vegetation recovery patterns at an early successional stage. The recovery of disturbed forests primarily depended on external seed sources and re-sprouting from stumps, rather than on soil seed banks, as few buried seeds were found. Re-sprouting thus appears to be key in allowing rapid vegetation recovery in evergreen broadleaved forest. Disturbances seem to be one of the most important factors that can contribute to regional species coexistence across temporal and spatial scales in evergreen broadleaved forests.

Role of Plant Patches in Preserving Flora from the Soil Seed Bank in an Overgrazed High-mountain Habitat in Northern Iran	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Seed bank is a central topic for plant community restoration. We determined the potential and regeneration capacity of soil seed banks of woody plant patches in conservation of the vegetation in an alpine habitat, since vegetation has completely disappeared in some sites by intensive grazing in the habitat. The study was done in mountainous area of Alborz in Iran. A total of 20 individual shrubby patches were selected and two quadrats were established in and out of each patch. Soil samples were then collected from each quadrat in spring, 2011. Above-ground vegetation was estimated in each quadrat in the growing season. The soil seed bank was determined by Seedling Emergence method in the greenhouse. The results showed that the soil seed bank density inside the shrub patches was much higher than outside the patches. This differentiation was more pronounced for forbs. However, seed density of the between-patches was strongly correlated to seed density of the within-patches, indicating the so-called patch effect. Similarity between the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation was lower inside the patches than outside. This study revealed that the limited woody patches that have remained in the study area could play an important role in conservation of herbaceous and palatable species by their positive effects on the aboveground vegetation and the soil seed																	1680-7073					JAN	2014	16	1					229	238									WOS:000330431200019

In September 2011, the activity density of crickets and invertebrate seed predation were investigated twice in a paddy field at distances of 0, 5, 10, and 15 m from the field edge, and on a paddy levee. The activity density of all cricket species in the field was 2.8-4.6 individuals/trap/day (first trial) and 2.4-6.0 individuals/trap/ day (second trial), with no significant difference in activity density between the examined distances from the field edge. However, the cricket species differed in their spatial distribution. The activity density of Teleogryllus emma peaked at 5 m from the field edge, whereas that of Velarifictorus micado peaked 15 m from the edge. In contrast, the activity density of Loxoblemmus spp., including L. campestris, was higher on the paddy levee than in the field. The proportion of invertebrate seed predation on Echinochloa crus-galli var. crus-galli (23.9-40.9%/day) and Lolium multiflorum (81.098.8%/ day) did not differ significantly between the examined distances from the field edge. Camera recordings showed crickets to be the predominant invertebrate seed predators. These results suggest that crickets can help deplete weed seed banks over a large portion of paddy fields.																	0021-3551					JAN	2014	48	1					63	69		10.6090/jarq.48.63							WOS:000329964100009						
J	Garrison, AJ; Miller, AD; Ryan, MR; Roxburgh, SH; Shea, K				Garrison, Andrew J.; Miller, Adam D.; Ryan, Matthew R.; Roxburgh, Stephen H.; Shea, Katriona			Stacked Crop Rotations Exploit Weed-Weed Competition for Sustainable Weed Management	WEED SCIENCE												Crop rotation has long been considered one of the simplest and most effective tools for managing weeds. In this paper, we demonstrate how crop rotations can be strategically arranged to harness a novel mechanism of weed suppression: weed-weed competition. Specifically, we consider how crop stacking, or increasing the number of consecutive plantings of a single crop within a rotation, can decrease the size of the weed seed bank, by forcing weeds to compete with each other in similar environments for longer periods of time, while still reaping the traditional benefits of crop rotation. Using an annual plant model, we investigate the theoretical effects of stacked crop rotations on weeds that have different life-history strategies and phenology. Our results show that when weeds compete within a season, stacking can reduce the weed seed bank compared to rotations without stacked crops. Although more research is needed to fully understand the effects of crop stacking on other aspects of the system, such as insect pests and diseases, our research suggests that crop stacking has the potential to improve weed suppression without additional inputs, and their associated costs and externalities. More generally, improving management by changing the temporal arrangement of disturbances is a novel, process-based approach that could likely be applied to other weed management practices, such as mowing and herbicide application, and which could involve mechanisms other than weed-weed competition. Leveraging this new application of existing ecological theory to improve weed management strategies holds great promise.

Effects of hydrology on recruitment of Pilularia minuta Durieu (Marsileaceae), an endangered plant of Mediterranean temporary pools	AQUATIC BOTANY												Hydrological requirements for germination and development of P. minuta were assessed through a 5-year field survey in Garaa Sejenane, Tunisia, and an experiment under controlled conditions. The spatial distribution of P. minuta was recorded in the field annually, while the experiment tested the effects of water levels and flooding dates on germination (the emergence of new individuals) and development. Water level was found to be the major factor affecting the germination and the development of P. minuta with flooding date as a secondary limiting factor. For germination to occur, the sediment must be completely waterlogged. Water depths of 5-10 cm are optimal for plant development. In addition, the plant needs a minimal flooding period of seven weeks to develop. Late-spring precipitation appears to be more critical than earlier rains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting time-windows for full recovery of postfire regenerating Pinus halepensis Mill. forests after a future wildfire	NEW FORESTS												A regeneration predictor (RP) has been elaborated to forecast the minimal inter-fire period, required for full recovery (assumed at 1,000 mature stems ha(-1), a typical value for a dense pine forest) of an even-aged, postfire regenerating Pinus halepensis population after a subsequent wildfire, in the future. The study has been conducted in three Aleppo pine forests of northern Euboea Island, Greece. Postfire field surveys of sapling growth, sapling density and reproductive dynamics (cone-bearing population fraction, annual cone and seed production per sapling, canopy seed bank build-up) were carried out for three, consecutive growing seasons (years). Additional postfire parameters, with values estimated from literature data, have been also included in order to devise the RP. In the cases of the three populations studied, the application of this RP provides time-windows for full recovery after a recurrent fire, as short as 10-15, 8-11 and 7-11 years, respectively (values corresponding to best and worst scenarios). It is suggested that in even-aged, postfire regenerating Aleppo pine populations, the minimal inter-fire period required for full recovery can be predicted by monitoring a few selected variables, namely (a) sapling density, (b) vegetative to reproductive shift dynamics, and (c) cones/sapling and germinable seeds/cone, for at least 2 years (either consecutive or 2-3 years apart) at a postfire age of 7-12 years.

Both germination and seed-bank dynamics depend on water availability. We studied 18 tree species, including those with permeable or impermeable seeds, from a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico. We measured seed germination in a growth chamber after (1) dispersal, (2) laboratory storage, (3) seed burial at two field sites and directly in the field, and (4) two rainy seasons. Lipids, nitrogen, and nonstructural carbohydrates were quantified after dispersal and after laboratory or field storage. Sixteen species were viable after three periods of laboratory storage (similar to 3 years). Eleven species were viable after two burial periods in the field (similar to 2 years). Nitrogen concentration decreased after storage and burial in 11 species. Species lipid concentration had a negative relationship with species water content at dispersal and after one burial period, whereas nonstructural carbohydrates showed the opposite trend. Potential and ecological longevities were similar in impermeable seeds. Most of the species studied can form persistent seed banks consisting mainly of species with impermeable seeds that can remain in the soil without degrading their viability. Germination in the field is staggered following natural precipitation pulses as a strategy to stagger seedling recruitment, which may insure against unfavorable conditions.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				JAN	2014	174	1					33	44		10.1007/s00442-013-2753-1							WOS:000329624300004	24002712

In this study it was hypothesized that the long-lived halophytic cold desert shrub Kalidium gracile has a seed bank and dormancy cycling, which help restrict germination to a favourable time for seedling survival. Fresh seeds were buried in November 2009 and exhumed and tested for germination monthly from May 2010 to December 2011 over a range of temperatures and salinities. Germination recovery and viability were determined after exposure to salinity and water stress. Seedling emergence and dynamics of the soil seed bank were investigated in the field. Seeds of K. gracile had a soil seed bank of 7030 seedsm(2) at the beginning of the growing season. About 72 of the seeds were depleted from the soil seed bank during a growing season, and only 14 of them gave rise to seedlings that germinated early enough to reach a stage of growth at which they could survive to overwinter. About 28 of the seeds became part of a persistent soil seed bank. Buried seeds exhibited an annual non-dormancy/conditional dormancy (ND/CD) cycle, and germination varied in sensitivity to salinity during the cycle. Dormancy cycling is coordinated with seasonal environmental conditions in such a way that the seeds germinate in summer, when there is sufficient precipitation for seedling establishment. Kalidium gracile has three life history traits that help ensure persistence at a site: a polycarpic perennial life cycle, a persistent seed bank and dormancy cycling. The annual ND/CD cycle in seeds of K. gracile contributes to seedling establishment of this species in the unpredictable desert environment and to maintenance of a persistent soil seed bank. This is the first report of a seed dormancy cycle in a cold desert shrub.

This study examines the soil seed bank in hardwood floodplain forests of the biosphere reserve Valle del Ticino (Northern Italy) to find out whether the natural forest vegetation can potentially be restored by the soil seed bank. We compared near natural forests of the phytosociological association Polygonato multiflori-Quercetum roboris with stands dominated by the nonnative tree species Robinia pseudoacacia and Prunus serotina in order to investigate whether the composition of the soil seed bank is significantly influenced by the composition of the main canopy tree species and soil properties. Soil seed bank samples were taken from 20 randomly selected plots in stands that were differentiated into four groups related to the dominant forest canopy species. The germinated plants were counted and their species determined. A total of 2,427 plants belonging to 84 species were recorded. The composition of the dominant tree species and soil parameters significantly influence the composition of the seed bank. The similarity with the standing vegetation was very low. Only 13% of the species in the soil seed bank represent the target vegetation. The low percentage of target species and the high percentage of nonnative species imply that the regeneration of near-natural forest vegetation from the soil seed bank is not feasible. Consequently, disturbances that may activate the soil seed bank should be minimized. Thus, we recommend stopping the mechanical removal of the nonnative tree species in the Ticino Park.

Do epizoochorously-induced spatial patterns persist during vegetation development? Does sandy grassland develop, which is rich in epizoochorously-dispersed target species? LocationUpper Rhine Valley, Germany. MethodsA 6-yr experiment on epizoochorous dispersal by sheep was conducted on three newly created deep sand deposition sites mimicking restoration areas with reduced nutrient availability. Establishment success and persistence of ten epizoochorously-dispersed species were assessed and spatial patterns were analysed using SADIE (Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices). Vegetation development of the experimental areas was related to a nearby nature reserve (releves, target species ratios). In addition, seed rain and early-successional soil seed bank were sampled. ResultsAll but one species dispersed by sheep became established and persisted during the 6-yr study. After establishment, most perennials did not change or increased in abundance over time, whereas annuals showed various population dynamics. Spatial patterns were aggregated for most study species. Similarity of spatial patterns between consecutive years varied by species, site and year, and was stronger in perennial than in annual species. Patterns of seed dispersal and establishment were positively associated with each other (a subset of three species was tested). Within 6yrs, the proportion, but not the cover, of target species in the experimental areas reached a level similar to that of a nearby nature reserve; however, many species characteristic of the nature reserve were absent. The species compositions of both seed bank and seed rain were dominated by non-target species. ConclusionsSheep flocks may assist in colonization of grassland species on newly created bare soil areas via epizoochory. The incorporation of livestock into restoration projects might facilitate the regeneration and preservation of threatened plant populations. Livestock might be most successful in promoting biodiversity if they are moved from communities with target species to restoration areas.

The sampling from seed banks were performed prior to rice farm preparation and after rice harvest; also weeds density was determined in three different dates during the growing season. The results showed that the highest amount of weed population was belonging to nutsedge (Cyperus spp. L.) including Cyperus difformis, C. rotundus and C. esculentus species. Nugget/sill ratios for all variogram models ranged from 15.2 to 46.9%, indicated that there was strong and moderate spatial correlation as spherical and exponential variograms models between weed and seedling nutsedge at all stages of sampling. Visual assessments of the weed growth in these field indicated that the weed exist in patches, but mapping results showed that the size and morphology of these patches varied within field. In the present study, seed bank patchy pattern was roughly in accordance with seedling germination pattern. Generally the provided seed bank maps can be used not only as information database of seedling germination, but also for predicting of seed bank dynamics and weed management programs.

Effects of substrate type, moisture and its interactions on soil seed survival of three Rumex species	PLANT AND SOIL												Seed bank persistence plays a highly relevant role for population dynamics. The impact of interacting environmental factors on seed longevity has only scarcely been investigated. We aimed to analyse the effects of varied soil substrate type and moisture on soil seed survival. Seeds of three Rumex species native to different habitats were buried in pots placed in open-air basins. The factors substrate (sand, loam, mud), water table depth (WTD; high, intermediate, low), time, and their interactions were investigated. Viability was tested after 6, 12, and 18 months. Seeds of R. acetosella (dry habitat) were short-term persistent with highest survival in low WTD on sand. Survival in R. acetosa (moist habitat) was very strongly reduced after 6 months with highest survival under wet conditions. R. maritimus (wet habitat) had overall long-term seed survival, where 'substrate type' had the strongest impact. Significant interactions of 'substrate type' and WTD were detected. Seed bank longevity is not a fixed species trait, but varies with environmental factors. Soil moisture, substrate type and their interactions have different effects on the studied species. Persistence-classifications ought to consider the impact of environmental factors.

Thus, it is important to consider what constitutes an adequate sample not only for all taxa as a whole but also for each taxon individually as well as how to strategically schedule collection over time. There are five basic sampling questions: from which species to collect, from how many and which populations, from how many and which individuals, how many and what kind of propagules to collect, and, finally, at what point is the desired sample size too great for a population to bear in one year? There is no single correct sampling strategy or protocol. Each situation must be evaluated in the context of the particular purposes, goals, and uses for which the collection is being made as well as the nature of the sampling universe, the manner in which the samples will be stored and maintained, the period of time they will be stored, and whether the wild-collected samples are to be used directly or whether their numbers will be increased by agricultural growouts. Purposes include providing a long-term insurance policy against extinction in the wild and, in the near to medium term, supplying native plant material for small- to large-scale restoration purposes. The term sampling universe refers to the target taxa of interest: it could be the entire seed plant flora of Taiwan or particular subsets, such as endemics, higher-elevation plants, ecologically important taxa, rare plants, and so on. Plants with orthodox seeds are much easier to work with and are more economically stored as dried, frozen seeds in a seed bank than either plants with recalcitrant seeds or taxa maintained as growing plants.

W.; Berjak, Patricia			PHYSIOLOGY OF DESICCATION-SENSITIVE (RECALCITRANT) SEEDS AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CRYOPRESERVATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) seeds can survive in the dry state for considerable periods and so can be stored successfully at low water content and subzero temperatures. Orthodox seeds possess a variety of protective processes and mechanisms that confer desiccation tolerance, important among them being metabolic shutdown and intracellular dedifferentiation. In contrast, desiccation-sensitive (recalcitrant) seeds cannot tolerate water loss and so cannot be stored using conventional seed bank conditions. Particularly with respect to storage, recalcitrant seeds do not undergo intracellular dedifferentiation nor any significant metabolic shutdown. Embryos of recalcitrant seeds remain metabolically active, with little or no reduction in extent of the extensive intracellular membranes. At the water content at which they are shed, with the ongoing metabolism in recalcitrant seeds, developmental phenomena grade imperceptibly into those associated with germination. Thus, recalcitrant seeds can be stored intact only until germination is initiated, which can range from a few days to several months, depending on species. Mild drying to inhibit germination in storage (subimbibed storage) leads to more rapid loss of viability. The only feasible method for long-term storage of germplasm of recalcitrant-seeded species is cryopreservation, but this requires partial drying to prevent ice crystal damage. However, the response to drying depends on the drying rate: slow drying induces viability loss at high water contents, whereas material dried rapidly can survive (in the short term) to water contents low enough to permit vitrification of the remaining intracellular water rather than the formation of ice crystals, if cooling rates are rapid enough. Recalcitrant seeds are almost invariably too large to permit the rates of drying and cooling required for vitrification, and so excised embryonic axes are generally the explants of choice. This review highlights how the physiology of recalcitrant seeds impacts on attempts to cryopreserve the excised embryonic axes/embryos.																	1058-5893	1537-5315				JAN 1	2014	175	1					21	28		10.1086/673302							WOS:000328679600004

EX SITU CONSERVATION AND CRYOPRESERVATION OF ORCHID GERMPLASM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Premise of research.Orchids are among the most enigmatic of plant species. Yet the Orchidaceae comprises more species at risk of extinction than any other plant family. The collection and storage of orchid germplasmprincipally seeds and associated mycorrhizal fungi but also protocorm-like bodies using encapsulation and vitrification techniquesallows for secure ex situ conservation. This article reviews the approaches and techniques used for the ex situ conservation of orchid germplasm, with a focus on seed banking and the use of cryopreservation techniques to improve the longevity of germplasm.Pivotal results.It is increasingly apparent that cryopreservationthe storage of germplasm at ultra-low temperatures (e.g., in liquid nitrogen)is required for the long-term and low-maintenance conservation of all types of orchid germplasm. For orchid seeds, desiccation tolerance is common, but longevity in storage is poor. Cryopreservation of orchid seeds shows promise, but some complexities in low-temperature storage behavior still require explanation and resolution. The application of more advanced cryopreservation techniques, including encapsulation-dehydration and vitrification, is becoming increasingly common. These techniques provide for the simultaneous storage of orchid propagules with their compatible fungus, while for seeds, vitrification techniques show potential for improving tolerance to the stresses of cryopreservation.Conclusions.A renewed focus on describing the low-temperature storage physiology of orchid seeds to more precisely define the relationship between seed water content, storage temperature, and seed survival is required, as is perhaps the wider adoption of the use of cryoprotectants for seeds. This research, coupled with the development of improved methods of seed viability testing, will support the growing work of germplasm banks to protect orchid biodiversity in the face of habitat loss and potential species extinction.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Merritt, David J/G-9376-2011; Swarts, Nigel/D-9380-2012	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; Merritt, David J/0000-0002-3250-6861; Hay, Fiona/0000-0002-3118-897X; Swarts, Nigel/0000-0002-4527-7658												1058-5893	1537-5315				JAN 1	2014	175	1					46	58		10.1086/673370							WOS:000328679600007

The role of wind in the dispersal of floating seeds in slow-flowing or stagnant water bodies	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWhat is the role of wind in the dispersal of waterborne seeds in slow-flowing and stagnant water bodies at different temporal and spatial scales? (i) Is there a direct effect of wind on seed dispersal speed and distance? (ii) Are prevailing wind conditions reflected in the seed deposition patterns during a year? (iii) What are the long-term (multiple year) effects of prevailing wind conditions on the pattern and composition of shoreline seed banks? LocationThe Westbroekse Zodden (5210N; 507E) and De Weerribben (52 degrees 46N; 5 degrees 55E) fen reserves in The Netherlands. MethodsReal-time seed movement tracking experiments were conducted at different wind speeds. Additionally, we performed a seed trap experiment using artificial grass mats and carried out seed bank analyses using a seedling emergence test. ResultsWind speed and direction strongly determined the dispersal process and the resulting deposition patterns of floating seeds in shallow lakes or ponds. Wind speed directly influenced dispersal speed and distance. Increasing wind speed increased dispersal speed but decreased dispersal distance. Over multiple seasons, more seeds were deposited at downwind shorelines than at upwind shorelines, showing that wind-driven hydrochory resulted in directional transport according to the prevailing wind direction. The species composition of deposited seeds was also affected, with proportionally more water-dispersed seeds being deposited at down-wind shorelines. These effects of wind speed and directionality will have consequences for the colonization of riparian zones in lentic systems and, therefore, also influence management and restoration. In the long term, local seed banks in riparian zones reflected the prevailing wind conditions poorly, showing that additional processes, such as differential germination and predation, also play important roles at longer time scales. ConclusionsWind plays an important role in the dispersal of waterborne seeds in lentic systems and (prevailing) wind speed and direction are reflected in seed dispersal trajectories and deposition patterns.				sarneel, judith/G-5248-2010; Soons, Merel/C-6216-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012	sarneel, judith/0000-0001-6187-499X; Soons, Merel/0000-0002-6130-6359; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X												1100-9233	1654-1103				JAN	2014	25	1					262	274		10.1111/jvs.12074							WOS:000328544600025

Linkages between primary seed dispersal, hydrochory and flood timing in a semi-arid region river	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsAre seed release and hydrochory of riparian plants coupled with seasonal flood pulses for a river with bimodal flows? What phenological hydrochore guilds are present? How representative of riparian vegetation are hydrochores? What is the role of hydrochory in riparian plant community composition in arid land streams? LocationVerde River, central Arizona, USA. MethodsWe recorded phenology of flowering and primary seed dispersal monthly for >100 riparian plant species, seined hydrochores 12 times during the growing season, sampled the extant plant community, and collected soil seed bank samples. Emergence of seedlings from hydrochore and soil samples was monitored for 1yr in a greenhouse. Plant species were classified as to wetland indicator status and assessed for traits including life span, growth form and seed mass. ResultsFlowering and primary seed dispersal at the community level was bimodal for dryland species but more constant through time for wetland species. Numbers and richness of wetland hydrochores were high during the three floods that occurred in the atypical study year, while dryland species pulsed during a single flood. Three of 56 hydrochore taxa were vernal flood specialists, characterized by a spring hydrochore pulse during their period of seed release, and one was associated with summer floods. Another six were phenological generalists, with hydrochores constant or semi-constant through time (including before and after primary dispersal) and persistent soil seed banks. Hydrochorous species spanned a wide range of traits, but overall had smaller seeds and higher wetland affinity than extant riparian vegetation. ConclusionsAs with other regions, hydrochory in dryland rivers is governed by the individual and combined influences of extrinsic factors, such as seasonal flow patterns and hydraulics, and intrinsic factors, such as timing of seed release and seed traits. Floods at different times during the season disperse distinct guilds, emphasizing the importance of flow variability for structuring riparian plant communities. Identifying temporal flood specialists and flood generalists is important, both for informing environmental flow regimes and for understanding patterns of plant distribution. The phenological dispersal plasticity of the generalist hydrochore species allows for adaptability to varying flow conditions and likely contributes to their broad geographic distributions.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				JAN	2014	25	1					287	300		10.1111/jvs.12061							WOS:000328544600027

What potential is there for regeneration of native species from the soil seed bank in Coast Tea Tree-dominated scrub?	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												Shrub encroachment generally causes the loss of native species in herbaceous-dominated communities. The ability of the original ecosystem to return to its pre-encroachment state (i.e. its ecological resilience) will be partially contingent on the capacity of these species to regenerate from soil-stored seed. Coast Tea Tree (Leptospermum laevigatum) has formed a dense scrub in many areas previously dominated by grassy woodland, and hence, managers need guidance about the effectiveness of strategies designed to recover the pre-encroachment vegetation. In this context, we ask: what is the potential of species stored in the soil seed bank to return following Tea Tree removal? A germination experiment was undertaken using soil collected from dense stands of Tea Tree that had been long established. Heat/smoke was applied to soils to simulate the effects of a fire on the soil seed bank, while leaf litter treatments were used to mimic both undisturbed stands and stands where shrubs have been slashed where litter creates a physical barrier to emergence. We found the soil seed bank was dominated by exotic forbs (83% of all germinants) and contained few grasses. Heat and smoke decreased total species density but increased species diversity through the suppression of common exotics. Our data suggest that slashing would result in germination being dominated by exotic flora, but using fire would likely reduce that dominance. However, we conclude that recovery by much of the original flora after site occupation by Coast Tea Tree may be contingent on mechanisms other than soil-stored seeds.

Role of trichomes and pericarp in the seed biology of the desert annual Lachnoloma lehmannii (Brassicaceae)	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												In many angiosperms, the fruit rather than the seed is the dispersal/germination unit, and this is the case with Lachnoloma lehmannii, a desert annual ephemeral in central southwestern Asia with indehiscent nonmucilaginuous silicles covered with trichomes. The primary aim of this study was to assess the role of trichomes and pericarp in dispersal, anchorage of diaspores, and seed germination of this species. Mature silicles are dispersed by wind and gravity, and trichomes not only significantly increased their dispersal distance, adherence to sandy soil particles, mass of water imbibed and moisture content, but also decreased the rate of water loss and moisture content of seeds. A significantly higher percentage of seeds within silicles than of isolated seeds retained viability after exposure to 60 A degrees C for 24 h. Seed dormancy is due to the pericarp and to nondeep physiological dormancy, as shown by the increase in germination percentage of isolated seeds following dry storage and treatment with GA(3). Removal of pericarp increased germination of 6-month-old seeds from 0 to 80-90 %, and leachate from both pericarp and trichomes significantly inhibited germination of isolated seeds. Ninety-five percent of seeds within silicles buried in soil for 2 years were viable, but only 28 % of them germinated in light at 15/2 A degrees C; thus L. lehmannii forms a persistent soil seed bank. The pericarp and its trichomes may maximize plant fitness by determining the settlement location of silicles, thus helping to ensure that seeds germinate during the cool season for seedling survival in the desert environment.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				JAN	2014	29	1					33	44		10.1007/s11284-013-1098-x							WOS:000330641500004

Resilience and recovery potential of duneland vegetation in the southern Kalahari	ECOSPHERE												Many dune fields around the world have undergone alternating periods of mobilization and stabilization in response to changes in wind power and rainfall. However, in modern times disturbances associated with land use are believed to be a dominant factor contributing to the activation of stabilized vegetated dunes in drylands, while the reduction in human activities such as grazing and farming may lead to stabilization of once active dune fields. The Kalahari region of southern Africa has recently begun to exhibit visible signs of dune mobilization, a process that could lead to an activation of aeolian transport in the region with important implications for the biogeochemistry of downwind terrestrial and marine ecosystems. It is still unclear whether the region is poised at a tipping point between its current state (i.e., vegetated fixed linear dunes), and a "degraded'' state (i.e., barren and active dunes). Here we investigate the ability of the landscape to recover from the degraded state by assessing the resilience of duneland vegetation and evaluating the vegetation and soil characteristics. Using field observations and soil seed bank experiments, we show that palatable perennial grass cover is reduced while the seedbank is depleted on grazed dunefields. Conversely, the interdunes generally exhibit relatively rich seed banks. Soils from grazed and ungrazed sites show that plant available nutrient contents are not significantly different; therefore, soil nutrients are likely not a major factor limiting the recovery of perennial vegetation in this region. It is observed that the perennial grasses reestablish on the recovering dunes after grazers have been excluded, indicating that the landscape is still able to recover after years of denudation and that any irreversible shift to a stable degraded state is likely during extended periods of disturbance and/or climatic shifts that promote the degraded state. We also find that changes in grass cover, grass community composition, and seed bank can serve as indicators of whether the system has irreversibly shifted from a vegetated to a bare dune state.

In inland alkali landscapes, elevation is a key factor for understanding patterns of salt accumulation and water table which is therefore considered a good indicator of alkali vegetation types. Remote sensing techniques offer viable solutions for linking elevation data to vegetation patterns by providing an elevation model of extended areas. Our goal was to test the relationships between fine-scale differences in vertical position and vegetation patterns in inland alkali landscapes by vegetation data collected in the field and elevation data generated using airborne laser scanning (ALS). We studied whether vertical position influences vegetation patterns at the level of main vegetation groups (based on alliances) or even at the level of associations. Our study sites were situated in a lowland alkali landscape in Hortobagy National Park (East-Hungary). We grouped the associations into four main vegetation groups: loess grasslands, alkali steppes, open alkali swards and alkali meadows. Even though we detected a very limited range (121 cm) in the vertical position of the main vegetation groups, they were well separated by their vertical positions. At the level of associations, a more detailed elevation-based distinction was also possible in many cases. The revealed elevation vegetation correlations show that high-resolution mapping based on ALS remote sensing techniques is an ideal solution in complex lowland areas, such as alkali landscapes. Our findings suggest that in other types of lowland landscapes, characterised by elevation differences, the applied method might hold a great potential as a supporting tool for vegetation mapping.

Digging deep for diversity: riparian seed bank abundance and species richness in relation to burial depth	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Soil and sediment seed banks contribute to the diversity of riparian plant communities. In degraded river systems, seed banks represent an important regeneration niche that may contribute to restoration efforts through the establishment of vegetation. The vertical dimension of seed banks has been neglected in river research, despite its importance for the regeneration of vegetation after disturbances such as erosive floods. 2. We sampled sediment at various depths within three geomorphological features: bars, benches and the floodplain, across four river reaches in the Wollombi subcatchment of New South Wales, Australia. A seedling emergence study was conducted to characterise the abundance and species richness of the germinable seed bank within these sediments. We hypothesised that the vertical distribution of seeds in bars and benches would show no clear pattern, but that bars would have lower propagule counts overall, due to their non-cohesive sediment and potential for frequent reworking by low-level flows. The floodplain seed bank, in contrast, would resemble that of terrestrial systems, with propagule abundance decreasing markedly with depth due to infrequent inundation and sediment reworking. 3. In total, 9456 seedlings emerged, representing 131 different species (83 native and 47 exotic) from 47 families. Propagule abundance and species richness in bar and bench seed banks were highly variable with depth, with the greatest average propagule numbers found at 25-30cm and 20-25cm, respectively. In contrast, and as hypothesised, propagule abundance and species richness in the floodplain decreased significantly with depth. Propagule abundance was surprisingly variable in bars, with some displaying extremely high values and others containing no detectable seeds, although overall species richness was significantly lower than in benches and the floodplain. 4. The vertical distribution of seeds in bars, benches and floodplains may be determined by the proportional influence of hydrochory (seed transport and deposition by water) during deposition events and seed losses, resulting from sediment reworking and erosion, set within the timescales over which they are formed and reworked. Bar seed banks are continually flushed by frequent inundation and reworking, especially at the surface, reducing seed deposition and burial. Abundant seed fall may be provided by local vegetation, however. Diverse seed banks in benches may form through alternating periods of hydrochoric seed deposition along with sediment, augmented during periods of exposure when propagules from the extant vegetation accumulate. Decreases in germinable propagule abundance and species richness with depth in the floodplain may reflect much slower rates of vertical accretion and seed losses due to mortality over time. Finally, we present some implications for the management of riparian vegetation and applications for river restoration.

J	Gioria, M; Jarosik, V; Pysek, P				Gioria, Margherita; Jarosik, Vojtech; Pysek, Petr			Impact of invasions by alien plants on soil seed bank communities: Emerging patterns	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Much of our current understanding of the impact of invasive species on plant communities is based on patterns occurring in the above-ground vegetation, while only few studies have examined changes in soil seed banks associated with plant invasions, despite their important role as determinants of vegetation dynamics. Here, we reviewed the literature on the impact of plant invasions on the seed bank and we provide a quantitative synthesis using a meta-analysis approach. Specifically, (1) we quantified the impact of 18 invasive alien plants on (i) species richness and (ii) density of the seed banks of invaded communities, based on 58 pair-wise invaded-uninvaded comparisons (cases); we identified (2) the invasive taxa that are responsible for the largest changes in the seed bank; and (3) the habitats where substantial changes occur. Our study showed three major findings: (1) species richness (68% of cases) and density (58% of cases) were significantly lower in native seed banks invaded by alien plants; (2) species richness and density of native and alien species were remarkably lower in seed banks invaded by large, perennial herbs compared to uninvaded sites; and (3) invaded seed banks were often associated with a larger richness and/or abundance of alien species. This study indicates a need for additional seed bank data in invasion ecology to characterize species-specific and habitat-specific impacts of plant invasions, and to determine whether changes in the seed banks of native and alien species are a symptom of environmental degradation prior to a plant invasion or whether they are its direct result. The findings of this study help improve our capacity to predict the long-term implications of plant invasions, including limitations in the recruitment of native species from the seed bank and the potential for secondary invasions by seeds of other alien species.

This bank focuses on the conservation of wild-plant communities and aims to conserve ex situ a representative sample of the plant biodiversity present in a habitat, emphasizing priority ecosystems identified by the Habitats Directive. It is also used to store plant material for research and teaching purposes. The collection consists of three subcollections, two representative of typical habitats in the center of the Iberian Peninsula: high-mountain pastures (psicroxerophylous pastures) and semi-arid habitats (gypsophylic steppes), and a third representative of the genus Lupinus. The high-mountain subcollection currently holds 153 accessions (63 species), the semi-arid subcollection has 76 accessions (29 species,) and the Lupinus subcollection has 6 accessions (4 species). All accessions are stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C in Kilner jars with silica gel. The Germplasm Bank of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos follows a quality control protocol which describes the workflow performed with seeds from seed collection to storage. All collectors are members of research groups with great experience in species identification. Herbarium specimens associated with seed accessions are preserved and 63% of the records have been georreferenced with GPS and radio points. The dataset provides unique information concerning the location of populations of plant species that form part of the psicroxerophylous pastures and gypsophylic steppes of Central Spain as well as populations of genus Lupinus in the Iberian Peninsula. It also provides relevant information concerning mean seed weight and seed germination values under specific incubation conditions. This dataset has already been used by researchers of the Area of Biodiversity and Conservation of URJC as a source of information for the design and implementation of experimental designs in these plant communities. Since they are all active subcollections in continuous growth, data is updated regularly every six months and the latest version can be accessed through the GBIF data portal at http://www.gbif.es:8080/ipt/resource.do?r=germoplasma-urjc. This paper describes the URJC Germplasm Bank and its associated dataset with the aim of disseminating the dataset and explaining how it was derived.

The disturbance dependent small-seeded taxa are regarded as superior colonists, whereas the large-seeded taxa are considered as best competitors able to survive the competition from adjacent plants and negative effect of litter. The impact of character of standing vegetation, disturbance level and size of gaps on spontaneous recruitment of seedlings of selected light-seeded species (Gentiana pneumonanthe L., Dianthus superbus L.) and heavy-seeded taxa (Serratula tinctoria L., Gladiolus imbricatus L.) were conducted. The investigations were carried out in two areas (A and B). Both of them were consisted of three adjacent patches of Molinietum caeruleae: dominated by small meadow species (labeled MC), prevailed by large-tussocks grasses (labeled GR), and overgrown by willows (labeled SA). In the year 2007, in all patches, ten permanent experimental plots were randomly arranged. In Area A, plots were divided in four square-shaped, neighboring subplots subjected to: no treatment; the removal of litter and moss layers; the removal of litter, bryophytes, and above-ground parts of plants; the removal of litter, moss and the plants, as well as top soil stripping. In the Area B, plots were divided into four subplots measuring from 0.16 m(2) to 0.01 m(2). In each of them the litter and above-ground part of plant biomass were clipped and removed. The recruitment of seedlings was monitored from 2007 through 2010. In both studied areas, regardless of seed mass, the greatest abundance of seedlings were found in patches MC, and decreased gradually in sites GR and SA. Irrespective of seed size, in subplots where plant cover and litter stayed intact no new genets was noted, moderate appearance of seedlings was observed in subplots without plant necromass, whereas the greatest number of generative progeny was found in subplots without necromass and aboveground parts of plants. The lower abundance of seedlings in subplots without litter, plants and topsoil might have been caused by depletion of seed bank reserves. Moreover, in all patches the number of seedlings of small- and large-seeded taxa increased significantly with augmentation of gap size. In light of performed studies it might be concluded, that the disturbances might play very important role in active protection of studied taxa. The positive impact of disruption diminishes with increasing of plant canopy height. The removal of plant cover and litter contributes to the greatest seedling recruitment but its beneficial effect diminishes with decreasing of opening size.																	1505-2249						2014	62	2					289	306		10.3161/104.062.0209							WOS:000338092500008

Effects of light conditions and plant density on growth and reproductive biology of Cascabela thevetia (L.) Lippold	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Cascabela thevetia (L.) Lippold (Apocynaceae) is an invasive woody weed that has formed large infestations at several locations in northern Australia. Understanding the reproductive biology of C. thevetia is vital to its management. This paper reports results of a shade house experiment that determined the effects of light conditions (100% or 30% of natural light) and plant densities (one, two, four or eight plants per plot) on the growth, time to flowering and seed formation, and monthly pod production of two C. thevetia biotypes (peach and yellow). Shaded plants were significantly larger when they reached reproductive maturity than plants grown under natural light. However, plants grown under natural light flowered earlier (268 days compared with 369 days) and produced 488 more pods per pot (a 5-fold increase) over 3 years. The yellow biotype was slightly taller at reproductive maturity but significantly taller and with significantly greater aboveground biomass at the end of the study. Both biotypes flowered at a similar time under natural light and low plant densities but the yellow biotype was quicker to seed (478 versus 498 days), produced significantly more pods (364 versus 203 pods) and more shoot growth (577 g versus 550 g) than the peach biotype over 3 years. Higher densities of C. thevetia tended to significantly reduce the shoot and root growth by 981 g and 714 g per plant across all light conditions and biotypes over 3 years and increase the time taken to flower by 140 days and produce seeds by 184 days. For land managers trying to prevent establishment of C. thevetia or to control seedling regrowth once initial infestations have been treated, this study indicates that young plants have the potential to flower and produce seeds within 268 and 353 days, respectively. However, with plant growth and reproduction most likely to be slower under field conditions, annual surveillance and control activities should be sufficient to find and treat plants before they produce seeds and replenish soil seed banks. The most at-risk part of the landscape may be open areas that receive maximum sunlight, particularly within riparian habitats where plants would consistently have more favourable soil moisture conditions.

J	Orr, DM; Phelps, DG				Orr, D. M.; Phelps, D. G.			Impacts of level of utilisation by grazing on an Astrebla (Mitchell grass) grassland in north-western Queensland between 1984 and 2010. 2. Plant species richness and abundance (vol 35, pg 17, 2013)	RANGELAND JOURNAL												The occurrence of interstitial species in Astrebla grasslands in Australia are influenced by grazing and seasonal rainfall but the interactions of these two influences are complex. This paper describes three studies aimed at determining and explaining the changes in plant species richness and abundance of the interstitial species in a long-term sheep utilisation experiment in an Astrebla grassland in northern Queensland. In the first study, increasing utilisation increased the frequency of Dactyloctenium radulans (Button grass) and Brachyachne convergens (Downs couch) and reduced that of Streptoglossa adscendens (Mint bush). In the second study, seasonal rainfall variation between 1984 and 2009 resulted in large annual differences in the size of the seed banks of many species, but increasing utilisation consistently reduced the seed bank of species such as Astrebla spp. and S. adscendens and increased that of species such as B. convergens, D. radulans, Amaranthus mitchellii (Boggabri) and Boerhavia sp. (Tar vine). In the third study, the highest species richness occurred at the lightest utilisation because of the presence of a range of palatable forbs, especially legumes. Species richness was reduced as utilisation increased. Species richness in the grazing exclosure was low and similar to that at the heaviest utilisation where there was a reduction in the presence of palatable forb species. The pattern of highest species richness at the lightest grazing treatment was maintained across three sampling times, even with different amounts of seasonal rainfall, but there was a large yearly variation in both the density and frequency of many species. It was concluded that the maintenance of highest species richness at the lightest utilisation was not aligned with other data from this grazing experiment which indicated that the maximum sustainable wool production occurred at moderate utilisation.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2014	36	3								10.1071/RJ11069_CO							WOS:000340270900010

In order to study the characteristics of soil seed bank (SSB) in Houtai Wetland, field survey and laboratory experiment were conducted. After germination test, the results show that the species richness is relatively low, only 12 kinds of species are contained, but the reserves of SSB are abundant. Its density reaches to7.27x10(5)grains/m(2), maintaining the same level with coastal wetlands. Glycine sofa account for the vast majority of proportion, leading to uneven distribution within species.So the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, Simpson Index and Pielou Evenness Index are all lower than ground vegetation.The Sorensen Similarity Index is 0.330, its ability to reproduce ground plants is limited. The suggestions are that appropriate manners should be taken to protect native plants and soil seed bank.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-912-4				2014	448-453						978	982		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.448-453.978							WOS:000338796300190

I studied the first three cohorts of seedlings that emerged after the 2009 mast year using pairs of plots located under conspecific and heterospecific (Norway spruce, Picea abies) trees. The interannual pattern of seedling emergence did not follow the fruit production pattern. In 2010 and 2011, there was no difference in the density of emerged seedlings among the plots under rowans and under spruces. Survival of the 2010 and 2011 seedling cohorts was higher under spruces than under rowans. Under either tree species seedling survival was not correlated with the density of emerged seedlings. The survival pattern of rowan seedlings in subalpine spruce forest seems to follow the Janzen-Connell model in temperate forest.

Kevin			Fine-scale variation in surface fire environment and legume germination in the longleaf pine ecosystem	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Fine-scale heterogeneity in fuels influences fire behavior and, in turn, may influence patterns of plant recruitment and regeneration from soil seed banks. In particular, hard-seeded species, such as many members of the plant family Fabaceae, may experience differential germination and mortality rates as a result of heterogeneous fire intensities mediated by variable distribution of fine and coarse fuels. Post-fire germination was examined for nine legume species native to longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stands of the southeastern United States in response to fuel variation using a paired laboratory and field study. For both studies, fine fuel loads (longleaf pine needles) and coarse fuels (longleaf pine cones) were manipulated. Germination of seven species was assessed for four months in the field following experimental burns of small plots. Germination and mortality were assessed for six species after exposure to experimental laboratory fires. Burning reduced germination compared to unburned controls in both studies. Furthermore, legumes exposed to burning pine cones experienced greater reductions in germination than when exposed to burning pine needles alone. Manipulation of fine fuel loads did not affect germination in either study. Results suggest that small pieces of coarse woody debris are responsible for differential germination following fire, rather than variation in fine fuels. We present a conceptual model of fine-scale fire effects to explain how long-duration smoldering creates localized mortality events that may drive variation in recruitment from the soil seed bank for longleaf pine ecosystems.

We studied effects of inter-seasonal and inter-year rainfall variation on the dynamics of regenerative successional communities of a tropical dry forest in Mexico. We emphasized the effects caused by the severe El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurred in 2005. We established permanent plots in sites representing a chronosequence of Pasture (abandoned pastures, 0-1 years fallow age), Early (3-5), Intermediate (8-12), and Old-Growth Forest categories (n = 3 per category). In total, 8210 shrubs and trees 10 to 100-cm height were identified, measured, and monitored over four years. Rates of plant recruitment, growth and mortality, and gain and loss of species were quantified per season (dry vs. rainy), year, and successional category, considering whole communities and separating seedlings from sprouts and shrubs from trees. Community rates changed with rainfall variation without almost any effect of successional stage. Mortality and species loss rates peaked during the ENSO year and the following year; however, after two rainy years mortality peaked in the rainy season. Such changes could result from the severe drought in the ENSO year, and of the outbreak of biotic agents during the following rainy years. Growth, recruitment and species gain rates were higher in the rainy season but they were significantly reduced after the ENSO year. Seedlings exhibited higher recruitment and mortality rate than sprouts, and shrubs showed higher recruitment than trees. ENSO strongly impacted both the dynamics and trajectory of succession, creating transient fluctuations in the abundance and species richness of the communities. Overall, there was a net decline in plant and species density in most successional stages along the years. Therefore, strong drought events have critical consequences for regeneration dynamics, delaying the successional process and modifying the resilience of these systems.

Genetic characterization of sunflower breeding resources from Argentina: assessing diversity in key open-pollinated and composite populations	PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												Open-pollinated (OPs) and composite populations (CPs) represent a valuable resource for sunflower breeding programmes. However, little is known about the levels and distribution of genetic variation within each of these populations. In this study, quantitative and qualitative traits along with molecular markers were used to evaluate 14 populations from the Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA) sunflower germplasm collection. These populations were chosen to represent historically important accessions that still play a central role within the INTA sunflower breeding programme due to their extensive variation in diverse agronomically important traits. Nine quantitative and eight qualitative agro-morphological descriptors were recorded and compared with those of a larger set of accessions representative of the phenotypic diversity of the sunflower collection. Molecular characterization was conducted on a total of 311 individuals using 16 microsatellite markers. Overall, the average gene diversity was 0.56 and the average number of alleles per locus was 6.25. No statistically significant differences in genetic diversity were detected between the OPs and CPs. Global estimates of FST revealed very high levels of differentiation among accessions (F-ST 0.413, P < 0.05). Population structure analyses were consistent with the observed levels of differentiation and identified two major groups. The results of this work show that high global diversity is preserved within the accessions analysed here. Additionally, this study provides a set of reliable and discriminant markers for the cost-effective molecular characterization of sunflower accessions, along with the guidelines for the delineation of sampling strategies for OPs and CPs, thus aiding the efficient management and exploitation of sunflower germplasm collections.

The lowest selected dose of 1 kg.ha(-1) reduced the germination of glomerules by 39.5 %, while the dual treatment with this regulator at a dose of 5 + 5 kg.ha(-1) causes a reduction in germination by 79.9 %. The most effective application term is in weed beet growth stage BBCH 54. The Roundup herbicide applied to weed beet in the growth stage BBCH 67 had no influence on germination of glomerules and caused plant maturation. With increasing dose of Fazor decreases the number of glomerules produced by weed beets decreases. The negative feature of this product is reduction of the yield of sugar beet tubers.																	1210-3306					DEC	2013	129	12					369	373									WOS:000328701500002

The seed bank in soil from the nests of grassland ants in a unique limestone grassland community in Ireland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The seed content of nest soil of four species of ants Myrmica sabuleti, Lasius flavus, L. niger and Formica lemani was investigated in the semi-natural limestone grassland of the Burren, western Ireland. On-nest and off-nest soil samples were compared to determine whether ants promote plant species richness. Samples were collected, monthly, from May to September 2006 from the top 50 mm of soil from 10 nests of each species, and from adjacent off-nest grassland soil (total 400 samples). After collection a total of 42 seed species were germinated and identified. L. flavus (both on-nest and off-nest samples) had the highest seed species richness of which 10 species had a high seedling representation (% affinity) for the nest of this species. Persicaria maculosa and Viola tricolour had a high percent affinity for the nests of L. niger, and these were significantly higher on the nest compared to the off-nest samples. Anagallis arvensis and Cerastium holosteoides also had significantly higher percent affinity for the nests of F. lemani. No species was associated with M. sabuleti. The high richness of seedling species associated with Lasius nests may be due to the specialised vegetation on the nest or ant activity. Since L. niger, F. lemani and M. sabuleti nest under stones it is likely that the seeds may be collected by ant activity. Although previously reported for L. flavus, the unique seed banks of the ant nests can account for localised mosaic patches of different vegetation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ficken, CD; Menges, E				Ficken, Cari D.; Menges, Eric			Seasonal wetlands on the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida: does a relict seed bank persist despite long term disturbance?	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wetlands maintain biodiversity and provide numerous ecosystem services, so the pressure to perform successful restoration consequently is high. However, restoration projects rarely include an in-depth assessment of wetland potential for recovery, and restoration techniques may not be tailored to site-specific concerns. This study examined the seed bank of disturbed wetlands slotted for hydrologic, but not vegetation, restoration to determine if a seed bank comparable to that of nearby undisturbed wetlands persisted despite long-term anthropogenic disturbance. We compared the aboveground vegetation and seed bank compositions under drained, drawdown, and flooded conditions between undisturbed and historically ditched ("disturbed") wetlands. Disturbed and undisturbed wetlands shared fewer than 30 % of total aboveground species. While undisturbed wetlands were dominated by graminoids, disturbed wetlands had greater cover of forbs. The seed banks of disturbed wetlands had high species diversity, but their composition was dissimilar to that of nearby undisturbed wetlands. In total, the seed banks of both disturbance histories germinated 56 species; drained conditions had the fewest germinants while flooded conditions had the most. Germinant richness was significantly affected by disturbance, moisture, and their interaction; evenness was significantly affected by moisture, and Shannon diversity by disturbance. Because the seed bank of disturbed wetlands included many fast-growing wetland plants, passive vegetation restoration and active hydrologic restoration may result in wetlands overgrown with weedy species and with fewer conservative wetland plants. An understanding of the capacity for seed banks to re-vegetate wetlands post-restoration and approximate undisturbed wetlands is crucial to the overall success of restoration projects.

Actual and Potential Use of Population Viability Analyses in Recovery of Plant Species Listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Use of population viability analyses (PVAs) in endangered species recovery planning has been met with both support and criticism. Previous reviews promote use of PVA for setting scientifically based, measurable, and objective recovery criteria and recommend improvements to increase the framework's utility. However, others have questioned the value of PVA models for setting recovery criteria and assert that PVAs are more appropriate for understanding relative trade-offs between alternative management actions. We reviewed 258 final recovery plans for 642 plants listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act to determine the number of plans that used or recommended PVA in recovery planning. We also reviewed 223 publications that describe plant PVAs to assess how these models were designed and whether those designs reflected previous recommendations for improvement of PVAs. Twenty-four percent of listed species had recovery plans that used or recommended PVA. In publications, the typical model was a matrix population model parameterized with 5 years of demographic data that did not consider stochasticity, genetics, density dependence, seed banks, vegetative reproduction, dormancy, threats, or management strategies. Population growth rates for different populations of the same species or for the same population at different points in time were often statistically different or varied by >10%. Therefore, PVAs parameterized with underlying vital rates that vary to this degree may not accurately predict recovery objectives across a species' entire distribution or over longer time scales. We assert that PVA, although an important tool as part of an adaptive-management program, can help to determine quantitative recovery criteria only if more long-term data sets that capture spatiotemporal variability in vital rates become available. Lacking this, there is a strong need for viable and comprehensive methods for determining quantitative, science-based recovery criteria for endangered species with minimal data availability.

J	Zaghloul, M; Reisch, C; Poschlod, P				Zaghloul, Mohamed; Reisch, Christoph; Poschlod, Peter			Soil seed bank contributes significantly to genetic variation of Hypericum sinaicum in a changing environment	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												The contribution of soil seed bank of a desert endemic plant species in maintaining genetic diversity has been addressed in this paper through investigating the differences in genetic diversity and structure (using AFLP markers) between plants grown from soil seed bank and standing crop plants within and among five populations of H. sinaicum growing at St. Katherine Protectorate, southern Sinai, Egypt. Standard genetic diversity measures showed that the molecular variation within and among populations was highly significantly different between standing crop and soil seed bank. While soil seed bank had lower genetic diversity than standing crop populations, pooling soil seed bank with standing crop samples resulted in higher diversity. The results revealed also that soil seed bank had lower differentiation (7 %) than among populations of the standing crop (18 %). Results of neighbor-joining, Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analysis showed that soil seed banks had a separate gene pool different from standing crop. The study came to the conclusion that the genetic variation of the soil seed bank contributes significantly to the genetic variation of the species. This also stresses the importance of elucidating the genetic diversity and structure of the soil seed bank for any sound and long-term conservation efforts for desert species. These have been growing in small-size populations for a long time that any estimates gained only from aboveground sampling of populations may be ambiguous.

Management history affects grassland seed bank build-up	PLANT ECOLOGY												Disturbance in the form of different management regimes affects established vegetation, but how the same management affects the corresponding seed banks is poorly understood. We used the seedling emergence method to investigate how present and previous management intensity impacts the dynamics of established vegetation and corresponding seed bank in six semi-natural grasslands (three pastures and three road verges) in W Norway. The increased management intensity reduced seed bank species richness but increased seedling density and the fraction of species with a persistent seed bank. Higher intensity also increased the components' floristic similarity, probably through formation of gaps where seeds may germinate. Moreover, the seed bank responded in parallel with the established vegetation to underlying environmental variables as well as to management intensity. Management intensity hence impacted directly on many aspects of seed bank-established vegetation relationships, and controlled established vegetation partly through seed bank dynamics involving both temporal and spatial dispersal.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				DEC	2013	214	12					1467	1477		10.1007/s11258-013-0267-x							WOS:000327093200006						
J	Yan, QL; Zhu, JJ; Gang, Q				Yan, Qiaoling; Zhu, Jiaojun; Gang, Qun			Comparison of spatial patterns of soil seed banks between larch plantations and adjacent secondary forests in Northeast China: implication for spatial distribution of larch plantations	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												In response to increasing timber demands, the natural secondary forest (NSF) is largely converted to larch plantation (LP) in Northeast China. However, it causes a series of problems such as mono-species composition, declined soil fertility and unsustainable productivity. On the other hand, it brings a great challenge for the forest managers to answer how to keep the LP with higher natural regeneration capability and how to change the pure plantations into mixed forests with more complex stand structures. Two typical spatial distribution patterns of LP within the NSF ecosystem, i.e., the Contour Type (CT, NSF and LP locating at the same slope position and aspect) and the Up-and-Down Type (UDT, LP locating at the down slope of adjacent NSF in the same aspect) were selected. The objectives of this study were to find out the optimal spatial distribution type of the LP to improve the regeneration potential (i.e., seeds in the soil stock) and the possibility inducing them into larch-broadleaved mixed forests. The spatial patterns of seed bank along the transects with the NSF-boundary-LP gradient were compared between CT and UDT. We found that in the CT stands, seed density of all species varied as a quadratic curve from NSF to LP and the largest seed density occurred at the boundary; for the dominant tree species in NSF, seed density of Fraxinus rhynchophylla tended to decrease logarithmically from NSF to LP and the seeds could only appear at 4 m away from the boundary in LP; litter depth was closely correlated with seed density and species richness in seed bank. In the UDT stands, seed density of all species tended to increase linearly from NSF to LP, and seed density in LP was 1.95 times higher than that in NSF significantly; seed densities of F. rhynchophylla and Acer mono increased as a quadratic curve from NSF to LP; the canopy openness was linearly correlated with seed density. Our results indicated that the establishment of the Up (NSF)-and-Down (LP) Type of stands could be more feasible for seed invasion. Comparative studies on the patterns of seed banks across the two spatial distribution types of larch plantations within the secondary forest ecosystem may provide some new insights into the tending measures on the LP management.

In barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) we investigated how fatal germination was influenced by the depth and time of seed burial. The proportion of germinated seeds decreased with burial depth to 0-20% at >= 0.1 in depth which is fatal for seedling establishment. The percentage of fatal germination was greater for the seeds buried during the spring season than during autumn. Germination was influenced by seed pre-treatment, after ripening or stratification. Spring ploughing of non-dormant seeds below 0.1 in depth induces fatal germination, decreasing in this way seed bank of barnyardgrass.																	1212-2580	1805-9341				DEC	2013	49	4					193	197		10.17221/18/2013-PPS							WOS:000326146300006

FIRE STRUCTURES PINE SEROTINY AT DIFFERENT SCALES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: Serotiny (delayed seed release with the consequent accumulation of a canopy seedbank) confers fitness benefits in environments with crown-fire regimes. Thus, we predicted that serotiny level should be higher in populations recurrently subjected to crown-fires than in populations where crown-fires are rare. In addition, under a high frequency of fires, space and resources are recurrently available, permitting recruitment around each mother to follow the seed rain shadow. Thus, we also predicted spatial aggregation of serotiny within populations. Methods: We compared serotiny, considering both the proportion and the age of serotinous cones, in populations living in contrasting fire regimes for two iconic Mediterranean pine species (Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster). We framed our results by quantitatively comparing the strength of the fire-serotiny relationship with previous studies worldwide. Key results: For the two species, populations living under high crown-fire recurrence regimes had a higher serotiny level than those populations where the recurrence of crown-fires was low. For P. halepensis (the species with higher serotiny), populations in high fire recurrence regimes had higher fine-scale spatial aggregation of serotiny than those inhabiting low fire recurrence systems. The strength of the observed fire-serotiny relationship in P. halepensis is among the highest in published literature. Conclusions: Fire regime shapes serotiny level among populations, and in populations with high serotiny, recurrent fires maintain a significant spatial structure for this trait. Consequently, fire has long-term evolutionary implications at different scales, emphasizing its prominent role in shaping the ecology of pines.

The principal donors of these alleles are Norin 10', Seu Seun 27' and Suwon 92' that, according to historical records, inherited semidwarfism from the Japanese landrace Daruma'. The objective of this study was to examine the origins of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b by growing multiple seed bank sources of cultivars comprising the historical pedigrees of the principal donor lines and scoring Rht-1 genotype and plant height. This revealed that Norin 10' and Suwon 92' sources contained Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, but the Seu Seun 27' source did not contain a semidwarf allele. Neither Rht-B1b nor Rht-D1b could be definitively traced back to Daruma', and both Daruma' sources contained only Rht-B1b. However, Daruma' remains the most likely donor of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b. We suggest that the disparity between historical pedigrees and Rht-1 genotypes occurs because the genetic make-up of seed bank sources differs from that of the cultivars actually used in the pedigrees. Some evidence also suggests that an alternative Rht-D1b donor may exist.

Maternal effects and embryo genetics: germination and dormancy of crop-wild sunflower hybrids	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Gene flow between agricultural crops and related wild plant populations can produce hybrids which differ significantly from their wild counterparts in many life history traits, including seed traits. Seeds from wild annuals often possess significant dormancy, while cultivated varieties have been selected to germinate immediately under favourable conditions. Consequently, the dormancy characteristics of crop-wild hybrids could influence their survival, seed-bank dynamics and, ultimately, the extent to which crop genes persist in wild populations. Dormancy characteristics can be influenced by both maternal effects, as well as the genetics of a seed's embryo, which are the result of contributions from both parents. Here we focus on how maternal effects and embryo genetics affect seed dormancy in crop-wild hybrid sunflowers (Helianthus annuus). Using three laboratory experiments, we quantified the germination and dormancy of 15 crop-wild hybrid sunflower cross types, while also identifying achene characteristics that may influence the differential germination observed. We found that increased frequencies of crop alleles and the maternal effects imparted by hybridization can reduce dormancy, though the effect of increased frequencies of crop alleles was more pronounced in wild-and F-1-produced than in the crop-produced achenes. The more open pericarp of the crop-produced achenes and the shorter relative distance that their radicles had to travel to germinate may explain some of the observed maternal effects. Finally, we generated hypotheses about how these results could affect survival and crop gene introgression in the field.

Woody species composition, structure and regeneration patterns of this forest were studied to generate information essential for formulating feasible management options for the forest. Vegetation data were collected from 64 quadrats of size 20mx20m, 10mx10m and 5mx5m for tree/shrub, sapling and seedling, respectively, laid systematically along transects. A total of 62 woody species belonging to 54 genera and 40 families were recorded. Rosaceae was the most diverse family with five (12.5%) species followed by Anacardiaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Myrsinaceae with three (7.5%) species each. Tree/shrub, sapling and seedling densities were 699, 1178 and 7618.7 individuals/ha. About 56.7% of the importance value index was contributed by Juniperus procera, Maytenus arbutifolia, Podocarpus falcatus and Ilex mitis. Vegetation classification resulted in five plant communities: Ilex mitis - Maytenus obscura, Galiniera saxifraga - Maesa lanceolata, Juniperus procera - Erica arborea, Podocapus falcatus - Allophylus abyssinicus and Pittosporum viridiflorum - Polycias fulva community types.

Do vegetative and reproductive phenophases of deciduous tropical species respond similarly to rainfall pulses?	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Deciduous trees with high-density wood that occur in dry seasonal tropical regions respond to rainfall seasonality with synchrony in phenophases. However, they may exhibit interannual differences in synchrony and intensity of phenophases, as strategy for large variations in duration and intensity of rainfall pulses. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how phenophases of deciduous trees of the Brazilian semi-arid region respond to rainfall variations. The phenology of Cordia oncocalyx was monitored in deciduous thorny woodland (Caatinga), from April 2009 to March 2011, and was correlated with rainfall, soil humidity, temperature, and photoperiod. The rainy years 2009 and 2011 exhibited higher duration of rainfall pulses and lower frequency of interpulses, but in 2010 pulse duration and total rainfall were lower. Circular statistics showed leaf flush followed by flowering and fruiting in the rainy season, and leaf fall and seed dispersal in the dry season. Both the vegetative and reproductive phenophases respond similarly to variations in rain pulses, with adjustments in time, duration, and intensity, which were correlated with variations in rainfall and soil humidity, excluding photoperiod as a trigger. Total defoliation occurred in the driest months of each year, November to December 2009 and August to October 2010. A sporadic leaf flush in November 2010 was triggered by occasional rains. Vegetative and reproductive synchronies were high in rainy years, but in 2010 synchrony was low, flowering was delayed and reduced, and, despite the low fruiting, we recorded high density in the seed bank. Lower synchrony, temporal separation of phenophases, and storage of fruits on the ground were risk-spreading strategies used by the population in the dry year, which suggest intrapopulation variability in responses to hydric stress. We believe that this plasticity contributes to high species density in the Caatinga.

J	Fernandez, C; Vega, JA; Fonturbel, T				Fernandez, Cristina; Vega, Jose A.; Fonturbel, Teresa			Fuel reduction at a Spanish heathland by prescribed fire and mechanical shredding: Effects on seedling emergence	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Traditional heathland burning has declined in Spain, leading to fuel accumulation and fuel reduction treatments have become common for severe wildfire hazard reduction. These methods need to maintain the botanical composition of those shrub communities. Prescribed fire has been widely used in the past, but we need to compare mechanical fuel reduction with prescribed fire because it is easier and safer to carry out in a wide range of weather conditions. This information could be particularly useful in flammable ecosystems all over the world where traditional anthropogenic burning has declined. In this study, we compared the effects of prescribed burning and mechanical shredding on the seedling emergence and its relation to the mature vegetation in a fire-prone heathland dominated by Erica australis L. and Pterospartum tridentatum (L.) Willk., in Galicia (NW Spain). We combined a greenhouse experiment with periodic field inventories of seedling emergence. In the greenhouse study, the seedling emergence was significantly higher in the soil samples after burning (383 seedlings m(-2)) than in samples before burning (242 seedlings m(-2)). In contrast, there was no significant difference in seedling density before and after mechanical shredding (243 compared with 261 seedlings m(-2)). Also, the number of seedlings that emerged after burning was significantly higher than that emerged after mechanical shredding. The maximum temperatures at the soil organic layer surface during burning were significantly and positively related to the density of Halimium lasianthum ssp. alyssoides and P. tridentatum seedlings. In the field study, the observed seedling density was very low both after prescribed burning and mechanical shredding. There was a high degree of similarity between emerged seedlings and mature vegetation in both the treated and in the untreated soils, which was probably a consequence of the dominance of resprouting species. Some consequences for the management of these shrublands are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Many studies have been conducted, but their ecological mechanisms of community assembly are not fully understood. Methodology: We examined the seasonal dynamics of the vegetation and soil seed bank as well as seed size distribution along a successional gradient. We also explored the potential role of the soil seed bank in plant community regeneration, the relationship between seed mass and species abundance, and the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes along a successional gradient. Principal Findings: Species richness of seed bank increased (shallow layer and the total) and seed density decreased (each layer and the total) significantly with succession. Species richness and seed density differed significantly between different seasons and among soil depths. Seed mass showed a significant negative relationship with relative abundance in the earliest successional stage, but the relationships were not significant in later stages. Seed mass showed no relationship with relative abundance in the whole successional series in seed bank. Results were similar for both July 2005 and April 2006. Conclusions: The seed mass and abundance relationship was determined by a complex interaction between small and larger seeded species and environmental factors. Both stochastic processes and deterministic processes were important determinants of the structure of the earliest stage. The importance of seed bank decreased with succession. The restoration of abandoned farmed and grazed meadows to the species-rich subalpine meadow in Tibetan Plateau can be successfully achieved from the soil seed bank. However, at least 20 years are required to fully restore an abandoned agricultural meadow to a natural mature subalpine meadow.

In hand-cultivated soybean fields in northeastern China, we asked if tussock-forming Carex and other wetland species were present as seed or asexual propagules. In the Sanjiang Plain, China, we compared the seed banks, vegetative propagules (below-ground) and standing vegetation of natural and restored sedge meadows, and hand-cultivated soybean fields in drained and flooded conditions. We found that important wetland species survived cultivation as seeds for some time (e.g. Calamogrostis angustifolia and Potamogeton crispus) and as field weeds (e.g. C. angustifolia and Phragmites australis). Key structural species were missing in these fields, for example, Carex meyeriana. We also observed that sedge meadows restored without planting or seeding lacked tussock-forming sedges. The structure of the seed bank was related to experimental water regime, and field environments of tussock height, thatch depth, and presence of burning as based on Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling analysis. To re-establish the structure imposed by tussock sedges, specific technologies might be developed to encourage the development of tussocks in restored sedge meadows.

Ruppia maritima L. seed bank viability at the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone	AQUATIC BOTANY												Ruppia maritima L. is a cosmopolitan habitat-forming seagrass species that historically dominated at the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone in the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. Currently, however, this species exhibits a patchy and ephemeral distribution which results in a degraded habitat. Thus, an important goal in Everglades' habitat restoration is to increase R. maritima abundance in the southern Everglades estuaries. We tested the hypothesis that a lack of seed bank viability may be limiting R. maritima recruitment potential. We surveyed the seed bank along the ecotone across western, central and eastern Florida Bay transects (28 sites); a large reproductive event was also captured at a western site. Seed densities were quantified and seeds characterized into intact (viable and nonviable), germinated and decomposing. Sediment nutrients were also determined from cores at each site. Transect data indicated low seed densities (150-1783 m(-2)) and few viable seeds (0-160 m(-2)) with higher total densities at western and central (643-1783 m(-2)) compared to eastern sites (150-327 m(-2)). In contrast, a meadow undergoing sexual reproduction had high total (25,398 m(-2)) and viable seeds (3556 m(-2)). Total and germinated seeds were also positively predicted by sediment P. While the Everglades ecotone is generally depauperate with respect to R. maritima seeds, an "opportunistic" recruitment strategy sustains it within the community. To restore this species as a highly productive habitat, restoration should focus on R. maritima life history development to seed set, and promoting the development of large reproductive meadows characterized by high seeds densities and a high proportion of viable embryos.

Fungal Diversity in Permafrost and Tallgrass Prairie Soils under Experimental Warming Conditions	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Soil fungi play a major role in terrestrial ecosystem functioning through interactions with soil structure, plants, micro- and mesofauna, and nutrient cycling through predation, pathogenesis, mutualistic, and saprotrophic roles. The diversity of soil fungi was assessed by sequencing their 28S rRNA gene in Alaskan permafrost and Oklahoma tallgrass prairie soils at experimental sites where the effect of climate warming is under investigation. A total of 226,695 reads were classified into 1,063 genera, covering 62% of the reference data set. Using the Bayesian Classifier offered by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) with 50% boot-strapping classification confidence, approximately 70% of sequences were returned as "unclassified" at the genus level, although the majority (similar to 65%) were classified at the class level, which provided insight into these lesser-known fungal lineages. Those unclassified at the genus level were subjected to BLAST analysis against the ARB-SILVA database, where similar to 50% most closely matched nonfungal taxa. Compared to the more abundant sequences, a higher proportion of rare operational taxonomic units (OTU) were successfully classified to genera at 50% bootstrap confidence, indicating that the fungal rare biosphere in these sites is not composed of sequencing artifacts. There was no significant effect after 1 year of warming on the fungal community structure at both sites, except perhaps for a few minor members, but there was a significant effect of sample depth in the permafrost soils. Despite overall significant community structure differences driven by variations in OTU dominance, the prairie and permafrost soils shared 90% and 63% of all fungal sequences, respectively, indicating a fungal "seed bank" common between both sites.				吴, 昊/AAB-1620-2020													0099-2240	1098-5336				NOV	2013	79	22					7063	7072		10.1128/AEM.01702-13							WOS:000327504200030	24014534

This study analyzed the seed-bank dynamics of Cytisus scoparius, a small woody species with a high aptitude for colonization and dominance. Our experimental setup made it possible to monitor seed emergence dynamics in situ for maternal individuals within the study population. In addition to the characteristic traits of the species (maximum seed life span between 4 and 5 years in 75 % of the cases), there was a high variability of the emergence dynamics between individuals, distinguished both by their total emergence rate and profile. The total emergence rate of seeds was correlated with their quality (seed weight and number of seeds per pod), but was unrelated to either maternal age or fecundity. Different emergence profiles can be recognized between two distinct patterns: on one hand, a strategy that concentrates on emergence in the second year and, on the other, a regular decrease of the germinant number over time. The coexistence of different seed-bank strategies between individuals results in the ability for the population to face to disturbances and environmental variability.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2013	28	6					927	934		10.1007/s11284-013-1075-4							WOS:000327457000001						
J	Dudinszky, N; Ghermandi, L				Dudinszky, N.; Ghermandi, L.			Fire as a stimulant of shrub recruitment in northwestern Patagonian (Argentina) grasslands	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												One strategy of plant survival during post-fire succession is to persist and regenerate by recruiting new individuals from a fire-resistant seed bank. The heat, smoke, and charcoal released during plant combustion may act (individually or in combination) as a cue for post-fire seed germination. Fabiana imbricata is a shrub that forms persistent seed banks in the northwestern Patagonian grasslands and shows a high recruitment from seeds during post-fire succession. Mathematical models showed that this species is advancing over the grasslands in response to fires. To corroborate these findings, we studied the role of fire on F. imbricata seed germination. In order to achieve this, a factorial experiment was designed in laboratory conditions to study the effect of heat, charcoal, smoke, scarification, and their interactions on F. imbricata seed germination. Seeds treated with the higher temperatures required a longer period of time to germinate, thus, significantly affecting the mean germination time. Total germination percentages in F. imbricata were significantly enhanced by smoke and scarification, but the interaction of heat, smoke, and scarification was more important than the effect of each fire factor alone. The positive response to fire cues exhibited by F. imbricata indicates that this species would have an adaptive advantage to colonize these grasslands if fire frequency increased, as predicted for this environment. Hence, fire will contribute to the grassland encroachment by this species and, therefore, to the loss of biodiversity and productivity of northwestern Patagonian grasslands.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2013	28	6					981	990		10.1007/s11284-013-1080-7							WOS:000327457000006						
J	Cui, NX; Wu, J; Xiang, DF; Cheng, SP; Zhou, Q				Cui, Naxin; Wu, Juan; Xiang, Dongfang; Cheng, Shuiping; Zhou, Qi			A field study on seed bank and its potential applications in vegetation restoration of a polluted urban river in China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												As an important component of restorations of polluted and/or degraded rivers, vegetation recovery has become a research highlight in the last two decades. Seed bank have been used as the best tool to allow natural recolonization of indigenous plants probably occurring before the degradation of the water bodies. To illustrate the relationship between water pollution and distribution of seed bank and evaluate the potential application of seed bank in vegetation restoration of polluted rivers, an urban river, Nanfeihe River was selected as the investigation target. A total of 27 species from 17 families with dominant families of Poaceae (5 species) and Polygonaceae (4 species) were identified in 38 channel bed samples. The observed species included 4 aquatic, 7 wetland and 16 terrestrial species, which occupied 15%, 26% and 59% of the total species, respectively. The species richness at the 10 sampling sites varied from 7 to 19, and the seed densities varied from 804 to 1.48 x 104 seedlings m(-2). Species richness and seed density in the river margin were significantly higher than those in the mid-channel (P < 0.05), and those in upper sediment layers were also higher than those in sub-layers. The species richness and Shannon Index of seed bank were significantly related to total nitrogen (TN) concentration in the sediment by Gauss regression (R2 = 0.94, P < 0.001 and R2 = 0.91, P < 0.001). Increasing TN concentrations in sediment eventually led to the decline of species richness and diversity. CCA ordination suggested that water depth and NH4 +-N concentration in water column played an important role in shaping the pattern of seed bank in the river. Perhaps water pollution not only caused degradation or even disappearance of standing vegetations, but also influenced the storage and distribution of seed bank. In addition, nitrogen-loading gradient along the river was probably capable of determining the pattern of seed bank at certain extend. The quantitative relations between the pattern of seed bank and water pollution give us insight to evaluate the potential application of seed bank in vegetation recovery in polluted urban rivers, and it would also contribute to urban riverine management, diversity conservation and ecological assessment.

Assessing the potential of Albufera de Valencia Lagoon sediments for the restoration of charophyte meadows	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Albufera de Valencia Lagoon, the largest littoral lagoon on the Iberian Peninsula, has been affected by eutrophication processes since the 1970s due to the direct dumping of sewage waters of industrial, agricultural and urban origin. Consequently, the submerged vegetation that covered the bottom of the lagoon has been lost (charophytes and Potamogeton spp., Myriophyllum spp. and Ceratophyllum spp.). Despite efforts to improve water quality, this vegetation has not recovered. No information about the potential of the recent sediments to host charophyte development is available. In this study, we analysed several sediment cores taken from different areas of the lagoon to determine the spatial distribution of past charophyte communities (based on the fructifications, i.e., oospores and gyrogonites, found in the sediments), to ascertain whether propagules remain in the upper sediments and to determine the potential of the surface sediments (containing pollutants, e.g., organochlorinated pesticides, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) to host the growth and germination of charophytes if clear water is restored to the lagoon. The study was based on laboratory experiments. Generally, the same species of charophytes were found in all studied areas of the lagoon. The oospores and gyrogonites were located immediately surficially (in the first 5 cm) in certain areas, and these might be capable of germinating in this sediment stratum. The more recent sediment strata (the upper 14 cm), corresponding to the eutrophication period, can support the vegetative growth of Chara hispida and Chara vulgaris and promote the germination of Chara aspera and Chara baltica. We conclude that if the underwater light conditions are improved and nutrient concentrations are reduced in Albufera de Valencia Lagoon, the reestablishment of charophytes might be possible both naturally and through specific management measures (namely, programmes involving seeds as planting stock or large-scale planting activity). This approach necessarily requires an improvement in the water quality of the inputs to the lagoon and an increase in the amount of water discharge to reduce the water residence time. These measures would restore the highly desirable positive feedback between submerged vegetation and water quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Past regeneration was reconstructed from tree rings and present regeneration was analyzed by surveying seedlings, sapling-sized trees and the occurrence of viable larch seeds in the soil seed bank. Forest regeneration occurred throughout the twentieth and the early twenty-first centuries in the forest interiors, but ceased after the late 1970s at forest edges. The density of sapling-sized larch trees decreased with livestock density linearly in the interior and exponentially at the edge. Most sapling-sized trees had visible damage from livestock browsing, which also manifested in wood-anatomical anomalies. By contrast, the densities of 1- and 2-year old seedlings increased with livestock density at the forest edge, suggesting that seedlings in this habitat benefitted from the reduction in competition intensity due to livestock grazing. This relationship also suggests that larch seedlings, in contrast to sapling-sized trees, were avoided by the livestock, as otherwise removal by the herbivores should have counteracted the promotion due to reduced competition. Near-consistency of the correlations of total livestock and goat densities with sapling and seedling densities suggests that the control of larch regeneration is primarily a function of goat density, which have tripled in the Mongolian livestock during the past 20 years for economic reasons.

New Approaches Indicate Constant Viral Diversity despite Shifts in Assemblage Structure in an Australian Hypersaline Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												It is widely stated that viruses represent the most significant source of biodiversity on Earth, yet characterizing the diversity of viral assemblages in natural systems remains difficult. Viral diversity studies are challenging because viruses lack universally present, phylogenetically informative genes. Here, we developed an approach to estimate viral diversity using a series of functional and novel conserved genes. This approach provides direct estimates of viral assemblage diversity while retaining resolution at the level of individual viral populations in a natural system. We characterized viral assemblages in eight samples from hypersaline Lake Tyrrell (LT), Victoria, Australia, using 39,636 viral contigs. We defined viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in two ways. First, we used genes with three different functional predictions that were abundantly represented in the data set. Second, we clustered proteins of unknown function based on sequence similarity, and we chose genes represented by three clusters with numerous members to define OTUs. In combination, diversity metrics indicated between 412 and 735 sampled populations, and the number of populations remained relatively constant across samples. We determined the relative representation of each viral OTU in each sample and found that viral assemblage structures correlate with salinity and solution chemistry. LT viral assemblages were near-replicates from the same site sampled a few days apart but differed significantly on other spatial and temporal scales. The OTU definition approach proposed here paves the way for metagenomics-based analyses of viral assemblages using ecological models previously applied to bacteria and archaea.

To account for the presence of a seed bank, we developed a hidden Markov model, where the focus species can be present in two forms, both above-ground and below-ground, the latter being unobservable. We generated patch histories of presence-absence for a species with a one-year seed bank under different colonization-extinction dynamics and metapopulation sizes, using a mechanistic model that accounts for three different sources of seedlings (seed bank, newly locally produced seeds and migrant seeds) as well as a disturbance process reflecting extinction. Using the program e-surge, we analysed these simulated data to evaluate the statistical performance of the hidden Markov model in detecting the presence of a seed bank and providing accurate estimates of the model parameters for different sets of parameter values. Our simulation tests showed that the absence of a seed bank was very well detected when data sets were simulated with no seed bank, regardless the size of the metapopulation. Similarly, the presence of a seed bank was well detected when data sets were simulated with a seed bank. In this latter case, detection of the seed bank improved with increasing size of the metapopulation. The quality of the estimates of the model parameters increased with the size of the metapopulation but still remained high for small metapopulation sizes. The two parameters reflecting the colonization process and seed dormancy were those best estimated. In addition, we showed that ignoring the presence of a seed bank unvaryingly led to overestimations of colonization and extinction rates.Synthesis. Hidden Markov models offer a reliable way to estimate colonization and extinction rates for plant metapopulations with a seed bank using time series of presence-absence data. Therefore, these models have the potential to provide valuable insights into the metapopulation dynamics of many plant and animal species with an unobservable life form that have remained poorly studied because of methodological constraints.

J	Lloret, F; Granzow-de la Cerda, I				Lloret, Francisco; Granzow-de la Cerda, Inigo			Plant competition and facilitation after extreme drought episodes in Mediterranean shrubland: does damage to vegetation cover trigger replacement by juniperwoodland?	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWe analyse the contribution of plant-plant interactions, particularly the outcome of plant competition and plant facilitation, on vegetation dynamics as a result of extreme drought episodes. These events will likely become more frequent under climate change, can induce vegetation die-off and alter community dynamics. We study succession in a shrubland that tends to be replaced by juniper (Juniperus phoenicea) woodland. Due to drought, shrubland die-off may result in competition release favouring J.phoenicea juveniles, and accelerating shrubland replacement. Alternatively, deleterious abiotic stress may increase after loss of vegetation cover protection. LocationMediterranean coastal shrublands, South Spain (Donana National Park). MethodsField estimates of plant growth, production of needle-like leaves, water-use efficiency (WUE; leaf C-13) and N leaf content of J.phoenicea juveniles in relation to plant size, drought-induced damage, cover and habit characteristics of surrounding vegetation, and drought-induced defoliation of the surrounding vegetation. ResultsJuniperus phoenicea juveniles growing beneath a dense vegetation canopy, particularly trees and large shrubs, were less damaged during the extreme drought episode. Plant size correlated negatively with damage. Post-drought growth was higher in juveniles partially released from the vegetation canopy, supporting the existence of a balance between competition and facilitation. Cover of pines, large shrubs and spiny shrubs favoured growth of juveniles. Needle-like juvenile leaves were more abundant in plants covered by the surrounding vegetation or in moderately damaged plants, but less abundant in plants without damage. Higher leaf C-13 values - indicating water stress - were measured in plants more damaged by drought and in those without canopy protection, or under vegetation strongly affected by drought. Leaf N content was lower in undamaged plants and individuals covered by surrounding vegetation. ConclusionWe did not find evidence that gaps opened by drought promoted growth of the potential replacing J.phoenicea. Thus, drought-induced enhancement of successional replacement of shrublands with woodlands was not supported; instead, our findings foresee shrubland prevalence under future climate change conditions. Plant facilitation will play a relevant role in this process. Thus, we herein extend the relevance of plant-plant interactions to extreme drought episodes related to climate change, highlighting their role as drivers of community dynamics.

J	Holland, JN; Molina-Freaner, F				Holland, J. Nathaniel; Molina-Freaner, Francisco			Hierarchical effects of rainfall, nurse plants, granivory and seed banks on cactus recruitment	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												AimsPlant facilitation is recognized as an important process, contributing not only to the ecology of individual species, but the diversity, organization and stability of communities as a whole. While decades of studies have enhanced our knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to plant facilitation, greater attention is now being given to the conditionality of the mechanisms, whereby multiple biotic and abiotic factors may act independently and jointly with one another in shaping plant-plant facilitation. Our objective was to evaluate the conditionality and hierarchy of mechanisms contributing to cactus germination and early seedling recruitment arising from plant-plant facilitation, including the effects of seed banks, rainfall, granivory and nurse plants. LocationBahia de Kina, Sonora, Mexico; Sonoran Desert of North America. MethodsWe employed descriptive analyses and a factorial experiment to examine the consequences of rainfall, nurse plants, granivory and seed banks for senita cactus recruitment (Pachycereus schottii) in two plant communities of the Sonoran Desert: one degraded of its key nurse plants and the other with its nurse plants intact. ResultsSeed banks did not occur in either of the plant communities, indicating that seed banks and seed dormancy do not affect senita recruitment and thereby do not modulate other mechanisms that contribute to nurse plant facilitation and cactus recruitment. Juvenile senita cacti were consistently associated with nurse plants in both plant communities. Yet, the density and species composition of nurse plants differed between the communities, resulting in reduced senita recruitment and shifts to alternative nurse plants in the community degraded of its key nurse plants compared to the intact community. In a factorial experiment manipulating rainfall, granivory and nurse plants, we found that rainfall and granivory had significant main factor effects, leading to increases and decreases in seedling recruitment, respectively. There was no main factor effect of nurse plants, but there was a significant nurse plant by granivory interaction, indicating that nurse plants increase seedling recruitment through escape from granivory conditional upon rainfall. ConclusionsTaken together, these results reveal a conditional hierarchy of mechanisms of plant-plant facilitation shaping senita cactus recruitment, namely the predominant effects of rainfall increasing recruitment and of granivory decreasing recruitment, for which nurse plants played a key role in increasing seedling recruitment with rainfall and by reducing granivory.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				NOV	2013	24	6					1053	1061		10.1111/jvs.12021							WOS:000325370200010
