J	Palmer, MW; Rusch, GM				Palmer, MW; Rusch, GM			How fast is the carousel? Direct indices of species mobility with examples from an Oklahoma grassland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Current interest in small-scale species dynamics has led to a proliferation of mobility indices. We advocate the use of direct measures of mobility such as immigration rate, extinction rate, residence time. and carousel time, We also demonstrate that the null expectation of cumulative frequency under different null models can be calculated explicitly. Species can depart from the commonly-used 'random reassignment' model simply because of longevity. and not mobility per se. We therefore prefer a random immigration null model, which assumes that immigration locations are randomized, We examined mobility patterns of selected plant species. studied in 256 quadrats of each of four grains (ranging from 1/64 m(2) to 1 m(2)) in an Oklahoma grassland. Residence times and carousel times can be centuries or even millennia for some species, We explore the numerical and biological reasons for relationships between mobility statistics. Mobility statistics are fairly consistent among grains and years, although the residence times of species exhibit some subtle scale dependence. Species depart from a random immigration model very slightly - but the departure is consistent: species tend to re-occupy previously vacated space more often than expected due to chance. We believe that the use of direct indices will facilitate the study of how species characteristics influence mobility.

(Fabaceae), we have analysed most of the individuals (n = 363) from the same population 6 years later using microsatellite loci. We confirm the result of the earlier study, namely that this population is very polymorphic and highly subdivided, with approximately 37% of the variance distributed among subpopulations, only 50 m apart one from another. We use standard F-statistics analyses, linkage disequilibria, minimum spanning network, multilocus assignment tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses to test the hypotheses that spatial structure and outcrossing events are involved in maintaining the large amount of genetic diversity at the level of each subpopulation. Interestingly, fine-scale spatial structure could be observed in only one subpopulation suggesting that other mechanisms are acting elsewhere. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of fine spatial genetic structure in a predominantly selfing species.

J	Hill, RL; Gourlay, AH; Barker, RJ				Hill, RL; Gourlay, AH; Barker, RJ			Survival of Ulex europaeus seeds in the soil at three sites in New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed banks area major factor in the persistence of perennial, woody, leguminous weed species. The longevity of seeds of Ulex europaeus, (gorse) in the soil at three sites was determined, and the implications of these results for the selection of biological control agents for the weed are discussed. Locally collected seeds were buried in bags at depths ranging from 2.5 cm to 15 cm at three climatically distinct sites. Seeds were recovered and germinated over a 10-year period to estimate the dormancy characteristics and viability of U. europaeus seed banks at the three sites, The decline in the seed bank conformed to a linear model using an exponential transformation. Seeds survived longer when buried deeper, but this influence was weak. The main determinant of seed survival was the time elapsed since burial. Results indicate that the dynamics of the seed bank vary from site to site. Thus, the view that U. europaeus seeds last almost indefinitely in the seed bank may be exaggerated, at least in some sites. At two sites, the number of viable seeds buried at a depth of 5 cm declined to 10% of the original number within 10 years of burial and to 1% within 20 years. By contrast. data from the third site suggested that in some places seed could survive many decades in the seed bank. Almost all seeds recovered from the soil were viable, and losses from the seed bank were probably due to germination. Local climatic conditions or local genotype may explain the variation in seed longevity between sites, although this study could not examine the relative importance of these factors. Seed-feeding biological control agents reduce U europaeus seed rain, and these may influence the population dynamics of the weed within several decades in areas where the rate of seed decline in the soil is rapid.																	0028-825X					JUN	2001	39	2					235	244									WOS:000170522000005						
J	Johnson, PN				Johnson, PN			Vegetation recovery after fire on a southern New Zealand peatland	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The effects of fires on conservation values and in determining present-day vegetation are poorly known in New Zealand. This study of vegetation recovery at Awarua Bog, Southland, began after a fire in 1985, Nine samplings were recorded over 10 years from permanent transects in six vegetation types: mixed Batimea-Empodisma bog, Leptospermum scrub. Pteridium fernland, Sphagnum bog, Chionochloa grassland, and Ulex scrub. Rapid initial vegetative regrowth was mainly by rhizomatous species. Low-growing species (herbaceous dicotyledons, grasses, bryophytes) peaked in abundance 15-22 months after fire but subsequently declined in cover or disappeared. Leptospermum shrubs established rapidly from seed; epacrid shrub species established later and more slowly. Former dominants (e.g., Empodisma minus, Gleichenia dicarpa, and Chionochloa rubra) were slow to recover. Sphagnum recovery was mainly by slow recolonisation of fire-bared peat, rather than regrowth of fire-damaged former cushions. Cushion bog (Donatia novae-zelandiae) is particularly sensitive to fire and very slow to recover. Fire provides open sites for gorse (Ulex europaeus) establishment, but also easy access for its eradication, Long-term fire prevention and prompt containment protect conservation values.																	0028-825X					JUN	2001	39	2					251	267									WOS:000170522000007

The hay of well-developed fen meadows from nature reserves in the region appeared to contain enough viable seeds to act as a source for the development of target communities when spread out on bare peat after topsoil removal. Repeated vegetation analysis showed that a combination of topsoil removal and hay transfer resulted in the establishment of new populations in the target area for 70% of the species of the donor area. Germination conditions of fen species were investigated to determine the optimal combination for stimulating germination rates. Most fen species were found to be dormant, and it was shown that dormancy could be broken with fluctuating light and temperature cycles and stratification pre-treatment.																	1061-2971					JUN	2001	9	2					127	136		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002127.x							WOS:000169227600003

Sod cutting was carried out in a range of different dune slacks in order to restore dune slack vegetation with many endangered Red List species. Sod cutting removed approximately 96% of the soil seed bank. Species abundant in the seed bank, notably Juncacea, also had a high frequency in the vegetation that established during the first year after the restoration measures. Many other species not registered in the seed bank or in the former vegetation also appeared. Species richness in the monitored plots exceeded that of uncut reference plots after a few years. Colonization rates were higher than extinction rates in most plots, indicating that a stable state has not been reached after 5 years. Differences in species richness between slacks appeared to be related to the occurrence of source areas nearby and availability of dispersal agents, such as flooding and animals.

J	Willems, JH				Willems, JH			Problems, approaches, and, results in restoration of Dutch calcareous grassland during the last 30 years	RESTORATION ECOLOGY					Groningen Conference on Restoration Ecology	AUG 25-30, 1998	GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS					This paper is based on research of the restoration of species-rich calcareous grasslands in The Netherlands, over the last 30 years. Chalk grassland is a semi-natural vegetation with a high density of species at a small scale. This type of vegetation was once widespread in Western Europe as common grazing land, mainly for flocks of sheep for which the main function was dung production. In some regions of Central Europe, these grasslands were also used for hay production. The dung was used to maintain arable field production at a reasonable level. In the chalk district in the southernmost part of The Netherlands some 25 sites of this vegetation, varying in area from 0.05-4.5 ha, are still present. Chalk grassland completely lost its significance for modern agricultural production after the wide application of artificial fertilizer following World War II. This grassland has a high conservation value both for plants and animal species, of which a large number of species are exclusively restricted to this biotope. When conservation activities started at a large scale in the early 1960s, three different types of restoration activities could be distinguished: (1) restoration of fertilized sites; (2) restoration of abandoned grasslands; and (3) recreation of chalk grassland on former arable fields. The main aim of the restoration attempt is to create and/or improve sustainable conditions for both plant and animal species characteristic of the chalk grassland ecosystem. In the process of restoration, several phases of different activities can be distinguished: (1) pre-restoration phase, during which information of the land use history is collected and, based on these data, clear restoration goals are established; (2) initial restoration phase, during which effects of former, non-conservational land use has to be undone in order to stimulate germination and establishment of target species originating from soil seed bank and species pool; (3) consolidation phase, including the introduction and continuation of a regular management system for sustainable conservation; and (4) long-term conservation strategy including measures to prevent disturbance from the outside and genetic erosion and extinction of locally endangered plant populations.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				JUN	2001	9	2					147	154		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002147.x							WOS:000169227600005						
J	Brouwer, E; Roelofs, JGM				Brouwer, E; Roelofs, JGM			Degraded softwater lakes: Possibilities for restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY					Groningen Conference on Restoration Ecology	AUG 25-30, 1998	GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS					In the Netherlands, the characteristic flora of shallow softwater lakes has declined rapidly as a consequence of eutrophication, alkalization and acidification. The sediment of most lakes has become nutrient rich and anaerobic. We expected that, if a vital seed bank was still present, restoration of the original water quality and sediment conditions would lead to the return of softwater macrophytes. The restoration of 15 degraded, shallow, softwater lakes in the Netherlands was monitored from 1983 to 1998. In eutrophied as well as in acidified lakes, removal of accumulated organic matter from the sediment and shores was followed by rapid recolonization of softwater macrophytes present in the seedbank. After isolation from alkaline water and subsequent mud removal, this recovery was also observed in alkalized lakes. Further development of softwater vegetation correlated strongly with the water quality. When renewed eutrophication was successfully prevented, softwater macrophytes could expand. However, in acidified lakes, Juncus bulbosus and Sphagnum species became dominant after restoration. Liming of an acidified lake was followed by re-acidification within 3 years. Recolonization by softwater macrophytes was inhibited by high turbidity of the water column and spreading of large helophytes on the shore. As an alternative, controlled inlet of alkaline, nutrient-poor groundwater was studied in a few lakes. The pH of those lakes increased, the carbon and nitrogen availability decreased and softwater macrophytes returned. Successful restoration has contributed considerably to maintaining biodiversity in softwater lakes in the Netherlands.

Sometimes such constraints in the restoration process can be identified, mostly being constraints in nutrient availability or in the water regime, but unexpected changes can also be the result of intrinsic species fluctuations or invasive species. Unexpected vegetation developments are sometimes undesired, can be very persistent and may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities. Unexpected developments also illustrate the limits in restoration ecology. Very often the restoration process simply proceeds along successional pathways we did not anticipate. Theories about such alternative pathways can be explored using prediction models, such as cellular automata, which can handle the results of biomonitoring very efficiently. Biomonitoring during 40 years, however, has also shown that a certain amount of unpredictability has to be taken for granted, both in natural wetlands and in areas under restoration.

J	Jaksic, FM				Jaksic, FM			Spatiotemporal variation patterns of plants and animals in San Carlos de Apoquindo, central Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												I summarize what is known about the mediterranean ecosystem represented in San Carlos de Apoquindo (33 degrees 23' S, 70 degrees 31'W), a rugged area of 835 ha located ca. 20 km east of downtown Santiago on the Andean foothills. This site attracted numerous researchers during 1976-1990 because of its proximity to Santiago and its relatively protected status. I review the literature, and provide unpublished information on this site. A total of 132 literature entries describe the ecology of San Carlos de Apoquindo, in about 30 topics. The shrub and herbaceous vegetation have been well studied. but little is known about the respective seed banks. Among animals, small mammals. rabbits, and avian and mammalian predators are the best investigated, whereas epigean arthropods, amphibians. lizards, snakes. passerine birds, and scavengers of all types are the least studied. Thematically, interactions from plant/climate, to plant/soil, to plant/ herbivore. to herbivore/predator interactions, and to decomposition of animal carcasses, have been addressed. But gross inequalities exist on the thoroughness with which each topic has been researched, The best studied aspects deal with plant/herbivore and herbivore/predator interactions. Up to now, no description existed of soils and climate in the area, which I present in this paper. Taking advantage of the long-term aspect of the research at the site, I highlight temporal variation patterns. And because of the different landscape aspects present at the site, I also highlight data that depict such spatial variability. In general, San Carlos de Apoquindo has contributed greatly to the understanding of ecological processes in central Chile. I call for renewed efforts at studying this site's ecology from an ecosystem perspective.				jaksic, Fabian m/G-1705-2014													0716-078X					JUN	2001	74	2					477	502									WOS:000170178000021

Four wetland types were identified based on species composition. Five distinctive physio-graphic zones, each with a characteristic assemblage of plant species, and three successional pathways were observed in the study sites. While soil moisture is clearly a strong influence on plant community structure and composition in beaver-impacted wetlands, hydrological dynamics including frequency, duration, and extent of flooding appear more influential than depth to water table.																	0035-4902					SUM	2001	103	915					293	320									WOS:000172001900003						
J	Wetzel, PR; van der Valk, AG; Toth, LA				Wetzel, PR; van der Valk, AG; Toth, LA			Restoration of wetland vegetation on the Kissimmee River floodplain: Potential role of seed banks	WETLANDS												The composition of seed banks of areas on the drained Kissimmee River floodplain (Florida, USA) that are currently pasture and formerly had been wet prairie, broadleaf marsh, and wetland shrub communities was compared to that of seed banks of areas that have extant stands of these communities. The species composition of the seed banks of existing wet prairie and former wet prairie sites were the most similar, with a Jaccard index of similarity of 55. Existing and former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub communities had Jaccard indices of 38 and 19, respectively. Although existing and former wet prairie seed banks had nearly the same species richness, species richness at former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites was higher than at existing sites. Mean total seed densities were similar in existing and former wet prairies (700 to 800 seeds m(2)). However, seed densities in former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites were significantly greater than in comparable existing communities (>4,900 seeds m(2) at former sites versus 200 to 300 in existing communities). The higher seed densities in former broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites was due to over 4,000 seeds m(2) of Juncus effusus in their seed banks. Half of the species that characterize wet prairies were found in the seed banks at former and existing wet prairie sites. At existing broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites, most of the characteristic species were found in their seed banks. However, only one characteristic broadleaf species was found in the seed banks of the former broadleaf marsh sites, and no characteristic wetland shrub species were found in the seed banks of the former wetland shrub sites. The seeds of only two non-indigenous species were found in the seed banks of former wetland communities at very low densities. For all three vegetation types, but particularly for the broadleaf marsh and wetland shrub sites, re-establishment of the former vegetation on the restored floodplain will require propagule dispersal from off-site sources.																	0277-5212					JUN	2001	21	2					189	198		10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0189:ROWVOT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000169412900003						
J	Haukos, DA; Smith, LM				Haukos, DA; Smith, LM			Temporal emergence patterns of seedlings from Playa wetlands	WETLANDS												Playas undergo dynamic environmental changes throughout the growing season, resulting in the need for a persistent seed bank for plants to respond to these changes. Therefore, we investigated seasonal germination patterns of species found in seed banks of playa wetlands. We used the seedling-emergence technique to determine recruitment patterns from seed banks of eight playas. In the greenhouse, seed-bank samples were subjected to two treatments, drawdown or flooded, over a 210-day duration divided into seven 30-day time periods. In both treatments, seedling emergence differed among time periods and species hut was similar among playas. Approximately 52% of drawdown seedlings and 44% of seedlings occurring in the flooded treatment germinated in the first 30 days. Plants occurring in playa seed hanks had variable germination strategies. Three patterns for common (>5% occurrence) species were identified in the drawdown treatment: (1) early germinators (those species that germinated rapidly after exposure to treatments with low germination during the remainder of time periods), (2) late germinators (those that germinate after specific environmental conditions have existed for some time), and (3) continuous germinators (those with even germination rates throughout submersion). Two patterns were found for common species in the flooded treatment: (1) early germinators and (2) continuous germinators. Germination throughout the period of suitable environmental conditions was the dominant strategy for persistence in the unpredictable playa environment. With only a few exceptions, species persisting in seed banks of playas do not show germination for all available seeds upon creation of suitable environmental conditions but rather use viable dornmant seeds as a hedge against the unpredictable environment.																	0277-5212					JUN	2001	21	2					274	280		10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0274:TEPOSF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000169412900012

The distribution patterns of contents of REEs in wheat seeds (n = 58) were observed and compared with their average level in soils (n = 364). Differences among regions and between spring and winter wheat were tested. Comparison with literature data was also made. The results show that the content of REEs in wheat seed ranges between 10(-11) g . g(-1) and 10(-8) g . g(-1), 3-4 order of magnitudes lower than that in soils. The distribution patterns are that light REEs enriched and the Eu-anomaly is weak, similar to the soil case. No obvious differences were found among different regions and breeds.

J	Owen, NW; Kent, M; Dale, MP				Owen, NW; Kent, M; Dale, MP			Spatial and temporal variability in seed dynamics of machair sand dune plant communities, the Outer Hebrides, Scotland	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The subjects of seed banks and seed rain represent comparatively neglected areas of biogeography, yet at the community scale, exhibit interesting patterns in both space and time. This paper describes the seed bank and seed rain characteristics of the machair sand dune communities of the Outer Hebrides. As well as looking at individual species distributions and variability, the seed banks and seed rain are examined in terms of their detailed subcommunity composition and its local spatial and temporal variation. The machair plant (sub)communities show extensive degrees of anthropogenic modification because of past and present agricultural management, including cultivation for cereals over wide areas and for potatoes in large numbers of 'lazy beds' or small patches. Thus over the historical period, large areas of machair have undergone regular ploughing and cultivation, which have provided the opportunity for a patchwork of secondary succession to occur. This pattern continues to the present day. Furthermore, most other non-cultivated plant (sub)communities are intensively grazed, primarily by cattle and also by sheep and rabbits. Location South Uist, the Outer Hebrides, north-west Scotland. Methods At two carefully selected locations, a range of these various successional subcommunities have been sampled for their seed banks, by taking cores and for their seed rain, by using specially designed traps located where each seed bank sample was removed. This paired sampling strategy allowed direct comparison of the seed bank and the seed rain. Both individual species distributions and the community assemblages of seed bank/seed rain species are examined in space and time using techniques of numerical classification [two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN)] and ordination [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)]. Results and conclusions There is considerable heterogeneity within and between machair subcommunities in terms of seed bank and seed rain characteristics. The soil seed banks and seed rain of the agriculturally disturbed machair subcommunities are consistently more dense and more species rich than non-cultivated areas of the machair. Overall, machair seed banks are small and stable with no discernible seasonal trends in either size or species composition. In contrast, seed rain on the machair is characterized by a distinct temporal trend. Both seed banks and seed rain are potentially very poor sources of propagules for recolonization following disturbance, indicating that the majority of revegetation following anthropogenic and/or environmental interference is through vegetative reproduction.																	0305-0270					MAY	2001	28	5					565	588		10.1046/j.1365-2699.2001.00564.x							WOS:000170907300002

Hatching fraction and timing of resting stage production are important life history variables. We model life cycles of freshwater invertebrates in temporary pools, with various combinations of uncertain season length and density-dependent fecundity. In deterministic density-independent conditions, resting stage production begins suddenly. With uncertain season length and density independence, resting stage production begins earlier and gradually. A high energetic cost of resting stages favours later resting stage production and a lower hatching fraction. Deterministic environments with density dependence allow sets of coexisting strategies, dominated by pairs, each switching suddenly to resting stage production on a different dare, usually earlier than without density dependence. Uncertain season length and density dependence allow a single evolutionarily stable strategy, around which we observe many mixed strategies with negatively associated yield (resting stages per initial active stage) and optimal hatching fraction.

While these influences may temporarily reduce vegetative cover, their mutual influence on the available seedbanks which might occupy new safe sites is unclear. We examine effects of drought and grazing upon pre- and post-drought plant root distribution and germinable seed bank to determine 1) if the response of root distributions to drought depends upon grazing use and 2) if the presence of germinable seeds is altered significantly by drought and grazing. Using twelve, 5 X 10 m nonweighing lysimeters with an automated rainout shelter, we documented root intercepts in situ using a minirhizotron from 1993-1996, Seed bank samples were incubated in a greenhouse to determine seedling emergence. Roots were fewer in shallow soil layers in grazed plots than ungrazed plots by the end of the study, irrespective of drought, Roots in deeper (Bw horizon) soil layers were fewer during drought, but were not influenced by grazing. Seed bank composition results suggest that perennial grasses were a small portion of the seed bank. Cool-season annual grass seeds accumulated after drought. Without drought, forb seed banks increased with grazing, Thus while shallow roots may decrease during drought, in the year following drought grazing may decrease aboveground net primary production, and allow Large accumulations of cool-season annual grass seed in a northern mixed grass prairie.																	0022-409X					MAY	2001	54	3					292	298		10.2307/4003250							WOS:000168634000015						
J	Gonzalez-Andujar, JL; Plant, RE; Fernandez-Quintanilla, C				Gonzalez-Andujar, JL; Plant, RE; Fernandez-Quintanilla, C			Modeling the effect of farmers' decisions on the population dynamics of winter wild oat in an agricultural landscape	WEED SCIENCE												Understanding spatial distribution has become increasingly important in weed science. Seed dispersal, both between and within agricultural fields, is an important component of weed spatial distribution. Analysis of the effect of dispersal between fields has been relatively neglected in theoretical studies of weed population dynamics. In this paper, we present a simple landscape-level model of the influence of seed dispersal on winter wild oat population dynamics between fields. In the model, two fields are interconnected, with seeds being carried from one field to another as would occur when seeds are carried by field equipment or in irrigation water. The model is intended to characterize the effect of field-level weed management decisions on landscape-level weed population dynamics. Three scenarios were studied. The first employed no control measures in either field. The second employed annual application of herbicides in field 1 with field 2 receiving no treatment. In the third scenario, an herbicide application took place in field I only if the weed population in that field exceeded an action threshold. In the first scenario, the net result of the immigration and emigration processes determined the increase or decrease of the stable plant population. In the second scenario, weeds in the controlled field (field 1) were not driven to extinction as might be expected. The weed populations grew for practically all the dispersal parameter space. Each change in the parameter's values produced a new stable equilibrium. This situation might correspond to a multiplicity of stable states. The uncontrolled field (field 2) experienced an indirect control effect due to the use of control measures in field 1. In the third scenario, we observed an interesting behavior of the populations in both fields. The population in field I was not driven under the economic threshold, and both fields showed complex dynamics within defined combinations of migration and emigration values.

Modelling population development	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENKRANKHEITEN UND PFLANZENSCHUTZ-JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION												In this paper, a model is outlined and parameterized for Viola arvensis using data from a long-term experiment (1982-1996) an population development described previously by GEROWITT and BODEN-DORFER (1998). Simulation exercises on population development were done using this model. It was found that re-parameterization was necessary for a satisfactory simulation of the population development for a treatment without N fertilisation in cereals, The simulation results of HOLZMANN (1987) were repeated and improved by fitting them to the investigated data. Variations in the data could be accounted for by modifying the parameters using the annual data for the investigated variables, when the variables within a Year were related to one another. The significance of the simulations is discussed with respect to investigations on the long-term risk associated with various control strategies.																	0340-8159					MAY	2001	108	3					269	283									WOS:000170353200005						
J	Amarasekare, P; Possingham, HP				Amarasekare, P; Possingham, HP			Patch dynamics and metapopulation theory: the case of successional species	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												We present a mathematical framework that combines extinction-colonization dynamics with the dynamics of patch succession. We draw an analogy between the epidemiological categorization of individuals (infected, susceptible, latent and resistant) and the patch structure of a spatially heterogeneous landscape (occupied-suitable, empty-suitable, occupied-unsuitable and empty-unsuitable). This approach allows one to consider life-history attributes that influence persistence in patchy environments (e.g., longevity, colonization ability) in concert with extrinsic processes (e.g., disturbances, succession) that lead to spatial heterogeneity in patch suitability. It also allows the incorporation of seed banks and other dormant life forms, thus broadening patch occupancy dynamics to include sink habitats. We use the model to investigate how equilibrium patch occupancy is influenced by four critical parameters: colonization rate? extinction rate, disturbance frequency and the rate of habitat succession. This analysis leads to general predictions about how the temporal scaling of patch succession and extinction-colonization dynamics influences long-term persistence. We apply the model to herbaceous, early-successional species that inhabit open patches created by periodic disturbances. We predict the minimum disturbance frequency required far viable management of such species in the Florida scrub ecosystem. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Houle, G; McKenna, MF; Lapointe, L				Houle, G; McKenna, MF; Lapointe, L			Spatiotemporal dynamics of Floerkea proserpinacoides (Limnanthaceae), an annual plant of the deciduous forest of eastern North America	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Because environmental filters are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, there often is a lack of significant relationship between the spatial patterns of successive life stages in plant populations. In this study, we determined the spatiotemporal relationships between different life stages in two populations of an annual plant of the deciduous forests of eastern North America. Floerkea proserpinacoides. Demographic surveys were done over a 4-yr period, and experiments were performed in the field and under controlled conditions to test for the effects of various environmental factors on population dynamics. There was a general lock of relationship between the spatial patterns of seed bank and seedling density, and a lack of similarity between their spatial correlograms. This was related mostly to the effects of spatially variable environmental filters operating on germination and emergence. However, environmental tilters acting on plant survival were stable through time and contributed to stabilize the density and spatial patterns of the populations. Despite density-dependent presenescence mortality, spatial patterns of seedlings and mature individuals were similar and their correlograms were alike, suggesting that mortality did not fully compensate for density. Estimated fecundity was negatively correlated with population density over the study period. Although flower production started only 2-3 wk after emergence, seed maturation mostly occurred at the end of the life cycle, just before the onset of plant senescence. Yet, individual fecundity was low for an annual plant, i.e., 3.0 +/- 0.5 mature seeds/plant (mean +/- 1 SE). Seed predation by vertebrates was not significant. Low soil moisture had little effect on the total number of seeds germinating, although it slowed down the germination process. In quadrats where leaf litter was experimentally doubled, seedling emergence was lower than in control quadrats: in quadrats where leaf litter was completely removed, emergence did not differ from that in control quadrats. Susceptibility to drought stress was higher for seedlings than for mature plants. Although the species does not maintain a long-term persistent soil seed bank, other factors, such as density-dependent fecundity and autogamy, may temper population fluctuations through time and reduce the probability of local extinction.

J	Enright, NJ; Kintrup, A				Enright, NJ; Kintrup, A			Effects of smoke, heat and charred wood on the germination of dormant soil-stored seeds from a Eucalyptus baxteri heathy-woodland in Victoria, SE Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The effects of dry heat, wet heat, charred wood and smoke on the germination of dormant soil-stored seeds from a Eucalyptus woodland in western Victoria were tested by using a glasshouse seed-bank germination experiment. Seedling density, species richness and species composition were compared between replicated treated and control samples. A total of 5922 seedlings, comprising 59 plant species, was recorded from the soil samples over a period of 150 days. While a few species dominated (including Centrolepis strigosa, Wahlenbergia gracilenta and Ixodia achillaeoides), 26 species were represented by fewer than five seedlings and 18 species were restricted to single treatment types. With the exception of charred wood, all treatments led to a significant increase in seed germination relative to the control. The highest number of germinants was obtained for the smoke treatment, with a mean (+/- SE) of 12 547 +/- 449 seedlings m(-2). Heat treatments yielded intermediate densities, with means (+/- SE) varying between 7445 +/- 234 and 9133 +/- 445 seedlings m(-2). In comparison with the estimates of seed-bank sizes from other fire-prone ecosystems, these densities are high. Species richness differed significantly among treatments. Highest mean richness was recorded in the smoke treatment and lowest for the control and charred wood treatments. There were significant differences in seed-bank species composition between treatment types based on analysis of similarity (Anosim) using Bray-Curtis similarity. While heat was a specific requirement for triggering germination in hard-seeded species (e.g. Fabaceae), smoke was the most effective trigger for species from a broad range of other families. The potentially confounding effect of physical and chemical mechanisms of germination stimulation in heated bulk soil samples is raised as an issue requiring further investigation in relation to the role of smoke as a germination trigger.

The main natural vegetation types are moist swards, tall-tussock grasslands and stony grasslands. Ten compound soil samples from each community at two soil depths (0-5 and 5-10 cm) were taken. The density of soil seed-banks was highest in moist swards, intermediate in stony grasslands and lowest in tall-tussock grasslands. Low levels of similarity were found between the established vegetation and total soil seed-bank in tall-tussock grasslands and stony grasslands, but the similarity was higher in swards. In all three communities the seed-bank was most frequently transient in nature. Short-term persistent and long-term persistent seed-banks were less frequent. Regeneration from the seed-banks after disturbance is expected to differ among communities on different edaphic patches. On the basis of the density and longevity of the soil seed-banks and the similarity to the established vegetation, potential for in situ regeneration should be lower in tall-tussock grasslands, intermediate in stony grasslands and higher in moist swards.

J	Simon, J; Bosch, M; Molero, J; Blanche, C				Simon, J; Bosch, M; Molero, J; Blanche, C			Conservation biology of the Pyrenean larkspur (Delphinium montanum): a case of conflict of plant versus animal conservation?	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Delphinium montanum is a larkspur endemic to the Pyrenees. It has c. 4000 individuals and is classified as vulnerable following the IUCN categories. Pollination ecology results demonstrated that it is strictly dependent on pollinator activity (mainly bumblebees) to set seeds. Genetic diversity estimated by allozyme variation at 7 loci showed quite high levels of variation related to its polyploidy. Predation by Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra pyrenaica), first detected in 1993, caused a continuous loss of > 90% of seed set in a protected area. The maintenance of high genetic diversity suggests the buffer effect of polyploidy and seed bank strategy to counter animal grazing, but long-term effects on conservation are expected. These results stressed: (1) the need for a plan to monitor this animal-plant interaction; and (2) the need to monitor closely the population number of individuals of certain protected animal species in Natural Reserves, particularly if ecological competition has been disturbed by human intervention.

J	Dzwonko, Z				Dzwonko, Z			Effect of proximity to ancient deciduous woodland on restoration of the field layer vegetation in a pine plantation	ECOGRAPHY												The influence of dominant toe species, soil conditions and distance from an adjacent ancient oak-hornbeam woodland upon the floristic composition, species richness and spatial distributions of species in a pine wood planted on dry rendzina soil were studied in southern Poland. It was found that, in spite of a 52-yr long succession, the cover and composition of species in the pine wood were significantly different from that in the adjacent ancient woodland. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and stepwise regression analyses showed that the distance to the ancient woodland had a significant influence on species distributions in the recent wood. The numbers of species from the Querco-Fagetea class, vegetatively reproducing species and myrmecochores decreased with this distance, whereas the numbers of tree species in the shrub and field layers and anemochores increased. The light intensity had a positive effect on the numbers of species in the shrub layer, non-woodland species and anemochores. The number of woodland species increased considerably with the cover of quickly decomposing litter and with thickness of the humus layer. The migration rate of many woodland species, calculated on occurrence of the farthest individuals was very slow, varying from 0.18 m yr (1) to 0.38m yr(-1). These results indicate that the availability of micro-sites suitable for seed germination and plant development determined the successful colonization of the recent wood to an extent comparable with the seed dispersal.																	0906-7590					APR	2001	24	2					198	204		10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.240210.x							WOS:000169456200010						
J	Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M				Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M			Influence of land use history on seed banks in European temperate forest ecosystems: a review	ECOGRAPHY												This study summarises European research on seed banks in temperate forest systems and analyses for differences in seed bank composition between geographically scattered forests with a different land use history. Special attention is given to seed bank characteristics of ancient forest species. Results of Detrended Correspondence Analysis suggest that historical land use is a key factor in determining the seed bank composition. Particularly seed banks of forests on former heathland sites differ from seed banks of ancient forest due to a high contribution of early successional species. The effect of former land use decreases after SO yr, due to seed senescence. Total seed density decreases with recent forest age. Seed bank composition of eastern European forests is different from northern or western European forests, a difference which is mainly caused by species with a higher Ellenberg indicator value for continentality, temperature and reaction. In general, ancient forest species are poorly represented. Only a limited number is mentioned to have a persistent seed bank, and their densities are relatively low, which means that restoration of typical ancient forest vegetation can not rely on the seed bank. However, there is still a considerable lack of knowledge concerning seed bank and germination characteristics of forest species.

ECOLOGY												Classifications of tree species into regeneration guilds or functional groups are often based on a limited number of life history characteristics indicative of requirements for early establishment, with the assumption that these traits are correlated with growth requirements of larger individuals. We tested the validity of this assumption for Alseis blackiana, a common canopy tree in central Panama, by examining its seed germination, seedling growth, and sapling distribution, growth, and mortality. We found that the early life history of Alseis is characteristic of pioneer species: the seed germination rate was much higher in forest gaps than in the forest understory, small seedlings were absent from the understory, and seedlings showed strong plastic responses to variation in light. Seedling relative growth rate, leaf area production rate, and maximum carbon assimilation rates of Alseis are much more similar to those of the pioneer tree Miconia argentea than to those of the non-pioneer tree Tetragastris panamensis. However, in contrast to Miconia, established seedlings of Alseis are capable of remarkable persistence in the understory; in a 1-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, the mortality rate for 722 saplings <1 cm dbh was <4% per year between 1986 and 1998. We suspect that shade tolerance in Alseis is achieved by both physiological and morphological adaptations, e.g., efficient light interception by thin, nonoverlapping leaves, tolerance to litterfall damage, and a high resprouting capacity. These results show that existing functional group classifications do not account for the full range of seedling trait combinations found in tropical trees and indicate that a gap requirement for seedling establishment need not limit the abundance of adult individuals in a stand.																	0012-9658					APR	2001	82	4					933	945									WOS:000168135100003						
J	Ruhland, CT; Day, TA				Ruhland, CT; Day, TA			Size and longevity of seed banks in Antarctica and the influence of ultraviolet-B radiation on survivorship, growth and pigment concentrations of Colobanthus quitensis seedlings	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Populations of Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, the only two vascular plant species native to Antarctica, are increasing. We performed a seed bank assay to determine the persistence of seeds from intact vegetation/soil cores collected near Palmer Station on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Vegetation/soil cores were cold stratified at 3 degreesC for >4 years. Subsequent seed bank densities, estimated from seedlings germinated, averaged 847 and 5645 seedlings m(-2) for C. quitensis and D. antarctica. respectively. We also conducted germination trials on C. quitensis seeds collected at our field site and stored for either 120 days or >4 years at 3 degreesC. Germination rates ranged from 6% after 120 days of cold storage to 38% after >4 years of cold storage. These findings show that previous estimates of seed bank densities and germination rates in these species. based on short-term laboratory stratification experiments. may underestimate there found in the field. Stratospheric ozone depletion has lead to increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-320 nm) along the Antarctic Peninsula during the austral spring. In a separate experiment we manipulated levels of biologically effective UV-B (UV-B-BE), over current-year C. quitensis seedlings near Palmer Station on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula by placing frames over them that either held filters that absorbed most UV-B-BE ('reduced UV-B-BE'). transmitted most UV-B-BE ('near-ambient UV-B-BE') or had no filters ('ambient UV-B-BE). We monitored seedling survivorship over the course of the growing season (January-March) and growth acid pigment concentrations at the end of the season. There were no UV-B,, treatment effects on seedling survivorship oc er the course of the season and overwinter survivorship averaged 12%. However, seedlings growing under near-ambient and ambient UV-B-BE had 25 and 48% smaller total leaf areas, 7 and 16% fewer leaves and 65 and 82% fewer branches, respectively, than those growing under reduced UV-B-BE. In addition, concentrations of methanol-soluble UV-B-absorbing compounds were 26% higher and concentrations of chlorophyll b were 26% lower in leaves of seedlings growing under ambient UV-B-BE compared with those under reduced UV-B-BE.

J	Grigulis, K; Sheppard, AW; Ash, JE; Groves, RH				Grigulis, K; Sheppard, AW; Ash, JE; Groves, RH			The comparative demography of the pasture weed Echium plantagineum between its native and invaded ranges	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Echium plantagineum is native to the western Mediterranean Basin, where it is a common, but not dominant, component of species-rich annual grasslands. Since its introduction into Australia, E. plantagineum has spread to infest vast areas of predominantly agricultural land in south-east and south-west Australia, where it can be the dominant pasture species. 2. To unravel the ecological factors responsible for the high population abundance of E. plantagineum in Australia, its demography was compared between sites in the invaded and native ranges. Demographic parameters of E. plantagineum populations were estimated at a site near Canberra in south-eastern Australia, and at a site near Evora in southern Portugal. Identical factorial experiments were set up at each site with treatment combinations of the presence or absence of grazing and pasture competition. 3. The recruitment, survival, fecundity and seed bank dynamics of E. plantagineum populations were measured for each of the treatment combinations over 2 years at each site. These data allowed the estimation of demographic parameters describing the proportion of E. plantagineum individuals moving from one life-cycle stage to the next. 4. Seedling establishment fractions were two to five times greater at Canberra than at Evora, and seed bank incorporation rates were three times greater at Canberra than Evora. These demographic differences were those most likely to play an important role in the greater abundance of E. plantagineum in Australia compared with Mediterranean Europe. Neither seed bank survival rates nor seed production differed between populations at Canberra and Evora, while seedling survival rates were always lower at Canberra than at Evora. 5. Neither grazing nor pasture competition limited the seed production or seedling survival of E. plantagineum populations at Evora more than at Canberra. 6. An effective approach for the control of E. plantagineum in Australia may thus be through the reduction of the seedling establishment fraction. This may be achieved by maintaining significant pasture vegetation cover and reducing the available space for E. plantagineum establishment during autumn.

J	Buckland, SM; Thompson, K; Hodgson, JG; Grime, JP				Buckland, SM; Thompson, K; Hodgson, JG; Grime, JP			Grassland invasions: effects of manipulations of climate and management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Climate change, in combination with the impacts of land use, will give rise to new opportunities for grassland invasion. This paper reports on the repercussions of a field experiment. 2. Plant species, sown into experimental plots as part of a 6-year study investigating factors limiting the success of seedling invasions, were resurveyed in 1999, 3 years after terminating experimental manipulations of climate, soil fertility and disturbance. 3. The most dramatic observation was the protracted expansion in populations of Brachypodium pinnatum, despite being at the northern limit of its distribution in Britain. In contrast, all other sown species, including those of both southern and widespread distribution in Britain, had become extinct, declined or remained unchanged in abundance. 4. Patterns of establishment were strongly deterministic. Populations of the southern grass, B. pinnatum, were highest in areas of the experimental plots unamended by fertilizer and physical disturbance, but expansion was apparently promoted by cessation of management. Among invaders of widespread distribution, two were dependent upon fertilizer addition (Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis glomerata), one significantly increased its cover with a combination of fertilizer and disturbance (Holcus lanatus), and one benefited from disturbance (Plantago lanceolata). 5. Two southern perennials, Origanum vulgare and Senecio erucifolius, both remained present in 1999 in plots that were formerly heated and subject to drought (1991-96), whereas they had become extinct in control plots. 6. Although the most successful invader was a rhizomatous perennial grass, an alternative strategy for survival and expansion was revealed after the severe drought in 1995: gap recolonization by annuals with a persistent seed bank. 7. Most notably, this study revealed the hidden potential of a native species to establish beyond its current range of distribution and, contrary to many recognized weeds, the capacity to achieve dominance in the absence of eutrophication or disturbance. This highlights the potent effects of climate change when plant traits effective for establishment coincide with the removal of current barriers to dispersal.																	0021-8901					APR	2001	38	2					301	309									WOS:000168691500007						
J	Rees, M; Hill, RL				Rees, M; Hill, RL			Large-scale disturbances, biological control and the dynamics of gorse populations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Simulation and analytical models were developed for gorse Ulex europaeus. The simulation model incorporated spatially local density-dependent competition, disturbance, asymmetric competition between seedlings and established plants, a seed bank, local seed dispersal, an age structured established plant population, and temporal variation in the probability of disturbance. The analytical models were simple approximations of the simulation. 2. The models extended our previously published model for Scotch broom Cytisus scoparius to include large-scale disturbances and possible management options, such as the use of fire, herbicides and oversewing with perennial grasses. Fire was assumed to influence established plant mortality, seed survival in the seed bank, and the probability of germination. 3. We reviewed published data on the demography of gorse in New Zealand, the current management techniques, and the ongoing biological control programme. 4. Over a wide range of biologically reasonable parameter values, the analytical models accurately predicted the outcome of the simulations. The analytical models worked well, providing gorse occupied a high proportion of the available sites and large-scale disturbances did not occur too frequently. 5. The potential impact of seed-feeding biological control agents on gorse abundance was assessed, using the models, for several environmental and management scenarios. In particular, we explored how large-scale disturbance, such as fire and herbicide application, influences the outcome of biological control. 6. The success of a biological control programme was found to depend critically on the frequency and intensity of disturbance, whether disturbed sites became suitable for recruitment, and the effects of disturbance on germination and seed mortality. 7. The models highlight the need to manage recruitment opportunities carefully in order to maximize the effect of biological control agents. The models also indicate that details of plant population biology can have a profound effect on the success of any management strategy.																	0021-8901					APR	2001	38	2					364	377		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00598.x							WOS:000168691500012						
J	Mandak, B; Pysek, P				Mandak, B; Pysek, P			Fruit dispersal and seed banks in Atriplex sagittata: the role of heterocarpy	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Atriplex sagittata, an arly succesional, annual species of disturbed habitats in Central Europe, produces three types of fruits. We studied the differences in dispersal between the fruit types in order to investigate their ecological roles. 2 The typical positive relationship between dispersal ability and germinability is not found in this species. Type A (ebracteate) fruits produced deeply dormant seeds and had the lowest dispersal potential, but of the two fruits with bracts, type B, with dormant seeds, was better dispersed by both water and wind than type C, which produces non-dormant seeds. 3 Wind, temperature and precipitation have significant effects on fruit release but their effects differ between fruit types. The release of fruit types with bracts was positively correlated with wind whereas all fruit types tended to be negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature range. 4 Type C fruit, which contains non-dormant seed, are absent from the soil in summer and have a Type II transient seed bank. Type A and B fruits, containing dormant seeds, form a persistent seed bank. 5 Heterocarpy, where fruit types show distinct ecological behaviour, enables colonizing species such as A. sagittata to survive both major disturbance (by ensuring that some seeds persist) and unfavourable conditions (by spreading germination over a long period). 6 In A. sagittata, seed dynamics can be explained by the germination behaviour of seeds produced by the three types of fruit. All fruit types mature in autumn, but few of Type A fall from the mother plant until spring, when germination is probably inhibited because of insufficient stratification. Type C fruit, however show peak dispersal in winter and the majority of these non-dormant seeds are able to germinate as soon as conditions become more suitable.

J., T. P SPIRA (Department of Biological Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina 29634) AND W C. BRIDGES, JR. (Department of Experimental Statistics, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina 29634). Effects of habitat, burial, age and passage through birds on germination and establishment of Chinese tallow toe in coastal South Carolina. J. Torrey Hot. Sec. 128:000-000. 2001. - Factors affecting germination and seedling establishment of the nonindigenous, invasive Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.) were investigated under greenhouse and held conditions. In greenhouse experiments, buried seeds had higher germination rates and percentages than surface seeds, and simulated and actual seed passage through the avian gut enhanced germination. One year of aging reduced germination and seed viability, particularly for seeds unhandled by birds. In the field, seedling emergence and survival were greater in mixed pine-hardwood forest than in pine-turkey oak forest or spoil areas. Planting date did not affect overall seedling emergence or survival. Seeds sown in March 1998 and 1999 in five coastal forests that contained established tallow trees emerged throughout the growing season. While seedling emergence rates varied, final seedling numbers were similar across habitats in 1998, but were lower and differed across habitats in 1999. Recruitment was thus spatially and temporally variable. Viability of seeds buried for one and two years ranged from 16 to 69% in the five habitats, but did not differ among habitats or length of burial time. Because habitat type did not affect seed dormancy (both years) and final seedling number (1998 only), we conclude that other factors influence the differential success of tallow trees among coastal forests in South Carolina. Management strategies (e.g., fire) should consider the seedling phenology and seed bank capability of tallow tree.																	0040-9618					APR-JUN	2001	128	2					109	119		10.2307/3088733							WOS:000169604900002						
J	Holzel, N; Otte, A				Holzel, N; Otte, A			The impact of flooding regime on the soil seed bank of flood-meadows	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												We assessed the significance of flooding for the floristic composition of seed banks in flood-meadows of the northern valley of the Upper Rhine. We compared three hydrological compartments of the alluvial plain, consisting of the regularly flooded land between the river and low summer dykes (functional flood-plain), the occasionally flooded land between summer dykes and high winter dykes (hybrid flood-plain) and the land behind the winter dykes, which is now only submerged by ascending groundwater (fossil flood-plain). Due to their different flooding regime, the three compartments should differ with respect to the prevailing conditions of diaspore input. The seed density of soil samples increased with the duration of flooding in the three compartments, while species richness and the proportion of species not occurring in the vegetation was constant. The increase in seed density can be largely attributed to an increase of disturbance indicators, which are present in the above-ground vegetation and capable of forming a long-term persistent seed bank. No effects of flooding on the composition of seed banks in the three flood-plain compartments were found. The differences in seed bank composition can be largely explained by corresponding differences in above-ground vegetation and former and present-day meadow management. Seeds of species absent from above-ground vegetation can be attributed to the local species pool present in the immediate vicinity of the study plots. We discuss consequences of the results for the restoration of species-rich flood-plain meadows.

J	Laterra, P; Solbrig, OT				Laterra, P; Solbrig, OT			Dispersal strategies, spatial heterogeneity and colonization success in fire-managed grasslands	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Interactions between fire regime, dispersal strategies and patch structure were examined as key issues for the management of floristic composition of grasslands, through a model that simulates the population dynamics of two competing fire-cued and non-sprouting species. The model describes a heterogeneous environment composed by several patches of grassland, only related by seed dispersal. The last burn date at each patch determines the accumulation level of fuel-biomass provided by a third, dominant species, which in turn controls for the exclusion rate of both colonizer species. The population dynamics of both species was approached following density-dependent models and parameterized for two opposite dispersal strategies: low spatial and high temporal dispersion of seeds (type 1), high spatial and low temporal dispersion of seeds (type 2). Only under the most variable scenarios (when non-synchronous and irregular fire regimes were combined with a proportion of patches (p) with initially depleted seed banks) did the relative success of dispersal strategies vary with the length of the lire-free period. Irrespective of p, smaller interval lengths favored the postburn density of the strategy 1. Strategy 2 was favored over strategy 1 when the fire-free interval increased, such difference being maximum for intermediate p-values. These general tendencies agree with those observed from a reference system: the Flooding Pampa grasslands dominated by Paspalum quadrifarium where short no-fire intervals promote the postburn abundance of a type 1 species (Lotus tenuis) over two type 2 species (Carduus acanthoides and Cirsium vulgare) while for long fire-free intervals the opposite is true. This results suggest that frequency, time since last burn, and burning synchrony are useful components of a fire regime to take advantage of variation in dispersal strategies.

J	Khurana, E; Singh, JS				Khurana, E; Singh, JS			Ecology of tree seed and seedlings: Implications for tropical forest conservation and restoration	CURRENT SCIENCE												Seed and seedling traits vary strongly across the tropical forest biome to cope with the variations in the distribution and amount of rainfall, light, temperature and soil nutrient regimes, and the intensity of predation and disturbance. Proportion of species producing dormant seeds increases along a gradient of dryness and unpredictability of rainfall. Seed longevity is generally higher for dry tropical than for wet tropical species. Environmental variables and the dispersal syndrome have led to the selection for and production of different seed sizes, with implications for germination and seedling establishment in different situations, and for the build up of persistent soil seed bank. Seeds have evolved mechanisms to recognize environmental cues which enable them to confine their germination in particular periods and locations to allow for a greater probability of seedling establishment and survival. While for a majority of wet tropical species gap dependency and shade tolerance are important, seedlings of many dry tropical species show shade dependence, Successional hierarchy is frequently reflected in ecological requirements for germination and seedling fitness. Field microsites represent multiple-variable cues for germination and establishment. Knowledge on the ecology of germination and seedling growth is vital, not only for understanding the community processes of plant recruitment and succession, but also for developing strategies for the conservation of biodiversity and restoration of tropical forests.																	0011-3891					MAR 25	2001	80	6					748	757									WOS:000167950200012						
J	Augusto, L; Dupouey, JL; Picard, JF; Ranger, J				Augusto, L; Dupouey, JL; Picard, JF; Ranger, J			Potential contribution of the seed bank in coniferous plantations to the restoration of native deciduous forest vegetation	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In this study, we compared the soil seed bank and current vegetation under coniferous plantations and adjacent native deciduous forests. The objective was to assess how much of the initial plant diversity is retained in such plantations, and the potential to restore this initial plant community from seed bank in case of reversion to broadleave stands. Four stands growing side by side and with different dominant species were selected at two locations (site of Haye: Quercus petraea, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies; site of La Petite-Pierre: Quercus petraea, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies). In each stand, ground vegetation was surveyed and soil seed bank was sampled. Composition of ground flora and seed bank of stands were quite different: only 11 to 30% of the species were in both the ground flora and the seed bank. Composition of the seed bank was mainly influenced by site location and sylvicultural practices such as the type of afforestation or the tree cover. Species richness of seed banks and vegetation were higher in the site of Haye than in the site of La Petite-Pierre. Seedling density strongly decreased with stand age. Whereas between 65 and 86 % of species found in the ground vegetation of native deciduous stand were also present in the understory or the seed bank of mature coniferous stands, this was only about 50 % in young coniferous stands. Species of deciduous stands which were absent from coniferous stands were typical of old forests. In contrast, species mainly found in the coniferous stands were often ruderal. In the studied areas, it would be possible to restore up to 86 % of the native deciduous forest vegetation, but some plant species typical of ancient forests may have disappeared during the coniferous stage.

J	Reuss, SA; Buhler, DD; Gunsolus, JL				Reuss, SA; Buhler, DD; Gunsolus, JL			Effects of soil depth and aggregate size on weed seed distribution and viability in a silt loam soil	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The position of weed seeds within the soil matrix plays an important role in seedling emergence and seed survival. The relationship of weed seeds with soil aggregates and soil depth was evaluated in a Waukegon silt loam soil that had been under a long-term, conventional tillage, annual crop management system. Soil aggregates were separated and classified into eight size classes from less than or equal to5 to >12 mm and weed seeds were extracted from the aggregates. Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters), Polygonum pensylvanicum L. (Pennsylvania smartweed), Setaria faberi Herrm. (giant foxtail), and Solanum ptycanthum Dun. (eastern black nightshade) accounted for the majority of seeds recovered. In general, seed viability declined from April to June, but increased in October following seed deposition. Seeds of individual species were most abundant in the aggregate size class most closely matching its seed size. However, seeds were commonly found associated with aggregates larger than 9 mm. Highest seed viability was found in the aggregate fraction closest to the seed size, however, S. faberi viability was also high in the >12 mm aggregate size class. Regardless of aggregate size, seed numbers were generally greatest in the upper 5 cm of soil. The results of this research were species-dependent and variable and demonstrated the complexity of weed seed/soil aggregate associations. However, they did show that seed placement within the soil matrix may play an important role in weed population dynamics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Oswald, A; Ransom, JK				Oswald, A; Ransom, JK			Striga control and improved farm productivity using crop rotation	CROP PROTECTION												Crop rotations with crops that are non-hosts of Striga were evaluated to reduce the Striga seed bank in the soil and increase farm productivity. Field experiments were conducted at two sites in western Kenya from 1996 to 1998 to study the effect of eight different crop rotations on Striga populations, Striga seed bank in the soil, maize yields and overall productivity of these cropping systems under low-input rainfed field conditions. A variety of crops, such as peanut, soybean, sunflower, pigeon pea showed greater economic potential than maize. The productivity of the best rotation under low soil fertility conditions was five times greater than maize mono-cropping. All crop rotation treatments reduced Striga seed numbers in the soil. Less Striga emerged if maize was planted after a two- season rotation that included pigeon pea. Crop rotation is probably one of the most effective ways to reduce Striga infestations and increase maize yields and income considering the limited resource base of small-scale subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.

Seedbank composition and species' abundance were determined with the seedling emergence method. By using the Braun-Blanquet method, five main vegetation units were identified in concordance with results obtained for the standing vegetation. A total of 108 species were recorded in the seedbank, which represents c. 50 per cent of the species recorded in the standing vegetation of the total study area. Seven annual species (3 per cent) were unique to the soil seedbank. On community level, similarity in species composition between the standing vegetation and the soil seedbank ranged between 39.2 per cent and 48.8 per cent, with a similarity of 54.3 per cent for the total study area. Annual and perennial species' similarity in species composition between the standing vegetation and the seed bank totalled 74.8 per cent and 43.1 per cent respectively. Post-mining topsoil replacement as well as seeding and transplanting of selected local species will be essential to revegetate this area.

J	Dugdale, TM; De Winton, MD; Clayton, JS				Dugdale, TM; De Winton, MD; Clayton, JS			Burial limits to the emergence of aquatic plant propagules	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The sediment depth limits to germling emergence were determined for five common New Zealand submerged plants. A significant trend was observed of declining emergence with increasing burial depth. Emergence from small oospores (13-16 mug) of Nitella pseudoflabellata A. Br. and Nitella leplostachys A. Br. was limited to the surface sediment (< 25 mm). Potamogeton ochreatus Raoul seed (1460 mug) emerged from < 50 mm depth. Chara corallina Willd. oospores (148 mug) emerged from burial depths of at least 50-75 mm, while Chara globularis Thuill. oospores (50 mug) were able to emerge from the maximum tested depth of 100 mm. The observation that burial limits to emergence by Chara species were at least twice that of the much larger P, ochreatus seed is at odds with theory that the size of propagule reserves act to determine emergence ability. However, it is in keeping with suggested energy efficiency of shoot extension in the macroalgae versus vascular species. Results indicate that assessment of submerged seed banks should concentrate on the upper 50 mm of sediment which contains most "ecologically active" propagules.																	0028-8330					MAR	2001	35	1					147	153		10.1080/00288330.2001.9516984							WOS:000168517300011						
J	Carmona, R; Boas, HDDV				Carmona, R; Boas, HDDV			The dynamics of Bidens pilosa seeds in the soil	PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA												Bidens pilosa L. seeds were buried at 0 cm and 10 cm depths in the soil, with or without millet mulch, to test the effect of these variables on seed viability and dormancy during one year. The numbers of germinated and firm seeds were evaluated; the remained firm seeds in the soil were germinated in two environmental conditions, to estimate seed viability and dormancy, respectively. The germination and decay of seeds were more intense on the soil surface. Seed depletion was higher during the first rainy season and decreased during the dry season until the second rainy season. The mulch had no effect on seed depletion, probably due to its fast decomposition and no subsequent reposition. These results show that the concentration of B. pilosa seeds on the soil surface, by practices such as no-tillage, can increase seedling emergence on short-term, which demands weed control practices, but at long-term it increases the depletion rate of the seed bank in the soil.																	0100-204X					MAR	2001	36	3					457	463		10.1590/S0100-204X2001000300009							WOS:000169372200009						
J	Skinner, R; Sheldon, F; Walker, KF				Skinner, R; Sheldon, F; Walker, KF			Propagules in dry wetland sediments as indicators of ecological health: Effects of salinity	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												Indicators of ecological health are problematic for wetlands in dry regions because distinctive communities are associated with dry and wet phases of indefinite duration. The propagule bank. including the resting stages of aquatic animals and plants, maintains the community's capacity to recover from drought or disturbance. This paper records observations of invertebrates, protists and algae emerging in laboratory microcosms following the inundation of dry sediments from two temporary lakes on the River Murray floodplain in South Australia. A simple experiment carried out on the sediment from one lake showed that increased salinity was associated with lower diversity (richness) but higher abundance of emergent organisms. The effect on diversity was evident at salinities above 11-17 mS cm(-1), and the effect on abundances was evident above 6-11 mS cm(-1) (salinity here is indicated by electrical conductivity at 25 degreesC), These data suggest that propagule banks may be useful as complementary indicators of wetland health.

J	Ailstock, MS; Norman, CM; Bushmann, PJ				Ailstock, MS; Norman, CM; Bushmann, PJ			Common reed Phragmites australis: Control and effects upon biodiversity in freshwater nontidal wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Phragmites australis (common reed) has expanded in many wetland habitats. Its ability to exclude other plant species has led to both control and eradication programs. This study examined two control methods-herbicide application or a herbicide-burning combination-for their efficacy and ability to restore plant biodiversity in non-tidal wetlands. Two Phragmites-dominated sites received the herbicide glyphosate. One of these sites was burned following herbicide application. Plant and soil macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity were evaluated pre-treatment and every year for four years post-treatment using belt transects. The growth of Phragmites propagules-seeds, rhizomes, and rooted shoots-was examined in the greenhouse and under bare, burned, or vegetated soil conditions. Both control programs greatly reduced Phragmites abundance and increased plant biodiversity. Plant re-growth was quicker on the herbicide-burn site, with presumably a more rapid return to wetland function. Re-growth at both sites depended upon a pre-existing, diverse soil seed bank. There were no directed changes in soil macroin-vertebrate abundance or diversity and they appeared unaffected by changes in the plant community. Phragmites seeds survived only on bare soils, while buried rhizomes survived under all soil conditions. This suggests natural seeding of disturbed soils and inadvertent human planting of rhizomes as likely avenues for Phragmites colonization. Herbicide control, with or without burning, can reduce Phragmites abundance and increase plant biodiversity temporarily. These changes do not necessarily lead to a more diverse animal community. Moreover, unless Phragmites is eradicated and further human disturbance is prohibited, it will Likely eventually re-establish dominance.																	1061-2971					MAR	2001	9	1					49	59		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009001049.x							WOS:000167428700006						
J	Rowland, J; Maun, MA				Rowland, J; Maun, MA			Restoration ecology of an endangered plant species: Establishment of new populations of Cirsium pitcheri	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												We determined the effects of shade, burial by sand, simulated herbivory, and fertilizers on the survival and growth of artificially planted population of Cirsium pitcheri-an endangered plant species of the sand dunes along Lake Huron. Sand burial experiments showed that greenhouse grown plants should optimally be transplanted into areas receiving 5 cm of sand deposition: burial at this depth maximized emergence, survivorship, and below-ground biomass. Under field conditions, simulated herbivory of up to 50% of the plant height produced a slight increase in biomass after one year of growth. Field observations showed that when white-tailed deer removed more than 50% of the transplant's leaf tissue, the plant died. The application of a 20:20:20 (N:P:K) water-soluble fertilizer produced a significant increase in the dry leaf biomass, total leaf area, and total dry biomass relative to control plants. We also tested for the presence or absence of a persistent seed bank. Few seeds were recovered from soil samples collected from Finery Provincial Park and Providence Bay. However, C. pitcheri has the ability to form a persistent seed bank under field conditions but only at soil depths of greater than or equal to 15 cm. Cirsium pitcheri seeds are able to germinate and seedlings can emerge from a burial depth of up to 6 cm. Thus, seeds planted in open, sunny areas will probably maximize emergence, growth, and survivorship of seedlings. Populations of C. pitcheri can be restored by planting seeds at shallow depths, transplanting greenhouse-grown plants, applying water soluble fertilizers, and protecting plants from herbivores.																	1061-2971					MAR	2001	9	1					60	70		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009001060.x							WOS:000167428700007						
J	Holmes, PM				Holmes, PM			Shrubland restoration following woody alien invasion and mining: Effects of topsoil depth, seed source, and fertilizer addition	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Invasion by woody alien plants, construction, and mining operations are among the major disturbances degrading vegetation in the Cape Floristic Kingdom, South Africa. The aim of this study was to assess whether native fynbos shrubland vegetation could be restored following dense alien invasion and disturbance by mining. An area supporting dense alien trees was cleared and topsoil was stripped and stockpiled to simulate mining disturbance. A field trial investigated the effects of topsoil depth, seed mix application, and fertilizer on native species recruitment and vegetation development over a three-year period. Soil-stored seed banks contributed 60% of the species recruited, indicating that areas invaded for three decades have good restoration potential. The addition of a fynbos seed mix, which included serotinous overstory species, improved both the richness and structural composition of the vegetation. Most species sown in untopsoiled plots established, but survival and growth was low compared to topsoil plots. Poor growth in combination with a lack of soil seed bank species, indicate that restoring a diverse and functional cover of indigenous vegetation on subsoil is not possible in the short-term. Soil amelioration is required to improve rooting conditions and initiate ecosystem processes. Shallow and deep topsoil treatments yielded high plant density, richness, and projected canopy cover, but canopy cover was higher in deep topsoil plots throughout the trial. Fertilizer addition increased canopy cover in untopsoiled and shallow topsoil plots via an increase in alien annual species. Fertilizer addition ultimately may lead to increased native vegetation cover in untopsoiled areas, but as it increased proteoid mortality on deep topsoil plots, it is not recommended for sites where topsoil is available. A species-rich and structurally representative fynbos community may be restored on topsoiled areas provided that the native disturbance regime is simulated and seeds of major structural guilds not present in the soil seed bank are included in the seed mix.																	1061-2971					MAR	2001	9	1					71	84		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009001071.x							WOS:000167428700008						
J	Vleeshouwers, LM; Bouwmeester, HJ				Vleeshouwers, LM; Bouwmeester, HJ			A simulation model for seasonal changes in dormancy and germination of weed seeds	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												A model has been developed to simulate the annual dormancy cycle of seeds of light-requiring species in the seed bank and the germination of exhumed seeds after irradiation. Simulation of dormancy and germination is based on a physiological model concerning the action of phytochrome in the seed. Dormancy is related to the amount of a hypothetical phytochrome receptor, which fluctuates in an annual pattern. Relief of dormancy is equivalent to an increase in the amount of receptor, and induction of dormancy is equivalent to a decrease in the amount of receptor. Annual changes in temperature are the driving force for annual changes in the amount of phytochrome receptor in seeds that are buried in the seed bank. From the average amount of phytochrome receptor in the seeds of a population, the model calculates the germination percentage that is reached when a seed sample from the population is exhumed, irradiated and incubated at a given temperature in darkness. In the model, relief of dormancy results in a widening of the range of temperatures over which germination can occur, and induction of dormancy results in a narrowing of this range. Model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to data from a burial experiment with seeds of Polygonum persicaria L., Chenopodium album L. and Spergula arvensis L. At regular time intervals during 3 years, subsamples of these seeds were exhumed and tested for germination in the laboratory. The simulation model gave a good description of the observed cyclic changes in germinability of exhumed seeds.

J	Buhler, DD; Hartzler, RG				Buhler, DD; Hartzler, RG			Emergence and persistence of seed of velvetleaf, common waterhemp, woolly cupgrass, and giant foxtail	WEED SCIENCE												Annual emergence and seed persistence of common waterhemp, velvetleaf, woolly cupgrass, and giant foxtail were characterized in central Iowa for 4 yr following burial of seeds collected and buried in autumn 1994. First-year emergence as a percentage of the original seed bank ranged from 5 to 40%, and the relative order was common waterhemp < velverleaf < giant foxtail < woolly cupgrass. During the second and third years, there were no differences in percent emergence among species, with emergence percentages ranging from 1 to 9% of the original seed bank. During the fourth year, seedlings continued to emerge from only the velveleaf and common waterhemp seed banks. A greater percentage of common waterhemp seed persisted each year and 12% of the original seed was recovered after 4 yr of burial. Five percent of the velvedeaf was recovered at the end of the fourth year. No woolly cupgrass and giant foxtail seed was recovered after the third and fourth years. The proportion of the seed that was accounted for from year to year through emergence and seed recovery varied by species and year. Total recovery of velvetleaf ranged from 61 to 87%, common waterhemp from 50 to 81% woolly cupgrass from 29 to 79%, and giant foxtail from 23 to 79%. Based on the results of this research, velvetleaf and common waterhemp form more persistent seed banks than woolly cupgrass and giant foxtail. Therefore, woolly cupgrass and giant foxtail should be more amenable to management through seed bank deletion than velvetleaf and common waterhemp.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	2001	49	2					230	235		10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0230:EAPOSO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000175241500014						
J	Cavan, G; Cussans, J; Moss, S				Cavan, G; Cussans, J; Moss, S			Managing the risks of herbicide resistance in wild oat	WEED SCIENCE												A single dominant mutation conferring resistance to aryloxyphenoxyprop ion ate (AOPP) and cyclohexanedione (CHD) herbicides was incorporated into a quantitative model for the population development of wild oat. The model was used to predict the times required to develop field resistance in a number of different scenarios. Field resistance was defined as a threshold of four plants m(-2) surviving herbicide treatment, and in most scenarios, a very large proportion of these plants were resistant. The model predicts that plow cultivation could delay the development of resistance relative to tine cultivation. With an initial seed bank of 100 Seeds m(-2) and annual use of AOPP/CHD herbicides, which kill 90% of susceptible but no resistant plants, field resistance develops in 15 yr with annual tine cultivation 10 cm deep but only after 23 yr with annual plowing 20 cm deep. The model predicts that herbicide rotation can dramatically increase the times required for field resistance to develop in a tine cultivation system. With annual use of AOPP/CHD herbicides, field resistance develops in 15 yr, whereas using alternative modes of action 1 in 2 yr delays field resistance to 28 yr. The model predicts that resistance can be delayed for at least 66 yr if three herbicides, each with a different mode of action, are rotated and each herbicide causes 90% mortality. The model predictions on the number of years required for field resistance to develop are not highly sensitive to the initial density of the seed bank (range modeled = 10(2) to 10(4), the mutation rate for resistance (10(-4) to 10(-7) per generation), the rate of outcrossing (0.1 to 100%) or the herbicide kill rare (80 to 95%).

Temporal evolution of a population of rapeseed volunteers in a field	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The aim of model GENESYS is to rank cropping systems according to their risk of gene escape from genetically modified, herbicide tolerant winter oilseed rape cultivars to rapeseed volunteers. The model integrates the effects of crop succession and crop management at the level of a region. The first part of the model presented in this paper describes the temporal evolution of rapeseed volunteers in a field, using an annual Life-cycle comprising stages such as seed bank, seedlings, adult plants, Rowers or freshly produced seeds. The relationships between the various stages depend on the crops grown each year and the cultivation techniques (stubble breaking, soil tillage, sowing date and density, herbicides, cutting and harvesting). Parameter values were either deduced from existing models and literature, or estimated from experimental studies and field surveys.

J	Burke, A				Burke, A			Determining landscape function and ecosystem dynamics: Contribution to ecological restoration in the southern Namib desert	AMBIO												The southern Namib is characterized by high biodiversity, changes in winter and summer rainfall, extreme climatic conditions and associated geomorphologic processes, a paucity of ecological knowledge, and multiple environmental threats posed by conflicting development options. With the long-term view to establish a research initiative focussing on restoration ecology in the southern Namib Desert, this article provides a review of current ecological knowledge and proposes potential research priorities. The aims of a research initiative would be twofold. On the academic side, understanding processes operating at different scales will be critical to develop methods of ecological restoration suitable for southern Namib ecosystems. On the practical side, the development of appropriate methods will focus on facilitating ecological processes such as restoration of biologically active substrate, natural succession, and concentration of limited resources. The function of landscapes, plant-soil interface, soil-, vegetation- and plant population dynamics will likely provide some of the answers for ecological restoration.																	0044-7447					FEB	2001	30	1					29	36		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0029:DLFAED]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000167684900005	11351790					
J	Auld, TD; Denham, AJ				Auld, TD; Denham, AJ			The impact of seed predation by mammals on post-fire seed accumulation in the endangered shrub Grevillea caleyi (Proteaceae)	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Over several fruiting seasons, the fates of seeds placed in recently burnt habitats, and one habitat unburnt for more than 10 years, were used to examine the impact of fire on seed predation levels in the endangered species Grevillea caleyi from southeastern Australia. Native rodents. Rattus fuscipes, and macropods. Wallabia bicolor, were responsible for seed losses after seeds fell below parent plants. Virtually all seeds (99-100%) were lost to these mammals for the first two fruiting seasons after a wildfire. Such losses usually exceeded pre-fire loss estimates or estimates from a site unburnt for more than 10 years. There was no significant difference in seed losses to mammals in three recently burnt sites over four fruiting seasons. However, there was a slight trend for some seed escape (seed losses 91-97%) acid a slowing of the rate of seed loss in the fourth fruiting season after fire. Time since the last fire accounted for some 60% of the estimated variation in magnitude of seed losses to mammals. These results suggest that in the endangered, fire-sensitive G. caleyi, replenishment of the soil seed bank after fire is severely retarded by mammal seed predation. The implications are that after a fire, G. caleyi should be protected from the risk of a future fire well beyond three times the primary juvenile period in the species or local extinction will occur.

At the four elevations, six replicates of 50 seeds each, from each of the four elevational sources, were buried at 5 cm depth in mesh envelopes, placed in wire cages to protect against predation. Seeds were retrieved 1,2 and 3 years after burial, and numbers of ungerminated seeds, and of those that remained viable, were determined. 3 At all elevations of seed burial, increasing proportions of seeds remained ungerminated, and proportionately more of the ungerminated seeds remained viable, as elevation of source of seed increased. For seed from low elevation, more seeds remained viable in the soil at the higher burial sites. However, for the seeds from higher elevation sources, seeds remaining viable were similar in number at all sites for seed burial. Half-lives of seed buried at the source elevation, calculated from the log-logistic distribution, increased with elevation, and ranged from 188 days at 1600 m to 354 days at 3400 m. 4 The results suggest that the propensity to form a persistent seed bank in P. secunda increases with elevation. Seeds from the highest elevations had the longest persistence, and this was largely unaffected by soil preservation conditions. Seeds from lower elevations survived for less time, and this was modifiable by preservation conditions. These results suggest that both selective effects and soil conditions may be involved in soil seed bank expression in the alpine environment.

Two null hypotheses were tested regarding how the sowing date influenced the weed flora. 1. There is no relationship between the weed flora composition and sowing date. A pCCA (with geographic regions, crop species and soil types as covariables) clearly refuted this hypothesis. Hence, the composition of the weed flora varied depending on sowing date. 2. Species classified as summer annuals, winter annuals and germination generalists (that can germinate substantially in both spring and autumn) do not differ in their placement along the first ordination avis in the pCCA, i.e. according to sowing date. An ANOVA was unable to reject this hypothesis. Hence, germination syndrome classification did nut explain the observed community differences related to sowing date. These results illustrate the importance of the date of disturbance for any secondary succession involving a seed bank and also the importance of annual dormancy cycles in seed banks.

J	Dzwonko, Z				Dzwonko, Z			Migration of vascular plant species to a recent wood adjoining ancient woodland	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Woodland communities can be restored by natural succession in sites adjoining ancient woodlands which can act as seed sources for trees, shrubs and woodland herbs. The influence of dominant tree species and the distance from an adjacent ancient oak-hornbeam woodland upon the floristic composition of species in a recent pine wood planted on dry rendzina soil were studied. It was found that, in spite of a 52-year long succession, the border between woods was sharp and the composition of species in the recent wood were significantly different than in the adjacent ancient woodland. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the distance to the ancient woodland had a significant influence on species distributions in the recent wood. The numbers of species from the Querco-Fagetea class, vegetatively reproducing species and myrmecochores decreased with this distance, whereas the numbers of anemochores increased. The migration rate of many woodland species, calculated on occurrence of the farthest individuals was very slow, varying from 0.0 m year(-1) to 0.38 m year(-1). The restoration of the field layer vegetation in the studied pine wood was much slower than in recent deciduous woods on rich and moist soils where the migration rate of some species exceeded 1.50 m year(-1). Recent woods adjacent to ancient woodlands can be more effectively colonised by woodland species only when they are dominated by broad-leaved trees with quickly decomposing litter, and the spatial continuity of these woods persists for a long period.																	0001-6977						2001	70	1					71	77		10.5586/asbp.2001.010							WOS:000167898100010

The results suggest that the seed bank realised in natural conditions is poorer in species with high light requirements (the Ellenberg indicator values for light (L greater than or equal to 6) and their seedlings in comparison with the potential seed bank estimated in glasshouse conditions (field: A - 24; B - 17; C - 7, glasshouse : 44; 38; 32 species / 2 m(2), field: 321; 108; 14, glasshouse: 785; 1205; 177 seedlings / m(2), respectively).

Over 30 years the habitat conditions of the lake deteriorated and the phytolittoral was reduced from a zone 6 metres wide to one of only 2 metres. In addition, the number of submerged macrophyte species decreased by 50% and the frequency of most of the remaining species declined severalfold. No new species were encountered. Species retreating from the lake littoral included all Chara species, Potamogeton obtusifolius, P. natans and Hydrocharis morsus-ranae. A significant lowering of the phytosociological diversity and species richness of aquatic and swamp communities was observed. By 1994, six of the 12 associations identified in 1964 and representing the submerged and floating-leaved vegetation (e.g. Nitellopsidetum obtusae, Charetum asperae and Potamogetonetum compressi) were no longer present. In turn, 6 swamp communities from among the original 14 identified in the lake were lacking (e.g. Typhetum angustifoliae, Sagittatio-Sparganietum emersi and Eleocharitetum palustris). At the same time, two new aquatic and swamp communities appeared (Ranunculetum circinati, Myriophylletum spicati, Caricetum acutiformis and Caricetum distichae). In contrast there was an increase in the species richness of reedswamp communities due to an influx of marshland species. While the 1990s witnessed a distinct decrease in concentrations of nutrients in Lake Mikolajskie, the consequent increase in water transparency was not associated with an increase in the area of submerged macrophytes, or the species richness of aquatic vegetation.																	0001-6977						2001	70	4					323	334									WOS:000172799100009						
J	Shumway, SW; Banks, CR				Shumway, SW; Banks, CR			Species distributions in interdunal swale communities: The effects of soil waterlogging	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The influence of soil waterlogging in determining plant species distributions among interdunal swales and between dunes and swales on Cape Cod was investigated employing field and greenhouse experiments. Most species exhibited significant responses to experimental treatments that closely matched their distributions in the field. In general dune species such as Ammophila breviligulata and Solidago sempervirens grew poorly under waterlogged conditions. When transplanted to the dry sand dune all species grew poorly or died. Swale species exhibited a range of responses to waterlogging conditions. Growth of Juncus canadensis, Scirpus pungens and Vaccinium macrocarpon increased with waterlogging. Cyperus dentatus, Juncus pelocarpus and Solidago tenuifolia grew equally well across all waterlogging conditions and are present in most swales. Juncus greenei and Myrica pensylvanica grew best in drier swales and their distributions appear to be restricted to the perimeters of swales. Soil waterlogging is an important determinant of species distributions among swales and between swales and dunes. However, the effect of biotic factors such as competition, seed dispersal, soil seed banks and seedling recruitment needs to be examined as well to show how swale communities change over time.																	0003-0031					JAN	2001	145	1					137	146		10.1674/0003-0031(2001)145[0137:SDIISC]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000166715100015

J	Chapman, R; Asseng, S				Chapman, R; Asseng, S			An analysis of the frequency and timing of false break events in the Mediterranean region of Western Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Historical meteorological data were used to estimate the frequency and timing of false break events at 10 locations in the annual pasture and wheat producing area in the Mediterranean climatic region of Western Australia. The seasonal pattern of false breaks identified by this analysis was compared with the dynamics of dormancy release in a field population of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) to determine the influence that these events may have on the legume content of annual pasture communities in this region. False break events were estimated to occur on approximately 2 of every 3 years (61-72% of years) with no significant differences across the area investigated. Changes in the risk of false break events were examined over discrete time periods. The period of greatest risk was predicted to occur during early autumn (early March to mid April). Seed softening is virtually complete in subterranean clover at this point. The seed bank strategy of this species is, therefore, not well adapted to withstand the effects of false breaks. This might largely explain the poor persistence of subterranean clover in the annual pasture communities in the Mediterranean region of Western Australia. The legume content of these pastures might be improved by selecting species with late dormancy release strategies that will give better protection from false breaks.

J	Dear, BS; Virgona, JM; Sandral, GA; Swan, AD; Orchard, BA				Dear, BS; Virgona, JM; Sandral, GA; Swan, AD; Orchard, BA			Effect of companion perennial grasses and lucerne on seed yield and regeneration of subterranean clover in two wheatbelt environments	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Seed production of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) in mixtures with lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula (Schrader) Nees cv. Consol), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L. cv. Currie), phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L. cv. Sirolan), danthonia (Austrodanthonia richardsonii (Cashm.) H.P. Linder, cv. Taranna), and lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Aquarius) was compared with pure and degraded (invaded by annual volunteers) annual subterranean clover pasture at 2 sites (Junee and Kamarah) in the southern wheatbelt of New South Wales. Seed yields, clover seedlings in winter, and the change in the proportion of 3 subterranean clover cultivars (Dalkeith, Seaton Park, Goulburn) when grown with and without perennials were assessed. The effect of thinning the perennials to 10 plants/m(2) on clover seed set was examined at the drier site. Seed production of subterranean clover in the mixtures was depressed by up to 50% compared with the pure and degraded annual swards. Initial clover seed poduction in the mixtures was at least 60 kg/ha even in the drought year at the wetter site (Junee), and >85 kg/ha at Kamarah, the drier site (seedling establishment at Kamarah failed in the drought year). Clover seed reserves in the following 2 years progressively increased to >300 kg/ha in the perennial swards at Junee but were <100 kg/ha by the end of the third year at Kamarah. In comparison, seed reserves in the pure clover and degraded annual swards were >650 kg/ha at Junee and >350 kg/ha at Kamarah. Reducing perennial density to 10 plants/m(2) at the drier site increased clover seed yield about 3-fold in the first year compared with unthinned perennial swards. The increased seed yield was due to increased numbers of burrs set and increased seeds per burr and, in all perennial pasture treatments except lucerne, increased seed size. Clover seedling regeneration in 3rd and 4th year after sowing was substantially lower in the perennial-based mixtures than annual plots, with a significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation at both sites between clover seedling regeneration and seed bank size (1996, r(2) = 0.46-0.64; 1997, r(2) = 0.64-0.85). Following false breaks in early autumn, clover seedling populations were substantially higher in the pure and degraded clover treatments than in most perennial treatments. The proportion of the 3 cultivars present in the seed bank at the end of the pasture phase differed between sites but the sward type only influenced the proportion at the drier site. At the medium rainfall site, the later maturing cultivar Goulburn constituted 27-54% of the seed bank and the early flowering Dalkeith 25-46%, with unsown cultivars being insignificant ( <1%). At the low rainfall site, Dalkeith was the major component (33-52%) of the seed bank but the background population of unsown cultivars constituted 11-48%, the lowest proportion being in swards without a perennial component. The proportion of Goulburn was highest (23%) in the pure sward and lowest (10%) in lucerne and phalaris. It was concluded that subterranean clover could form relatively stable mixtures with perennials in medium rainfall environments, with clover populations increasing with time. In lower rainfall environments, clover seedling populations in perennial swards may be low due to reduced seed set and decreased seedling survival following early autumn rains. In these environments earlier maturing, hard-seeded cultivars are more likely to persist in mixtures and there is more potential for unsown cultivars to constitute a greater proportion of the sward. Decreasing perennial density offers scope for improving clover seed set and survival in these environments.

J	Osunkoya, OO; Swanborough, PW				Osunkoya, OO; Swanborough, PW			Reproductive and ecophysiological attributes of the rare Gardenia actinocarpa (Rubiaceae) compared with its common co-occurring congener, G-ovularis	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Gardenia actinocarpa Puttock (rare) and G. ovularis F. M. Bailey (widespread) are closely related cooccurring shrub-small trees of rainforests of far north Queensland, Australia. Gardenia actinocarpa is endemic to alluvial lowlands along Noah-Oliver Creeks of Cape Tribulation, whereas G. ovularis spans a wider habitat and occurs on a range of substrates and altitudes. The rare G. actinocarpa is cryptically and strictly dioecious, with a longer reproductive period (9 months) and a low fecundity (1.77 fruits per female tree). In contrast, G. ovularis, although also dioecious, has a shorter reproductive phase (4 months) and produces more fruits (35.76 fruits per female tree), some of which may occur in the absence of fertilisation (apomixis). Under different regimes of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), seed germination percentages and patterns were similar (70-90%) in the two species, although at 37% PAR G. actinocarpa has lower germination (55-68%). The rare G. actinocarpa loses seed viability very rapidly (< 15% viability after 3 months) compared with G. ovularis (37%). Gardenia actinocarpa grows and survives in both closed forest understorey and in small gaps, while G. ovularis prefers light gaps (both small and large). Net photosynthetic measurements of seedlings grown at 2.5 and 37% PAR suggest that the physiological performance of G. actinocarpa is not inferior to that of G. ovularis, although the latter exhibits greater plasticity. In a density-dependent seedling growth experiment, G. actinocarpa, surprisingly, has a superior competitive ability. Thus, the rarity of G. actinocarpa may be a result of limited fecundity, reduced seed dispersal ability and lack of soil seed-banks rather than inferior vegetative and ecophysiological traits.

J	King, SA; Buckney, RT				King, SA; Buckney, RT			Exotic plants in the soil-stored seed bank of urban bushland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Native vegetation reserves in urban areas have been invaded by exotic plants, particularly along edges. However, it is not known whether the seeds of exotic plants in the soil-stored seed bank are also largely restricted to edges. Ten urban bushland sites in northern Sydney were randomly selected and the readily germinable, soil-stored seed bank examined to assess whether the number of exotic and native species varied with distance from an urban edge. The similarity of the contents of the seed bank and the composition of the above-ground vegetation was also examined. Soil samples were collected from quadrats 0-10, 20-30 and 50-60 m from the edge at each site, then spread on germination trays in a glasshouse and germinated seedlings identified. Soil samples were collected every 3 months for a year. The number of exotic species in the seed bank was found to be highest near urban edges, as was the total number of species. The above-ground vegetation was found to be a poor indicator of the contents of the seed bank, for both native and exotic species. Most of the exotic species found in the seed bank were not found in the immediately surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, some exotic species were found in the seed bank at sites where no exotic species were present in the vegetation. The results suggest that it is the lack of suitable conditions that is largely restricting invasion of exotic species to edges of bushland. The results also highlight the need for seedbank studies to assess the contents of the soil seed bank in urban bushland in order to prevent further invasions of exotic plants.																	0067-1924						2001	49	6					717	720		10.1071/BT01016							WOS:000172314800005

A.Hitchc. is one of the first perennial grasses in monsoonal Australia to produce seed at the start of the wet season. Patterns of growth and seed production and seed dynamics of Alloteropsis semialata were examined in this study, along with the effects of partial defoliation. Growth of Alloteropsis semialata tussocks started with the first pre-wet-season rains, and was then interrupted during a period with little rain. Growth ceased before the end of the wet season, indicating that factors other than moisture availability were limiting. Seeds of Alloteropsis semialata were germinable on production, but did not remain viable or persist on the soil surface through the dry season. Most seeds and young seedlings were harvested and no seedlings were recruited. Inflorescence production increased with plant size. Moderate defoliation in the early wet season had no impact on plant growth, but reduced inflorescence and seed production for at least 2 years. Absence of a seed bank and early wet-season flowering mean that Alloteropsis semialata is likely to be sensitive to long-term over-grazing.

J	McIvor, JG				McIvor, JG			Pasture management in semi-arid tropical woodlands: regeneration of degraded pastures protected from grazing	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Regeneration of native and oversown pastures following exclusion of grazing was studied over 3 years on a fertile soil at Hillgrove, near Charters Towers, north-east Queensland. The pastures covered a wide range of initial conditions reflecting the grazing pressures they had been exposed to during 2 dry years before enclosure. Pasture measurements made before the exclusion of grazing (yield, botanical composition, basal area, ground cover, height, soil seed banks) were related by regression analysis to subsequent changes in site condition described by a site condition value, calculated from herbage yields and botanical composition, to determine suitable predictors of regeneration during resting from grazing. The pastures recovered (increases in soil cover, grass basal area and the proportion of desirable species) under the generally favourable growing conditions during the period of enclosure although some plots, initially in poor condition, had not recovered after 3 years. There were only minor differences between the native and oversown pasture types in their recovery. Relative yields and site condition values were not affected by pasture type and botanical composition index values differed with pasture type in 1989 only. The site condition values of both pasture types after the first year of enclosure were closely and positively related to all the pasture characteristics measured the previous year except for soil seed numbers in the native pastures. All characteristics could be used to predict site condition value and potential of the pasture to regenerate, and their merits are discussed. The proportion of desirable species in the pasture combined with level of ground cover is suggested as a useful means of predicting regeneration and potential for future grazing.

J	Salemaa, M; Uotila, T				Salemaa, M; Uotila, T			Seed bank composition and seedling survival in forest soil polluted with heavy metals	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Seedling recruitment from forest soil polluted with heavy metals was studied in order to determine the revegetation potential of the seed bank. The soil samples were collected from untreated and fertilised Scots pine stands along a 8 km transect running SE from a copper-nickel smelter in SW Finland. The composition and size of the active seed bank and the survival of the germinated seedlings were studied in greenhouse conditions. The average densities of germinated seeds of 15 species ranged from 250 to 4750 plants per m(2) at the six sites. Although vegetation was almost totally absent near the smelter, germinable seeds of Betula pubescens, Calluna vulgaris, Pinus sylvestris and Vaccinium uliginosum were found in the most contaminated soil. The number of Calluna vulgaris seedlings increased with increasing distance from the smelter, but no such trend was found for the other species. The mortality rate of the seedlings was highest in the soil samples collected near the smelter. Nutrient addition (stand-specific fertilisation with N, Ca, P and Mg) did not affect the number of germinated seeds, but liming slightly reduced heavy metal induced death of the seedlings. The survival probability of Calluna vulgaris seedlings decreased with proximity to the smelter. The results suggest that the recovery of Calluna vulgaris near the smelter was prevented by a low availability of seeds in the soil, unfavourable germination conditions and unsuccessful seedling establishment. We conclude that, despite the presence of viable seeds in polluted soil, revegetation from seed banks is not successful without soil mitigation to immobilise heavy metals.																	1439-1791						2001	2	3					251	263		10.1078/1439-1791-00055							WOS:000171075800008

Observed seed behaviour is a consequence of interactions between heterogeneous seed and changing environmental inputs. Given the restraints imposed by seed morphology and the stimulatory effects of oxygen and carbon monoxide on seed germination, it is hypothesized that foxtail seed behaviour is regulated by the amount of oxygen dissolved in water taken into the seed over time. This hypothesis implies that the signal stimulating foxtail behaviour is the quantity of oxygen within the water content of the seed symplast (caryopsis) per time unit: mass O-2(-1) volume H2O-1 time(-1) seed(-1). If this hypothesis is true, then the nature of the signal stimulating foxtail seed behaviour can be deduced by computations with hourly soil temperature and daily moisture weather data and used as a predictive tool. We discuss the knowledge with which this hypothesis is derived and present sample calculations of the acute and chronic H2O-O-2 signals we are currently attempting to correlate with observed foxtail seedling emergence patterns in the field. Sustainable weed management systems could be improved when real-time information is available to the producer about weedy pests, Predicting foxtail seedling emergence may be possible by combining information about the heterogeneity of dormancy states among seed in the soil and computations of oxygen mass per seed from real-time soil meteorological data.																			1-901396-61-4				2001							65	74									WOS:000175297500009

Estimates of frequency and persistence of canola volunteers were obtained from field surveys conducted on farms in eastern (province of Quebec) and western (provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta) Canada, and also from field experiments conducted in both regions. As expected, density of canola volunteers decreased with time since the last canola crop. Still, an average of 0,2 and 0.5 volunteer canola plants m(-2) were found in fields five and four years after canola production, in eastern and western Canada, respectively. Experimental results suggest the presence of a persistent canola seed bank, although it is likely that volunteers contribute to the replenishment of the seed bank over the years. Over-wintering canola plants were also observed in eastern Canada in no-till cropping systems. Weed management in Canadian cropping systems generally provides adequate control of volunteer canola but still allows long-term persistence of low density populations. Management of risks associated with the presence of volunteer HT canola will require improved long-term management of these populations.																			1-901396-61-4				2001							143	148									WOS:000175297500018

However, the weeds are not uniformly or randomly distributed but have a patchy distribution such that the broadcast application of herbicides can spray post-emergence herbicides in areas where there are no weeds. Therefore, this work had the objective of demonstrating the potential of saving of herbicides in the no-till production system of the Brazilian agriculture, based on weed seed bank and weed seedling maps. The density of several weeds was mapped using a backpack DGPS and laptop computer. Experiments were conducted in a 17.7 ha field of no-till corn under centre pivot irrigation. Seed bank data was determined from soil cores collected from a depth of 0.05 m in the centre of a 20 m by 20 m grid and emergence assessments in a greenhouse. On the same grid size, weed seedlings were counted in 0.25 m(2) quadrats. Resultant maps showed a high weed density in the seed bank over just 4.67 ha which was only 26% of the field area. The seedling maps demonstrated that grasses and broadleaf weeds had different distributions with broadleaf weeds occupying 12.6% of the field and grasses 87.4%. The targeting of herbicide to weed patches using pre and post emergent herbicides has the potential to reduce herbicide use compared to broadcast application giving both environmental and economic advantages.

The annual wild rice (Oryza barthii) causes high yield losses in the irrigated rice areas, particularly in the direct seeded systems. The weed increases management costs and high levels of infestation have resulted in farmers adopting transplanting of rice in order to reduce infestations. Ability to invest in preparation of land and hand weeding before planting is however limited by commitments to production of other crops. Yield loss studies on farmers' fields indicate grain yield losses of more than 2 t/ha, or almost 40%, caused by infestations O. barthii at densities of 70 tillers/m(2). Studies identify irrigation water and the soil seed-bank as being major sources of infestation, but not nursery beds and seed supplies that are of only minor importance. Studies on farmers' fields showed grain losses of approximately 1 t/ha, or half the yield, caused by infestations of 120 stems/m(2) of the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata. Control measures tested on farmers' fields show that applications of glyphosate to O. longistaminata at the beginning of the rainy season, or pre-plant wet cultivation, are effective means of control. Large proportions of farmers have scarce resources, which limits the likelihood of adoption in some areas. An opportunity that may be more attractive to such farmers is the development of dry season cropping of vegetables or potatoes, which produce additional revenue, as well as reducing infestations.																			1-901396-61-4				2001							889	894									WOS:000175297500132

The target species for this restoration process may be present in the relict seed bank, which can be used to restore the ecological diversity of heathlands successfully. This study focuses on the consequences of a highly dynamic and complex historical land use pattern on the composition and heathland restoration potential of the soil seed bank of a sand stone hill in central Belgium. The presence of typical heathland species was negatively correlated with historical orchard land use. Former land use as orchard imposed both biotic (low seed densities of target species) and abiotic (high soil phosphate level) constraints in the restoration of heathland. Time since abandonment of the heathland and conifer land use negatively affected the presence of heathland species due to seed senescence in the heathland species seed bank. Especially more than 50 years after the reference land use, the number of heathland species has become very small acid restoration is hardly possible. On parcels that had no historical orchard land use and having a current land use as oak-birch forest, the chance of successful restoration of heathland is greatest. Densities of heathland species in the seed bank of these parcels are relatively high and the densities of non-target, potentially competing, species are relatively low.

J	Barbaro, L; Dutoit, T; Cozic, P				Barbaro, L; Dutoit, T; Cozic, P			A six-year experimental restoration of biodiversity by shrub-clearing and grazing in calcareous grasslands of the French Prealps	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The conservation of dry calcareous grasslands in the French Prealps strongly depends on the maintenance of low-intensity farming systems supported by agri-environmental schemes. An experimental assessment of the effect of current agro-pastoral management on the biodiversity of plant communities was conducted during a six-year permanent plot survey in four sites with contrasting habitat conditions (mesic to xeric). Analyses of species changes showed: (i) a strong increase in species richness and open grassland species frequencies four years after shrub-clearing, and (ii) a noticeable recovery of rare annuals and perennial species of conservation interest establishing in gaps created by grazing. At the community level, the restoration effect was evaluated by a between-year Correspondence Analysis, explaining 10.9% of the total floristic variability versus 29.5% for the site effect (between-site CA). Species ordination by between-year CA showed similar trajectories of vegetation changes during restoration despite different habitat conditions and grazing regimes between sites. The successful restoration of prealpine calcareous grasslands was explained by the availability of seed sources during the study in adjacent grazed or mown grasslands. Thus, restoration assessment should focus on dispersal possibilities and functional roles of species rather than species richness only. Finally, the spatial (i.e. the area of patches that need to be restored) and temporal (i.e. the frequency of shrub-clearing) implications for the large-scale conservation of prealpine calcareous grasslands by current agro-pastoral management are discussed.

Rich.) Stapf, was studied in regularly burned savanna in Gambella, western Ethiopia. The seedling emergence technique was employed to determine the density of the soil seed bank of six sites with different fire severity. The soil seed bank was largely dominated by graminoids as almost 90% of the soil seed bank consisted of seeds of Hyparrhenia confinis. The seed density of Hyparrhenia confinis in the soil varied strongly between seasons, sites and depths and was not always closely correlated with the above-ground cover of Hyparrhenia confinis. This was high in the wooded grasslands and intermediate in the woodland, whereas the species, and other grasses, were absent from the more densely forested sites. The majority of the seeds were found in the uppermost 0.5 cm of the soil. Seed density was highest in the dry season and declined strongly in the beginning of the rainy season due to germination when conditions were favourable for plant growth. However, observations from the field suggest that sprouting from the base also may contribute to regeneration of the grass cover after the dry season. Our results show that the current fire regime of these savanna woodlands appears to maintain the dominance of Hyparrhenia confinis both as seeds in the soil and in the herbaceous stratum of the standing vegetation.

J	Sjursen, H				Sjursen, H			Change of the weed seed bank during the first complete six-course crop rotation after conversion from conventional to organic farming	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE												The modification of the weed seed bank in the top soil (0-20 cm) during a six-year period including a sequence of annual crops and a perennial grass-clover ley in the rotation, were analysed in an organic cropping system after conversion to organic farming. The seed bank of dicotyledonous annual species varied from a minimum of 7200 seeds m(-2), the year following a three-year period with perennial ley, to a maximum of 17600 seeds m(-2), the year following a three-year period with annual crops. The number of species in the seed bank was essentially constant at 18-21 during the rotation, but the number of emerged species in the field decreased from about 19-20 during the annual crop period to a minimum of eight in third year ley, indicating a reduced input of seeds to the seed bank during the ley period. Dicotyledonous perennial weed seeds in the soil constituted only 2-3% of the seed bank. The correspondence between the soil seed bank and emerged weed plants was not straightforward. For Capsella bursa-pastoris and Chenopodium album, only 41 % of the calculated correlations were significantly positive, indicating that an increase in the seed bank only occasionally can predict an increase of the actual weed flora.																	0144-8765						2001	19	1					71	90		10.1080/01448765.2001.9754910							WOS:000170296400007						
J	Lomascolo, T; Aide, TM				Lomascolo, T; Aide, TM			Seed and seedling bank dynamics in secondary forests following hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico	CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												This study describes the effect of Hurricane Georges (September, 1998) on the dynamics of seed and seedling banks in young secondary forests (25 yr) and mature secondary forests (60 yr) in abandoned pasture lands in Puerto Rico. In eight secondary forest sites, the seed bank was sampled in July 1998 and July 1999, and the seedling bank was sampled in November 1998 and November 1999. We collected data on number of species and individuals. In the seedling bank, mortality, recruitment and growth rate were estimated for one year. Hurricane damage was estimated for each site. The data suggest that sites in early stages of succession receive less damage from hurricane-force winds than older sites. As a consequence, after a hurricane later stages of succession present high light conditions, which result in high growth rate of pioneer and non-pioneer species. Although high light conditions may enhance seed germination from the seed bank, recruitment was low, and most post-hurricane regeneration came from pre-established individuals in the seedling bank. The recovery of secondary forests is usually studied in reference to time since abandonment, but this study shows that natural disturbances, particularly hurricanes, can affect the successional trajectory of secondary forests.																	0008-6452						2001	37	3-4					259	270									WOS:000172501800013						
J	D'Antonio, CM; Hughes, RF; Vitousek, PM				D'Antonio, CM; Hughes, RF; Vitousek, PM			Factors influencing dynamics of two invasive C-4 grasses in seasonally dry Hawaiian woodlands	ECOLOGY												The introduced C-4 bunchgrass; Schizachyrium condensatum, is abundant in unburned, seasonally dry woodlands on the island of Hawaii, where it promotes the spread of fire. After fire, it is partially replaced by Melinis minutiflora, another invasive C-4 grass. Seed bank surveys in unburned woodland showed that Melinis seed is present in locations without adult plants. Using a combination of germination tests and seedling outplant experiments, we tested the hypothesis that Melinis was unable to invade the unburned woodland because of nutrient and/or light limitation. We found that Melinis germination and seedling growth are depressed by the low light levels common under Schizachyrium in unburned woodland. Outplanted Melinis seedlings grew rapidly to flowering and persisted for several years in unburned woodland without nutrient additions, but only if Schizachyrium individuals were removed. Nutrients alone did not facilitate Melinis establishment. Competition between Melinis and Schizachyrium naturally occurs when individuals of both species emerge from the seed bank simultaneously, or when seedlings of one species emerge in sites already dominated by individuals of the other species. When both species are grown from seed, we found that Melinis consistently outcompetes Schizachyrium, regardless of light or nutrient treatments. When seeds of Melinis were added to pots with well-established Schizachyrium (and vice versa), Melinis eventually invaded and overgrew adult Schizachyrium under high, but not low, nutrients. By contrast, Schizachyrium could not invade established Melinis pots regardless of nutrient level. A field experiment demonstrated that Schizachyrium individuals are suppressed by Melinis in burned sites through competition for both light and nutrients. Overall, Melinis is a dominant competitor over Schizachyrium once it becomes established, whether in a pot or in the field. We believe that the dominance of Schizachyrium, rather than Melinis, in the unburned woodland is the result of asymmetric competition due to the prior establishment of Schizachyrium in these sites. If Schizachyrium were not present, the unburned woodland could support dense stands of Melinis. Fire disrupts the priority effect of Schizachyrium and allows the dominant competitor (Melinis) to enter the system where it eventually replaces Schizachyrium through resource competition.																	0012-9658					JAN	2001	82	1					89	104		10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0089:FIDOTI]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000166488200008

Soil samples were excavated separately in 0-2 cm and 2-5 cm deep layers, and their seed content was assessed using the seedling emergence method. Emergent seedling counts were carried out in the field during the spring following the fire. Analysis of samples from an unburnt stand revealed that annuals (83% species, 86% seeds), and weeds (50% species, 30% seeds) were a major component in the seed bank. Seed banks of most species (85%) were accumulated in the upper soil layer, denoting their transient nature. Fire severely reduced the density and species richness of the seed bank, as expected for a mainly transient soil seed bank in a community not exposed to a recurrent wildfire regime throughout its evolutionary history. One year after the fire, the seed bank increased in density and species richness, particularly in the upper soil layer. The recovery occurred in two ways: i) in-site seed production From seeds which survived the fire and germinated, and ii) wind-borne seed invasion from adjacent unburnt vegetation. The first type of recovery was mainly the result of relatively large-seeded species with short-distance seed dispersal mechanisms, whereas the second H as observed for anemochorous and/or tiny-seeded species. We conclude that the ability of weedy communities to respond to fire is based on the colonizing and invasive nature of the species. Consequences for the use of fire in the management of such communities are discussed.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218												1195-6860						2001	8	2					211	219		10.1080/11956860.2001.11682647							WOS:000169569300009

Plant community searched is situated on the calcareous hill called The White Mountain (Central Roztocze Region, SE Poland). This area is protected as the ecological unit, the form of environment protection defined in Polish Nature Conservation Act. The main conclusion of the work done is the statement that the possibility of use of the seed bank to maintenance and community recovery is narrowed by some factors. The most important of them arc: great occurrence of seeds of species alien to xerothermic grassland and the lack of the persistent seed bank of main valuable components of searched community.																	1335-342X						2001	20			4			215	221									WOS:000179936200022

As forest trees are normally the keystone species of forest ecosystems, their continued existence is essential for many floral and faunal associations of these ecosystems. Major concepts, challenges and opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources are briefly discussed in this paper. The major challenges include population decline and population structure changes due to forest removal and conversion of forest land to other uses, forest fragmentation, forestry practices, climate change, disease conditions, introduced pests, atmospheric pollution, and introgressive hybridization. Developing scientifically sound conservation strategies, maintaining minimum viable population sizes, and deployment of genetically engineered organisms represent other important challenges in conservation. The usefulness of various biochemical and molecular genetic markers, adaptive traits, and genetic diversity measures for developing conservation strategies for in situ and ex situ genetic resource conservation are also discussed. Major opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources include: use of molecular genetic markers and adaptive traits for developing conservation strategies; in situ conservation through natural reserves, protected areas, and sustainable forest management practices; ex situ conservation through germplasm banks, common garden archives, seed banks, DNA banks, and tissue culture and cryopreservation; incorporation of disease, pest, and stress tolerance traits through genetic transformation; plantation forestry; and ecological restoration of rare or declining tree species and populations. Forest genetic resource conservation and resource use should be considered complementary rather than contradictory to each other.																	0014-2336						2001	118	2					197	212		10.1023/A:1004150525384							WOS:000167435700015						
J	Kebreab, E; Murdoch, AJ				Kebreab, E; Murdoch, AJ			Simulation of integrated control strategies for Orobanche spp. based on a life cycle model	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												A computer simulation model was developed to investigate strategies for control of the parasitic weed species of Orobanche. The model makes use of data from published literature and predicts infestation levels in a dynamic and deterministic way. It is predicted that sustainable control of the parasite can only be achieved by reducing the soil seed bank to levels of 1000-2000 seeds m(-2) and maintaining it at that level in subsequent years. When cultural control methods such as hand weeding, trap/lcatch cropping, delayed planting, resistant cultivars and solarization were considered individually, a relatively high level of effectiveness was required to contain the soil seed bank. An integrated approach with a selection of appropriate cultural methods is therefore recommended for further testing and validation in the field. The simulations demonstrate the importance of preventing new seeds entering the soil seed bank and that although reducing the soil seed bank may not increase yield for the first few years, it will ultimately increase production.

Spatial and temporal variability of the seed rain during the growing seasons of 1996 and 1997 was recorded, using seed traps sunk into the soil surface. The size of the seed bank was determined in a preliminary study for spring samples in 1996, using the extraction method. Seedling emergence and establishment were recorded within permanent plots during the growing seasons of 1996 and 1997, comparing vegetated and bare-ground plots. The results showed a high degree of inhomogeneity within the samples from each site. In general, the species composition of the seed rain, the seed bank and the seedlings resembled that of the present vegetation. Late-successional species were present in neither the seed rain nor the seed bank. They were also absent from the seedling cohorts. More seedlings were recorded on the vegetated plots compared to the bare-ground plots. Between the two moraine stages no significant differences in seedling recruitment were found; however, the species composition was different. Most of the seedlings emerged on safe sites, i.e. in the vicinity of already established plants and larger stones. Ca. 50% of all seedlings died before they could be identified. Mortality rates of the remaining seedlings were between 0% and 100% after two winters. The relatively high plant cover on the studied moraines suggests that an additional input of plant fragments from avalanches and streams has to be assumed. The speed of colonization and succession on the studied glacier foreland is relatively low compared to that recorded on other glacier forelands of the Alps, probably due to the scarce sources of propagules close to the youngest moraines.																	0367-2530						2001	196	4					304	312									WOS:000170288900006						
J	Brown, G				Brown, G			Small-scale dynamics of desert annuals in an ungrazed Rhanterium epapposum community over three growth seasons in Kuwait	FLORA												Two blocks, each consisting of twelve 0.25 m(2) permanent plots (0.5 x 0.5 m), were established in a community dominated by desert annuals in an area of Kuwait protected from grazing. Small-scale dynamics of desert annuals, cumulative species richness and inter-annual plot similarity were investigated in plots of both blocks in three growth seasons, 1997, 1998 and 2000. The three study periods had different precipitation patterns in respect of the amount of rainfall received during the growth period, as well as the timing and amount of the first rains to trigger germination. In all three seasons, most species of the cumulative species pool (i.e. all species registered in each block during the study period) were rare, and of the more frequent ones, species turnover was generally high. High turnover is also reflected in a low inter-annual plot similarity. Stochastic climatic factors appear to play a major role in determining species composition and thus species turnover in a particular growth season. Species turnover, mediated by temporal niche partitioning, is generally regarded as an important factor in promoting coexistence in communities dominated by annuals in spatially uniform habitats. However, very high species richness in the particularly favourable growth season 1998, in which over 75% of species of the cumulative species pool were recorded, suggests that in this desert ecosystem characterised by generally very low vegetation cover, the role of species turnover in maintaining diversity may not be as important as in other ecosystems dominated by annuals.																	0367-2530						2001	196	5					353	363		10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30071-3							WOS:000171591300003						
J	Asselin, H; Fortin, MJ; Bergeron, Y				Asselin, H; Fortin, MJ; Bergeron, Y			Spatial distribution of late-successional coniferous species regeneration following disturbance in southwestern Quebec boreal forest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Remnant tree stands left intact following a disturbance constitute the sole seed banks available for regeneration of coniferous species that neither bear serotinous cones nor reproduce vegetatively. The success of regeneration of tree species on these disturbed sites is, therefore, dependent on the distance from potential seed sources. The regeneration of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) was studied at two sites in Quebec's southwestern boreal forest in order to quantify the influence of remnant stands on spatial distribution of regeneration. The first site is located in an area that burned in 1944 while the second site is located in an area that was clear-cut in the mid-1980s. Canonical correspondence analyses were used to determine the respective contributions of environmental data and spatial variables to the pattern of spatial distribution of regeneration. The results reveal that distance from a remnant stand is the most important variable in explaining spatial distribution of regeneration when compared to environmental variables such as soil type, drainage, slope and altitude. The plots of regeneration density against distance from a remnant stand for both the burned site and logged site show that regeneration density decreases abruptly with distance from a remnant stand. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation analyses (Moran's I) indicate that even small remnant zones can significantly influence the pattern of spatial distribution of regeneration for the three species studied. The results presented here suggest that where preestablished regeneration is not abundant enough, alternative silvicultural systems such as strip clear-cutting or seed-tree systems could be used instead of cuts with protection of regeneration and soils (CPRS).

J	Ferrandis, P; de las Heras, J; Martinez-Sanchez, JJ; Herranz, JM				Ferrandis, P; de las Heras, J; Martinez-Sanchez, JJ; Herranz, JM			Influence of a low-intensity fire on a Pinus halepensis Mill. forest seed bank and its consequences on the early stages of plant succession	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The effect of an experimental low-intensity fire on the soil seed bank and its consequences on the early stages of post-disturbance succession-were analyzed. The hypothesis that low-intensity fire may produce a population decline of hard-seeded species by the elimination of established plants and the lack of a seed germination promotion effect was investigated. Consecutive pre- and post-burning soil samplings revealed extremely low impact of fire on seed banks. In contrast, some specific seed banks increased with fire, probably due to a seed rain from fire-opening of capsule fruits. Fire neither promoted germination of hard-coated seeds nor affected their viability. Both the length of the seed-unproductive juvenile phase and post-fire habitat conditions were revealed as critical in determining the recovery of hard-seeded species after a low-intensity fire. Species with a short life cycle produced seeds in the year subsequent to the disturbance, ensuring a progressive moderate recovery from the few individuals which emerged after fire. This was particularly true in the southern exposure, where other seed-softening factors not exclusively related to fire may operate in a more intense way, compensating the null effect on germination of the low-fire intensity. For Cistus clusii, with a relatively long juvenile-phase span (3 years), low post-fire germination coincided with a long seed-unproductive period, which finally overlapped with a dramatic seed bank viability depletion (63-68%). In the northern exposure, fire resulted in a complete extinction of this species.

J	Gutterman, Y				Gutterman, Y			Drought tolerance of the dehydrated root of Schismus arabicus seedlings and regrowth after rehydration, affected by caryopsis size and duration of dehydration	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The unique drought tolerance of the single root of Schismus arabicus seedlings was compared with the roots of barley subjected to the same drought conditions. S. arabicus seedlings with roots and coleoptiles that were I to 2 mm or longer continued to grow and develop into normal plants when rehydrated after various dry periods. Moreover, seedlings originating from larger caryopses grew faster than those from small caryopses. When seedlings of cultivated barley 'Noga' were dehydrated under the same conditions, none of the roots survived even after one day of drought. However, the barley seedlings survived because coleoptile growth was re-initiated following rehydration and new adventitious roots developed. S. arabicus is one of the very common annual plant species in large areas in the extreme deserts of the Saharo-Arabian phytogeographic region where the low rainfall and its distribution in winter are unpredictable. The ability of small portions of the S. arabicus soil seed bank to germinate after small amounts of rain, together with seedling drought tolerance for at least 29 days, may increase the chance of survival of this plant species. Seedlings originating from larger caryopses have even a higher chance of survival.																	0792-9978						2001	49	2					123	128		10.1560/EA47-F4P0-P54G-WB3Y							WOS:000170867200006						
J	Spencer, M; Blaustein, L				Spencer, M; Blaustein, L			Hatching responses of temporary pool invertebrates to signals of environmental quality	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Many temporary pool invertebrates survive dry periods as diapausing eggs. Theory predicts that the proportion of diapausing eggs that hatch when the pool fills with water should vary with signals of likely reproductive success, if such signals are available. Reproductive success in temporary pool invertebrates is influenced by the presence of predators and desiccation. We studied hatching responses of temporary pool invertebrates to the presence of fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra L., an important predator in temporary pools), and to manipulations of nutrients. Nutrient manipulations may mimic the increase in conductivity associated with high evaporation and risk of desiccation, but might also affect food availability or modify signals associated with the presence of Salamandra. Fewer eggs of the conchostracan Cyzicus sp. hatched in the presence of Salamandra, and in pools to which nutrients had been added. Other taxa (bdelloid rotifers and chydorids) did not show unambiguous hatching responses to the presence of Salamandra or nutrients. We discuss these results in the light of simple models for optimal hatching fractions. Large crustaceans such as Cyzicus are particularly likely to show strong hatching responses to signals of environmental quality. However, we also expect to find such responses in many other crustaceans.																	0021-2210						2001	47	4					397	417		10.1560/23F2-2XBW-252B-DU5C							WOS:000174653100008						
J	Caffrey, JM				Caffrey, JM			The management of giant hogweed in an Irish river catchment	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT					40th Annual Meeting of the Aquatic-Plant-Management-Society	JUL 16-20, 2000	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA					Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum Sommier and Levier) is an alien plant that was introduced to Ireland as an ornamental in the late 19th Century. The banksides of rivers and streams are the preferred habitat for the plant and it is now a feature in many important angling catchments. The continued spread of this plant is a cause of concern because of its impact on human health and on the ecology of infested river corridors. As giant hogweed populations can only be perpetuated by seeds, most control strategies aim to limit recruitment to future generations and to deplete the seed bank reserve. Trials conducted in Ireland and in Europe have revealed the sensitivity of the plant to herbicidal treatment using glyphosate. Based on research conducted in Ireland a four-year treatment program, using glyphosate, was formulated. Prior to 1998 no coordinated attempt to eradicate giant hogweed from a catchment had been undertaken. To investigate the feasibility, and logistics, of managing this hazardous plant in a discrete river catchment, a control program on the Mulkear River catchment (670 km(2)) was undertaken by the Office of Public Works. Field surveys indicated that an area of circa 35 km(2) within the catchment was overgrown with giant hogweed. Weed treatment commenced in March 1998 and continued through 1999 and 2000. With almost three of the four-year treatment schedule complete, the preliminary results are very encouraging. The benefits to the local community and the overall ecology of the river and riparian habitats are discussed.																	0146-6623					JAN	2001	39						28	33									WOS:000174564800008						
J	Molano-Flores, B				Molano-Flores, B			Reproductive biology of Eryngium yuccifolium (Apiaceae), a prairie species	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Temporal dioecism is a synchronized flowering sequence with minimal overlap between the pistillate and staminate phases of an individual plant. This strategy allows pollen to be shed before stigmas become receptive, minimizing geitonogamous pollinations and maximizing outcrossing. I studied this condition using Eryngium yuccifolium Michx., a tallgrass prairie perennial species. As a temporary dioecious species, E. yuccifolium exhibits the following characteristics: 1) an extended pistillate phase, with stigmas becoming receptive only after the anthers have shed pollen and dehisced, 2) synchronized flower heads, 3) numerous flower heads visited by generalist pollinators, and 4) some degree of self-compatibility as indicated by hand pollinations. Finally, results from open and bagged pollinations and high pollen-ovule ratios indicated that the species is xenogamous. This study also found high fruit and seed sets (close to 90%) for E. yuccifolium. However, intense herbivory by the larva of a Gelechiidae moth significantly reduced the reproductive output of the species by destroying 40-60% of flowers and fruits. The results of this study indicate that temporal dioecism can enhance outcrossing and potentially can explain the high fruit and seed set for E. yuccifolium.																	0040-9618					JAN-MAR	2001	128	1					1	6		10.2307/3088654							WOS:000167794100001						
J	Stout, IJ				Stout, IJ			Rare plants of the Florida scrub, USA	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Forty-five plant species found in Florida scrub (USA) have been recognized as endangered or threatened with extinction under the Endangered Species Act (28) or comparable state regulations (45). An additional three species are recognized as rare for a variety of reasons. Many of these species are endemic to the Lake Wales Ridge of central peninsular Florida. Fewer rare species are associated with scrubs found elsewhere within the peninsula, along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and in the panhandle. Of the seven categories of rarity defined by Rabinowitz (1981), nearly all of the species exhibit small geographic ranges and narrow habitat specificity. Population sizes tend to be small everywhere, but exceptions do occur. Life history strategies represented include (1) obligate seeders, (2) resprouters and seeders, and (3) seed bank reseeders. These strategies have evolved in the face of periodic, catastrophic fires that tend to destroy most of the aboveground biomass of the Florida scrub. Rare plants show a mixture of these life history strategies. Nearly all of the rare plants depend on openings or gaps in the vegetation with exposed mineral soil and little or no litter accumulation for recruitment or long-term survival. Several land acquisition programs are involved in acquiring lands necessary to ensure the potential survival of rare Florida scrub plants.																	0885-8608					JAN	2001	21	1					50	60									WOS:000166720100005						
J	Ovstedal, DO; Heegaard, E				Ovstedal, DO; Heegaard, E			Biodiversity and vegetation dynamics in the coastal heathlands of western Norway	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The heaths of Lygra, western Norway, were investigated, and 19 communities at the association level were distinguished. Distinct ecotypes of Ranunculus acris and Poa humilis and microspecies of Euphrasia were restricted to the grass heaths. No distinct ecotypes were found in the Calluna-dominated vegetation. It is suggested that the regular burning, which has been part of the management of the area, has activated the seed bank of the ericaceous heath, and thus maintained genetic diversity and slowed down ecotype differentiation. The grass heaths, with no combustible material, have been unaffected in this way. Permanent plots in the two dominant heath types, dry heath (Vaccinio-Callunetum) and wet heath (Ericetum tetralicis) were followed over six years and the data analysed using a modification of Jaccard's index, allowing for species abundances.																	0107-055X	1756-1051					2001	21	3					283	290		10.1111/j.1756-1051.2001.tb00770.x							WOS:000173240100010

We studied annual (Polygonum) and woody perennial (Celastrus, Parthenocissus) non-native species and their native congeners in a three-year buried seed experiment. The woody perennial species formed a transient seed bank lasting only one year. In year one, both perennial non-native species had significantly greater germination than their native congeners. Both Pollygonum species formed a persistent seed bank, but the invasive P. perfoliatum had greater longevity than the native P. sagittatum. The study demonstrated that seed bank strategies of invasive species are qualitatively similar to their less abundant native congeners, but there were significant quantitative differences.																	1092-6194						2001	8	3					301	310		10.1656/1092-6194(2001)008[0301:SLITPO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000174240400005

PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The seed-bank and the dynamics of a Polygonum hydropiper L. community were investigated. The study area is located along the Po river in the Central-West Po plane (Northern Italy), in Piedmont, near Alessandria. The seed-bank in the sod was investigated by means of a simplified procedure of seasonal sampling and germination tests while the dynamics of the Polygonum community was investigated within a permanent square. Results indicate that: i) The Polygonum hydropiper community has strong growth potential because it has a source of biodiversity in its reservoir of germinable seeds of different species. River overflows act both as disturbance and as vectors for propagules, selecting the species that can grow and develop within the vegetation, and the species that will be left as seeds in the soil; ii) species diversity and dominance vary with vegetation stage (seed bank, pioneer stages and mature stages); iii) two types of seed-bank were present in the sod we analysed: a transient one and a persistent one.

J	de Viana, ML; Suhring, S; Manly, BFJ				de Viana, ML; Suhring, S; Manly, BFJ			Application of randomization methods to study the association of Trichocereus pasacana (Cactaceae) with potential nurse plants	PLANT ECOLOGY												Spatial distribution of plants and seeds of Trichocereus pasacana was studied in relation to bush species abundance, and of cacti in relation to the available number of seeds under bush species, in Los Cardones National Park, Argentina. Randomization tests, carried out to find the significance level of Chi squared test statistics used to test for non-random association hypothesis, proved that T. pasacana plants, seeds, and seedling establishment is related to the different bush species that co-occur with it. Positive interactions were found mostly with L. divaricata, but also with P. ferox and A. spartioides, suggesting that they act as nurse plants. Negative interactions were found with B. boliviensis, A. spartioides, S. crassiramea, and Verbena sp, in spite of the high seed storage beneath their canopies. Cacti are more frequent than expected in relation to seed relative abundance under L. divaricata and P. ferox and less frequent under P. rougesii, B. boilviensis, Verbena sp, G. glutinosa, S. crassiramea, and A. spartioides, due to differential seed or seedling mortality when emergence occurs.																	1385-0237						2001	156	2					193	197		10.1023/A:1012621106009							WOS:000172074900007						
J	Witkowski, ETF; Wilson, M				Witkowski, ETF; Wilson, M			Changes in density, biomass, seed production and soil seed banks of the non-native invasive plant, Chromolaena odorata, along a 15 year chronosequence	PLANT ECOLOGY												The non-native invasive plant Chromolaena odorata (Asteraceae) was studied at 6 sites, with a chronosequence of ages from <1 to greater than or equal to 15 years, at St Lucia, South Africa. C. odorata density, biomass, seed production and soil seed banks were quantified in three microsites: sun, semi-shade and shade. C. odorata density decreased with invasion age, apparently as a self-thinning process. Biomass per unit area and seed production/plant increased over the first 10 years, but declined greatly at greater than or equal to 15 years. C. odorata plants grew larger and had much greater seed production in the sun relative to semi-shade, with small plants producing few if any seeds in the shade. Seed production in the sun varied from 2000 (<1-year old site) to 260 000 (10 year) seeds m(-2) annum(-1). About 20-46% of seeds produced were germinable and showed the same trend with age of invasion, but was particularly low after greater than or equal to 15 years. Assessment of soil seed banks immediately prior to seed production (seed greater than or equal to 10 months old), indicates that about 5-10% of seeds in the sun and 11-22% in the shade were still germinable, resulting in germinable seed densities of 12-385 and 158-511 m(-2), respectively (excluding the greater than or equal to 15-year old site). A greenhouse trial showed that burial of seeds, relative to those at the surface, and provision of less water, significantly improved seed persistence in the soil, while light intensity had no effect. Control of C. odorata is difficult due to rapid attainment of reproductive maturity, large production of wind-dispersed seeds and a short-term persistent seed bank. An integrated control strategy either excluding fire (coastal forest sites) or using fire prior to seed release in July/August to kill plants and soil-stored seeds immediately prior to seed production, together with biological, chemical and/or physical control, should be explored.

J	Valbuena, L; Trabaud, L				Valbuena, L; Trabaud, L			Contribution of the soil seed bank to post-fire recovery of a heathland	PLANT ECOLOGY												The importance of a soil seed bank was evaluated through its role in the recovery of a burnt shrubland. The study was carried out in a heathland characterized by several ericaceous species. Part of the heathland was burnt in a wildfire on 7 April 1991, while the rest was not affected by the fire and used as a control. Soil samples were collected three days after the wildfire, in the absence of rain; 10 samples (20x25 cm width to a depth of 5 cm) were collected from the burnt area and 10 from the control. Samples were set out in a greenhouse where germinating seedlings were recorded, counted and identified for 17 months. Observations were also carried out twice in the field for 14 months after the wildfire by examining two permanent transects in the study area and recording all regenerating species. The results show a low correspondence between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation: only 23% of the identified taxa appeared both in the bank and in the field observations. From these species 65% of them have dispersal types like autochory or barochory, that is they generally fall near the mother plant. In the identified species as a whole, therophytes and hemicryptophytes dominate in comparison with chamaephytes, phanerophytes and geophytes; this also applied to the herbaceous species in comparison with the woody ones. Potentially soil possesses an important seed bank, which contributes poorly to the vegetation recovery after fire.

B	Bakar, BB		Brundu, G; Brock, J; Camarda, I; Child, L; Wade, M		Bakar, BB			Spatio-temporal dynamics of Mimosa quadrivalvis var. Leptocarpa populations in peninsular Malaysia	PLANT INVASIONS: SPECIES ECOLOGY AND ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT					5th International Conference on Ecology of Invasive Alien Plants	OCT 13-16, 1999	SARDINIA, ITALY					Mimosa quadrivalvis L. var. leptocarpa (DC.) Barneby was first detected in Peninsular Malaysia by Baki and his colleagues in 1996 (BAKI et al. 1996). It was a new species record for Malaysia and Malaesia. Subsequent field surveys conducted in 1996-1998 recorded increased infestation of the weed from small localised pockets in Penang to areas hitherto uncolonised in Perlis, Kedah and Penang states in northern Peninsular Malaysia, usually on inseptisol, vertisol, ultisol and entisol soils. The weed populations were highly clustered with Ip (Lloyd's patchiness index) values ranging from 64.89 to 121.84. The Lloyd's mean crowding (m*)-to-Lloyd's mean density (tu) ratios of fruit-bearing populations registered values ranging from 31.08 to 57.86. Field populations displayed erratic oscillations and this was due apparently to high mortality of seedlings. Each plant produced ca. 11,550 seeds/year with 98.23% viability. Only about 5.75% of the seeds produced emerged as seedlings out of which only 24.85% became successful colonisers of open space. There is a slight increase in fruit-bearing adult populations of 2.54%/year over the 1996 - 1998 period. This was translated as an increase of seed bank populations in soils (5.95%/year) over the same period. The seeds displayed both primary and secondary dormancy. The plant exhibited robust clonal growth producing many primary and higher order stolons which in turn act as fruit- and seed-bearing entities and resource-capture. Arguably, high seed production capacity coupled with robust and aggressive clonal growth identify M. quadrivalvis as an invasive weed to watch in Peninsular Malaysia.																			90-5782-080-3				2001							23	32									WOS:000170231900003						
B	Hickey, B; Osborne, B		Brundu, G; Brock, J; Camarda, I; Child, L; Wade, M		Hickey, B; Osborne, B			Natural seed banks, seedling growth and survival in areas invaded by Gunnera tinctoria	PLANT INVASIONS: SPECIES ECOLOGY AND ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT					5th International Conference on Ecology of Invasive Alien Plants	OCT 13-16, 1999	SARDINIA, ITALY					In areas invaded by Gunnera tinctoria species diversity was greater than in adjacent uncolonised areas. Significant alterations in species composition were, however, observed and 31 of the 46 species recorded in the colonised plots were absent from the uncolonised areas. Although fewer species were found in the seedbank analysis. compared to the numbers found beneath the canopy, 8 species that were present in the seedbank were absent from the understorey of the G. tinctoria canopy in situ. These changes in species composition may be due to a greater number of suitable microhabitats that can be invaded in the colonised areas, due to a major reduction in the biomass of the native species, as well as the long-term persistence of viable seeds in the seed bank. Some additional annual recruitment may also occur in the spring and autumn when the canopy is not fully developed. Whilst the presence of the G. tinctoria canopy may not have a major effect on the germination of individual species, few survived or persisted long enough to reach reproductive maturity. Greenhouse experiments, using simulated shade, suggest that the major effect of G. tinctoria was due to its impact on the biomass of native species. which may, in turn, be related to water availability. For species present in the seedbank the long-term consequences of this will depend on their numbers and longevity.																			90-5782-080-3				2001							105	114									WOS:000170231900013

This alien invasive plant is also forming dense patches in construction sites, nonagricultural lands, roadside. and paddy fields, indicating the extent of its invasive nature. Studies on seed germination and viability, growth and development, and soil seed bank density of Mimosa pigra L. were carried out to elucidate the invasive characteristics of the species. Mature seeds of M. pigra were collected from a naturalized habitat in the central province of Sri Lanka. The seeds were 100 %. viable after storage at room temperature (28 +/-2 degreesC) and at 8 degreesC, however, seeds germinated after sand scarification (99 %). The onset of flowers was first observed at 12 weeks after planting. The initial growth of the weed was slow, but the height increased at 2.4 cm.day(-1) during the first 8-12 weeks. From 12 weeks, the stem dry weight of M. pigra increased at a more rapid rate than the root dry weight. The relative growth rate (RGR) increased until onset of flowers and then decreased. The soil-seed bank density within the canopy diameter of the naturally grown M. pigra plants varied from 2,336 to 46,410 seeds.m(-2). The results indicated that M. pigra seeds could be dormant in large masses in the soil for prolonged periods under Sri Lankan conditions, and germinate readily after sand scarification. The weed reaches the reproductive stage earlier than that observed in other countries, indicating its invasive growth habit under Sri Lankan conditions and the threat to natural and agricultural ecosystems of the country.																			90-5782-080-3				2001							115	121									WOS:000170231900014

The greatest level of speciation of Proteaceae in Africa occurred in the Cape Floral Kingdom, a threatened and fragile ecosystem. The Southern African Proteaceae were recognized as valuable floriculture commodities during the 1960's, leading to cultivation in a large number of countries with suitable soil and climatic conditions. Cultivation was initially based on use of seed propagated populations selected either haphazardly or intentionally from the wild species. While this material served as excellent propagation stock for foreign countries, the gains from cultivation of pure species in their country of origin were too small to induce large-scale cultivation. It was the discovery and use of unique interspecific hybrids that sparked the desire to cultivate in South Africa. These interspecific hybrids provide a floral product that is easily distinguishable from the wild harvested product. Continued development of superior, unique products relies on breeding based primarily on interspecific hybridization. Constraints to cultivation, with environmental concerns becoming more important, also stress the need to develop not only unique cultivars, but cultivars that grow faster, produce more and do not become diseased. To develop these types of cultivar requires consistent screening of the species populations that have been sampled from the wild and managed in a plantation to determine the important characteristics; therefore the necessity for a large field gene bank. However, the field gene bank needs to be supported by a representative seed bank so that it has maximum economic impact on the crop. Currently the ARC Proteaceae gene bank comprises over 2000 accessions in the field gene bank and 200 accessions kept as seed-samples. Investigations into the genetic diversity present in species are underway to provide guidelines for effective sampling from wild populations. These studies need to be extended. The most pressing concern for the gene bank activities is the lack of consistent long term funding. Changes to the policy of cultivar distribution and royalty collection are attempts to enable the long-term sustainability of cultivar development.																	0567-7572		90-6605-754-8				2001		545					21	28		10.17660/ActaHortic.2001.545.1							WOS:000168874300001

This crop, center pivot irrigated, was rotated with wheat, dry edible beans, forage oat, and tomato itself as controls, on a yearly basis, during the dry, cool months (May-September). During the rainy, warm months (November-March) all plots were cultivated to maize. The 46 species of weeds that have been identified in the plots are predominantly dicotyledons. Crop sequences consisting of tomatoes, wheat, and maize showed the highest levels of efficiency in reducing the weed seed bank. Sclerotinia rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was the major disease affecting the tomato crop. Disease incidence started from near zero in 1991 and increased annually, reaching more than 50% of the plants in some cases, but declined or stabilized after the fifth year in the tomato monoculture. The worst sequences in terms of disease incidence included beans. Late infection and adequate soil and irrigation management practices contributed to reducing the damage caused by the disease. Rotation with grasses, mainly maize and wheat, make it possible to control both weeds and Sclerotinia rot to a certain extent.

Zapican (WC),and Lotus corniculatus cv. San Gabriel (BFT) oversown swards were evaluated. A complete randomized block design with 4 replicate blocks was used, in which 4 grazing strategies (grazing all year (SI), summer spelling for seed production (S2), winter rest plus summer spelling (S3) and autumn rest plus summer spelling (S4)), were combined with two defoliation severalties (4 and 10 cm height post-grazing residuals). Plots of 110 m(2) were grazed monthly by sheep. Seed production, soil seed bank and seedling emergence were monitored from April 1998 to August 1999. In both species, summer spelling for seed production improved seed yield, especially in BFT. Severe defoliation (4 cm) reduced seed inputs drastically (46% in BFT and 64% in WC). 1000 seed weight was only affected by defoliation severity in WC (0.544 and 0.562 g for 4 and 10 em height respectively). Potential seedling emergence, between June and December from soil seed bank, was 44 and 35% in BFT and WC, respectively.,Seedling emergence of Lotus corniculatus increased under high seed production levels (S3), and also it was improved under intensive grazing during autumn and winter. There were no effects on Trifolium repens seedling emergence. Soil seed bank can preserve seedling recruitment rates in the short term, but maintenance of species balance will depend on seeding spelling management.

J	Lodge, GM				Lodge, GM			Studies of soil seedbanks in native and sown pastures in northern New South Wales	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Total and germinable soil seedbanks (litter and soil) were studied for a native pasture and three sown pastures (dominated by Phalaris aquatica L. cv. Sirosa) in northern New South Wales from 1993 to 1996. Soil core samples were taken from continuously grazed plots for both pasture types and two oversown treatments in the native pasture and from a spring-autumn rest treatment at the sown pasture sites. At each site above ground herbage mass was also estimated regularly as part of the Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program. For all sites and treatments, the proportion of germinable seeds as a percentage of the total (dormant and germinable) seedbank ranged from 1-26% for the native pasture and 1-39% for the sown pastures. Germinable seed numbers ranged from 280 to 26,110 seeds per in, while total seedbank numbers were from 6700 to 178,360 seeds per m(2). Native pasture herbage mass was dominated by native perennial grasses, but seeds of these species were less than 20% of the total seed bank in all treatments in 1994 and 1995. At the sown pasture sites, most of the germinable (51-92%) and total (65-97%) seedbanks were either barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beaux, annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) or wireweed (Polygonum aviculare L.). Since seeds of annuals and other forbs generally dominated both the total and germinable seedbanks of these perennial grass-based pastures, these species were likely to increase over time, Seeds of the sown perennial grass Phalaris aquatica L, cv. Sirosa were less than 1% or the total seedbanks in pastures sown in 1990 and less than 3% of those sown in 1979, With above average summer rainfall at the native pasture site in 1996 and prolific growth of redgrass, seeds of this species were 38-63% of the total and 11-29% of the germinable seedbank in May 1996. Except at this site and time, the species composition of the total and germinable seedbanks did not generally reflect the dominance of the above ground herbage mass of these pastures by perennial grasses.

J	Selinger-Looten, R; Muller, S				Selinger-Looten, R; Muller, S			Restoration of grassland in old maize-cultivated land: impact of mowing and role of soil seed bank	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												Grassland ecosystems have been altered by their transformation into cultivated land, particularly in floodplains where maize replaced alluvial meadows. The restoration of meadow plant communities after cultivation from commercial seed mixture is studied. Three methods of cutting are tested to estimate the most rapidly establishment of "desirables" species. The new plant communities and the neighbouring natural meadow vegetation are compared. As restoration of native species-rich meadows depends mainly on the increasing contribution of natural plant populations, the soil seed bank was estimated. By first cutting in the beginning or late June the sowing species are progressively replaced by typical meadow species (grasses or not). The floristic richness increased by 8 species in 4 years while the proportion of the sowing species declined (from 70% to 40%). In the case of lack of cutting, the floristic richness, which increased in the first time, declined because of bad conditions for seedling establishment (litter, shade, density and height of the cover...). The restoration of species-rich meadows is prevented by the poverty of the seed bank, which is mainly formed by annual species. The best solution seems to be the introduction of native species from the neighbouring meadows.																	0249-7395						2001	56	1					3	19									WOS:000168147900001

First, fire regimes have changed considerably over time through the effects of a changing climate, and sometimes even more dramatically through the influence of humans. Therefore it is unlikely that a close quantitative link exists between fire regime and biodiversity. Alternatively, if there is such a link, then biodiversity should have been highly variable in the past, even at the landscape scale. Second, it is impossible to re-enact all fire variables within forestry, particularly those operating at the landscape scale. An alternative to the superficial "emulation" of the past, which is so often claimed in today's forest management. would be to identify critical processes and habitats at the stand and landscape scale and find ways to maintain these at sufficient Levels. This requires detailed knowledge of the mechanisms involved, and will lead to very different solutions for different groups of species. For example: whereas the highly mobile fire-dependent insects can make use of randomly appearing and relatively small burns in the landscape, fire-dependent plants are typically seed bankers and require that fire returns to the same site within a reasonable time. For these and other more or less "sessile" organisms it is vital to designate selected stands and landscapes with long-term plans for the use of fire. Without such a long-term commitment to selected localities, much of the unique features associated with fire in the boreal landscape will be lost, despite a costly investment in prescribed burning.																	0282-7581						2001				3			62	69									WOS:000168543800007

To study the long-term dynamics of these populations, which are vulnerable to extinction, we have monitored the demography of a population in Fillmore Canyon in the Organ Mountains of southern New Mexico. Annual estimates of growth, survival, and reproduction were recorded for 2,152 individuals in 15 one-meter square plots for 6 years. We estimated a seed bank survival rate from experimental plots and constructed annual size-structured transition matrices to determine population growth rates. Annual growth rates varied widely between 0.46 and 1.72 and were strongly correlated with spring precipitation. We calculated a weighted mean matrix, based on the historical frequency of spring rainfall events, resulting in a population growth rate of 1.02. The relationship between population growth rate and precipitation was used to calculate a mean growth rate from 75 years of recorded climate data and to project future growth rates under different climate conditions. These methods provide both an additional approach to modeling population persistence and a clearer understanding of the likelihood of extinction for a species dependent on mesic habitat in Fillmore Canyon.																							2001		23					70	77									WOS:000175529000010

J	Bussan, AJ; Boerboom, CM				Bussan, AJ; Boerboom, CM			Modeling the integrated management of velvetleaf in a corn-soybean rotation	WEED SCIENCE												The objectives of this study were to model the influence of herbicides, wilt disease, and mechanical treatments on velvetleaf population dynamics, annualized net return (ANR), and economic optimum threshold (EOT) in a 20-yr rotation involving alternate years of corn and soybean. Mechanical treatments were interrow cultivation in corn and rotary hoeing in soybean. Herbicides at a quarter (1/4x) rate or lower did not reduce velvetleaf seed banks without mechanical treatments in the absence of wilt. Herbicides at full (1x) and half (1/2x) rates decreased velvetleaf seed banks 95% within 6 and 20 yr, respectively, when there was no wilt. Herbicides at 1/2x rates with mechanical treatments reduced the seed bank 95% in only 10 yr, but mechanical treatments did not increase the rate of seed bank decline with 1x rates. Wilt infection had to occur annually to reduce velvetleaf seed banks as effectively as herbicides at 1x rates alone. ANR was maximized with herbicides at reduced rates, even though they were not as effective at reducing seed banks as were 1x rates. The herbicide rate required to maximize ANR increased as the initial velvetleaf seed bank density increased. Mechanical treatments and wilt decreased the herbicide rate required to maximize ANR. In fact, wilt infection increased the ANR of herbicides at reduced rates. The EOT was 0.55 and 0.4 seedlings m(-2) when velvetleaf was managed with herbicides at 1x and 1/2x rates, respectively. Mechanical treatment had no effect on EOT but wilt increased the EOT Herbicides at reduced rates should only be used to manage velvetleaf in fields with a low seed bank density when integrated with mechanical treatments or when the field has a history of wilt. Herbicides should be used at 1x rates when fields have a large velvetleaf seed bank and when integrated management practices are not used.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				JAN-FEB	2001	49	1					31	41		10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0031:MTIMOV]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000175241300006						
J	Buhler, DD; Kohler, KA; Thompson, RL				Buhler, DD; Kohler, KA; Thompson, RL			Weed seed bank dynamics during a five-year crop rotation	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Cultural practices used for crop production influence the composition of the weed seed bank in the soil. This paper reports the results of a 5-yr experiment to characterize the weed seed bank conducted on a farmer-managed field in central Iowa. The number of weed seeds in the soil and their vertical distribution were examined each October. At the initial sampling in October 1994, the field had been in hay production and about 80% of the weed seeds were common waterhemp and foxtail species. The cropping sequence over the next 3 yr was corn/soybean/corn using a ridge tillage system. Over this period, the density of common waterhemp seeds declined each year. The density of foxtail seeds declined by almost 90% during the first year of corn and did not change during the following years of soybean and corn production. Prior to moldboard plowing of the hay sward in 1994, weed seeds were concentrated in the upper 10 cm of soil. Moldboard plowing resulted in a more uniform distribution of the weed seeds over the upper 20 cm of soil, and the distribution across depths remained relatively constant during the 3 yr of corn and soybean production. During the final year of the experiment, the field was rotated to oat and reseeded with hay species. The number of common waterhemp and foxtail seeds in the soil greatly increased following oat/hay production and seeds were concentrated in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile. Results indicated that the processes affecting the weed seed bank in production fields are complex and will vary greatly based on the production practices used and the timing of their application.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2001	15	1					170	176		10.1614/0890-037X(2001)015[0170:WSBDDA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000175240600027						
J	Humphrey, LD; Schupp, EW				Humphrey, LD; Schupp, EW			Seed banks of Bromus tectorum-dominated communities in the Great Basin	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Many shrub-steppe communities of the Great Basin have been converted to Bromus tectorum-dominated communities. Seed production and seed bank traits of native perennials may be poorly suited to conditions of communities dominated by this introduced annual, and native perennials may be lost from the seed banks. Seed banks of former shrub-steppe communities now dominated by annuals were quantified on 3 sites in western Utah to determine if seeds of native perennials were present and to track changes in Bromus tectorum seed densities and species composition of seed banks after fire. Burned and unburned plots on 1 site were sampled for 3 years after a wildfire. Plots consisted of grids of 5.2-cm-diameter soil cores. Seeds were quantified by monitoring seedling emergence from these cores over an extended period of time in the greenhouse. On unburned,plots introduced annuals, mainly Bromus tectorum, constituted >99% of the seed bank, with Bromus densities of 4800-12,800 seeds m(-2). Immediately after the fire, Bromus seed density was <3% of unburned plots, but its seed bank density recovered in 2 years. The major change in species composition of the seed bank following fire was a shift in proportional abundance between Bromus and 2 other introduced annuals immediately after the fire. One native annual and a native annual/perennial (Oenothera pallida) increased in the seed bank the 1st year after the fire. Of all samples, only 4 perennial-plant seeds representing 3 species (excluding Oenothera) were found, for a total perennial-plant seed bank of 2-3 seeds m(-2). Lack of perennial-plant seeds in annual-dominated communities impairs the reestablishment of native perennials. Because perennial-plant seeds are so few, the reduction of Bromus seed banks by fire provides no opportunity for reestablishment of native species.

Aerosol smoke and conventional smoke water products are not practical for use in broad-scale seed bank regeneration programmes due to infrastructure limitations and the high rate of application required for their use. Concentrated smoke products have been found to be effective in stimulating soil seed banks and are suitable for broad-scale use due to the lower rate of application required to elicit germination within smoke-responsive species. The use of concentrated smoke products on undisturbed soil seed banks at 50 and 100 mL m(-2) increased total seedling numbers 10-fold, while species richness more than doubled over untreated controls. Although aerosol smoke applied directly to soil promoted 10 times more seedlings compared to concentrated smoke products, species richness levels in each treatment were similar. Concentrated smoke products cause leaf scorch when applied directly over plants in active growth, with limited to nil damage when plants are not actively growing. The affected plants generally recovered following application of concentrated smoke products as a foliar spray.

(Asteraceae). Z. bicolorata became abundant in 1990, and since 1992 there has been regular outbreaks resulting in the defoliation of the weed in central Queensland. In this study we evaluated the impact of defoliation by Z. bicolorata on P. hysterophorus from 1996 to 1998. Z. bicolorata caused 91-100% defoliation resulting in reductions in weed density by 32-93%, plant height by 18-65%, plant biomass by 55-89%, flower production by 75-100%, soil seed-bank by 13-86% and seedling emergence in the following season by 73-90%. At sites with continued outbreaks of Z. bicolorata, it is expected that the existing soil seed-bank will be minimised, resulting in reduced density of parthenium in 6 to 7 years.

J	Gavazzi, M; Seiler, J; Aust, W; Zedaker, S				Gavazzi, M; Seiler, J; Aust, W; Zedaker, S			The influence of elevated carbon dioxide and water availability on herbaceous weed development and growth of transplanted loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings were grown in competition with native weeds using soil and seed bank collected from recently chopped and burned areas near Appomattox, Virginia. One-year-old seedlings were planted and weeds allowed to germinate from the native seed bank while being exposed to CO2 (ambient and elevated approximately 700 ppm) and water (water stressed and well watered) treatments for approximately one growing season in a greenhouse. Elevated CO2 did not influence total weed biomass; however, C-3 weed community development was favored over C-4 weed community development in elevated CO2 regardless of water availability. This suggests that weed community composition may shift toward C-3 plants in a future elevated CO2 atmosphere. Pine growth was significantly greater in the well watered and elevated CO2 treatments compared to the water stressed and ambient treatments, respectively, even though they were competing with native herbaceous weeds for resources. There was a significant water and CO2 interaction for pine root:shoot ratio. Under elevated CO2, root:shoot ratio was significantly greater in the water stressed treatment than the well watered treatment. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the root:shoot ratio under the ambient CO2 treatment for either water treatment. These results suggest that loblolly pine seedlings will respond favorably in an elevated CO2 atmosphere, even under dry conditions and competing with herbaceous weeds.

Agricultural policy in the Pennine Dales Environmentally Sensitive Area in northern England aims to enhance plant species diversity in agriculturally improved meadows and return them to a 'traditional' species composition. The interacting effects of management on vegetation and productivity were tested in a split-split-split plot experiment. Three grazing treatments (autumn grazing with cattle and sheep, spring grazing with sheep. both regimes) were applied between 1990 and 98. Two fertilizer treatments (25 kg ha(-1) N plus 12.5 kg ha(-1) P(2)O(5) and K(2)O, no fertilizer): three hay cut date treatments (14 June, 21 July, 1 September) and two seed addition treatments (no seed, seed of many species) were used within the grazing treatments. 2. By 1998, all the main treatments had produced small but significant changes to plant species diversity. A particularly large increase in diversity occurred with the combination of autumn and spring grazing. 21 July hay cut date and seed addition treatments. This change was achieved by an episodic rather than a regular increase in species over time. 3. Rhinanthus minor spread to most plots after its introduction as a constituent of the seed treatment. By 1996 it was particularly abundant in all treatment combinations that included autumn grazing, no mineral fertilizer and a July haycut. Populations of > 40 plants m(-2) were associated with the lowest yields of hay. 4. 'Unimproved-traditional' plant communities, mainly Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland, occupied more than 66% of the trial area. Anthoxanthum odoratuam-Gerantium sylvaticum grasslands were most abundant in 1996, being primarily associated with the combination of autumn and spring grazing, 21 July and September hay cut dates and seed addition treatments, over both fertilizer treatments. 5. Yields of herbage biomass initially declined over time in all treatment combinations. Lowest yields in most years were associated with the autumn and spring grazing, 14 June cutting date and no fertilizer treatments. 6. Management to increase the number of plant species in agriculturally improved mesotrophic grassland requires the joint implementation of appropriate cut date and grazing regimes, probably to provide regeneration niches, and the application of seed to provide species to fill these niches. The small amount of mineral fertilizer used in this experiment had a measurable effect, but was of lesser importance.																	0021-8901					DEC	2000	37	6					1029	1043		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00566.x							WOS:000166979900012						
J	Marone, L; Horno, ME; Del Solar, RG				Marone, L; Horno, ME; Del Solar, RG			Post-dispersal fate of seeds in the Monte desert of Argentina: patterns of germination in successive wet and dry years	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Patterns of seed germination of grass and forb species were studied in open Prosopis woodland of the central Monte desert (Argentina) during several years, to test the hypotheses that (i) seed germination is positively affected by both rainfall and protection afforded by vegetation cover (a facilitative effect), (ii) the number of surviving plants is positively influenced by rainfall but negatively affected by established vegetation (a competitive effect), and (iii) seed loss from soil banks owing to germination is lower than that caused by granivorous animals. 2 Forb species germinated during restricted periods, either in early autumn or in spring. Grasses, however, germinated throughout the growing season, but because seedlings could not be identified to species level, it was impossible to discern whether different species germinated in particular seasons, or if all grasses germinated in all seasons. Grass and forb germination were generally of similar magnitude, but grass germination increased by an order of magnitude during a summer of unusually abundant rainfall related to an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. 3 Overall, the spatial distribution of neither germinating seeds nor surviving plants could be explained by interactions with established vegetation (facilitation and competition effects, respectively). An alternative explanation may be provided by the distribution of forb and grass seeds in the soil. 4 Seed loss owing to germination was low in both dry and rainy years. For forbs, such loss totalled < 1% of soil-seed reserves, and no forb species suffered losses > 4%. Total grass-seed loss to germination was usually < 0.5%, and the 5% reached in 1997-98 corresponded to an interruption of a prolonged drought by unusually abundant rainfall associated with a reduced seed bank. 5 Grass-seed loss caused by germination was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that reported due to autumn-winter granivory in the central Monte desert.																	0022-0477					DEC	2000	88	6					940	949		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00508.x							WOS:000166795700001						
J	Vleeshouwers, LM; Kropff, MJ				Vleeshouwers, LM; Kropff, MJ			Modelling field emergence patterns in arable weeds	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												A model was developed to simulate weed emergence patterns after soil cultivation. In the model, the consecutive processes of dormancy release, germination and pre-emergence growth nt re modelled in separate modules. Input variables of the model were: date of soil cultivation, soil temperature and soil penetration resistance. Output variables of the model were: seedling density and timing of seedling emergence. The model was parameterized for Polygonum persicaria, Chenopodsium album and Spergula arvensis with data from previous field and laboratory experiments. The model was evaluated with data from an experiment, in which emergence of P. persicaria, C. album and S.arvensis was monitored in field plots that were cultivated once only, at one of five dates in the spring. At the same time as the field. observations on seedling emergence, seasonal changes in seed dormancy of the buried weed seeds were assessed by testing the germination of seed lots that were buried in envelopes. From a comparison between field observations and simulated data, it appeared that the model overestimated the rate of dormancy) release in spring, whereas germination and pre-emergence growth were simulated well. In general, therefore, both the numbers of emerging seedlings and the timing of emergence could be predicted accurately, when dormancy was nut simulated but introduced from experimental data. Improvement of predictions of field emergence of weeds should mainly focus on increasing the precision of the simulation of dormancy release. Close correlations were found between seedbed temperature and both the extent and rate of seedling emergence, but analysis with the simulation model revealed that the were only partly based on causal relationships, so that they have limited predictive value.

J	Zimmerman, JK; Pascarella, JB; Aide, TM				Zimmerman, JK; Pascarella, JB; Aide, TM			Barriers to forest regeneration in an abandoned pasture in Puerto Rico	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Sources of forest regeneration (soil seed bank, seed rain) and barriers to seedling establishment were examined in a recently abandoned pasture in eastern Puerto Rico. Few woody species were found in the soil seed bank or in the seed rain. The number of seeds and species in the seed rain and soil seed bank declined with distance from the adjacent secondary forest Nine species naturally dispersed and colonized plots during the study, with the wind-dispersed tree Tabebuia heterophylla being the predominant colonizer (91% of all seedlings). Barriers to seedling establishment were determined using a blocked field experiment with eleven woody species representative of a variety of life histories. Each species was planted under the pasture vegetation (control) or in areas where all vegetation was removed (removal). Germination was enhanced for four species in the control treatment five species were not affected, and two species did not germinate under either treatment. Survival to 6 months was higher in the removal treatment for two species. Seedling biomass was greater in the removal treatment at 12 months for one species. Seed mass was a good predictor of germination success and final shoot biomass, but not survival. This study demonstrates that seeding recently abandoned pastures with a mix of known pioneer species may accelerate the rate of secondary succession, but some species will have to be planted in later successional stages in order to overcome strong barriers to establishment.																	1061-2971					DEC	2000	8	4					350	360		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2000.80050.x							WOS:000165993400004						
J	Wijdeven, SMJ; Kuzee, ME				Wijdeven, SMJ; Kuzee, ME			Seed availability as a limiting factor in forest recovery processes in Costa Rica	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Abandoned pastures and secondary forests are increasingly prominent features of tropical landscapes. Forest regrowth on abandoned pastures is generally slow and virtually limited to regeneration from seeds from external sources, since agricultural activities alter site conditions. We hypothesize that seed availability is a major limiting factor in forest recovery on abandoned pastures. This hypothesis was tested by studying the seed bank, seed rain, and seed predation in a small pasture (I ha) situated in a forest-pasture mosaic in northwestern Costa Pica. The tree seed density in the pasture seed bank was much lower (21/m(2)) than the density in the seed bank of a neighboring secondary forest (402/m(2)). Within a period of five weeks, 23 tree seeds entered the pasture by seed rain. This number is low compared to densities found in closed forests but higher than densities reported in other studies where virtually no seeds were found beyond 20 m from the forest edge. Possibly the small size of the pasture with seed sources nearby and the small-scale landscape mosaic enhance seed dispersal. Predation limits the seed density in pastures, with 42% of the woody species consumed by predators. The low seed density in the seed bank, and hampered recruitment combined with significant losses, pose severe restrictions to forest recovery on abandoned pastures. Moderate land use, and small sized clearings with seed sources nearby may increase the pace of recovery. Nevertheless, forest establishment may still take a considerable time. Thus, enlarging the available pool of species may be a worthwhile management strategy.																	1061-2971					DEC	2000	8	4					414	424		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2000.80056.x							WOS:000165993400010						
J	Quilichini, A; Debussche, M				Quilichini, A; Debussche, M			Seed dispersal and germination patterns in a rare Mediterranean island endemic (Anchusa crispa Viv., Boraginaceae)	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We analyse and discuss patterns of seed dispersal and germination of a rare endemic plant species, Anchusa crispa Viv. (Boraginaceae) from Corsica and Sardinia. This coastal plant inhabits dunes and back-dunes, and, currently numbers only a few thousand individuals which generally occur in isolated populations. This study included experiments conducted in the field in Corsica and also under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Short-distance dispersal of A. crispa is performed by ants, both by myrmecochory and dyszoochory. The invasion of an exotic species of ant, Linepithema humile, could locally modify the dispersal system and possibly the population dynamics of A. crispa. Long-distance dispersal may occur by water transport since seeds can germinate after at least I week of immersion in seawater and readily float on the surface. Burial of seeds is favourable for germination, percentage germination being maximised at a depth of 1-2 cm below the soil surface. A. crispa has a seed bank of about ten Viable seeds per m(2), which may contribute to the survival of this species which exists in small populations with a short life span. Due to its seed dispersal and germination patterns, the conservation of this species will necessitate that human disturbance, which can destabilise the surface of the sand is prevented and that new populations are introduced to favourable sites.

J	Amiaud, B; Bonis, A; Bouzille, JB				Amiaud, B; Bonis, A; Bouzille, JB			Germination conditions and role of herbivores in the dispersion and recruitment of a clonal species: Juncus gerardi Lois.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The finding of new individuals of a clonal plant, Juncus gerardi, raised the question of modalities for the colonization of new sites by this species. Indeed, the existence of seedlings has not been observed in the field, nor reported in the literature for European marshes. Among the parameters limiting recruitment, we examined the soil seed bank, which appeared extremely small. Many seeds could be found in bovine feces but few were found in equine feces. Futhermore, bovines are not only important for seed dispersion, but also for the improvement of the germinative capacities: the seed germination rate of Juncus gerardi was doubled after digestive transit. Germination testing showed that this species is largely tolerant to salinity (from 0 to 26,4 mS.cm(-1)). The germination rate was maximal with a thermoperiod of 10-20 degreesC but null for a 0-10 degreesC thermoperiod. Germination was improved by immersion and was light dependent. The critical phase for colonization success in new habitats could be primarily seedling survival. Recruitment success in Juncus gerardi seems to be a rare event, requiring the combination of favorable conditions related to climate and gap openings in swards.																	0008-4026					NOV	2000	78	11					1430	1439		10.1139/b00-117							WOS:000166004300006						
J	Kent, R; Odum, HT; Scatena, FN				Kent, R; Odum, HT; Scatena, FN			Eutrophic overgrowth in the self-organization of tropical wetlands illustrated with a study of swine wastes in rainforest plots	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The relationship of plant species diversity to cultural eutrophy in tropical wetlands was studied in Puerto Rico with experimental plots, a survey of 25 eutrophic sites developing from the wastes of society, and a simulation mini-model. The model is a quantitative hypothesis which contains the mechanisms to maximize empower (gross production) by reinforcing low diversity, net production overgrowth when resources are in excess, but switches to high diversity efficiency and recycle to maximize gross production when excess resources are absent. To study self-organization with eutrophy, six wetland plots (3 x 2 m) were seeded with many plant species and treated for five months with pig wastewaters and control plots with groundwater. Vegetation was seeded: (1) with seed bank; (2) with ten species of local rainforest and wetland trees (60 individuals in each plot); and (3) with weedy species invading from fertile surroundings. The fertilized waste plots filled in with vegetation in less than half the time (9 weeks) required for the clear water control plots (21 weeks). Vegetative diversity in both waste and control plots was maximum (2.73-3.34 bits per individual) shortly before 100% cover was reached, and then declined with the competitive overgrowth of a few species (mixed grasses and Commelina diffusa). Of the planted seedlings, there was little growth, and individuals of only four species survived. Survival of Andira inermis and Cyrilla racemiflora was 42 and 53%, respectively. Dominants of oligotrophic wetlands (Pterocarpus officinalis and Prestoea montana) were displaced. A survey of 25 other wetland sites, receiving high nutrient waters from developments, found low diversity overgrowth, but different species prevailing. Eighty-five species were involved in wetland self-organizational processes and ecological engineering management. Eutrophic wetlands, such as those released from sugar cane closure in Puerto Rico and elsewhere, may be in a state of marshy, arrested succession because there may not be a forest species already adapted for rapid reforestation of the excess nutrient habitat. The study provides evidence of the overgrowth principle as the natural means for ecological engineering of eutrophic interfaces between the current civilization and environment.

J	Odum, HT; Doherty, SJ; Scatena, FN; Kharecha, PA				Odum, HT; Doherty, SJ; Scatena, FN; Kharecha, PA			Emergy evaluation of reforestation alternatives in Puerto Rico	FOREST SCIENCE												Six alternative ways of reforesting degraded lands in Puerto Rico were evaluated using emergy (spelled with an "m"). Emergy and its economic equivalent, emdollars, put the contributions of environmental work and human services on a comparable basis. This article shows the emergy method for evaluating forest contributions to public benefit and its use to select alternatives for reforestation. Emdollar values were compared for six scenarios for reforestation of degraded land in Puerto Rico: (1) the natural succession within or adjacent to mature forest; (2) reforestation from the spread of the exotic tree siris (Albizia lebbek); (3) reforestation with plantations of siris and mahogany for harvest; (4) reforestation by leaving plantations unharvested; (5) direct planting of seedlings of many species; and (6) starting patches of forest by massive transfer of topsoil, seed bank, and roots. After energy systems diagrams were made for each reforestation alternative, data were assembled and evaluation tables prepared that estimated the emergy required for: (1) canopy closure and (2) developing species complexity if left unharvested. To explain the method, detailed calculations were included for one of the alternatives, exotic Albizia lebbek plantation on 11 yr harvest cycle. All alternatives generated net public benefit (emdollar yield ratios 4.2 to 24.3). The emdollar value of a closed canopy developed in :10 to 20 yr ranged from 20,000 to 48,000 em$ /ha, whereas the economic costs were $1200 to $9700. For complex forest development in 25 to 60 yr, values ranged from 63,000 to 118,000 em$ /ha, much higher than economic costs of $4000 to $12,000/ha. Highest public benefit per dollar cost came from succession (24.7 em$/$) and exotic colonization (19.1 em$/$). Highest potential monetary returns were from exotic spread (15.1 $/$) and plantations (17.9 and 14.5 $/$). Stand quality after 60 yr, as measured by the transformity (emergy/energy), was largest in mahogany plantation (6.4 x 10(4) sej/J) and succession forest (3.9 x 10(4) sej/J).																	0015-749X	1938-3738				NOV	2000	46	4					521	530									WOS:000170456000006						
J	Reinhold, K				Reinhold, K			Maintenance of a genetic polymorphism by fluctuating selection on sex-limited traits	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Fluctuating selection is often thought to be ineffective in maintaining a genetic polymorphism except when generations overlap, for example when a seed bank causes a storage effect. Here, I demonstrate that fluctuating selection on sex-limited traits automatically includes such a 'storage effect' because sex-limited alleles are shielded from selection in the sex where they are not expressed. With analytical calculations and numerical simulations I show that fluctuating selection can maintain a genetic polymorphism in sex-limited traits. Such a protected polymorphism can reduce the cost of sex when female-limited traits are involved. But, this effect will probably be small compared to the two-fold advantage of asexual reproduction unless many polymorphic loci interact or exceptionally strong environmental fluctuations are present. It is argued that genetic polymorphisms maintained by fluctuating selection on sex-limited traits may partly explain the large genetic variance of traits under strong sexual selection.

J	Perez, EM; Bulla, L				Perez, EM; Bulla, L			Dietary relationships among four granivorous doves in Venezuelan savannas	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												A total of 537 crops from four coexisting granivorous doves (Columbina minuta, C. passerina, C. talpacoti and Scardafella squammata), collected on seven sampling dates in a Venezuelan savanna, were examined to assess food partitioning. These closely related doves are resident birds, and overlap broadly both in daily activity patterns and habitat use; in circumstances like this, segregation in the use of food resources often occurs. It was found that: (a) differences in body dimensions did not account for variations in seed size taken by doves: they all ate seeds in the same size range and they showed high similarity in seed size preferred; (b) the importance of different seed sizes in the diets changed seasonally with similar tendencies for all four species, (c) there were differences up to 4-fold in mean seed size consumed by individuals of the same species on the same date; (d) seeds of 63 plant species were consumed by the four dove species and constituted from 98 to 99.5% of the diets; (e) high dietary overlap both in prey size and prey type was found throughout the year. The dietary relationships found in this study support the idea that these birds forage opportunistically, and that some differences found among their diets may be the result of random seed sampling from the heterogeneous seed pool available.																	0266-4674					NOV	2000	16		6				865	882									WOS:000166498000006						
J	Pugnaire, FI; Lazaro, R				Pugnaire, FI; Lazaro, R			Seed bank and understorey species composition in a semi-arid environment: The effect of shrub age and rainfall	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Understorey vegetation in patches of Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs in semi-arid environments is dependent on the overstorey shrub life history. Community structure changes with shrub age as a result of physical amelioration of environmental conditions by the canopy and organic matter accumulation in the soil. We investigated the effect of the canopy on understorey species diversity in the field and its relationships with the soil seed bank under 50 shrubs from 5 to 25+ years old, and compared species composition in the field in a wet and a dry year. Species composition of the soil seed bank under R. sphaerocarpa shrubs did not differ significantly with shrub age, but seed density increased as the shrubs aged. In the field, community composition changed with shrub age, increasing species richness in a process that depended on the amount of spring rainfall. Our results suggest that the soil seed bank is rather uniform and that the shrub canopy strongly selects which species appear in the understorey. There were seeds of many species present under both young and old shrubs but which only established under old shrubs. This showed dispersal was not limiting species abundance and suggested that the canopy was an important sorting factor for species present in the understorey. Less frequent species contributed the most to patch diversity, and rainfall effectively controlled species emergence. Understorey community composition depended on multiple interspecific interactions, such as facilitation by the shrub and competition from neighbours, as well as on dispersal processes. Facilitation in this environment is a key feature in the structuring of plant communities and in governing ecosystem functioning. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY					1st Joint Conference of the Ecological-Society-of-Australia/New-Zealand-Ecological-Society	1998	DUNEDIN, NEW ZEALAND	Ecol Soc Australia, New Zealand Ecol Soc				The exotic shrub Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius) has invaded large areas of eucalypt woodland at Barrington Tops, New South Wales, where it forms dense stands that have significant impacts on vegetation structure, flora and fauna. Data are presented from four 25 m(2) plots, which have been studied since 1985. Two plots were located in uniform broom thickets of different ages, and two were located across the margins of broom stands, which have since expanded to cover the entire plots. All broom plants in the plots (other than young seedlings, which were counted) were mapped, tagged and monitored annually. New seedlings appeared annually, but there was no relationship between their numbers (varying between years) and subsequent recruitment of older plants. The probability of seedlings reaching first flowering was less than 2%, and of surviving to mature size (> 10 cm(2) basal area) was negligible. Seedlings mainly died through suppression (shade). Individuals less than 50 cm high were also browsed. Recruitment occurred only where light levels were high, either before closure of the broom canopy or after senescence had led to canopy opening. From approximately 12-30 years after initial invasion, broom stands underwent self-thinning of mature plants, accelerated by collapse of plants on to each other. Recruitment of new, maturing plants, after this period produced a stand that was less dense than that found after initial invasion. Broom is creating more disturbance-prone environments due to its impacts on other biota, likely alterations to the fire regime, and by harbouring feral pigs. Further disturbance favours broom, and elsewhere it has resulted in massive seedling regeneration. While fire or other disturbance can be used to stimulate germination, and thereby reduce a large part of the soil seed bank, denser broom infestations are likely to result unless follow-up treatments can be applied over long time periods. A wiser management option, at least in the short term, may be avoidance of all disturbance, especially for stands of mature broom.

J	Buist, M; Yates, CJ; Ladd, PG				Buist, M; Yates, CJ; Ladd, PG			Ecological characteristics of Brachychiton populneus (Sterculiaceae) (kurrajong) in relation to the invasion of urban bushland in south-western Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY					1st Joint Conference of the Ecological-Society-of-Australia/New-Zealand-Ecological-Society	1998	DUNEDIN, NEW ZEALAND	Ecol Soc Australia, New Zealand Ecol Soc				Brachychiton populneus (Sterculiaceae) (Schott et Endl.) R. Br. (kurrajong) is a small tree that occurs naturally ranging from southern Queensland to Victoria. It has been widely planted as an ornamental tree in south-western Australia. In Kings Park, B. populneus has moved from cultivation to become a weed in the adjoining bushland reserve. The aim of this study was to examine the ecology of B. populneus and the Kings Park environment in order to identify the particular conjunction of characteristics that have led to the species becoming a weed. The highest density of kurrajongs (69.3 trees ha(-1)) was observed in the most disturbed area of Kings Park, and there was a strong relationship between density of B. populneus and disturbance (P = 0.058). The most striking feature of the invasion was the tendency of B. populneus to occur beneath other tree species, and this was attributed to birds feeding on transported fruit in trees and rats building seed caches at their base. Mature trees produced large amounts of viable seed, but rates of seed predation were high. Weevils, beetle larvae and omnivorous vertebrates such as Australian ravens, magpies and introduced black rats were observed eating seeds. The foraging behaviour of the vertebrates may facilitate the dispersal of seeds for relatively long distances away from parent plants. Seeds that escape predation form a transient seed bank and germinate with the onset of the winter rains. Early in their development, seedlings allocate resources to form a large tap-rooted tuber that has substantial starch and water reserves, allowing seedlings to survive the long dry and hot summers in Perth. The study observed that B. populneus could survive at least one fire by resprouting from basal dormant buds. Brachychiton populneus appears to have become a weed in Kings Park because, first, it is dispersed widely into new sites through the foraging behaviour of vertebrates and once germinated has no grazing pressure, and, second, its development of a root tuber and ability to resprout means the seedlings are resilient in this frequently disturbed Mediterranean environment. While management of existing plants is relatively straightforward, continued vigilance will be required to avoid reinvasion.

Subsequent exposure of seedlings to -12 degreesC for 7 days killed all seedlings, while exposure to 4 degreesC killed only 18% to 28%, The temperature regimes of -12 degreesC for 4 days, and 32 degreesC for 4 days followed by -12 degreesC killed 95%, 78%, and 68% of the johnsongrass, hemp sesbania, and barnyardgrass, respectively.																	0018-5345					OCT	2000	35	6					1092	1094		10.21273/HORTSCI.35.6.1092							WOS:000089964200024						
J	Hirst, RA; Pywell, RF; Putwain, PD				Hirst, RA; Pywell, RF; Putwain, PD			Assessing habitat disturbance using an historical perspective: The case of Salisbury Plain military training area	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Chalk grasslands are a habitat with high European importance for both flora and fauna. The largest known expanse of unimproved chalk grassland in north-west Europe lies within the Salisbury Plain training area (SPTA) in SW England, where sole use of the land for military training since the end of the nineteenth century has limited the ecologically damaging impacts of modern intensive agriculture. Organisational changes in the British Army may now paradoxically be threatening this unique ecological resource. In this study, historical aerial photograph analysis was carried out for SPTA using images from the 1940s through to the mid 1990s. Image analysis software enabled the creation of a model that analysed the extent and pattern of high intensity military disturbance on SPTA at a local landscape scale. Although trends in disturbance vary across SPTA for the time period under investigation, the average annual increase in bare ground since WWII has been in the region of 25.5ha. These trends indicate that disturbance is occurring at a greater rate than natural regeneration, representing a significant threat to the chalk grassland through habitat loss and fragmentation.

J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW			Studies on the ecological life cycle of the native winter annual grass Alopecurus carolinianus, with particular reference to seed germination biology in a floodplain habitat	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Alopecurus carolinianus is a widely-distributed native winter annual grass that grows in the same cultivated floodplain habitat as the narrowly-endemic winter annual Lesquerella lescurii (Brassicaceae). Most seeds of A. carolinianus buried under nonflooded conditions and exposed to seasonal temperature changes had an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle, being dormant in spring and nondormant in autumn. However, 1-16% of the seeds exhumed in spring could germinate at 15/ 6 and 20/10 degreesC. Nondormant seeds were not induced into dormancy by a 12-wk period of burial at 5 degreesC; mean monthly minimum temperatures were about 1-3 degreesC when buried seeds entered dormancy. Seeds flooded in October, November, or December under natural temperature conditions germinated to 61-99% at 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15 degreesC the following May, but those flooded in February, March, or April germinated to only 1-23% at these temperatures. Thus, flooding prior to the time that temperatures are low enough to induce dormancy could result in many seeds being capable of germinating in spring. Plants flowered under short and long days and had little or no vernalization requirement for flowering. Consequently, plants from spring-germinating seeds can complete their Life cycle if not destroyed by soil cultivation. The species has a small, relatively short-lived persistent seed bank. In contrast, buried seeds of L,. lescurii have an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle with dormancy induced at temperatures of 20/10 and 15/6 degreesC in October and November (Baskin t al. 1992). Lesquerella lescurii also has a large, long-lived seed bank, which ensures persistence at the site if no seed production occurs in spring. Although flooding may destroy all A. carolinianus plants from autumn-germinating seeds, it also prevents many seeds from entering dormancy. Production of seeds by A. carolinianus plants from spring-germinating seeds would help ensure persistence at the site and compensate for lack of prolonged seed viability.																	0040-9618					OCT-DEC	2000	127	4					280	290		10.2307/3088646							WOS:000165795400003

During the ENSO year 1997 cover of ephemerals increased in all three sites; 43% vs 8% on the xeric slope 75% vs 26% on the mesic slope and 57% vs 32% in the ravine. The number of species was almost three times higher. On the xeric slope (27 vs 10 species), increased by 47% on the mesic slope (28 vs 19) and by 14% in the ravine (24 vs 21). Cover of shrubs plus perennial grasses increased from 52% in 1996 to 59% in 1997 on the xeric slope, but no significant cover changes were found on the mesic slope or the ravine. On the xeric slope peak density of seeds was 4500/m(2) in 1996, while during the ENSO year it was 24000/m(2). On the mesic slops equivalent values were 3000 and 17000 seeds/m(2) while in the ravine figures were 8500 and 27000 seeds/m(2). The strong responses of ephemerals and seed bank to the ENSO-driven wet year of 1997 demonstrate the importance of this phenomenon in replenishing, recovering and probably maintaining ephemeral vegetation in this region.				jaksic, Fabian m/G-1705-2014													1100-9233					OCT	2000	11	5					641	648		10.2307/3236571							WOS:000166253100004						
J	Dai, XB				Dai, XB			Impact of cattle dung deposition on the distribution pattern of plant species in an alvar limestone grassland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Seed banks in cattle dung, soil under cattle dung and soil under vegetation and growth response of plant species to the changes in soil nitrogen availability were studied in an alvar limestone grassland on Oland, Sweden, in order to analyse the impact of dung deposition and decomposition on the formation of patches of plant species. Results suggest that parches of four plant species could result from cattle dung deposition and decomposition. Impact of dung could proceed in three ways: (1) by changing the relative abundance of species in the soil seed bank under dung, and/or (2) by influencing the deposition of seeds in the dung, and/or (3) by intensifying the growth of some species through nutrient release. Species patches could result from one or more of these aspects. For instance, patches of Arenaria serpyllifolia may be induced by dung deposition because of the dominance of its seeds in dung, while the pattern of Cerastium semidecandrum and Festuca ovina may be due to the abundance of their seeds in the soil seed bank under dung and their positive growth response to increased nitrogen availability.																	1100-9233					OCT	2000	11	5					715	724		10.2307/3236578							WOS:000166253100011						
J	Zedler, JB				Zedler, JB			Progress in wetland restoration ecology	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												it takes more than water to restore a wetland. Now, scientists are documenting how landscape setting, habitat type, hydrological regime, soil properties, topography, nutrient supplies, disturbance regimes, invasive species, seed banks and declining biodiversity can constrain the restoration process. Although many outcomes can be explained post hoc, we have little ability to predict the path that sites will follow when restored in alternative ways, and no insurance that specific targets will be met. To become predictive, bolder approaches are now being developed, which rely more on field experimentation at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and in many restoration contexts.																	0169-5347					OCT	2000	15	10					402	407		10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01959-5							WOS:000089443300010	10998517

Feeding by Z. bicolorata caused damage to meristems, resulting in shorter height of the primary stem and changed branching pattern. With no water stress, defoliation caused the plant height to be reduced by 13-56% and flower production by 25-45%, and the reductions were more significant when defoliated at early stages of plant growth. However, there were no reductions in leaf production and plant biomass in defoliated plants, irrespective of the plant stage at which defoliation was imposed. Under water stress, defoliation caused the plant height to be reduced by 10-31%, flower production by 31-75%, leaf production by 23-51%, and plant biomass by 2-9%. In water-stressed plants, the negative effects of defoliation on flower production, leaf production, and plant biomass were more significant when defoliated at flowering stage than at early stages of plant growth. The increase in the negative effects due to synergism between defoliation and water stress was only marginal. Flower production and root and shoot biomass declined with increase in the duration of defoliation. Defoliation for 74 days without water stress reduced flower production by 99%, shoot biomass by 67%, and root biomass 80%. In field-cage, Z. bicolorata caused 92% defoliation in about 90 days and reductions in plant height by 27%, root length by 56%, root biomass by 69%, shoot biomass by 81%, flower production by 83%, and soil seed-bank by 73%.

J	Ransom, JK				Ransom, JK			Long-term approaches for the control of Striga in cereals: field management options	CROP PROTECTION					XIVth International Plant Protection Congress (IPPC)	JUL 25-30, 1999	JERUSALEM, ISRAEL					Farmers in Africa have limited resources to invest in Striga control practices and longer term, low-input approaches are needed. Long-term Striga control approaches focus on controlling the production of new Striga seeds and on reducing the number of seeds in the soil. Several seasons of hand weeding are required before the beneficial effect on the cereal crop can be observed. Rotations with trap crops can reduce Striga seed banks but selection of a rotation crop should be based on socio-economic factors such as market value in addition to whether or not it can stimulate Striga seeds to germinate. Striga seed banks can be readily reduced in suppressive soils. Organic matter and fertilizer additions may help induce suppressiveness. Extension of long-term Striga control approaches requires intensive interaction with farmers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Edwards, MS				Edwards, MS			The role of alternate life-history stages of a marine macroalga: A seed bank analogue?	ECOLOGY												Many organisms occurring in temporally variable environments have evolved life-history traits that enable their populations to persist during unfavorable environmental conditions. Numerous terrestrial plants, insects, and marine invertebrates, for example, rely on resting stages that disperse their propagules in time. Although widely observed among many taxa, few examples exist for marine macroalgae, at least in part because of the methodology involved in studying them. Here, I determined that microscopic life stages of the annual marine macroalga Desmarestia ligulata overwinter during periods when the macroscopic thalli are absent, thereby allowing this species to persist in temporally variable environments. Examination of field-grown microscopic stages with fluorescence microscopy identified these stages as gametophytes. Holdfast tagging experiments determined that recruitment of the macroscopic stages was not enhanced by regrowth of perennial thalli as observed in other macroalgae, suggesting that overwintering gametophytes were the sole source of sporophyte recruitment. In contrast to true resting stages, Desmarestia gametophytes were not dormant, but rather were metabolically active, sensitive to small differences in environmental quality, and highly subject to physical damage. Gametophyte photosynthetic rates were greater under higher irradiance, and growth rates were greater under longer photoperiods and higher irradiance. Although their survival appeared to be reduced by grazing from large (>1 cm) invertebrates and sedimentation, gametophytes. were able to survive in the field for at least 15 mo and thereby enhance sporophyte recruitment more than a year after settlement. I suggest that Desmarestia gametophytes be regarded as alternate life-history stages that simply maintain populations under a different set of environmental conditions than the macroscopic sporophytes do, rather than as ''dormant" or "resting" stages.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				SEP	2000	81	9					2404	2415		10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2404:TROALH]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000089093500005						
J	Brown, G; Porembski, S				Brown, G; Porembski, S			Phytogenic hillocks and blow-outs as 'safe sites' for plants in an oil-contaminated area of northern Kuwait	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Towards the end of the Gulf War in 1991, the retreating Iraqi forces destroyed numerous oil installations in Kuwait, causing widespread oil pollution to extended areas of the desert ecosystem. Vegetation development in an oil-contaminated area of northern Kuwait, where the natural vegetation is dominated by the dwarf shrub Haloxylon salicornicum, was studied seven years after the release of the oil. Some sites of the study area were largely unaffected, whereas others were contaminated to varying degrees by oil. Tar-like oil tracks accounted for the largest proportion of contaminated ground, and these remained largely unvegetated. However, a number of Haloxylon shrubs survived the oil contamination mainly due to the presence of phytogenic hillocks around their bases. These phytogenic hillocks provided 'safe sites' for a number of plant species. This also applied to blow-outs, former phytogenic hillocks an the oil tracks that had been subject to severe sand deflation in recent years. Species composition on both the phytogenic hillocks and in the blow-outs was very similar to that of the control area. Laboratory studies showed that the seed bank under the oil tracks had been annihilated. The number of seedlings emerging from soil samples was lower on the phytogenic hillocks and blow-outs than in the control areas. We conclude that recolonization of oil tracks will gradually take place as the hard surface of the tracks begins to disintegrate, or in part becomes covered by sand. The break-up of the track surface has already begun to a limited extent, mainly due to factors such as off-road driving, large herds of grazing animals, burrowing animals (lizards, rodents) and colonies of ants. It is suggested that a specific programme aimed at breaking up the hard surface and allowing it to become mixed with uncontaminated sand would probably greatly enhance recolonization.																	0376-8929					SEP	2000	27	3					242	249		10.1017/S0376892900000278							WOS:000166150700004

Bip. Wedd., from the Andes Cordillera in Merida, Venezuela. We analysed the models and calculated population growth rate (lambda), sensitivities, elasticities and the sensitivity of the elasticities to changes in the vital rates. The analysis showed that the two species behave alike in general demographic terms. In both models, population growth rate is positive and sensitivities of lambda to changes in vital rates decrease markedly in this order: plant establishment, progression of juvenile-adult, germination and survival. The relative contributions of vital rates to lambda (elasticities) are very similar to those of other woody plant species: a higher contribution of survival and a very low contribution of fecundity. Transition from seedling to juvenile is most important and the younger established stages (juveniles and young adults) play a predominant demographic role in both populations. Seed banks and older adults are playing a relatively minor role in the dynamics of both populations. However, they may be important in relation to unpredictable, favourable or detrimental events. Perturbation analysis of elasticities showed that increasing the rate of plant establishment will decrease the relative importance of stasis. We conclude that both species are demographically very close, and similar to other long-lived woody plant species. However, the two species differ in the role of the seed bank, which seems more important in the demography of E. spicata than in E. timotensis.																	0960-7447					SEP	2000	9	5					403	413		10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00187.x							WOS:000090051800005						
J	Liao, JD; Monsen, SB; Anderson, VJ; Shaw, NL				Liao, JD; Monsen, SB; Anderson, VJ; Shaw, NL			Seed biology of rush skeletonweed in segebrush steppe	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea L.) is an invasive, herbaceous, long-lived perennial species of Eurasian or Mediterranean origin now occurring in many locations throughout the world. In the United States, it occupies over 2.5 million ha of rangeland in the Pacific Northwest and California. Despite the ecological and economic significance of this species, little is known of the ecology and life history characteristics of North American populations. The purpose of this study was to examine seed germination characteristics of 2 populations of rush skeletonweed in Idaho. Seeds from rush skeletonweed plants in southwestern Idaho were collected during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons. Mature seeds were harvested on 6 dates between early July and early October 1994, and on 5 dates between early July and late September 1995. Fresh seeds from each harvest period were measured to determine seed weight, total germination, rate of germination, and viability (tetrazolium staining [TZ]) of non-germinating seeds. An aliquot of seeds collected in 1994 was also stored for 1 year to examine the effects of seed storage on germination. In southwestern Idaho, rush skeletonweed produces seeds continuously from mid-July through October. Seeds were capable of immediate germination without scarification or wet prechilling. Total germination generally ranged from 60 to 100% throughout the entire seed production period. Germination was also rapid, reaching 50% of total germination in less than 12 days. In general, germination was higher at the lower incubation temperature regime (20/10 degreesC), perhaps reflecting origins of this species in Mediterranean winter rainfall regions. The TZ testing indicated that 30 to 60% of non-germinating seeds were viable, suggesting that seeds may persist in the soil seed bank. Up to 60% of seeds remained viable following 1 year of storage. Stored seeds generally exhibited higher germination rates ((x) over bar = 90%) than fresh seeds ((x) over bar = 67%), indicating possible dormancy and afterripening effects. Germination characteristics of this species are consistent with those of other invasive alien species, and favor rapid population growth leading to community dominance.																	0022-409X					SEP	2000	53	5					544	549		10.2307/4003656							WOS:000166156300012						
J	Smith, SE; Mosher, R; Fendenheim, D				Smith, SE; Mosher, R; Fendenheim, D			Seed production in sideoats grama populations with different grazing histories	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Frequent and intense defoliation. of grasses has been associated with the evolution of "grazing morphotypes" that exhibit a variety of vegetative traits correlated with improved grazing resistance, While recovery from a seed bank is not considered an important grazing resistance mechanism, relatively little is actually known regarding seed (caryopsis) production in grazing morphotypes of caespitose grasses. The goal of this research was to compare components of seed production in 2 populations of sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula var. caespitosa Gould & Kapadia) from nearby sites with different histories of livestock grazing. This was done using vegetative propagules of genotypes from both populations in a greenhouse study. The study was conducted in 2 flowering seasons under conditions considered favorable for seed production. The population exposed to livestock grazing showed a genetically based decrease in seed production relative to the ungrazed population. Lower seed production per plant in the grazed population was at least partially due to reduced numbers of tillers and panicles per plant and spikes per panicle that may be associated with selection for grazing tolerance, The grazed population also exhibited lower average seed production per spike indicating lower inherent floral fertility. Seed production was not closely correlated with vegetative traits associated with increased grazing tolerance, nor was there evidence of obvious physiological trade-offs related to decreased seed production in the grazed population, Lower seed production potential in populations of sideoats grama intensively grazed by livestock may lead to reduced potential for seedling colonization.

Seeds in the secondary forests germinated most rapidly in the first week, while the seeds of the seasonal rain forest and the slash-and-burn field soils germinated slowly over the first 6 weeks and peaked in the seventh and eighth weeks. Seed densities were 4585-65,665 seeds m(-2) for forest sites and 1130 seeds m(-2) for the slash-and-burn field in the top 10 cm of the soils. The seed density decreased with soil depth in the forest sites and tended to decline during succession. Herbs accounted for the largest proportion of seeds at all five sites. The importance of woody species, however, increased as forests became older. Slash and burn eliminated a large number of seeds in the upper soil and, consequently, reversed the vertical distribution of seeds in the soil and had a negative impact on family, genus and species richness of the soil seed bank as well.																	0960-2585					SEP	2000	10	3					255	264		10.1017/S0960258500000283							WOS:000165586100006						
J	Pammenter, NW; Berjak, P				Pammenter, NW; Berjak, P			Evolutionary and ecological aspects of recalcitrant seed biology	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH					3rd International Workshop on Desication Tolerance and Sensitivity of Seeds and Vegetative Plant Tissues	1997	KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA	Int Plant Genet Resources Inst				There is a substantial literature on the basic physiology and response to desiccation of recalcitrant seeds, but little is known about their ecology and even less of their evolutionary status. It is difficult to assess the response of early land plants to dehydration, but it is likely that desiccation tolerance in vegetative tissue arose concomitantly with the invasion of the land. Similarly, from the fossil record it is not possible to assess the desiccation response of early seeds, and furthermore, it is difficult to see phylogenetic relationships among species producing recalcitrant seeds. A consideration of the available evidence, however, suggests that the first seeds were desiccation-sensitive, but tolerance evolved early and probably a number of times, independently. The desiccation sensitivity and short life span (generally shorter than the interval between flowering) of recalcitrant seeds have implications in terms of regeneration ecology. A long-term soil seed bank as such does not exist; rather the seeds germinate and form a seedling bank. However, there is a wide range in post-shedding physiology among recalcitrant seed species, and although species producing recalcitrant seeds are common in the humid tropics, they do occur in habitats with more marked seasonal variation. Here regeneration strategies may be more specialized.

The fallow types were natural bush, planted Leucaena leucocephala, and Pueraria phaseoloides. The land-use intensities consisted of continuous cropping, invoking Zen mayslManihot esculenta and fallowing for 1, 2, and 3 yr, with each fallow period followed by 1 yr of Z. maysl M. esculenta cultivation. In 1994, seed rain in plots cropped after P phaseoloides fallow was significantly lower than in plots cropped after bush or L. leucocephala fallow Pueraria phaseoloides plots had similar seed rain as bush fallow plots in 1995, and the seed rain in these plots was significantly lower than in L. leucocephala plots. Weed seed rain was significantly higher in continuously cultivated plots across all fallow types than in plots that were cultivated after one or more years of fallow. The lowest seed rain was in plots that were cropped once after a 3-yr fellow. The largest quantity of weed seed input in the plots occurred in either August or September reflecting the life cycle of the annual weeds that dominated the vegetation. Individual species differed in pattern and duration of shedding seeds within the fallow systems and land-use intensities. Annual weeds dominated the seed rain in continuously cropped plots, and seeds of perennial weeds were dominant in plots fallowed for more than 1 yr before cultivation. Weeds flowered earlier in continuously cropped plots than in plots that were cropped after 2 or 3 yr of fallow. Increased land-use intensity caused an increase in seed rain and consequently increased the soil seed bank. Pueraria phaseoloides fallow was more effective in shading weeds and probably reducing the quantity of light reaching them than the natural bush and planted L. leucocephala fallow systems, and this may have been the basis of the significantly tower seed rain in P phaseoloides plots.																	0043-1745					SEP-OCT	2000	48	5					604	612		10.1614/0043-1745(2000)048[0604:IOFTAL]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000089783100011

High spatial variability in physical habitat conditions such as summer-average sediment deposition, summer-average organic content, and surface-sediment grain size distributions were explainable using combinations of independent variables, including elevation, plant distributions, and distances to the tidal inlet and an adjacent stream.

J	Paveglio, FL; Kilbride, KM				Paveglio, FL; Kilbride, KM			Response of vegetation to control of reed canarygrass in seasonally managed wetlands of southwestern Washington	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) is an exotic, invasive species that degrades wetlands throughout North America. Although the efficacies of control methods for canarygrass have been studied, little information is available regarding response of wetland plant communities to these treatments, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Consequently, we investigated vegetative response to control of reed canarygrass in seasonally managed wetlands of southwestern Washington. We evaluated mechanical (disking or mowing) and chemical (Rodeo(R)) methods and combinations of disking and Rodeo with water-level management. Spraying and disking in the first: year with a follow-up application of Rodeo during the next growing season resulted in the most diverse plant community. Disking in the first year with a follow-up application of Rodeo during the next growing season also yielded a diverse plant community similar to the most efficacious treatment. Canarygrass that germinated from seeds and grew from viable rhizomes following drawdown after the initial Rodeo application or disking made a follow-up treatment with herbicide during the next growing season imperative to maintain a diverse community of wetland plants with little canarygrass. To prevent re-infestation of canarygrass, treatments should not be initiated until water levels can be managed consistently throughout late winter and early spring.																	0091-7648					FAL	2000	28	3					730	740									WOS:000089964500036						
J	Edwards, AL; Sharitz, RR				Edwards, AL; Sharitz, RR			Population genetics of two rare perennials in isolated wetlands: Sagittaria isoetiformis and S-teres (Alismataceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We investigated genetic structure in two closely related perennial plants that occur in isolated wetlands: Sagittaria isoetiformis, restricted to the southeastern Coastal Plain of North America, and S. teres, endemic to the northeastern Coastal Plain. Using horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis, we screened 527 individuals from Il populations of S. isoetiformis and 367 individuals from seven populations of S, teres. A high proportion of the 16 loci were polymorphic (%P-s = 93.8% in S. isoetiformis and %P-s = 75.0% in S. teres), with higher mean numbers of alleles per polymorphic locus and effective alleles per locus in S. isoeriformis (AP = 3.27, A(E) = 1.90) than in S. teres (AP = 2.58, A(H) = 1.30). Species- and population-level expected heterozygosities were higher in S. isoetiformis (H-ES = 0.399, H-EP = 0.218) than in S. teres (H-ES = 0.177, H-EP = 0.101). Jackkinife estimates of F statistics indicated moderate levels of inbreeding in S. teres ((F) over cap(ts) = 23.1%). Strong differentiation characterized these geographically isolated populations (G(ST) = 39.9% in S. isoetiformis, and G(ST), = 26.1% in S. teres). Genetic identities varied substantially within ((I) over bar = 75%, range = 0.558-0.963 in S. isoetiformis (I) over bar = 89%, range = 0.776-0.963 in S. teres) and among species ((I) over bar = 81%, range = 0.506-0.882), leading to the discrimination of four regional population clusters using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). It appears that S. isoetiformis and S. teres are a progenitor-derivative species pair.																	0002-9122					AUG	2000	87	8					1147	1158		10.2307/2656651							WOS:000088837800009	10947999					
J	Greene, DF; Johnson, EA				Greene, DF; Johnson, EA			Tree recruitment from burn edges	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												We developed and tested a wind-dispersal model of tree recruitment into burns from living sources at the fire edge or from small unburned residual stands. The model was also tested on recruitment of serotinous Pinus banksiana Lamb. within a burn. The model assumed that source strength is proportional to basal area density and that an individual (point source) recruitment curve can be expressed as a lognormal distribution. The model made significant predictions of the recruitment curves of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) to distances as great as 2.0 km, although it tended to underpredict Abies and overpredict Picea. The model gave significant prediction of recruitment for jack pine (Pinus banksiana) within burns with seeds derived from aerial seed banks, and of white spruce and tamarck (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) up to 100 m from residual stands. By forestry standards, burns are poorly stocked by those species that must obligately recruit from edges. In large fires, adequate stocking by a species such as white spruce that had 5 m(2)/ha of basal area would be limited to about 70 m from the edge. Small residual stands are expected to supply about half of all the recruits of white spruce or fir at distances exceeding about 800 m from a nominal burn edge.																	0045-5067					AUG	2000	30	8					1264	1274		10.1139/cjfr-30-8-1264							WOS:000089017000009						
J	Guo, QF; Brown, JH; Valone, TJ; Kachman, SD				Guo, QF; Brown, JH; Valone, TJ; Kachman, SD			Constraints of seed size on plant distribution and abundance	ECOLOGY												We examined the correlation between seed size (mass) and spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of plants, using both published data from northern England and 18 years of census data from permanent quadrats in the Chihuahuan Desert, Arizona, USA. In both systems, there were many small-seeded species and few large-seeded ones. Spatial patterns of distribution and abundance were constrained by seed size within triangle envelopes, i.e., small-seeded species had a greater range of abundance and a greater number of sites occupied than did large-seeded species. Temporal patterns of abundance and distribution from the Chihuahuan Desert site were similarly correlated with seed size, i.e., small-seeded species were, in general more abundant and present in more than were large-seeded species. These patterns probably result because small-seeded species produce more seeds. are more vagile, and persist longer in seed banks than do large-seeded species. The results are consistent with recent findings from seed bank studies, suggesting the generality of the correlation between seed size and plant abundance and distribution.

The lateral displacement of the earth during mouldboard ploughing contributes to the dispersal of the weeds inside the tilled field. In order to model vertical and lateral seed displacements during ploughing, an existing model describing soil particle movements for different ploughing characteristics (depth and width) and soil structures was tested on a multilocal field trial. The trials were carried out in 1996 and 1997 and comprised two soil textures and three soil structures; tillage was performed with a mouldboard plough at varying ploughing widths and depths. Seeds were simulated by beads that were introduced immediately before ploughing with an auger at different depths and lateral positions (relative to the future passage of the coulter) within and just below the ploughed horizon. Lateral displacement and the final vertical position of the heads were measured and compared to the simulations obtained with the model. The model correctly simulated the final vertical seed co-ordinate and lateral seed displacement as a function of soil structure, ploughing width and depth and initial seed position, if ploughing depth is lower than ploughing width. If, however, the former exceeds the latter and/or if the furrows are not properly rotated, the model does not simulate the seed movements correctly. The model was then used to calculate seed transfer matrices describing vertical seed movements between seed bank layers for different conditions and plough modes and to determine the optimal ploughing mode for a given seed bank distribution. For instance, if most seeds are located in the top layer ploughing should be as deep as possible, with a low depth to width ratio to maximise soil inversion and seed burial. If, however, the seeds are concentrated in the bottom layer, the model can be used to decide how shallowly to plough in order to avoid disturbing the deeper seeds and what ploughing width to associate to this depth in order to minimise soil inversion and leave as many seeds as possible undisturbed. Ways of improving the model are suggested, particularly the necessity to simulate the effect of a skim coulter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Each sequence represented a 25-year hayfield succession following cessation of fertilizer application in the Drentse A Nature Reserve (NL). where the vegetation has been studied since 1972. 2 The number of seeds of many late successional species showed a significant increase during succession with only two characteristic late species present in the seed bank of the early stage of each series. Most of the early successional species showed a decrease in the number of seeds, which paralleled their relative frequency within the vegetation. Overall, seed density and species diversity of the seed bank was higher in the wet than the dry chronosequence. 3 Mean values for seed longevity were calculated for each successional phase in each series using a published seed bank data base, When based simply on the presence of species, the seed longevity index decreased significantly during the wet-series succession in both surface and deeper seed banks and in the vegetation. When based on the relative frequency of species present, the index decreased significantly in both series but only in the surface seed bank and the vegetation. 4 Comparison with data for an ancient undisturbed wet hay meadow in England suggests that seed longevity of hayfield species is generally low. Similarity between seed bank and established vegetation was low in both the undisturbed British meadow (only 47%) and in the relatively young Dutch study sites (c. 50%). 5 The soil seed bank is unlikely to determine hayfield succession in the Drentse A Nature Reserve, since the composition of the soil seed bank tended to follow that of the above-ground vegetation. Increases in plant species richness following the cessation of fertilizer application, the main goal of restoration management, therefore depend to a large extent on an influx of the seeds of most species from outside the site.																	0022-0477					AUG	2000	88	4					594	607		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00485.x							WOS:000088941200005

We simulated two of the effects of fire on the germinable soil seed bank in four pine stands on Mt. Carmel, Israel, that differed in their postfire ages. Soil samples were heated to 100 degrees C, or covered by pine ash. Vermiculite was used to simulate litter cover. 2 Heat exposure increased overall seedling density, richness and taxon diversity in all stands, but density of annual taxa (e.g. grasses and legumes) were not clearly affected. 3 Ash cover dramatically decreased germination of all taxa and highest germination was achieved with heating and no cover. Vermiculite cover resulted in intermediate germination levels. 4 The combined effect of heat exposure and ash cover, simulating a post-fire situation under a canopy of pine, reduced the germination level of all taxa in the soil seed bank. However, it also creates conditions that facilitate the establishment of pine seedlings from the canopy stored seed bank.

This is especially the case in Andean countries, where ex situ conservation of crops has been a focus of attention since the 1970s. In Peru in the early 1990s, researchers and development specialists also focused on in situ conservation and the participation of campesino communities in mountain development processes. They designed the Cajamarca model as a result of several years of experience in rural development projects. This model includes so-called seed fairs (Figure 1) and encourages the creation of local seed banks managed by a conservationist campesino association. The HimalAndes Project, which promotes technical cooperation to support exchange of seeds and local knowledge between mountain agriculture ecosystems, is another recent project with a partial focus on agrobiodiversity conservation in Andean and other countries.																	0276-4741	1994-7151				AUG	2000	20	3					220	225		10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0220:MAIP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000089361200005

We examined the relationship between vegetation and seed bank composition, and tested 3 hypotheses predicting decrease in seed bank richness, decrease In seed bank abundance, and divergence of seed bank species composition from vegetation composition during succession. Grazing changed species abundance and the vertical structure of the vegetation but did not cause loss of species. Most of the taxa in the seed bank occurred in the vegetation. Seed bank richness, diversity, and abundance decreased significantly during grassland succession following cessation of grazing. Although in general the most abundant species in the vegetation at each site were also dominant in the respective seed bank, seed bank and vegetation composition differed greatly after cessation of grazing. The seed bank at sites undisturbed over the long term does not appear to be an important source of seedling recruitment after disturbance in these grasslands.																	0276-4741					AUG	2000	20	3					254	261		10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0254:SSBOAS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000089361200010						
J	Tracy, BF; Sanderson, MA				Tracy, BF; Sanderson, MA			Patterns of plant species richness in pasture lands of the northeast United States	PLANT ECOLOGY												Pasture lands are an important facet of land use in the northeast United States, yet little is known about their recent diversity. To answer some fundamental questions about the diversity of these pasture lands, we designed a broad survey to document plant species richness using an intensive, multi scale sampling method. We also wanted to learn whether environmental (soils or climate) or land management variables could help explain patterns of species richness. A total of 17 farms, encompassing 37 pastures, were sampled in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts and Connecticut during July and August 1998. We positively identified a total of 161 different plant species across the study region. Species richness averaged 31.7 +/-1.1 on pastures. Infrequent, transient species that were mostly perennial and annual forbs accounted for similar to 90% of the species richness. Except for a subjective rating of grazing intensity, land management methods were not good predictors of species richness. Over time, it appears that grazing neither reduces nor increases species richness in pastures. Of the environmental variables measured, only soil P explained a significant amount of the variation in species richness. Soil P was inversely related to species richness at the 1m(2) scale. Percent SOM was positively associated with species richness at this scale, although weakly. At larger spatial scales, we suggest that patterns of species richness are best explained by the species diversity of soil seed banks, or seed rain, and stochastic recruitment of these species into existing vegetation.																	1385-0237					AUG	2000	149	2					169	180		10.1023/A:1026536223478							WOS:000165790400005

Seeds of different ages, stored at the seed bank of CENARGEN/EMBRAPA were either inoculated on culture medium or used as a source of embryo axis and cotyledon explants. Whole seeds failed to germinate on MS either without growth regulators (MS0) or supplemented with 10 mu M TDZ. Embryo axes cultured on MS0 produced only single plants. In the presence of 8.8 mu M BAP these explants showed multi-shoot formation. Cotyledons cultured on MS supplemented with 110 mu M BAP developed adventitious shoots through direct organogenesis. Plant regeneration was obtained from A. villosulicarpa, A. macedoi, A. retusa, A. burchellii and A. pietrarellii both from embryo axes and cotyledons. Explants from A. prostrata and A. aff. prostrata did not produce regenerants. Rooting of shoots was induced in the presence of 5.4 mu M NAA.

The aims of the study were (1) to detect soil parameters that best explain changes observed in plant species richness and abundance and (2) to determine if pollution-derived stresses have also affected regeneration capabilities of plant communities from the soil seed bank. The grassland was quantitatively analysed in terms of physicochemical soil characteristics, plant species diversity and abundance, and soil seed bank species composition and abundance. Results showed that a decrease in total soil nitrogen explained 13% of the changes detected in plant abundance while soil pH and 0.05 M EDTA extractable copper explained 10% and 7%, respectively, of the vegetation change. It was also found that the pollution has already affected plant species regeneration capabilities from the soil seed bank and the microsite distribution of the seeds in soils.

J	Benech-Arnold, RL; Sanchez, RA; Forcella, F; Kruk, BC; Ghersa, CM				Benech-Arnold, RL; Sanchez, RA; Forcella, F; Kruk, BC; Ghersa, CM			Environmental control of dormancy in weed seed banks in soil	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Dormancy is a common attribute of many weed seed populations and this usually hampers the task of predicting timing and extent of emergence of weeds. Both the number of established plants and the timing of emergence of a weed are strongly related to the dynamics of dormancy release of the seed population. In this paper, we discuss the different factors that affect dormancy in weed seed banks in soil, aiming to set a conceptual basis that will facilitate the construction of predictive models. From the long list of factors that are known to control dormancy under held conditions, we distinguish those that modify the dormancy level of the population (i.e. soil temperature and soil hydric conditions) from those that terminate dormancy or in other words, remove the ultimate constraints for seed germination once the degree of dormancy is Sufficiently low (i.e, light, fluctuating temperatures, nitrate concentration). We also discuss the effect of agricultural practices on dormancy of weed seed populations, making reference to studies that have evinced clearly the factor(s) involved in determining a particular pattern of response. Overall, we stress the importance of clarifying, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the interaction between soil thermal and hydric conditions in the modification of the degree of dormancy of seed populations, Similarly, it is essential that we understand the extent to which such changes in dormancy comprise changes in sensitivity to factors that terminate dormancy.

J	Bowers, JE				Bowers, JE			Does Ferocactus wislizeni (Cactaceae) have a between-year seed bank?	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Field and laboratory experiments at Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.A., demonstrated that Ferocactus wislizeni, a common perennial cactus in the northern Sonoran Desert, has a between-year seed bank. In laboratory studies, F. wislizeni seeds lost dormancy during storage at room temperature and had a light requirement for germination. Field experiments suggested that as much as 2% of the annual seed crop might escape post-dispersal predation even when unprotected; where suitable safe sites exist, a higher percentage might escape. Germination of seed recovered monthly from above- and below-ground components of an artificial seed bank showed that seeds can survive at least 18 months in and on the soil. Seed banks enable F. wislizeni to take advantage of favorable rains and temperatures throughout the growing season, thus increasing the number of opportunities for germination. Moreover, seed banks enable F. wislizeni to respond hugely when the climate seems especially favorable, thus producing the large cohorts necessary to compensate for high seedling mortality.

The goals of this study were: (1) to quantify the size and composition of seed banks in areas of intact maritime chaparral and nearby abandoned roads; (2) to investigate whether a burning regime is necessary to induce germination of the species present in the seed bank; and (3) to compare the seed bank composition with the vegetation in maritime chaparral and abandoned roads. Soil samples for seed bank analysis were collected in October 1996 from seven paired areas of intact chaparral and abandoned roads near Monterey, California. Seed bank samples were subjected to a burn or a control (no burn) treatment, after which germination was monitored in a greenhouse for five months. In spring 1997, vegetation at each area was surveyed. Results of the seed bank study indicated that greater numbers of native plant species and native seeds germinated in intact chaparral compared to road areas, whereas numbers of exotic plant species and seeds germinating were similar in the two habitats. Burning reduced the number of native species and seeds that germinated, and to a lesser extent the number of exotic species and seeds that germinated from the seed bank. In the field survey, intact chaparral areas had greater numbers of native species and greater native cover than roads, whereas road areas had greater numbers and cover of exotic species. Several species were found only in field surveys; in particular, few chaparral shrub seeds germinated from the seed bank. Similarity between the seed bank and vegetation was low in both chaparral and road sites. The results suggest that although many native species of chaparral plants are present in the seed bank, planting of some species may help accelerate recovery in disturbed areas.

Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. ssp oleifera) is a "sensitive" crop since it con cross, more or less easily with wild relatives and can colonise natural or semi-natural habitats in the vicinity of the cultivated fields. The persistence of feral plants outside of fields is an important component of risk assessment and management since feral populations could be reservoir and/or corridors for generic pollution between GM and GM-free productions. At the scale of an agricultural landscape, we performed a study (collaborating with CETIOM and INRA) to determine spatial distribution and dynamics of feral populations. This study shows (i) that relict plants of now unmarketable cultivars persist at least 8 years after their last cultivation (likely in the seed-bank), (ii) that feral populations persist also by local recruitment and (iii) that the spatial distribution of feral populations is partially related with carrying traffic of harvests from fields towards the silo.																	1258-8210					JUL-AUG	2000	7	4					324	328		10.1051/ocl.2000.0324							WOS:000165794100006

However, few attempts have been made to influence the course of succession thereby testing the hypothesis that passing through one stage is essential before entering the next one. At each stage of succession ecosystem processes may be affected by the diversity of species present, but there is little empirical evidence showing that plant species diversity may affect succession. On ex-arable land, a major constraint of vegetation succession is the dominance of perennial early-successional (arable weed) species. Our aim was to change the initial vegetation succession by the direct sowing of later-successional plant species. The hypothesis was tested that a diverse plant species mixture would be more successful in weed suppression than species-poor mixtures. In order to provide a robust test including a wide range of environmental conditions and plant species, experiments were carried out at five sites across Europe. At each site, an identical experiment was set up, albeit that the plant species composition of the sown mixtures differed from site to site. Results of the 2-year study showed that diverse plant species mixtures were more effective at reducing the number of natural colonisers (mainly weeds from the seed bank) than the average low-diversity treatment. However, the effect of the low-diversity treatment depended on the composition of the species mixture. Thus, the effect of enhanced species diversity strongly depended on the species composition of the low-diversity treatments used for comparison. The effects of high-diversity plant species mixtures on weed suppression differed between sites. Low-productivity sites gave the weakest response to the diversity treatments. These differences among sites did not change the general pattern. The present results have implications for understanding biological invasions. It has been hypothesised that alien species are more likely to invade species-poor communities than communities with high diversity. However, our results show that the identity of the local species matters. This may explain, at least partly, controversial results of studies on the relation between local diversity and the probability of being invaded by aliens.

However, species without a persistent seed bank and with poor dispersal ability often do not re-establish spontaneously. Here, reintroduction is an option. If existing populations are comparable in their genetic composition, any population will do. This is not the case if populations have local adaptations. Unfortunately, whether populations are adapted locally is not easily determined, in contrast to assessing differentiation using neutral genetic markers. We used AFLP to study genetic diversity of Cirsium dissectum and Succisa pratensis within and among several Junco-Molinion plant communities in the Netherlands (up to 200 km apart) that were potential source populations, and followed the reintroduction using seeds from these populations. Also, vegetative growth phase characteristics of three populations of C. dissectum were analyzed under controlled conditions. Most of the genetic variation in these cross-fertilizing species was found within populations. Small but significant genetic differences in band frequencies were found among populations (F-st 0.100-0.135). The first generation of reintroduced plants contained less polymorphic bands than the source populations. The genetic differences caused by reintroduction using a limited number of seeds (founder effects) were significant in all except one case (F-st 0.012-0.101 between source and corresponding reintroduced population), but the magnitude was smaller than the source population differentiation. In assignment tests, reintroduced populations resembled their source population more than any other population, but all populations contained sizeable proportions of plants that were assigned to most similar plants from other populations, indicating that the populations are only marginally distinct. Calculations show that reintroduction from more than one source population introduces significantly more polymorphic bands into the new population, capitalizing on the existence of band frequency differences among populations.

The horizontal (between microsites) and vertical (with depth in litter and soil) distribution of soil seed banks of the microphyllous woody species, Acacia tortilis, A. nilotica and Dichrostachys cinerea (all legumes of the Mimosoideae), were quantified in an area with low intensity grazing (reserve), and a bordering cattle farm with high intensity grazing (farm). Species differed in seed bank densities between microsites and sites. Seed densities for all species were highest below parent tree canopies and decreased with distance beyond the canopy, and with soil depth. D. cinerea had the smallest seed bank associated with parent trees, particularly on the farm (8 vs. 1643 seeds/tree on the reserve), A. tortilis had the largest (6357, 31910), with A. nilotica intermediate (1789, 1906). The proportion of current (recently fallen) versus old (greater than or equal to 1 year old) seeds differed between species and sites. These species form at least short-term persistent seed banks with the old seeds largely representing the persistent seed bank. Seed densities in the open (inter-canopy) and those dispersed under either of the other two (non-parental) study species were much lower than those associated with parent trees. The latter were mostly found under the acacias (single-stemmed) rather than D. cinerea (multistemmed). Total seed store per parent plant increased with plant size (best fits were mostly power curves of canopy area). A large proportion of intact seeds were viable, namely 81-84% for A. tortilis, 68-77% for A. nilotica and 63-78% for D. cinerea, with no differences between sites. Viability tended to increase with depth of burial, except for A. nilotica seeds at the 3-5 cm depths on the farm. At the landscape scale there were 1.5 million and 140 000 A. tortilis seeds/ha on the reserve and farm respectively, with corresponding values of 2000 and 31 000 for D. cinerea, and 23 000 and 86 000 for A. nilotica.

J	Lacko-Bartosova, M; Minar, M; Vranovska, Z; Strasser, D				Lacko-Bartosova, M; Minar, M; Vranovska, Z; Strasser, D			Weed seed bank in ecological and integrated farming system	ROSTLINNA VYROBA												Surface and subsurface weed seedbank in soil is a suitable indicator of weed flora on different cultivating system. Knowledge about weed seedbank gives us an evidence about soil cultivation in the past and at the same time it helps us to set prognosis For the future. The objectives of this study were to find out the influence of an integrated and ecological farming system as well as agrotechnical measures on weed seedbank size in soil and its species composition over the longer period. Field experiments of integrated and ecological arable systems were established at the Slovak Agricultural University Research Station near Nitra on brown clay-loamy soil in the fall of 1990. Crop rotations are shown in Tab. I. In both systems two variants of soil cultivations are examined: Conventional with ploughing to the depth of 0.24 m and minimum with shallow cultivation to the depth of 0.12 to 0.15 m. Manure is embeded by middle ploughing. Weed seedbank was determined in the years 1990, 1996, 1998 in the depths of 0.00 to 0.05 m and 0.20 to 0.25 m in seven replications according to the methodology of Hron, Kohout (1974). Weed seedbank in integrated system significantly rose up in 1996. In comparison with the year 1990 it was 2.5 times. The whole seedstock in both depths of soil reached the highest rate, 24 356 weeds per 1 m(2) in 1996. The difference between the years 1996 and 1998 was not significant (Tabs. II, III). The soil cultivation did not have a significant influence on changes of weed seedbank. Amaranthus retroflexus dominantly represented all 22 of the determined weed species. Its ratio from the whole weed seedstock was 80.6% in 1990. In 1996 its ratio rose to 87.7% and in 1998 Amaranth reached 94.7%. After eight years of the realisation of the system the soil cultivation did not have any significant influence on dominance of Amaranthus retroflexus. There was no significant influence at integrated system on changes of the number of weed species. The most frequent species were beside the above-mentioned ones: Chenopodium album, Chenopodium polyspermum, Tripleurospermum inodorum and Persicaria maculata. Some weed species did not occur any more, the other new species were imported. Development of a weed seedbank in ecological system has similar tendencies (Tab. IV). In the average the whole weed seedstock per 1 m(2) was significantly higher in 1996 according to the statistical analysis, in comparison with the year 1990. Soil cultivation had a significant influence on weed seedstock. More intensive soil weed infestation was detected under shallow (minimum) cultivation. In this case, during the last two years, total number of viable weed seeds per 1 ml was 8.4 times higher as compared with the year 1990 (41 014 weed seeds per 1 m(2)). There were no significant differences between the systems when using conventional cultivation. Average weed density under conventional cultivation was 24 768 weeds per 1 m(2) in ecological system and was higher by 21.6% than was the case in the integrated system. Often detected tendencies of weed seed accumulation in surface layers under minimum and reduced soil cultivation systems were not confirmed. It might be caused by incorporation of farm yard manure and perennial crop residues into the soil by middle ploughing within eight years rotation also in the system with the minimum soil cultivation. This causes an even distribution of weed seeds to the above mentioned depths. During evaluated years, 21 weed species were detected in the ecological system. Dominant weed species was Amaranthus retroflexus with the share of 67.4% in 1990. After six and eight year period its share was 96.4% and 95.1%. The tillage system did not influence the dominance of the mentioned species. Changes in weed species composition are similar as in the integrated system. They are shown in Tab. IV. On the basis of determined development of the weed seedbank, we can recommend conventional soil cultivation for ecological farming system.																	0370-663X					JUL	2000	46	7					319	324									WOS:000088856600005						
J	Mengistu, LW; Mueller-Warrant, GW; Barker, RE				Mengistu, LW; Mueller-Warrant, GW; Barker, RE			Genetic diversity of Poa annua in western Oregon grass seed crops	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												genetic diversity of Poa annua L. populations collected from western Oregon grass-seed fields was surveyed using 18 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Markers from 1357 individual plants from 47 populations collected at three sampling dates (fall, winter, and spring) for 16 sites were used to measure genetic diversity within and among populations. Site histories varied from low to high herbicide selection pressure, and some sites were subdivided by 3 years of differing post-harvest residue management. Gene diversity statistics, simple frequency of haplotype occurrence, and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed the presence of significant variability in P. annua among sites, among collection dates within sites, and within collection dates. Nei gene-diversity statistics and population-differenriation parameters indicated that P. annua populations were highly diverse. Mean Nei gene diversity (h) for all 47 populations was 0.241 and total diversity (HT) was 0.245. A greater proportion of this diversity, however, was within (H-S=0.209) rather than among (G(sr)=0.146) populations. When populations were grouped by season of collection, within-group diversity was H-S=0.241, while among-group diversity was G(sr)=0.017. When populations were grouped by site, within-group diversity was Hs=0.224, while among-group diversity was G(sr)=0.087. The diversity among populations within season for fall, winter, and spring collections was G(sr)=0.121, 0.142, and 0.133, respectively. Populations collected from fields with histories of high herbicide selection pressure showed low differentiation among collection dates, with G(sr) as low as 0.016, whereas those collected from fields with low herbicide selection pressure showed greater differentiation among collection dates, with GS, as high as 0.125. At high selection-pressure sites, populations were also lower in gene diversity las low as h=0.155), while at low selection-pressure sites there was higher gene diversity las high as h=0.286). The site to site variability was greater For the high selection-pressure sites (G(sr)=0.107 or 69% of the total among-population variance), while the season of germination variability was greater at sites of low herbicide-selection pressure (G(sr)=0.067, or 70% of the total among-population variance). High initial diversity coupled with a long-term re-supply of genotypes from the seed bank must have been factors in maintaining the genetic diversity of this weed despite the intensive use of herbicides. Knowledge of the genetic diversity of Willamette Valley P. annua should help in formulating more effective strategies for managing this weed.																	0040-5752					JUL	2000	101	1-2					70	79		10.1007/s001220051451							WOS:000088403800011						
J	Guardia, R; Gallart, F; Ninot, JM				Guardia, R; Gallart, F; Ninot, JM			Soil seed bank and seedling dynamics in badlands of the Upper Llobregat basin (Pyrenees)	CATENA					Workshop on Badlands Processes and Significance in Changing Environments	1997	FLORENCE, ITALY					In the badlands of the Upper Llobregat basin, vegetation is sparse and heterogeneous. The harsh conditions generated with the formation of the badlands involve a regressive succession. On the upper part of the slope, a sharp change can be seen between dense communities and denuded badland slopes. Nevertheless. recolonization of thc badlands rarely occurs. Scarce seed availability or low capacity of seeds to germinate in such unfavorable conditions may be the main causes. The soil seed bank was sampled in two micro-catchments; a total of 105 soil cores were extracted along three parallel transects. Soil samples were washed through a set of sieves, and seeds were separated and identified, Seedling emergence and mortality were also recorded monthly from April 1990 to December 1991, on two permanent plots in a nearby micro-catchment. An unexpected soil seed bank was found. A relatively high species number has been found with rather small and slightly heterometric seeds. Strong relation between seed bank composition and established vegetation has been detected. Seedling emergence occurred mainly from May to August. The species composition was also dominated by the most frequent species in the badlands and in the soil seed bank. Seedling mortality does not appear to be directly associated with the erosive processes, as it occurred throughout the year. It seems that seedling survival rates could be sufficient to ensure persistence of the current vegetation in badland areas. We conclude that there is no single reason that can explain the low vegetation cover in badlands but rather there is a combination of several restrictive factors. Lack of seed availability within the reduced favorable period for germination and low seedling establishment contribute in part to this low colonization. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Woldu, Z; Saleem, MAM				Woldu, Z; Saleem, MAM			Grazing induced biodiversity in the highland ecozone of East Africa	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The species composition of grazing lands can be influenced by livestock and grazing pressure. A study on manure seed bank was conducted in Ghinchi highland Research Site in Ethiopia between 1995 and 1997. The data on species composition and life-form of the plants germinating in pots receiving air dried manure were compared with species composition of experimental plots in natural grassland subjected to varying grazing intensity. There was significant difference among the species composition of grazed and non-grazed grasslands and the manure seed bank (p = 0.01). The life-forms of the species also showed variation. There were more families and species in the natural grassland vegetation than indicated in the manure seed bank. The manure seed bank had more annuals than the natural grassland vegetation. The species composition and life-forms in the manure seed bank showed variation with time and this corresponded with the seasonal Variation in the grassland, which had a direct relationship with the rainfall pattern. The study showed that livestock play a major role in maintaining the biodiversity of grassland vegetation by spatial and temporal dispersion of readily germinating seeds in their manure. The use of manure to improve soil fertility should be weighed cautiously against the introduction of weeds into crop fields, although weeds are important feed resource for livestock in land-constrained areas. There is therefore the need for developing manure management practices so that the benefits can be optimised and the undesirable effects can be minimised. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kwit, C; Platt, WJ; Slater, HH				Kwit, C; Platt, WJ; Slater, HH			Post-hurricane regeneration of pioneer plant species in south Florida subtropical hardwood hammocks	BIOTROPICA												After Hurricane Andrew crossed southern Florida (U.S.A.) on 24 August 1932, native and exotic pioneer species in subtropical hardwood forests (hammocks) regenerated from seed banks. Regeneration occurred in hammocks of metropolitan Dade County and the Long Pine Key region of Everglades National park. The density of the native pioneer Trema micrantha was significantly higher in hammocks of Long Pine Key than in those of metropolitan Dade County. In contrast, the basal area of the exotic pioneer Carica papaya was greater in Dade County hammocks than Long Pine Key hammocks. Although T. micrantha tended to be restricted to areas of soil disturbance (tip-up pits) formed by trees uprooted during Hurricane Andrew, especially in Long Pine Key, C. papaya was located throughout hammocks. These results suggest differences in the regeneration niches in which the native T. micrantha required more specific disruptions (i.e., both canopy and soil) than C. papaya (only removal of canopy) for establishment. A broad regeneration niche could in part account for the capability of an exotic species with a dormant seed bank to invade native subtropical forests following natural large-scale disturbances.																	0006-3606					JUN	2000	32	2					244	251		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2000.tb00467.x							WOS:000087812600006						
J	Molau, U; Larsson, EL				Molau, U; Larsson, EL			Seed rain and seed bank along an alpine altitudinal gradient in Swedish Lapland	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												We studied the seed flux, including seed rain and seed bank (germinable and total), at twelve sites along an altitudinal gradient in the Abisko area in northernmost Swedish Lapland during a period of 3 years with contrasting summer climates. The study sites were evenly spaced in altitude from the timberline at 700 m above sea level to the highest peaks in the area (1560 m). A subalpine birch forest site was included for comparison. Each site was equipped with seed traps, replaced and emptied directly upon snow-melt each summer. Soil samples for seed bank assessment were taken at all sites, and inventories of the vascular plant flora were carried out in the 10 m radius neighborhood of the traps. The results revealed high variation among years with regard to seed rain and its partitioning over various functional types of plants. Even though most of the seed rain could be attributed to species present in the plant community of the trap sites themselves, some more long-distance dispersal takes place every year. A number of extrazonal recoveries are reported, often several hundred m above the distributional limit of the species. Even though seed number and species diversity declined rapidly from seed rain over total seed bank to germinable seed bank, the correlation among all three aspects of the seed pool was high. The dominant species in the seed flux at moderate altitudes, Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup, has a persistent seed bank with an average turnover of more than 200 years.																	0008-4026					JUN	2000	78	6					728	747		10.1139/b00-049							WOS:000088272000004						
J	Leishman, MR; Masters, GJ; Clarke, IP; Brown, VK				Leishman, MR; Masters, GJ; Clarke, IP; Brown, VK			Seed bank dynamics: the role of fungal pathogens and climate change	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. One of the climate change scenarios predicted for the UK is warmer winters and additional summer rainfall, which may favour growth and survival of fungal pathogens. We tested several hypotheses on the fate of persistent seeds in the soil and the role of fungal pathogens under this predicted climate change. 2, We buried seed bags containing fungicide-treated and non-fungicide-treated seeds of four species with persistent seed banks (Convolvulus arvensis L., Lotus corniculatus L., Medicago lupulina L. and Rubus fruticosus L.) under control and simulated climate change (winter warming plus supplemented summer rain) conditions, and monitored seed survival over 1 to 2 years. 3. Fungicide treatment resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of intact seeds recovered for only two of the four species, M. lupulina and R. fruticosus. Seeds of M. lupulina that were treated with fungicide remained viable in the soil for longer than non-treated seeds. Thus, the effect of fungal pathogens on seed persistence in the soil appears to be species specific. 4. There was no significant effect of the simulated climate (winter warming plus supplemented summer rain) on seed persistence in the soil, for any of the four species. Neither was a significant climate x fungicide treatment interaction found for any of the four species. Thus, it does not appear that the conditions provided in the simulated climate plots favoured the growth and survival of fungal pathogens affecting the soil seed banks of the four species studied here. 5. The use of fungicides in manipulative experiments and the importance of field experiments that simulate predicted climate change are discussed.

J	Vila, M; Lloret, F				Vila, M; Lloret, F			Seed dynamics of the mast seeding tussock grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica in Mediterranean shrublands	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The Mediterranean perennial grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica may have the potential to expand its range. We analysed temporal variability of its reproductive components (seedfall, seed bank, seed predation, seed germination, seedling emergence, survival and growth) in three microsites (open areas, beneath Ampelodesmos and beneath shrubs) at two sites. 2 Reproductive components prior to seedling emergence were both closely linked and very similar between microsites within a site. Seedling survival and growth differed between microsites, being lowest in open areas. Recruitment patterns cannot therefore be predicted from seedfall. 3 Abundant seed production in 1996 was followed by successful germination and high seedling survival. In the following (non-masting) year, although Ampelodesmos has a low-density persistent seed bank, recruitment was much lower because germination was low and post-dispersal seed predation was high. 4 Our results suggest that Ampelodesmos reproduction is episodic. Expansion of its distribution may be triggered by intermittent seedling recruitment following masting, but is otherwise constrained by seed limitation, post-dispersal seed predation and a loss of viability in the seed bank.

J	Hyatt, LA; Casper, BB				Hyatt, LA; Casper, BB			Seed bank formation during early secondary succession in a temperate deciduous forest	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Seed banks are dynamic entities, with input occurring through dispersal and loss occurring through germination and various sources of mortality. Measures of abundance of seeds in the soil at one point in time cannot distinguish those seeds destined to germinate or die in the next growing season from those entering the long-term seed bank, and cannot therefore reveal the proportion of seeds that are carried over from year to year. 2 We studied seed bank dynamics in a 2.5-ha deciduous forest gap by following the fate of a single year's cohort of seeds over 2 years. Seed input for 1 year, subsequent in situ germination and survivorship were measured at 60 locations. We examined how temporal changes in seed bank composition were affected by the presence of the dominant gap colonizing species Rubus allegheniensis. 3 Over the course of 2 years, both mean seed density and its variance declined. The temporal changes in density were not, however, accompanied by detectable changes in diversity. 4 Three species (R. allegheniensis, Phytolacca americana and Paulownia tomentosa) dominated the seed bank. Seed bank accumulation patterns in Rubus and Phytolacca showed contrasting responses to the presence of Rubus, with Phytolacca excluded from seed banks in such patches through reduced input and increased mortality. 5 First year germination and post-dispersal mortality interact with seed input to influence the spatial distribution of density and diversity in the long-term seed bank. Substantial long-term seed banks do form within temperate forest gaps and patterns of above-ground vegetation can have substantial effects on their dynamics.																	0022-0477					JUN	2000	88	3					516	527		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00465.x							WOS:000087232200013						
J	Burggraaf, VT; Thom, ER				Burggraaf, VT; Thom, ER			Contamination and persistence of endophyte-free ryegrass pastures established by spray-drilling, and intensively grazed by dairy cows in the Waikato region of New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The contamination of endophyte-free ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pastures with volunteer endophyte-infected ryegrass, and the persistence of endophyte-free ryegrass, were studied over three years at the Dairying Research Corporation, Hamilton, New Zealand. Plots were sprayed with glyphosate herbicide in mid March 1996 (sprayed: S), or mid March and again in mid April (double sprayed: D). A sub-plot treatment allowed the effects of the presence or absence of white clover (Trifolium repens) to be studied. All plots were direct-drilled with endophyte-free perennial ryegrass in late April 1996, and were subsequently rotationally grazed by dairy cows. Sources of contamination were endophyte-infected ryegrass seed from reseeding of existing ryegrass, seed consumed by cows and deposited in dung, and seed buried in the soil, with endophyte infection levels after germination of 66, 38, and 75%, respectively. incomplete kill of existing endophyte-infected ryegrass after herbicide applications was another possible source of contamination with a 50% endophyte infection level. Contamination of D plots was consistently less than in S, averaging 25 and 58%, respectively, after three years, but was <10% of plants in D plots over the first two years. Reseeding of existing endophyte-infected ryegrass was considered the most important source of contamination and the soil seedbank the least. Double spraying reduced competition for establishing endophyte-free ryegrass, which consistently improved ryegrass survival compared with S, reflecting a higher pasture ryegrass content for 12 months, but no improvement in herbage accumulation. White clover level did not influence contamination. The trial showed that an endophyte-free ryegrass pasture could be maintained for at least 3 years showing similar trends in yield and persistence as high-endophyte based ryegrass pastures previously monitored at the site.																	0028-8233					JUN	2000	43	2					163	173		10.1080/00288233.2000.9513418							WOS:000088920100002						
J	Rokich, DP; Dixon, KW; Sivasithamparam, K; Meney, KA				Rokich, DP; Dixon, KW; Sivasithamparam, K; Meney, KA			Topsoil handling and storage effects on woodland restoration in Western Australia	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												An analysis of the effects of topsoil handling and storage methods was undertaken to optimize the potential rehabilitation of southwest Western Australian Banksia woodland species present before site disturbance. An increase in the depth of topsoil stripped from the Banksia woodland, from 10 to 30 cm, correlated to decreasing seedling recruitment from the soil seedbank by a factor of three following in situ respreading in an area to be restored. There was no significant difference in total seedling recruitment in situ at two depths of spread, 10 cm and 30 cm. These results concur with an ex situ trial on the effects of depth of seed burial on seedling recruitment that showed most species failed to emerge from depths greater than 2 cm. In situ stockpiling of the woodland topsoil for 1 or 3 years demonstrated a substantial and significant decline in seedling recruitment to 54% and 34% of the recruitment achieved in fresh topsoil, respectively. Stripping and spreading during winter substantially depressed seedling recruitment, compared with autumn operations, as did in situ stockpiling followed by spreading in the wet season, or stockpiling in winter followed by spreading in spring. No loss in total seedling recruitment occurred when replaced topsoil and subsoil were ripped to 80 cm following spreading of topsoil in sites to be restored. Conclusions from this study are that (1) topsoil provides a useful source of seeds for rehabilitation of Banksia woodland communities in the southwest of Western Australia, (2) correct handling of the topsoil, stripped and replaced fresh and dry (autumn direct return) to the maximum depths of 10 cm, can be used to optimize revegetation of species-rich plant communities with this type of seedbank, and (3) ripping of topsoil and subsoil to ease compaction of newly restored soils does not diminish the recruitment potential of the soil seedbank in the replaced topsoil.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; 												1061-2971					JUN	2000	8	2					196	208		10.1046/j.1526-100x.2000.80027.x							WOS:000087363200012

Our objective was to create a large-volume soil coring device that could be applied with consistency to a variety of wetland substrates. The result is a hand-operated soil corer that resembles the aluminum irrigation pipe corer that DeLaune et al. (1978) used to core soft marshy substrates. Instead of aluminum pipe, we used regular steel stovepipe and a variety of tools for insertion. After the sample is extracted from the sediment, the handle can be quickly removed for ease of transportation and storage of a core. The stovepipe can be cut open to expose the soil sample so that it can easily be sectioned for incremental analysis. The corer was used to take 130 samples in 18 different sites, spanning many different wetland substrate types. Our method has many applications, including radiochronologic dating, seed bank analysis, bulk density measurement, and soil contaminants analysis.																	0277-5212					JUN	2000	20	2					422	426		10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020[0422:AMFCIF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000087748100018						
J	Elias, M; McKey, D				Elias, M; McKey, D			The unmanaged reproductive ecology of domesticated plants in traditional agroecosystems: An example involving cassava and a call for data	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Although cassava is a strictly vegetatively propagated crop, in many traditional Amazonian agroecosystems, Amerindian farmers recognise volunteer seedlings of cassava and allow them to grow. If their properties are deemed desirable, plants originating from seedlings are included in the harvest of tuberous roots, and their stems are used to prepare cuttings for propagation. Incorporation of these products of spontaneous sexual reproduction appears to be important in origin and maintenance of genetic diversity in this clonally propagated plant. Our observations conducted in an Amerindian village in Guyana suggest that volunteer seedlings arise from a bank of viable seeds stored in soil, and that dispersal and burial of seeds by ants may be important in its constitution. Future investigations of the dynamics of genetic diversity in this crop in traditional agroecosystems must consider the role of the 'wild' sexual reproduction that occurs in parallel with vegetative propagation. We suggest that unmanaged processes of sexual reproduction play important but neglected roles in the evolutionary ecology of many domesticated plants in traditional agroecosystems.

Although the biological richness in this valley is well know, few studies have been made of the effects of different traditional management regimes on the floristic soil seed bank composition of these grasslands. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of traditional management regimes on the floristic composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank determining which species groups are most represented in each case to increase scientific information about these communities that every day are more scarce in Western Europe because of intensive management (generally due to fertiliser application to increase production) and abandonment of the traditional methods of management with a profound modification of the agrarian structure. An indirect germination method was used to study the seed bank. Soil samples were put into a germination chamber. 119 species of the vegetation and 104 of the seed bank were identified, 54 species being common to both. Results were analysed using Correspondence Analysis (CA), samples and species on the above-ground flora being ordered in the first two axes in well-defined groups: limestone and siliceous pastures, formerly-cultivated land and hay meadow, In the case of the below-ground seed bank, the manure used as fertiliser in some communities affected principally the concentration of therophytes in the soil and defined the different groups. Sampling time, management and differences between the persistence of seeds of different species in the soil seed bank were responsible for the large differences between the composition of the vegetation and seed bank, Ruderal species, species with persistent seeds and therophytes, which were better represented in the seed bank were responsible for the low correlation between seed bank and vegetation established.

J	Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Menges, ES				Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Menges, ES			Competitive abilities of three narrowly endemic plant species in experimental neighborhoods along a fire gradient	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We conducted field experiments manipulating lichens, shrubs, and herbs along a time-since-fire gradient and assessing effects on three endemic herbaceous species of Florida scrub: Eryngium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, and Polygonella basiramia. Responses included seed germination, survival, biomass, and fecundity. Transplants into recently burned patches generally had higher survival, larger biomass, and greater reproductive output than transplants into long-unburned patches. Open areas and sites near oaks frequently were more favorable than sites near Florida rosemary. Ground lichens did not affect germination but increased mortality rate of seedlings. Neighboring small shrubby and herbaceous species did not affect the performance of these species. Of the three species, naturally occurring E. cuneifolium were farthest from large shrubs, and their microhabitats had the least ground lichens and shrubs. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are capable of forming persistent seed banks and their recruitment after fire depends mostly on these dormant seeds. Polygonella basiramia relies on seed dispersal and immediate seed germination to colonize recently burned patches. Management for these species should involve variable fire regimes to allow all three species to persist along with many other scrub endemics.

J	Hald, AB; Vinther, E				Hald, A. B.; Vinther, E.			Restoration of a species-rich fen-meadow after abandonment: response of 64 plant species to management	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Eleven years of abandonment of a species-rich fen-meadow under undisturbed environmental conditions resulted in transformation into areas with tall herb-, sedge- and rush-dominated communities and areas with Alnus thicket. Species cover was measured in permanent plots in both community types and succession was monitored during 14 yr of restoration following reintroduction of management. The annual increase in accumulated species number followed a log-log-time linear regression during 10 yr of grazing management. The expected number of years taken before this annual rate was equal to annual extinction, i.e. a stable situation according to species density, was up to six. The response of 64 species to management was evaluated through paired statistical tests of changes in cover and frequency over time. In total, 55 species could each be allocated to one unique response model (monotone or non-monotone, concave models) independently of the importance value used (cover or frequency) and type of management (grazing following felling or mowing and mowing without grazing). Species which increased in response to grazing had the most persistent seed banks and CR-strategies, while species decreasing in response to grazing had less persistent seed banks and CS-strategies. Some of the species which increased due to grazing followed a model with a local maximum in cover and frequency. The results are discussed in relation to management of species with high cover value during restoration succession.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				MAY	2000	3	1					15	24		10.2307/1478914							WOS:000208472200003						
J	Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M				Bossuyt, Beatrijs; Hermy, Martin			Restoration of the understorey layer of recent forest bordering ancient forest	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Recently established forests are commonly characterized by an impoverished understorey. Restoration is mostly based on spontaneous secondary succession, but little is known about the time period needed to achieve a community species pool with species composition equal to that of ancient forests. Vegetation in transects of 197 plots in 13 recent forest stands contiguous to the Meerdaalwoud ancient forest complex was surveyed. The recent forest stands ranged in age from 36 to 132 yr. The community species pool was described with an ecological, functional and phytosociological approach and based on groups derived from a CCA. Differences in community species pool between age classes of recent forest stands were analysed. During establishment of a new forest competitive species, forest edge species and species with high Ellenberg values for light and nitrogen and a more persistent seed bank will dominate the understorey. After 90 yr of succession the cover by these species decreases and reaches equal values to ancient forest after ca. 105 yr. A large number of forest species will be able to colonize the forest in less than 90 yr. Some typical forest species, however, have very low colonization rates and still have low cover in recent forest more than 105 yr old, so that complete restoration of the understorey requires a time period of over a century. Anthropogenic introduction of forest plant species may reduce the time required for ancient forest vegetation equality.

Hydrology of Dutch Cirsio-Molinietum meadows: Prospects for restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Fen meadows (Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum) are seriously threatened by desiccation, acidification and eutro-phication. In The Netherlands several projects were launched to restore damaged fen meadows. This review describes how successes and failures of these restoration projects depend on hydrological systems. Six hydrological systems have been distinguished, which all provide the site conditions required by this community. Nowadays, the best developed fen meadows are found in the higher Pleistocene landscape of The Netherlands, where they depend on base-rich groundwater discharging from local or large groundwater systems. Fen meadows of the lower Holocene landscape usually occur in man-made surface water systems. Almost all stands have been severely deteriorated. Restoration of fen meadows in the Pleistocene landscape is promising when the hydrology is only slightly disturbed or when hydrological measures are taken in combination with sod cutting. Restoration prospects of fen meadows in the Holocene landscape are low. Until now a complete regeneration of Cirsio-Molinietum meadows has not been realized. Restoration measures failed to restore high pH values in the top soil. It is hypothesized that viable seeds of many target species lack in the soil seed bank. In addition, the dispersal capacities of these species seem to be limited.				Grootjans/I-1638-2012													1402-2001					MAY	2000	3	1					51	64		10.2307/1478918							WOS:000208472200007						
J	Rosen, E; van der Maarel, E				Rosen, Ejvind; van der Maarel, Eddy			Restoration of alvar vegetation on Oland, Sweden	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Alvars in the Baltic region, particularly on the Swedish islands of Oland and Gotland and in western Estonia, are well-known for their plant species richness and extensive populations of rare species. Grasslands make up most of alvar vegetation. The extent of these grasslands decreases because of bush enchroachment which takes place in most alvars when traditional land use practice changes, notably when grazing is ceased. The main threat for the alvar grassland is formed by the rapid expansion of Juniperus communis and Potentilla fruticosa in dry and wet sites, respectively. Applied research has been carried out during several years in order to develop plans for the restoration of alvar grassland. Thus it was shown that species richness in areas with a mixture of grassland and shrubland decreases in relation to the increased cover by shrubs. In the case of Juniperus there is a distinct drop in species number as soon as the cover exceeds 75-80%, while the decrease is more gradual with increased cover of Potentilla. The seed banks under dense stands of these shrubs only contain ca. 20% of the species found in dry and wet alvar meadows. This was confirmed by clearing experiments. Long-term recordings have shown that establishment of juniper seedlings takes place mainly in half-open areas between already existing junipers. Intermediate-sized junipers expanded faster than old and big shrubs. Potentilla shrubs recover fast from cutting or burning. After 2-4 yr they have almost attained their former size. This recovery can be prevented when cattle grazing is introduced. In the framework of a local alvar restoration project on Oland, covering 7000 ha, grazing regimes are re-established, fences erected and large-scale clearings carried out. Recently established juniper shrubs are being cleared, intermediate sized junipers (30-50 yr old) are selectively removed while creating a mosaic landscape with high biological diversity. Older dense juniper stands are left alone or are only partly cleared. Potentilla stands in moist areas are cut to create moist meadows which are breeding grounds for waders, and to establish corridors between remaining open areas. Three items are discussed (1) the importance of the Stora Alvar area; (2) re-introduction of grazing and (3) re-introduction of species. The outstanding importance of the area regarding species richness and endemism should be recognized through a golden list to be used along with red and blue lists.																	1402-2001					MAY	2000	3	1					65	72		10.2307/1478919							WOS:000208472200008						
J	Owen, KM; Marrs, RH				Owen, K. M.; Marrs, R. H.			Acidifying arable soils for the restoration of acid grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Minsmere is a large nature reserve in East Anglia UK, owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Two blocks of land, which were farmed commercially until 1990, have been bought in an attempt to link existing patches of heathland and acid grassland, thus creating a larger area for conservation. This paper discusses methods for the creation of acid grasslands. Previous studies of the arable soils in these fields identified three constraints -a depauperate seed bank, a high pH and vigorous growth of ruderal species after the fields were abandoned. Accordingly, experiments were set up to test the effects of (1) adding seed of species typical of acid grasslands and (2) adding amendments (elemental sulphur, litter of Pteridium aquilinum and pine chippings) to acidify the soil. The results confirmed that ruderal growth was high on unamended plots, but this could be reduced by addition of acidic amendments. Where the cover of ruderals was reduced, the cover of the sown species increased. The sown species colonized adjacent unsown subplots naturally and this was most pronounced where the acidity had been reduced by treatment. The most effective treatment was 21 S/ha, which gave the optimal reduction in soil pH, controlled ruderal growth and provided a reasonable cover of the sown species. The addition of Pteridium litter or pine chippings gave good establishment of sown species, but control of the ruderals was less effective.

Soil cores were collected from three site types, heavily impacted, lightly impacted, and undisturbed, that differed in area of bare ground and depth of surface organic matter. We hypothesized that the density and composition of the seed bank would vary with depth of surface organic matter and distance from established vegetation. Seedling emergence was determined in the greenhouse. Seed density was significantly lower on disturbed sites, averaging 441 seeds/m(2) on heavily impacted sites, 1495 seeds/m(2) on lightly impacted sites, and 4188 seeds/m(2) on undisturbed sites. Seed density declined exponentially with distance from established vegetation and increased with depth of surface organic matter. The number of species present did not vary across site types, but 10 species that occurred on lightly impacted and undisturbed sites were not present on heavily impacted sites. We concluded that disturbance that causes removal of surface organic matter can affect natural revegetation by lowering the density of propagules and affecting the species represented in the seed bank.																	0008-4026					MAY	2000	78	5					577	582		10.1139/b00-031							WOS:000088167300002						
J	Farji-Brener, AG; Illes, AE				Farji-Brener, AG; Illes, AE			Do leaf-cutting ant nests make "bottom-up" gaps in neotropical rain forests?: a critical review of the evidence	ECOLOGY LETTERS												We discuss the role of leaf cutting ant nests (Atta sp.) on the formation of understory "bottom-up" gaps in tropical rain forests. We (i) describe the characteristics of Atta nests that qualify them as promoters of understory gaps; (ii) review the effects of Atta nests on the dynamics of systems other than tropical forests; and (iii) discuss the hypotheses that in neotropical rain forests Atta nests affect plant productivity, and also influence distribution and community composition of the flora. Finally, we discuss the importance of Atta nests in the dynamics of forests and compare their effects with the better-known effects of treefall gaps. Atta nests modify soil structure, soil nutrient content, light intensity at ground level, seed bank composition and understory structure. The presence of the nest and associated refuse also accelerates the soil nutrient cycles. The size, high frequency, turnover rate and duration of these nests could make them a good substrate for particular species of plants. In spite of their potential importance, little information exists on the effects of Atta nests on plant productivity and/or plant composition in neotropical rain forests.

J	Easterling, MR; Ellner, SP				Easterling, MR; Ellner, SP			Dormancy strategies in a random environment: Comparing structured and unstructured models	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Hatching strategies are studied in a model of population dynamics in a random environment. The strategies are the fraction of dormant eggs that hatch each year, A projection matrix with random elements describes the population dynamics. The model extends the density-independent model of Dan Cohen and the density-dependent model of Stephen Ellner by adding structure to the egg bank, such that a fraction of the dormant eggs are buried and unavailable for hatching each year. Differences between the structured and unstructured models are analysed by deriving a small variance approximation for the population's long-term growth rate and relating the growth rate to the egg bank structure and the environmental parameters. Tuljapurkar and Istock (1993) claimed that structured and unstructured models give very different predictions, especially when dormancy is high. We show that Tuljapurkar and Istock's conclusions are the result of the particular dormancy type in their model, in which the maximum duration of dormancy is 2 years, rather than the addition of population structure. Using parameters estimated from field and experimental studies of the freshwater copepod Diaptomus sanguineus in Bullhead Pond, RI, the density-dependent model correctly predicts that the population should maintain a long-term pool of diapausing eggs, whereas the density-independent model makes the incorrect prediction that all eggs should hatch at their first opportunity. If the per capita burial and emergence rates are low, as may be the case for many plant populations, the ESS optimal hatching strategy is nearly that of an unstructured model with the mortality of non-hatchers increased by the burial rate.																	1522-0613	1937-3791				MAY	2000	2	4					387	407									WOS:000087362300002						
J	Arevalo, JR; Fernandez-Palacios, JM				Arevalo, JR; Fernandez-Palacios, JM			Seed bank analysis of tree species in two stands of the Tenerife laurel forest (Canary Islands)	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We analyzed the germination from the seed bank for two laurel forest stands (Moquinal versus Aguirre) of Tenerife collected at two different seasons (summer versus winter). We incubated and monitored germination in greenhouse conditions for 1 year. A high variability in germination was found between trays. Germination was much higher in summer than in winter, especially from Moquinal seed bank. Shade tolerant species (Laurus azorica, Persea indica, Rhamnus glandulosa and Viburnum tinus) have a shorter germination delay than shade-intolerant species (Erica arborea, Erica scoparia and Myrica faya), which dominate the seed bank. The species composition of germinating seeds after one year did not reveal any differences between sites nor between, despite the high differences in number between seasons. We compared the species composition of germinating seeds to that of the canopy (expressed as basal area). The results indicate that the winter seed bank does not significantly differ from the canopy composition in the Aguirre stand. We interpret our results to imply that the Aguirre stand is of an earlier successional stage than the Moquinal stand, because of a higher species richness in the germinated tree seeds, and compositional similarities between the winter seed bank and the canopy (both characteristic of earlier successional stages).

J	Malo, JE; Jimenez, B; Suarez, F				Malo, JE; Jimenez, B; Suarez, F			Herbivore dunging and endozoochorous seed deposition in a Mediterranean dehesa	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Spatial patterns of herbivore defecation within grazing systems are important as they directly affect pasture growth and composition. These effects are partially linked to seed dispersal in dung, a little studied process. This paper focuses on: (1) quantification of dung and seeds deposited by herbivores in a Mediterranean grazing system, and (ii) analysis of the spatial variability of dung and seeds deposited within and among plant communities. We carried out year-long monthly quantifications of the depositions of rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and cow (Bos taurus) dung to 32 plots distributed in Quercus rotundifolia Lam. and Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl woodlands, mixed scrub, and Cistus ladanifer L. scrub. We also quantified the germinable seed content of dung. The results revealed differences (p < 0.05) in dung deposition, varying (i) among the 4 species, (ii) within species (except for the red deer) among plant communities, and (iii) within plant communities. An average of 735 seeds/m(2) were returned to the soil via dung, with the highest numbers in open woodlands (870-1,888 seeds/m(2)) and the lowest numbers in scrubs (83-315 seeds/m(2)). Cows dispersed the most seeds (68%), followed by red deer (20%), rabbits (7%), and fallow deer (5%). Spatial variability in deposition led to accumulations of up to several thousand seeds at points covered by the dung. The effect of seed input to the seed bank and on vegetation may be low at large and medium-sized spatial scales, but it can be very important at small scales and for colonization processes.

Annual and perennial weeds were sampled yearly from 1993 to 1997 at 410 permanent grid points in a 1.3-ha no-till field sown to row crops each year. Geostatistical techniques were used to examine the data as follows: (1) spatial structure within years; (2) relationships of spatial structure to literature-derived population parameters, such as seed production and seed longevity; and (3) stability of weed patches across years. Within years, densities were more variable across crop rows and patches were elongated along rows. Aggregation of seedlings into patches was strongest for annuals and, more generally, for species whose seeds were dispersed by combine harvesting. Patches were most persistent for perennials and, more generally, for species whose seeds dispersed prior to expected dates of combine harvesting. For the most abundant weed in the field, the annual, Setaria viridis, locations of patches in the current year could be used to predict patch locations in the following year, bur not thereafter.

J	Brendonck, L; Riddoch, BJ				Brendonck, L; Riddoch, BJ			Egg bank dynamics in anostracan desert rock pool populations (Crustacea : Branchiopoda)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Egg densities were monitored in the dry sediment of four desert rock pool populations of the fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi over different years/seasons. Egg densities varied according to pool and season/year between about 1,000 and 220,000 eggs per m(2). This converts to population sizes of between about 200 and 500,000 viable diapausing eggs per pool. Egg densities are within the range of 10(3) to 10(5) eggs per m(2) usually measured for other zooplankton species with egg banks. Egg densities were associated but not significantly correlated with chances for successful recruitment in each of the pools as estimated from direct observations of pool hydrocycles and from pool morphometry. Egg bank densities were also not significantly linked with maturation rate and average brood size of the respective populations. Egg densities fluctuate in a partially asynchronosus way among the pools suggesting that factors other than chances for recruitment are also important in controlling egg bank dynamics. The large variance (CV greater than or equal to 80 %) in egg densities over the seasons in unvegetated pools with loose and sparse sediment in comparison with vegetated pools (CV <40 %) with compact sediment holding the eggs, is suggestive of the overriding importance of stochastic passive dispersal by wind or overflows. Earlier reproduction and larger average broods in the short-lived pools also weaken a positive correlation between habitat suitability and egg bank density. The relatively high egg densities of B. wolfi egg banks illustrate the effectiveness of the reproductive and hatching characteristics of this species to successfully persist in this extreme type of temporary habitat. This is the first study on egg bank dynamics in large branchiopods.																	0003-9136					APR	2000	148	1					71	84									WOS:000086710000006						
J	Sutcliffe, OL; Kay, QON				Sutcliffe, OL; Kay, QON			Changes in the arable flora of central southern England since the 1960s	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In the early 1960s, 156 arable fields scattered across Oxfordshire and Berkshire were surveyed. A full resurvey of all these fields which were still in arable production was carried out in 1997. The results were used to assess the change in status of arable weed species over the past 30 years. Many of the rarer species found in the original survey were found over 30 years later at the same sites, suggesting that the distribution of scarce species may not have contracted as seriously as had been believed. However, although these species persist in the seed bank, their overall abundance has declined markedly and consequently urgent, active conservation measures should be undertaken to prevent further extinctions within this species group. Requirements for conservation of rare arable plants are considered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Moriuchi, KS; Venable, DL; Pake, CE; Lange, T				Moriuchi, KS; Venable, DL; Pake, CE; Lange, T			Direct measurement of the seed bank age structure of a Sonoran Desert annual plant	ECOLOGY												We describe a new approach to determining the age structure of seed banks of natural plant populations and apply it to a natural population of the Sonoran Desert winter annual, Pectocarya recurvata (Boraginaceae). Unlike other C-14 techniques, tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (TAMS) counts the number of carbon isotope atoms, permitting high precision with small samples. Aboveground nuclear bomb tests caused atmospheric C-14 levels to peak in 1963. Their subsequent gradual decline provides a signal for aging seed banks with TAMS. We constructed a calibration curve using seeds with known dates of production during 1980-1995, then used it to age 53 seeds sampled from a natural seed bank in 1993, at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Seed number declined with age at an approximately exponential rate, with the oldest recovered seed having an estimated age of 5 yr (95% cr = +/-2.3 yr). The seed bank age structure was judged more than adequate to buffer this population from typical fluctuations, based on an examination of 15 yr of population dynamic data. The TAMS technique has strong potential for answering a broad range of ecological and evolutionary questions requiring post-1963 age determinations and for which a several-year confidence interval is acceptable.																	0012-9658					APR	2000	81	4					1133	1138		10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1133:DMOTSB]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000086351500022

It was introduced to NE Brazil around three centuries ago by African slaves. The study of watermelon evolution after its introduction in NE Brazil indicated that three main factors have played their part: historical (slave trading and colonization of the region); genetical (seed dormancy, introgressive hybridization, fruit opening in the field, natural and artificial selection), and ecological (seed dispersal by animals, watermelon as source of water by farmers in the field, seed bank, different physical environments). These factors, solely or together, determined the selection, maintenance and amplification of the watermelon's genetic variability in the traditional farming of NE Brazil, on the basis of the farmers' fields as units for evolution.																	0925-9864					APR	2000	47	2					207	213		10.1023/A:1008723706557							WOS:000087057400015

It has been observed that some soybean cultivars are capable of stimulating germination of S, hermonthica seed, which would reduce the seed bank in the soil. This study was undertaken to quantify the effect of a soybean crop (compared with a sorghum control) on S. hermonthica emergence in subsequent maize in three farmers' fields in northern Nigeria. Soybean cultivar TGx 1740-7F, previously identified as efficacious for S. hermonthica seed germination, was grown at four densities without P fertilizer to test the effect of increasing plant density of soybean on subsequent S. hermonthica parasitism. The effect of P as single super phosphate was tested on the two highest soybean densities. S. hermonthica parasitism on maize was significantly lower after unfertilized soybean than after the sorghum control treatment at two of three trial sites. Soybean rotation increased maize yield by approximately 90% for the three sites combined. Increasing soybean plant density did not result in lower emerged S. hermonthica. Application of P to soybean at the higher soybean densities resulted in higher root length density, lower emerged S, hermonthica on maize (P<0.15), and significantly higher maize yield. The results suggest that an efficacious cultivar of soybean reduces S. hermonthica parasitism on a succeeding maize crop and that the effect is increased by application of P to the soybean.																	0967-0874					APR-JUN	2000	46	2					115	120		10.1080/096708700227471							WOS:000087368100007						
J	Briese, DT				Briese, DT			Impact of the Onopordum capitulum weevil Larinus latus on seed production by its host-plant	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The impact of the oligophagous capitulum weevil Larinus latus on seed production by its host Onopordum species was studied in its native range in order to assess its potential as a biological control agent of these thistles in Australia. 2. Field surveys in Greece during 1988-89 showed a strong positive relationship between attack levels of L. latus and seed destruction in Onopordum species Differences in attack levels were found between populations of different species, with heavier attack on those having larger capitula. 3. In the case of O. bracteatum, attack levels attained 100% with total seed destruction. More detailed studies at one location over a full season in 1991 confirmed that L. latus is the dominant capitulum insect, being responsible for the loss of 37% of seed, compared with 8% for the lepidopteran Homeosoma nebulella and 2% for the tephritid fly Tephritis postica. 4. A regression surface was produced that estimated seed loss in terms of capitulum size and number of developing L. latus larvae. This provides a tool for measuring overall population seed loss from easily measurable parameters. 5. While able to reduce seed production by Onopordum thistles severely in a single season, the longer-term impact of these weevils on their host-plant population dynamics may not be as great. Onopordum species have long-lived seed banks and thus escape in time will dampen the effects of high seed loss in any one year. Moreover, populations of L. latus are themselves subject to density-dependent regulatory processes that would further buffer the system. 6. This weevil was released in Australia in 1992 for the control of Onopordum thistles, and these findings suggest that L. latus would be most effective as part of a complementary guild of biological control agents.																	0021-8901					APR	2000	37	2					238	246		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00489.x							WOS:000086276000004						
J	Cabin, RJ; Marshall, DL				Cabin, RJ; Marshall, DL			The demographic role of soil seed banks. I. Spatial and temporal comparisons of below- and above-ground populations of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Although seed banks may often affect the colonization, succession and structure of surface plant communities, few studies have investigated the demographic relationship between seeds in the soil and above-ground plant populations over space and time. We examined this relationship in the perennial mustard Lesquerella fendleri between 1991 and 1994 within a New Mexico desert ecosystem characterized by open patches of soil (intershrub areas) interspersed with dominant creosote (Larrea tridentata) shrubs (subshrub areas). 2 For the first 2 years of the study, Lesquerella soil seed, surface plant and seed production densities were greater in subshrub vs. intershrub areas. Within the subshrub areas, there were more Lesquerella soil seeds and surface plants in the northern and central microsites, compared with the southern and perimeter microsites, respectively. The mean density of the subshrub seed bank did not increase following large inputs of new seeds (2400 seeds m(-2)) in the summer of 1992. In contrast, virtually all of the relatively modest Lesquerella intershrub seed production at this time (169 seeds m(-2)) appeared to survive, so that for the remainder of the study most soil seeds were found in the intershrub sites. This spatial reversal of seed bank densities preceded a similar switch in the relative densities of the Lesquerella sub- and intershrub surface plant populations in the last 2 years of the study. 3 This study supports the hypothesis that desert seed bank patchiness contributes to surface plant patchiness, but does not support the idea that seed banks are comprised primarily of seeds produced during favourable reproductive periods. Because there was a closer spatial match between Lesquerella soil seeds and surface plants than between soil seeds and seed production, the above-ground population may be limited to sites favourable for soil seed persistence.																	0022-0477					APR	2000	88	2					283	292		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00443.x							WOS:000086271800008						
J	Cabin, RJ; Marshall, DL; Mitchell, RJ				Cabin, RJ; Marshall, DL; Mitchell, RJ			The demographic role of soil seed banks. II. Investigations of the fate of experimental seeds of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Although poorly studied and understood, the post-dispersal movements and fates of seeds may affect critically the subsequent structure of plant communities, particularly in desert ecosystems where seeds can be the most abundant or only viable form of many plant species. We investigated the fate of experimental seeds of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri by examining seed dispersal and predation, and by quantifying the proportion of seeds that germinated and survived as seedlings in three different microsites within a New Mexico desert shrubland. 2 We found very limited seed dispersal but strong density-dependent seed predation by rodents. There was a significant and consistent microsite effect in the proportion of soil seeds germinating and seedlings surviving to the end of the experiments. We did not find a consistent microsite effect for soil seed persistence, but did find a positive correlation between soil seed persistence and soil seed germination. Overall, these results indicate that seed predation may strongly affect the distribution of the seed bank, and that the abiotic environment may largely determine the extent to which soil seed populations in turn affect the distribution of emerging surface plants. 3 We present a seed fate model that synthesizes the results of the present and previous empirical investigations of the Lesquerella study system. This diagram illustrates how interactions among the abiotic environment, microsite variation and seed genotypes can determine which soil seeds successfully germinate and establish into the surface plant population. We suggest that the demography of desert surface plant populations may depend more on the time between seed inputs and the longevity of these seeds in the soil than on the amount of seeds produced at any one point in time and space.

Community composition and regeneration of Lake Wales Ridge wiregrass flatwoods in relation to time-since-fire. 127:125-138. 2000.-On the Lake Wales Ridge in south-central Florida, we studied plant species composition, seed bank composition, and recovery strategies in thirteen wiregrass flatwoods stands ranging from one to over thirty years postfire. Postfire recovery mechanisms were characterized for 54 species. Wiregrass flatwoods have been characterized historically by fire-return intervals of 1-10 years, which create an open savanna with scattered slash pines. Plant cover reached its maximum only a few years after fire, and litter cover gradually increased with time-since-fire. In long-unburned stands, tall shrubs were abundant and herbs were scarce. The frequency and cover of the two most structurally important species in the community significantly varied among postfire age groups; wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana) frequency was lowest in long-unburned stands, but average cover of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) increased with time-since-fire. Plant species presence remained relatively constant across all stands. Estimated species richness and diversity did not change significantly with time-since-fire. Species composition of the seed bank did not closely resemble the aboveground community composition. Most species present in the seed bank (63%) were not found growing in any stand. Most wiregrass flatwoods species (89%) are capable of vegetative recovery and many (54%) were found to recover only vegetatively after fires. Although few significant shifts in plant species presence were detected along a gradient in fire history that spanned thirty years, important structural changes occurred, which eventually can have substantial impacts in fire suppressed communities. Species that recover vegetatively after fires, but are not present in the seed bank, could be lost from long-unburned flatwoods.																	1095-5674					APR-JUN	2000	127	2					125	138		10.2307/3088690							WOS:000087115900004

The seed banks were assessed by counting the numbers of seedlings appearing of Erica australis and Calluna vulgaris. A total of 2285 germinable seeds/m(2) before burning and 1177 germinable seeds/m(2) after the fire were estimated for Erica australis, and 90 and 690 germinable seeds/m(2), respectively, for Calluna vulgar is. After the fire the number of germinable seeds/m(2) of Erica australis had decreased, whilst there was a considerable increase in the number of germinable seeds/m(2) of Calluna vulgaris. Neither seedlings nor sprouts of Calluna vulgaris had appeared in the field plots 10 months after the fire. Erica australis did recover mainly by sprouting after fire.

J	Egan, TP; Ungar, IA				Egan, TP; Ungar, IA			Similarity between seed banks and above-ground vegetation along a salinity gradient	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Zonation of above-ground vegetation often occurs in salt marshes along salinity and moisture gradients. The above-ground vegetation and seed bank in four physiognomically different vegetation zones in a salt marsh were compared to determine their level of similarity using percent similarity as a distance measure. 10-m transects were established along a salinity gradient through four different vegetation zones; a Salicornia zone, a Salicornia-Atriplex zone, an Atriplex zone and an Atriplex-Hordeum zone. A UPGMA cluster analysis demonstrated that the above-ground vegetation was not usually highly correlated with the seed bank composition of zonal communities. Since seeds of these annual salt marsh species occurred in all zones, the levels of salt stress may be the main factor determining which species were found in the above-ground vegetation.																	1100-9233					APR	2000	11	2					189	194		10.2307/3236798							WOS:000087726700004						
J	Eriksson, A; Eriksson, O				Eriksson, A; Eriksson, O			Population dynamics of the perennial Plantago media in semi-natural grasslands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												In this study we investigated population dynamics of a perennial forb, Plantago media, in semi-natural grasslands in southeastern Sweden. Plantago media is a rather common inhabitant of grasslands in this region, but it has been shown to experience dispersal limitations both among managed grassland sites and at potential dispersal routes along road verges. The demography of P. media was studied in 22 permanent plots at two sites over five years. A seed sowing experiment was also performed at each site. The Life-cycle of P. media includes seedlings, juveniles, small vegetative rosettes, large vegetative rosettes and flowering rosettes. The population growth rates (lambda-values) were negative for both populations, with one exception: the first year transition matrix at one site. The projected life span for individuals surviving from seedlings to flowering rosettes varied between 19.6 yr and 227.8 yr. Elasticity analysis showed that remaining in the large rosette stages, both vegetative and flowering, was the most important factor influencing population growth rate. LTRE analysis gave similar results, indicating that spatial and temporal variation have similar effects on the population growth rate. The expected time to extinction in populations with an initial size of between 100 and 1000 individuals varied between 60 and 200 yr. The seed sowing experiment showed that seedling emergence was enhanced by both seed addition and disturbance, suggesting that recruitment is limited by seed and microsite availability. Recruitment was not found to have much impact on population growth rate. However, long-term population maintenance may depend on occasional small-scale disturbances that enhance pulses of recruitment. Fragmented landscape is likely to effect plant populations including rare and endangered species as well as more common species which have limited dispersal mechanisms.																	1100-9233					APR	2000	11	2					245	252		10.2307/3236803							WOS:000087726700009						
J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM			Seed germination ecology of Lesquerella lyrata Rollins (Brassicaceae), a federally threatened winter annual	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Lesquerella lyrata Rollins (Brassicaceae) is a federally threatened winter annual that is endemic to northern Alabama (USA). Seeds are dormant at maturity in May and have a high temperature (e.g., 25/15 degrees C, 30/15 degrees C) requirement to break dormancy; low temperatures (e.g., 5/5 degrees C, 15/6 degrees C) cause nondormant seeds to reenter dormancy. Seeds buried in soil and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes in a nonheated greenhouse came out of dormancy in summer and reentered it in winter, thus exhibiting an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle. The highest germination percentages of non-dormant seeds in the laboratory were obtained at 30/15 degrees C, in light. Fresh seeds sown on the soil surface in the greenhouse in June germinated in September, when maximum and minimum daily temperatures were about 27 degrees C and 18 degrees C, respectively. Seeds germinated in six autumns in soil samples kept in the nonheated greenhouse for 10 years; thus the species has a long-lived seed bank. Plowing, mowing, and/or grazing to maintain the field, roadside, and/or pasture habitats of L. lyrata in an early stage of succession should be done from June to August, while the species is in the seed stage of its life cycle. These efforts are not needed to promote seed germination per se but to keep the habitat open and, thus, to promote plant growth and seed production. The presence of a seed bank means L. lyrata can persist at a site without producing seeds every year.																	0885-8608					APR	2000	20	2					159	165									WOS:000086570100007						
J	Tessier, M; Gloaguen, JC; Lefeuvre, JC				Tessier, M; Gloaguen, JC; Lefeuvre, JC			Factors affecting the population dynamics of Suaeda maritima at initial stages of development	PLANT ECOLOGY												This study describes life history and population dynamics of the annual halophyte Suaeda maritima, at initial stages of seedling development, in salt-marshes of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay. Effects of salinity on seed germination and seedling development were studied both in the laboratory and in the field. Salinity was measured as sediment electrical conductivity. Experiments in the laboratory showed that Suaeda maritima was relatively tolerant to salinity during the germination stage. In the field, germination occurred when soil salinity was minimal. Almost all seeds germinated in the field; this may explain the absence of a persistent seed bank. Salinity did not seem to affect the growth of seedlings either. Mortality in the field was attributed to physical factors such as anoxia during temporary immersion, burial by sediment and tidal uprooting. The intensity of these effects varied according to the location of Suaeda maritima seedlings: in hollows, along the edge of tidal creeks, in gaps among dense vegetation cover, or in pattern with Puccinellia maritima. Perennial vegetation did not restrict Suaeda maritima germination. In contrast, perennials such as Puccinellia maritima and Halimione portulacoides limited the development of Suaeda maritima seedlings since only a small number of this annual emerged beneath their canopies. The fate of seedlings depended to a great extent on the permeability of the perennial canopy to light. Thus, disturbance resulting in bare patches inside the perennial vegetation seemed essential for the development of this annual species. Suaeda maritima can grow in the presence of Puccinellia maritima so long as the latter present as an open matrix. Suaeda maritima may also benefit from protection against desiccation and tidal action where this occurs.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				APR	2000	147	2					193	203		10.1023/A:1009854204841							WOS:000086380600005						
J	Casanova, MT; Brock, MA				Casanova, MT; Brock, MA			How do depth, duration and frequency of flooding influence the establishment of wetland plant communities?	PLANT ECOLOGY												In many temporary wetlands such as those on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales Australia, the development of plant communities is largely the result of germination and establishment from a long-lived, dormant seed bank, and vegetative propagules that survive drought. In these wetlands the pattern of plant zonation can differ from year to year and season to season, and depth is not always a good indicator of the plant community composition in different zones. In order to determine which aspects of water regime (depth, duration or frequency of flooding) were important in the development of plant communities an experiment using seed bank material from two wetlands was undertaken over a 16 week period in late spring-early summer 1995-1996. Seed bank samples were exposed to 17 different water-level treatments with different depths, durations and frequencies of flooding. Species richness and biomass of the communities that established from the seed bank were assessed at the end of the experiment and the data were examined to determine which aspects of water regime were important in the development of the different communities. It was found that depth, duration and frequency of inundation influenced plant community composition, but depth was least important, and also that the duration of individual flooding events was important in segregating the plant communities. Species were grouped according to their ability to tolerate or respond to fluctuations in flooding and drying. The highest biomass and species richness developed in pots that were never flooded. Least biomass and species richness developed in pots that were continuously flooded. Short frequent floods promoted high species richness and biomass especially of Amphibious fluctuation-tolerator species and Amphibious fluctuation-responder species that have heterophylly. Terrestrial species were able to establish during dry phases between short floods. Depth was important in determining whether Amphibious fluctuation-tolerator or Amphibious fluctuation-responder species had greater biomass. Longer durations of flooding lowered species richness and the biomass of terrestrial species. Experiments of this kind can assist in predicting vegetation response to water-level variation in natural and modified wetlands.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				APR	2000	147	2					237	250		10.1023/A:1009875226637							WOS:000086380600009

A herbicide program consisting of SAN 582 applied preemergence followed by a postemergence application of dicamba plus atrazine was evaluated at four levels (0.0, 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0 times the label rates). At a site with low initial weed densities, the addition of velvetleaf or giant foxtail seed to the seed bank did not influence herbicide efficacy at the 1.0 x rate at 9 wk after planting (WAP). Giant foxtail densities were greater 9 WAP in augmented areas than in the native seed bank plots at both the 0.3x and 0.7x rates, whereas with velvetleaf, higher densities in augmented plots were seen only at the 0.3x rate. In areas with high native weed densities, addition of seed of either species resulted in an increase in final weed densities at all herbicide rates.																	0890-037X					APR-JUN	2000	14	2					261	267		10.1614/0890-037X(2000)014[0261:EOSBAO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000166693500004						
J	Jones, RE; Medd, RW				Jones, RE; Medd, RW			Economic thresholds and the case for longer term approaches to population management of weeds	WEED TECHNOLOGY												The economic threshold is a concept strongly embedded within the weed management literature. There are some theoretical concerns with applying a static approach such as the economic threshold to weed management decision making. An improvement is to adopt a population management approach where the intertemporal effects of decisions are taken into account. The focus should be on managing weed populations through time rather than minimizing the yield effect of weeds in a single season or year. Rather than viewing weeds as an annual production problem, the weed seed bank can be considered a renewable resource: stock, and the management goal is to deplete this resource stock through time. The principles of natural resource economics illustrate that including the intertemporal effects of weed control will, for a given size of a seed bank, result in a greater level of weed control and a higher economic benefit than if control decisions were based solely on the current period effects. A dynamic economic model was developed of an extensive Australian spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system to test these principles using wild oat (Avena fatua and A. ludoviciana) as an example. The model was solved for a 20-yr time horizon for a population management approach and the traditional static economic threshold. The economic benefits from a population management approach were significantly greater than those generated by the economic threshold, and the final seed bank was considerably lower. This result suggests that a paradigm shift from thresholds to longer term population management is warranted.																	0890-037X					APR-JUN	2000	14	2					337	350		10.1614/0890-037X(2000)014[0337:ETATCF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000166693500015						
J	Evans, MEK; Dolan, RW; Menges, ES; Gordon, DR				Evans, MEK; Dolan, RW; Menges, ES; Gordon, DR			Genetic diversity and reproductive biology in Warea carteri (Brassicaceae), a narrowly endemic Florida scrub annual	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Carter's mustard (Warea carteri) is an endangered fire-stimulated annual endemic of the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida, USA. This species is characterized by seed banks and large fluctuations in plant numbers, with increases occurring in postdisturbance habitat. We investigated the mating system, patterns of isozyme variation, and effective population sizes of W. carteri to better understand its population biology and to comment on reserve designs and management proposals relevant to this species. Waren carteri is self-compatible and autogamous, and probably largely selfing. Measures of genetic variation in W. carteri were lower than values reported for species with similar ecological and life history traits (6.6% of loci polymorphic within populations, 1.87 alleles per polymorphic locus, and 0.026 and 0.018 expected and observed heterozygosity, respectively). The high average value for Nei's genetic identity (0.989) reflects the paucity of genetic diversity. Genetic variation within populations was not correlated with aboveground population size. effective population size estimates (N-e), or recent disturbance history. Much of the diversity detected was found among populations (F-ST = 0.304). A significant cline in allele frequencies at one locus and a significant negative correlation between geographic distance and Nei's genetic identity also point to spatial organization of generic diversity. As a result we propose that reserve design should include the entire geographic range of W. carteri. We also recommend that the natural fire regime be mimicked.																	0002-9122					MAR	2000	87	3					372	381		10.2307/2656633							WOS:000085956600009	10718998					
J	de Winton, MD; Clayton, JS; Champion, PD				de Winton, MD; Clayton, JS; Champion, PD			Seedling emergence from seed banks of 15 New Zealand lakes with contrasting vegetation histories	AQUATIC BOTANY												Submerged sediments were sampled from 15 New Zealand lakes of contrasting vegetation histories and seedling emergence was measured. Lakes either supported seed producing, indigenous plants (Native), vegetatively reproducing, adventive plants (Hydrocharitacean), or lake vegetation had declined (De-vegetated). Sediment was divided into three depth strata of 50-mm thickness and cultured in a shallow outdoor pond receiving 8% ambient light. Seedlings were recorded from 92% of samples, with emergence recorded throughout the trial (22-25 weeks). Initial emergence was earlier for Native lakes (mean 5.2 weeks), than Hydrocharitacean (8.7 weeks) or De-vegetated lakes (9.5 weeks). Overall numbers of emerging seedlings varied considerably (0-3 x 10(5) m(-2) per sample), but could not be related to vegetation history (p > 0.05, ANOVA). In contrast, seedling species richness was higher (p < 0.05) for Native lakes than for either of the other two categories. Vegetation history was reflected by differing patterns of emergence across sediment depth strata (p < 0.05), with reduced numbers of seedlings in deep sediments identified from Native lakes only. Seed banks (seedlings plus remaining viable seed) were recorded in all samples, representing up to 12 submerged species. Charophyte oospores dominated the seed banks, with higher recruitment of Chara species than Nitella species possibly related to a larger volume of reserves in the oospores of the former. The study suggests that submerged seed banks possess attributes of longevity and act to conserve seed density and species richness. These attributes, and the potential for a substantial and sustained seedling emergence response, demonstrate that lake seed banks offer a potential means to restore vegetation resources in degraded lakes.

J	Tekle, K; Bekele, T				Tekle, K; Bekele, T			The role of soil seed banks in the rehabilitation of degraded hillslopes in southern Wello, Ethiopia	BIOTROPICA												The species composition in the soil seed bank of degraded hillslopes in southern Wello, Ethiopia, was assessed using the seedling emergence method and compared with chat of the standing vegetation. Surface soils were sampled at Oto 5-cm depth from 49 plots of four physiognomic vegetation classes (hereafter vegetation classes): forests, shrublands, grasslands, and degraded sires. Soils were spread on sterile sand in a glasshouse and watered. Emerging seedlings were recorded for five months until no new seedlings emerged. A total of 3969 seedlings belonging to 71 species and 30 families germinated. The species composition of the seed bank was dominated by 53 herb species (75%) compared co 2 tree species which accounted for only 3 percent of the total number of species. Seedling density differed significantly among vegetation classes and ranged from 391 to 7807 seeds/m(2). Mean species richness also differed significantly among the vegetation classes. Forty-two species were found to be common to the seed banks and the standing vegetation; however, correspondence between species numbers and composition of che seed banks and the standing vegetation was poor. Although most of the species chat germinated in che seed banks were herbs and grasses, they can develop a vegetative cover and contribute to reduction of sail erosion. Regeneration of the cree species (some of which have seed viability up co four years) however, requires both time and the presence of mature individuals. Together with hillside closure and soil conservation measures (e.g., terracing), planting of native woody seedlings might help to expedite rehabilitation of degraded hillslopes devoid of trees and shrubs.																	0006-3606	1744-7429				MAR	2000	32	1					23	32		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2000.tb00444.x							WOS:000086506100003						
J	Duncan, RS; Duncan, VE				Duncan, RS; Duncan, VE			Forest succession and distance from forest edge in an Afro-tropical grassland	BIOTROPICA												Forest succession on degraded tropical lands often is slowed by impoverished seed banks and low races of seed dispersal. Within degraded landscapes, remnant forests are potential seed sources that could enhance nearby forest succession. The spacial extent that forest can influence succession, however, remains largely unstudied. In abandoned agricultural Lands in Kibale National Park, Uganda, recurrent fires have helped perpetuate the dominance of tall (2-3 m) grasses. We examined the effects of distance from forest and grassland vegetation structure on succession in a grassland having several years of fire exclusion. At 10 and 25 m from forest edge, we quantified vegetation patterns, seed predation, and survival of planted tree seedlings. Natural vegetation was similar at both distances, as was seed (eight species) and seedling (six species) survival; however, distance may be important at spatial or temporal scales not examined in this study Our results offer insight into forest succession on degraded tropical grasslands following fire exclusion. Naturally recruited trees and tree seedlings were scarce, and seed survival was low (20% after 7 mo). While seedling survival was high (95% after 6 to 8 mo), seedling shoot growth was very slow ((x) over bar = 0.5 cm/100 d), suggesting that survivorship eventually may decline. Recurrent fires often impede forest succession in degraded tropical grasslands; however, even with fire exclusion, our study suggests that forest succession can be very slow, even in close proximity to forest.

J	Farji-Brener, AG; Medina, CA				Farji-Brener, AG; Medina, CA			The importance of where to dump the refuse: Seed banks and fine roots in nests of the leaf-cutting ants Atta cephalotes and A-colombica	BIOTROPICA												The location of the nutrient-rich organic refuse produced by a leaf-cutting ant colony varies among ant species. Atta cephalotes locate their organic refuse in subterranean chambers, whereas A. colombica place their organic refuse on the soil surface near the nest. We studied the effect of the absence or presence of external organic refuse on the abundance of fine roots and seed bank composition in the superficial horizons of ant nests. We sampled soils from ant nests or dumps and adjacent areas of 15 adult nests of A. cephalotes at La Selva (LS), Costa Rice, and of 15 of A. colombica nests on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Soils from A. cephalotes nests did nor differ from adjacent soils in abundance of fine-root and seed diversity. In contrast, organic refuse from A. colombica nests was less diverse in seed composition (due to the great abundance of Miconia argentea) and had a greater abundance of fine roots than adjacent areas. Thus the external location of the ant-nest organic refuse is potentially important in determining the different types of plant recolonization in abandoned or dead ant nests. The relative abundance of these Atta species may influence the structure and/or composition of tropical forests.

J	Araki, S; Washitani, I				Araki, S; Washitani, I			Seed dormancy/germination traits of seven Persicaria species and their implication in soil seed-bank strategy	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												In order to predict species-specific potential to form persistent soil seed-banks and to characterize the dynamics of their seed-banks, the seed dormancy/germination traits of seven Persicaria (Polygonum s.lat.) species sharing lakeshore habitats in central Japan were examined. Strict light requirements for seed germination were not observed in any of the species examined. Although all species required moist chilling (0-6 weeks) to break seed dormancy and were sensitive to temperature fluctuation, the degree of both responses varied between species. Seed germination of Persicaria hydropiper (L.) Spach, Persicaria lapathifolia (L.) S.F. Gray, and Persicaria longiseta (De Bruyn) Kitag. was more accelerated by temperature fluctuation and required shorter chilling periods compared with Persicaria japonica (Meisn.) H. Gross, Persicaria maackiana (Regel) Nakai, Persicaria thunbergii (Sieb. et Zucc.) H. Gross, and Persicaria sieboldi (Maisn.) Onki. Secondary dormancy was induced in all species at higher temperatures (24 and 30 degrees C). A persistent seed-bank strategy suggested by the dormancy/germination traits of the studied species was also demonstrated by seedling emergence from surface soils collected from the natural habitat immediately before seed dispersal, as well as by viable seed persistence for 13 months in the field in a seed burial experiment. In the natural habitat, the species with longer chilling requirements occurred in various microhabitats, including the interior of moist tall grasslands, whereas the species having higher sensitivity to temperature fluctuation were most frequently found in sparsely vegetated microhabitats.																	0912-3814					MAR	2000	15	1					33	46		10.1046/j.1440-1703.2000.00323.x							WOS:000085689200004						
J	Rogers, HM; Hartemink, AE				Rogers, HM; Hartemink, AE			Soil seed bank and growth rates of an invasive species, Piper aduncum, in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Secondary fallow vegetation in parts of the Papua New Guinea lowlands is dominated by the shrub Piper aduncum L. that originates from South America. Here we report on its seed bank, growth rate and biomass accumulation. P. aduncum accounted for 69 % (408 m(-2)) of the seed bank in the forest and 53 % (1559 m(-2)) of the seed bank under fallow. About 90 % of the tree seed bank at the fallow site was dominated by P. aduncum whereas this was 78 % in the forest soil. Two-year-old P. aduncum had grown to 4.5 m height and had accumulated 48 Mg dry matter (DM) per ha of above ground biomass. The rate of biomass accumulation increased from 10 Mg DM ha(-1) y(-1) in the first year to 40 Mg DM ha(-1) y(-1) in the second year when 76 % of the biomass consisted of mainstems. The highest growth rate of 134 kg DM ha(-1) d(-1) occurred when P. aduncum was 17-mo-old. Aggressive invasion and monospecific stands of P. aduncum are explained by its dominance in the seed bank, fast growth, and high rates of biomass accumulation. P. aduncum is a major competitor to indigenous tree species and presents a threat to Papua New Guinea's rich biodiversity.

J	Tew, TE; Todd, IA; Macdonald, DW				Tew, TE; Todd, IA; Macdonald, DW			Arable habitat use by wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). 2. Microhabitat	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Forty-eight wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were radio-tracked over an estimated 1500 h yielding 9000 fixes. The mice were living in three contiguous arable fields, and showed that they respond to weedy microhabitat patches within superficially homogeneous crops. Plant species' abundance and the composition of the seed bank were assessed in quadrats taken in areas in which (a) mice foraged, (b) through which mice travelled, or (c) at random within each home range. Wood mice avoided foraging in areas with a high abundance of bare earth, and selected areas with a high abundance of Alopecurus myosuroides, Stellaria media, Avena fatua, Galium aparine or Bromus sterilis. The food plants apparently selected by wood mice differed markedly between months and between sexes. This may relate to the energetic and nutritional demands incurred by the contrasting reproductive tactics of male and female wood mice. There were no differences between seed bank samples taken from quadrats where the mice foraged, travelled through, or which were selected at random. Our study, the first large-scale analysis of wood mouse microhabitat preference using radio-tracking, reveals that whereas the mice do not react to heterogeneity on the scale of the mosaic of crop fields, they are greatly influenced by the dispersion of food plants within the superficially homogeneous crop itself.																	0952-8369					MAR	2000	250		3				305	311		10.1017/S0952836900003034							WOS:000086124300003						
J	Sutherland, EK; Hale, BJ; Hix, DM				Sutherland, EK; Hale, BJ; Hix, DM			Defining species guilds in the Central Hardwood Forest, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY												Tree regeneration outcomes are challenging to generalize and difficult to predict. Many tree species can establish new propagules in a variety of post-disturbance environments and many different reproductive mechanisms may be used. In order to develop conceptual models that accurately reflect reproductive potential, we need a better understanding of the similarities in regeneration ecology among species. We used information from the forest ecology literature to evaluate the reproductive attributes of sixty-two tree species in the central hardwood region of the eastern United States. Each species was classified categorically for features such as flowering, seed production and dispersal, seed dormancy, germination requirements, seedling characteristics, and vegetative reproduction. Cluster analysis (Jaccard's similarity coefficient, complete linkage method) and ordination (homogeneity analysis) were used to separate nine groups (guilds) of species that had similar reproductive attributes. Individual attributes that had high variance in the first and second dimensions included: seed banking, seed dispersal, seedling shade tolerance, and seedbed requirements. Members of each guild had similar levels of reproductive specialization and guilds were either pioneer-like, opportunistic, or persistent. Pioneer guilds included: short-lived or fugitive species that colonize sites rapidly and are too shade intolerant to replace themselves; shade-tolerant species that colonize frequently disturbed sites; and stress-tolerant pioneers that survive on dry or nutrient-poor sites. Opportunistic guilds contained species that are remarkably versatile in their reproductive effort. The most flexible opportunists can colonize new sites, maintain seed in a seed bank, sprout from existing stems and persist as a seedling or sapling bank. Persistent guilds contain species that develop and maintain advance regeneration. These include: species with moderate understory tolerance that regenerate via cycles of dieback and resprouting; and more tolerant species that maintain seedling or sapling banks. Our regeneration guilds may provide a useful approach for more realistically representing large and diverse sets of tree species in forest ecosystem models.				Hix, David/B-3228-2012; Hix, D.

J	Bender, MH; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC				Bender, MH; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC			Ecological life history of Polymnia canadensis, a monocarpic species of the North American Temperate Deciduous Forest: Demography	PLANT ECOLOGY												A demographic investigation was conducted to assess variation in life history of Polymnia canadensis (Asteraceae), a geographically-widespread, herbaceous species of deciduous forests in eastern North America. During 1985-1994, 23,063 seedlings of P. canadensis were monitored at five central Kentucky study sites. Numbers at the end were: biennials, 554; triennials, 142; winter annuals, 16; monocarpic perennials, 2; tricarpic perennials (three years), 3; and dicarpic perennials (some skipped years) that matured in the first year of life, 23; in the second year, 60; and in the third year, 9. Weekly cohorts of P. canadensis generally exhibited Deevey Type III survivorship with highest seedling mortality in summer associated with low soil moisture. Wide spatial variation in life history was displayed by the fact that fall germination cohorts at dry sites generally had greater germination and survivorship than at mesic sites during seedling establishment, while the reverse was true for spring cohorts. This led to more reproductive individuals in fall germination cohorts than spring cohorts at dry sites and generally the opposite case at mesic sites. Forest shade in mesic sites caused slower growth and a greater frequency of longer-lived reproductive individuals than in open, dry sites, but it also resulted in higher survivorship than at dry sites during moderate drought. Annual population growth rate averaged across four years was not significantly different between a dry site and mesic site, indicating that despite forest shade, P. canadensis persisted in the mesic site as well as it did in the dry site. Population structure varied among years, seasons, and study sites; at two study plots, a 2-year flowering cycle of mass seeding and senescence persisted for 4 years. At a smaller scale, there was little difference in survivorship between study plots within sites or between quadrats within study plots, while in a few instances there were large differences in the number of reproductive individuals. Weekly cohorts that germinated early within seasonal cohorts had greater number of reproductive individuals than later weekly cohorts, but not consistently greater survivorship. Several droughts induced temporal variation that was as important as spatial variation. During these droughts, the population size of all cohorts that germinated prior to the droughts declined to zero at all sites, and biennials were the longest lived type of reproductive individuals. During drought, Deevey Type I survivorship was prevalent, and lack of seed rain led to dependence on persistent seed banks for recruitment in some seasonal cohorts.																	1385-0237					MAR	2000	147	1					117	136		10.1023/A:1009864912195							WOS:000085308100009						
J	Gordon, E				Gordon, E			Vegetation and seed bank dynamics in a lacustrine harbaceous wetland (Venezuela)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Vegetation and seed banks association with seasonal water depth variations were studied in a herbaceous wetland of a tropical lake in Monagas, Venezuela. The sampling was done in 10x10 m(2) quadrates located at random in two zones of the lagoon. In each sampling four quadrates per zone were analyzed for relative species density, species richness, life forms and water depth. Soil samples were taken simultaneously for size and composition of the seed banks (seedling emergence method). Soil pH was five. The organic total fraction of the soil varied between 38% and 52%, and the conductivity between 114 and 182 mu mhos/cm. 50 species were recorded: 46% perennial herbs, 22% vines, 12% suffrutescents and 10% hydrophytes. The highest species richness was recorded during periods of rain and rain-dry transition. Hymenachne amplexicaulis, Leersia hexandra, Sacciolepis striata and Polygonum acuminatum were among the most important species numerically. The total density of seed bank varied between 5689 and 13936 seedlings/m(2). In the seed bank there were 58 species: 43% perennial herbs, 22% suffrutescents, 12% vines 9% annual herbs and 9%, hydrophytes. The highest species richness in the seed bank was during periods of dry and dry-rain transition. Cyperus odoratus, Eleocharis interstincta, Ludwigia hyssopifolia, L. lithospermifolia and Polygonum acuminatum had the highest densities. The potential flora of these wetlands included 76 species, but only 33 (43%) were common to the seed bank and the vegetation.																	0034-7744					MAR	2000	48	1					25	42									WOS:000088671400004

J	Onaindia, M; Amezaga, I				Onaindia, M; Amezaga, I			Seasonal variation in the seed banks of native woodland and coniferous plantations in Northern Spain	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The effect of forest type (native woodland and two types of plantation: evergreen coniferous Pinus radiata D. Don and deciduous coniferous Larix kaempferi Lamb.) and season on the composition and density of the soil seed bank were studied in a replicated experiment in the Basque Country, northern Spain. Spring was the season with the largest germinable seed bank and the highest species diversity. The seasonal variation of the seed bank was mainly due to the phenology of the species rather than to the environment (i.e. tree species). The highest number of seeds and species in the seed bank was found in the larch plantation. The greatest similarity among the seed bank of the different forests was due to the presence of broad ranged species. Species belonging to this group were mainly present in the seed bank. The presence of seeds of some native held layer species such as Arum maculatum, Oxalis acetosella, Blechnum spicant (spores) or Danthonia decumbens in the seed bank was favoured by the coniferous plantations. However, most of the field layer species were not found in the seed bank. As the typical woodland species, which do not have a persistent seed bank, are the first ones to disappear from vegetation in coniferous plantations, future management plans should aim to maintain a balance between plantations and natural woodlands and the frequency of cutting, in order to maintain local species diversity.

J	Read, TR; Bellairs, SM; Mulligan, DR; Lamb, D				Read, TR; Bellairs, SM; Mulligan, DR; Lamb, D			Smoke and heat effects on soil seed bank germination for the re-establishment of a native forest community in New South Wales	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The effects of plant-derived smoke and of heat on the emergence of seedlings from seeds were assessed. Seeds had been stored in forest topsoil used for mine site rehabilitation. The study was carried out in a dry sclerophyll, spotted gum (Corymbia maculata), forest community at the Mount Owen open-cut coal mine in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. Samples of the surface 2.5 cm of topsoil were either exposed to cool smoke from eucalypt foliage for 60 min, heated to 80 degrees C, or left untreated. Seedling emergence from the seed bank in this soil was then monitored in a glasshouse. Within the first month, smoke alone promoted a 4.3-fold increase in the density of seedlings relative to control. There were 540 emergents per m(2) in the control and 2309 per m(2) in the smoke treated topsoil. Many annual and perennial herbs emerged but grasses responded most strongly to smoke. Germination in seven of the 20 grass species was promoted by smoke. Smoke promoted the germination of some introduced species as well as native species, and accelerated the rate at which seedlings emerged, although these differences sometimes declined with time. Heat also stimulated germination but smoke and heat stimuli appeared to be complementary in their promotion of seedling emergence from the topsoil seed bank. Each treatment increased the density of different species, enhanced the species richness of different components of the seed bank, and had different effects on the rate of emergence. The results suggest that increased seed germination in the field immediately following a moderate intensity fire may sometimes be the result of smoke stimulation and sometimes the result of heat stimulation of the soil seed bank. These findings may have important implications for minesite revegetation programs where topsoils are replaced after mining and rapid germination of seeds stored in these soils is required during short periods when conditions are favourable for germination.																	1442-9985					FEB	2000	25	1					48	57		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2000.tb00006.x							WOS:000087255200006

A preliminary checklist of 104 vascular plants occurring in the forest is provided. Based on 27 plots, each of 400 m(2), the forest had the following ecological features: mean tree density 408 stems . ha(-1); basal area 66.56 m(2) . ha(-1); Shannon and Wiener diversity 2.6406; evenness 0.7585 and species richness 31 tree species per 1.08 ha. The seed bank was dominated by woody species, including mature forest tree species, and had several species in common with the standing vegetation. The forest contains species that are phytogeographically linked to Madagascan, Western and Southern African floras and also species disjunctly distributed in this forest and the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. Correspondence Analysis of tree species based on size classes showed that the timber species had declining populations, indicating the possibility of genetic erosion, while other species showed expanding or interrupted populations. Some DBH-size classes (e.g. 145.0-189.9 cm) have disappeared from the forest, presumably due to their selective removal. We recommend detailed integrated floristic and faunistic studies of the forest, targeting the ecologically sensitive indicators of habitat change such as orchids, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Finally, a proposal to conserve the forest under a community-based forest conservation scheme is put forward.																	0960-3115					FEB	2000	9	2					241	263		10.1023/A:1008954526896							WOS:000086323400005

We identified 49 taxa in the seed bank, with an average of 40 species.m(-2) and a median density of 1218 seeds.m(-2). The most frequent seeds were species of Carex and Rubus, Diervilla lonicera, and Eupatorium rugosum, while seeds of Carex were the most numerous overall. Of the 12 species in the seed bank not found in the forest, 11 were found growing on the developed landscape surrounding this 10-km(2) forest fragment. These nonforest species were numerically only a minor component of the forest seed bank. Vernal herbs were not in the seed bank, and there were only a few tree species. Variation in seed bank richness among habitats was correlated positively with canopy cover, soil moisture, and soil nutrients, but not with the seed bank density or total number of species in the aboveground vegetation. Seed bank density increased with plot soil moisture. Woody species predominated in the seed bank of plots with richer soils, deeper litter, and more closed canopies. Herbaceous species predominated in the seed bank of plots with more open canopies, more mesic water regimes, and greater species richness in the aboveground vegetation. Contrary to earlier results suggesting forest seed banks primarily include shade-intolerant species associated with canopy disturbance or secondary succession, the seed bank in this old-growth, primary forest contains many shade-tolerant forest species.

J	Guariguata, MR				Guariguata, MR			Seed and seedling ecology of tree species in neotropical secondary forests: Management implications	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In spite of the growing importance of neotropical secondary forests as sources of timber and environmental services, the baseline information needed to develop silvicultural options is still limited. In this paper I describe interspecific patterns of seed longevity in the soil, germination, and survival and growth of transplanted seedlings under closed canopy of nine tree species that are common in secondary forest stands in wet, lowland Costa Rica and most of which are timber species in the region: Cordia alliodora, Hampea appendiculata, Jacaranda copaia, Laetia procera, Rollinia microsepala, Simarouba amara, Stryphnodendron microstachyum, Trichospermum grewiifolium, and Vochysia ferruginea, Many of these species also occur throughout the lowland neotropics. Experiments were carried out in three replicate secondary-forest stands (20-30 yr old after pasture abandonment) located at La Selva Biological Station in northeastern Costa Rica. Longevity of experimental seed cohorts differed markedly among species, from <3 mo (Cordia, Hampea, Simarouba, Vochysia), to >1 yr (Stryphnodendron). Similarly, germination of recently dispersed seeds in the understory ranged from 0% in Laetin to >75% in Cordia and Vochysia. In contrast, seedling survival was uniformly low (<10% survival one year after transplanting except for Stryphnodendron, which showed similar to 20% survival). The implications of these findings for the management of secondary forest stands for timber production are varied and depend on the species of interest. First, all study species appear to require nearly complete canopy opening to regenerate as they show limited capacity either to germinate or to survive as seedlings in the understory. Second, some species that can germinate at high levels in the shade can be managed at the seedling stage by opening up the canopy a few months after germination (e.g., Cordia, Simarouba, Vochysia). Third, species that show little or no germination under closed canopy (e.g., Jacaranda, Laetin, Rollinia) will need canopy removal simply to germinate in adequate amounts. Due to rapid declines in seed viability and seedling survivorship, however, any canopy manipulation must be performed not beyond 6 mo in order to guarantee adequate levels of soil-stored seeds or seedlings for future stand development. Site-preparation techniques may need implementation, given the potential of competing vegetation to interfere with seedlings after canopy opening, as suggested by the high abundance of herbs and shrubs present in the soil seed bank in the study stands. This ecological scenario is likely to occur in secondary stands elsewhere in the region as secondary stands are usually located within agricultural land. Finally, the results of this study suggest that ecological classifications of trees solely based on light preferences for stem growth may fail to account for important differences among species in their regeneration mode. This is of particular importance for refining silvicultural guidelines in neotropical secondary forests.																	1051-0761					FEB	2000	10	1					145	154		10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0145:SASEOT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000085108400012						
J	Odion, DC; Davis, FW				Odion, DC; Davis, FW			Fire, soil heating, and the formation of vegetation patterns in chaparral	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												We documented patterns of surface heating associated with chaparral fire to characterize fundamental scale variation in the intensity of this stand-replacing disturbance. To test how this variation may influence community structure, we studied its effect on the soil seed bank and the distribution of seedlings and resprouts that emerged after fire. To evaluate the long-term significance of initial patterns, we monitored vegetation development for 4-5 yr, thereby encompassing the dynamic portion of the chaparral fire cycle. We studied two stands on level uniform terrain before, during, and after fall fires. Stands were dominated by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), a postfire seeder/sprouter. Nonsprouting Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus spp. were also present. Preburn vegetation, seed populations, soil heating, and postburn plant growth were analyzed along transects of contiguous 1-m(2) plots, so that we could block them together incrementally to identify scale dependence of patterns. In addition, we directly compared heating effects under the fuel array with those just outside by establishing plots in canopy gaps, under the adjacent canopy, and in gaps created and eliminated by reciprocally translocating fuel. Pre- and postburn seed populations were estimated in soil samples collected from all plots. The proportion of seed that survived above and below 2.5 cm in the soil was determined in a subset of plots. The amount and distribution of canopy fuel that collapsed during fire and smoldered on the ground caused pronounced spatial variation in total surface heating. The strength of relationships among patterns of soil heating, preburn canopy, surviving seeds, and seedlings and herbaceous resprouts was consistently most pronounced in blocks 3-5 m long. At this scale, postburn patterns were strongly negatively associated with the amount of preburn canopy and the pattern of soil heating this fuel created. Seedlings or herbaceous resprouts of numerous species were abundant where soil heating was relatively low, most notably in natural and created canopy gaps. Conversely, areas where dense canopy occurred before fire, especially gaps displaced by fuel addition, were barren except for occasional Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus seedlings. These obligate postfire seeders, along with the subshrub Helianthemum scoparium, had more deeply buried seeds, and some of them were able to survive where soil heating was prolonged. However, Helianthemum did not emerge from depth. Seedlings of Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus nearest Adenostoma burls survived significantly better when Adenostoma failed to resprout. This wan common in one burn where heating was relatively high and burl size was small. Seed mortality prevented Adenostoma seedling emergence from occurring where its seeds were most abundant prior to fire, which was in proximity to its burls. Adenostoma seedlings did emerge in areas of lower soil heating, but their survival was inversely related to the density of Helianthemum seedlings. No shrub seedlings emerged after the first year following fire because their seed banks were exhausted by fire-induced mortality and/or germination. After 4-5 yr, few young Adenostoma remained. The combination of seedling and resprout regeneration allowed this shrub to maintain dominance, but to a lesser extent in the older stand. Our results support a vegetation pattern-process model in which local species distributions after fire in Adenostoma chaparral are antecedently linked to the physical and chemical properties of the canopy. These control the nature of combustion, the soil heating that results, and the distribution of seeds and resprout tissues that survive. The vegetation develops entirely from these sources, so fire-induced patterns are manifest in the long-term structure of this vegetation.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				FEB	2000	70	1					149	169		10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0149:FSHATF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000085208500007						
J	Hegazy, AK				Hegazy, AK			Intra-population variation in reproductive ecology and resource allocation of the rare biennial species Verbascum sinaiticum Benth., in Egypt	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Verbascum sinaiticum Benth. (Scrophulariaceae) is a biennial rosette plant. The species is rare in Egypt and its distribution is restricted to the Sinai peninsula. The investigated population was located in Saint Catherine, Southern Sinai. To assess the reproductive ecology of the species the population dynamics, age-specific survival, resource allocation, energy content, and seed longevity of a natural population were studied. The germinable seed bank represents an average of 0.08% of the seeds in the seed rain. The plants are juvenile during 33% to 67% of their lives. Total seed rain output comes from four different cohorts of adult plants. Seeds produced during the summer constituted 83.5% of the;total seed rain. Adult plants 15-18 months in age attained a maximum rosette leafiness of 2.85 m(2)m(-2) and a maximum root crown diameter of 2.3 cm. Highly reproductive individuals allocated the least dry mass to their roots. The root/shoot ratio was 0.25. Caloric content reached up to 6.37 kcal g(-1) dry mass in roots of juvenile plants and 7.5 kcal g(-1) dry mass in the summer seeds. Seed viability was higher in seeds produced during summer and autumn (9 years) as compared to seeds produced during spring (6 years). Life span ranges between 1 and 2 years, which results in an intra-population variation of survival, resource allocation, energy content, and seed longevity and viability. These variations act as an evolutionary filter, an important asset to increase the genetic diversity and stability of populations In areas with low or periodical rainfall.

J	Inglis, GJ				Inglis, GJ			Disturbance-related heterogeneity in the seed banks of a marine angiosperm	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Patterns in the distribution of seeds of the marine angiosperm Halodule uninervis were described over spatial scales ranging from a few centimetres to meadows separated by more than 120 km along the north-eastern coast of Queensland, Australia. Separate surveys examined how seed bank densities were related to: (i) the distribution of male and female plants (primary dispersal) and (ii) disturbances caused by turbulent water movement and the foraging of large marine vertebrates. 2 The distribution of seeds was extremely heterogeneous at very small scales of sampling (centimetres to tens of centimetres). Variation in seed abundance within individual meadows (87% of total variation in seed densities) was at least an order of magnitude greater than that among separate intertidal populations (13%). Densities of seeds were greatest in micro-topographic depressions where the overlying vegetation had been removed by directional water currents and the feeding activities of dugongs. Smaller disturbances that did not disrupt the cover of vegetation had no effect on seed abundance. Detailed mapping of the distributions of seeds and male and female reproductive shoots showed only a weak relationship between primary seed production and the seed bank, but revealed a pattern of seed distribution that was consistent with accumulation in linear depressions in the meadow. 3 The seed banks of intertidal sediments exhibit many similarities to those of physically dynamic desert sands. In these unstable environments, seeds are most abundant in sheltered micro-habitats where sediment mobility is impeded. Plants that inhabit desert and marine sands appear to have responded similarly to strong selective pressures on seedling recruitment by developing mechanisms that restrict primary seed dispersal to take advantage of micro-sites provided by established plants.																	0022-0477					FEB	2000	88	1					88	99		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00433.x							WOS:000085946700007						
J	Catovsky, S; Bazzaz, FA				Catovsky, S; Bazzaz, FA			The role of resource interactions and seedling regeneration in maintaining a positive feedback in hemlock stands	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 When a species influences conditions at a site to promote recruitment of conspecifics, the community may remain dominated by that species until the next major disturbance. We examined the occurrence of possible mechanisms for such a positive feedback in one community where it may be important: forests dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). 2 Intact soil divots were collected from a hemlock stand in central Massachusetts, USA, and placed in shade-houses at either 1.5% or 60% full sun. Soil was amended with nitrogen (5 g m(-2) year(-1)), lime (1 kg m(-2) year(-1); to increase soil pH) or left untreated. Emergence, survival and growth of seedlings arising from the soil seed bank were subsequently monitored. 3 Light availability had a very large influence on seedling regeneration dynamics. Birch (Betula spp.) seedlings were most sensitive of all species to light availability, with low light reducing emergence by 43% and substantially decreasing seedling growth (by 99%) and survival (by 94%). In contrast, light treatments had smaller effects on performance of other species [hemlock and white pine (Pinus strobus)]. Birch survival was also increased by nitrogen addition, but only in low light. Liming had only marginal effects on seedling performance. 4 Differential seedling responses to resource availability led to dominance of final seedling communities by hemlock in low light, unamended soils (i.e., under conditions naturally found in hemlock stands), but by birch in high light, as well as in low light, nitrogen-amended soils. 5 Positive feedbacks in hemlock stands are mediated both by availability of light and nitrogen, and by species' life-history strategies.																	0022-0477					FEB	2000	88	1					100	112		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00428.x							WOS:000085946700008

Our objective was to determine if late season fire of varying frequency results in divergent successional patterns in an early successional tallgrass prairie disturbed by grazing and cultivation. Specifically, we evaluated the influence of late-summer fires of varying frequency on community composition and species richness. We collected vegetation and environmental data on two sites burned in the late growing-season at varying frequencies. These communities differed in composition depending primarily on edaphic factors, time since the last burn, and year-to-year variation. We interpret the time effect as related to changes in species composition accompanying plant succession that followed disturbance either from cropping and heavy grazing on the loamy site or heavy grazing on the shallow site. Other unidentified factors also have a role in vegetation dynamics on this prairie. Community composition and species richness were not consistently responsive to frequency of growing-season fires.

J	Alcantara, JM; Rey, PJ; Sanchez-Lafuente, AM; Valera, F				Alcantara, JM; Rey, PJ; Sanchez-Lafuente, AM; Valera, F			Early effects of rodent post-dispersal seed predation on the outcome of the plant-seed disperser interaction	OIKOS												We analysed two potential effects of post-dispersal seed predation on recruitment of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a Mediterranean bird-dispersed tree: (a) the limitation of abundance and distribution of seedlings after dispersal, and (b) the selection of certain seed characteristics of the recruited plants. An observational approach was used to compare seed rain among microhabitats, and how it was affected by seed predation. The relation of microhabitat, scrub density, and seed size with predation risk uas explored by a field experiment. Seed density ranged from 0 seeds/m(2) in open places to 93.2 seeds/m(2) under O. europaea. The overall predation rate was low, as shown in the observational approach (35%). The mean percentage of predation in the experimental approach was 51%, ranging across microhabitats between 28% and 88%. It was higher in dense scrub patches (67%) than in sparse ones (33%), and lower for large seeds (42%) than for medium and small ones (57% and 55%, respectively). Finally, seed density near seed depots did not increase their probability of being detected by rodents or the predation rate. Although predation rates were low, wild olive seeds could be frequently found by rodents due to their spatial ubiquity and local abundance. Together with the efficient foraging strategy of predators (92% of experimental seed depots a ere found), this allowed a widespread post-dispersal predation, but it did not modify the relative distribution of seeds among microhabitats. Thus? in our study, the seed dispersal pattern of the wild olive tree was not reshaped by post-dispersal predation. because (1) rodents did not alter significantly its initial spatial distribution and (2) mice did not seem to limit the number of recruits. Finally, our results indicate that, as a consequence of seed size preferences of rodents, large seeds have a higher probability to survive post-dispersal predation. Thus. seed size may be a key trait to determine the identity of the future recruits in the wild olive tree, ai least affecting the characteristics of the seeds that reach the soil seed bank.

J	Middleton, B				Middleton, B			Hydrochory, seed banks, and regeneration dynamics along the landscape boundaries of a forested wetland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Following the environmental sieve concept, the setting in which the recruitment of Taxodium distichum occurs in, becomes increasingly restrictive from the seed to seedling stage in an impounded forested wetland. Although a wide elevational band of dispersing seed moves across the boundary of a swamp-field in the water sheet, the zone of germination is relegated to that portion of the forested wetland that draws down during the growing season. Seedling recruitment is further restricted to the uppermost zone of the winter water sheet. These patterns are likely applicable to other species of dominant swamp species, e.g., Cephalanthus occidentalis crossed the boundary of a forested wetland and abandonded field in winter flooding (November-December and November-March, respectively) in Buttonland Swamp. The elevation of the boundary was 101.3 m NGVD. While the seeds of at least 40 swamp species were dispersed across the boundary, few viable seeds were dispersed after the winter season. Kriged maps showed seeds of T. distichum and C. occidentalis dispersed in patches in the water depending on the position of the water sheet. Most species of both water- and gravity-dispersed species had a localized pattern of seed distribution (either spherical or exponential) and this indicated that seeds may not be dispersed for great distances in the swamp. Water-dispersed T. distichum and C. occidentalis had larger dispersal ranges (A(0)=225 and 195 m, respectively) than Bidens frondosa and B. discoidea (A(0)=14 and 16 m, respectively). Seed dispersal varied with season depending on the availability of seeds. In Buttonland Swamp, viable seeds typically were dispersed for T. distichum in November-June, and for C. occidentalis in November-July. Low water occurred in August 1993 and high in February 1994 (99.8 and 101.6 m NGVD, respectively). The seed banks along the landscape boundary varied in species composition according to elevation (r(2)=0.996). While the similarity of species richness between water-dispersed seeds and the seed bank at elevations that flooded (during June 1993 through May 1995) was high (10-17%), it was low between water-dispersed seeds and the seed bank at elevations that did not flood (5%). T. distichum seeds had a short germination window in that seeds germinated within a year following their production in zones that were flooded in the winter followed by drawdown during the next growing season. After 1 year, less than 5% of the T. distichum seeds remained viable on the surface of the soil. Germination of T. distichum was confined to specific elevations (above 99.3 but below 101.6 m NGVD) during this study with 4.1% of the seedlings surviving for more than 2 years at a mean of 101.4 m NGVD. All seedlings below this elevation died. To maximize natural regeneration along the boundaries of swamps in abandoned farm fields targeted for restoration, this study suggests a flood pulse regime consisting of high water in the winter to maximize dispersal of live seeds followed by low water in the summer to facilitate seed germination and seedling recruitment. Hydrologic restoration could assist in the natural recovery of damaged wetlands if a seed source exists nearby.																	1385-0237					FEB	2000	146	2					169	184									WOS:000085308000005						
J	Menges, ES				Menges, ES			Population viability analyses in plants: challenges and opportunities	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												This review of 95 plant population viability analyses (PVAs) reveals that most studies consider one species, only a few populations and are based on data collected for less than five years. Only five studies referred to themselves as PVAs. Plants offer numerous challenges, such as seed banks and periodic recruitment, but these can be answered with suitable data collection and modeling. New approaches, such as metapopulation models, inclusion of disturbance cycles, and integration of genetics and demography, are producing more realistic PVAs, Although exact solutions are fraught with limitations, plant PVAs can be useful in comparing management regimes, populations and microhabitats, and in using these results to guide conservation and management.																	0169-5347					FEB	2000	15	2					51	56		10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01763-2							WOS:000085525200007	10652555					
J	Hamze, SI; Jolls, CL				Hamze, SI; Jolls, CL			Germination ecology of a federally threatened endemic thistle, Cirsium pitcheri, of the Great Lakes	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Pitcher's thistle ( Cirsium pitchen) is a federally listed monocarpic plant species endemic to the shoreline dunes of Lakes Huron, Michigan and Superior. Individual plants may require 4-8 y to mature, after which they flower and die. This life history and the lack of vegetative modes of reproduction make an understanding of seed and seedling ecology critical for preservation and restoration of Pitcher's thistle. We report conditions necessary to overcome seed dormancy and the effects of light, seed mass and depth of burial (0, 2, 4 or 8 cm) on seed and seedling success from laboratory experiments in controlled growth environments. Seeds of Pitcher's thistle are dormant when dispersed, but a combination of low temperatures and afterripening can break dormancy. Germination over 30% was obtained with at least 24 wk of low temperature moist stratification: 25% germination occurred after 6 mo of storage at room temperatures. Light suppressed germination of nondormant seeds. Although burial is required for germination, only 8% of seedlings emerged from a depth of 8 cm, associated with longer time to emergence. Achenes of this taxon lack endosperm: seedlings probably lack the reserves to overcome excessive burial. Logistic regression was used to compare the relative effects of the presence or absence of light, burial depth, seed mass and differences between rn populations from Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas. All three variables were significant predictors of germination and emergence when tested alone. Seeds from the upper peninsula were more likely to germinate, provided they were buried, although their probability of emergence decreased at greater burial depths. Although seeds ft um the upper peninsula were significantly heavier on average than those from lower peninsula populations,ns, seed source was an even better predictor of seed and seedling success than seed mass. This suggests genetic differences among populations even within this geographically restricted endemic. Seeds of Pitcher's thistle can remain viable 1-2 y in the laboratory, suggesting this species can maintain a seed bank, although it is ephemeral. Seeds and seedlings of Cirsium pitcheri successfully exploit die dynamic nature of their dune habitats. Our results suggest that conservation efforts must consider seed storage conditions, generic source of seeds and seed size, as well as maintenance of natural sand erosion and accretion regimes for preservation and restoration of this taxon.																	0003-0031					JAN	2000	143	1					141	153		10.1674/0003-0031(2000)143[0141:GEOAFT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000084690600011

Total number of seedlings that emerged from the surface (0-5 cm deep) soil samples was significantly smaller in the farthest site (5.9 km, 939 seedlings m(-2)) as compared with sites situated 2.1 or 3.2 km (2 882 and 3 687 seedlings m(-2), respectively) from the pollution source. The most common taxa in the seed banks were Calluna vulgaris and Betula spp. Only 18%-31% of the spermatophyte species were common to both seed bank and vegetation. The monodominance of Calluna was smallest, and the number of emergent seedlings of other mire species was highest in the farthest site. The high numbers of emergent seedlings show that seeds of some species can persist viable in the soil in polluted bogs.

J	Farnsworth, E				Farnsworth, E			The ecology and physiology of viviparous and recalcitrant seeds	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS												Understanding seed physiology is central to reconstructing how angiosperms have evolved, to characterizing dormancy and germination regimes shared by suites of species, and to devising sound strategies for seed bank conservation, agriculture, and forestry. While species with dormant seeds have received the lion's share of attention, hundreds of plant species exhibit no seed dormancy and germinate either viviparously on the parent plant or shortly after release. Embryos of these recalcitrant and viviparous species cannot tolerate the maturation drying that is usually prerequisite to dormancy; such desiccation intolerance creates challenges for storing and preserving such embryos. I review the physiology, morphology, and ecology of these desiccation-intolerant, nondormant lineages. Differences in the production and function of plant hormones are implicated in the occurrence of recalcitrance and vivipary in plant families. Plant hormones are key regulators of seed physiology and simultaneously coordinate responses of the seedling and mature plant to their environment. Desiccation-intolerant embryos occur most commonly among species of wet or flooded environments and have evolved multiple times in disparate lineages. Natural selection in wetland environments simply may not eliminate these seed types or may select for changes in hormone physiology that simultaneously affect both maternal and embryonic tissues. integrative data from ecological, genetic, and physiological studies are needed to elucidate evolutionary origins and maintenance of reproductive strategies in organisms.																	0066-4162						2000	31						107	138		10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.107							WOS:000166011500006						
J	McCaughey, TL; Stephenson, GR				McCaughey, TL; Stephenson, GR			Time from flowering to seed viability in purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)	AQUATIC BOTANY												L. salicaria is a troublesome invasive species in eastern North America. Control methods being considered include use of herbicides, phytophagous insects and cutting. More effective use of these methods, separately or as an integrated program, requires better knowledge of seed viability for this plant which is a prolific seed producer. Infloresences of L. salicaria were collected from an infestation over one growing season. Ten inflorescences were collected on each sampling date; five of which were examined while they were fresh and five were allowed to desiccate in a greenhouse under ambiant conditions. Germination tests were performed on seeds from both fresh and dried inflorescences. From 12 days after anthesis (DAA) up to and including 24 DAA, there were no seeds that were germinable on either the fresh or dried inflorescences. At 27 DAA, germinable seed was first found in the lower 20 nodes of the freshly cut inflorescences. Above node 20, the inflorescence was in bloom but the seed capsules were immature. From 27 DAA on, percent germination from most of the nodes up the stem increased with time. This same pattern was observed in the seeds from the dried inflorescences. Germinable seed was first detected 27 DAA on the dried inflorescences in the lower 10 nodes. As the inflorescences expanded, the upper nodes matured and germination was not significantly different between the fresh and dried inflorescences. Desiccation of the cut stems of L. salicaria did not affect the germinability of the seeds. There was no evidence of further maturation and greater seed viability on the dried stems as compared to the germinability of seeds from freshly cut stems. This indicates that cutting or chemical defoliation of L. salicaria within 3 weeks of anthesis should destroy the seed crop and prevent additions to the seed bank. (C)2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												A mixture of 3 subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) cultivars (cvv. Goulburn, Seaton Park, and Dalkeith) was grown with 5-40 plants/m(2) of phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.) or lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) for 3 years at Wagga Wagga, NSW (147 degrees 21'E, 35 degrees 03'S). Clover seed yield was assessed each year, the number of regenerating clover seedlings was counted, herbage yield of clover and the perennials was measured, and the change in perennial density recorded. The influence of perennials on water availability in spring and light during clover seed set was also examined. The impact of perennial density on clover was assessed using regression analyses. In each of the 3 years, subterranean clover seed yield was negatively related to perennial density, but phalaris suppressed clover seed yield more than equivalent densities of lucerne in 2 of the years. Clover seed yield was positively related (R-2 = 0.30-0.85) to clover biomass in spring in all 3 years (except for subterranean clover in phalaris in 1994) and to the proportion of total photosynthetically active radiation reaching the clover canopy beneath the perennial (R-2 = 0.33-0.83) in 2 of the 3 years. There was a positive relationship between clover seedling regeneration in autumn and size of the summer seed bank in both years in lucerne (R-2 = 0.40-0.76) and in 1 year in phalaris (R-2 = 0.76) and a negative association between perennial density and clover seedling regeneration. The rate at which the surface profile (0-37 cm) dried in spring was independent of phalaris and lucerne density over the 3 years and did not differ from that of pure clover. The late season clover cultivar, Goulburn, constituted between 57% and 79% of the seed bank following seed set, substantially more than the earlier flowering cultivars, Seaton Park and Dalkeith. Neither perennial density nor species changed the relative competitiveness of the 3 cultivars. The high seed yield of Goulburn and the lack of a perennial-induced change in surface soil water in spring suggest that growing perennials in association with subterranean clover does not increase the level of moisture stress during clover seed set. The good performance of Goulburn is attributed to superior competitive ability for light in late spring. The basal area occupied by lucerne and phalaris increased with perennial density in each of the first 2 years. However, in the third year, phalaris basal area was similar at all densities. The findings suggest that sowing low densities of lucerne should assist in promoting seed yield and regeneration of subterranean clover. Management of phalaris, which has the capacity to substantially increase plant size at low densities, may require additional strategies such as more frequent grazing in spring.																	0004-9409						2000	51	2					267	278		10.1071/AR99054							WOS:000085247700011						
J	Ellery, AJ; Chapman, R				Ellery, AJ; Chapman, R			Embryo and seed coat factors produce seed dormancy in capeweed (Arctotheca calendula)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Capeweed [Arctotheca calendula (L.) Levyns.] is common in annual pastures of southern Australia. The physiological basis of seed dormancy in capeweed seeds was studied to determine the likely role of dormancy in the success of this species. Two dormancy mechanisms were identified: one embryo-based and the other imposed on the embryo by the seed coat. Embryo dormancy could be overcome by leaching, suggesting that this form of dormancy was caused by a water-soluble germination inhibitor, possibly localised in the cotyledons. Following an initial after-ripening period, embryo dormancy was rapidly relieved under conditions experienced on the soil surface during summer. Ungerminated embryos entered secondary dormancy in winter. Seed coat-imposed dormancy persisted longer than primary embryo dormancy, but was not associated with mechanical constriction of embryo growth, or with limited water or oxygen supply to the embryo. Embryo and seed coat dormancy mechanisms interacted to maintain a high level of dormancy in these seeds at all times. Thus, a large proportion of seeds produced might enter a persistent seed bank, enabling re-establishment following years when seed production is limited by unfavourable seasonal conditions or cropping activities.																	0004-9409						2000	51	7					849	854		10.1071/AR00050							WOS:000089277500007						
J	Clarke, PJ; Davison, EA; Fulloon, L				Clarke, PJ; Davison, EA; Fulloon, L			Germination and dormancy of grassy woodland and forest species: effects of smoke, heat, darkness and cold	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The germination requirements of a broad spectrum of common species found in grassy woodlands and forests in the New England region of northern New South Wales were tested in a series of replicated growth-cabinet experiments. The effects of dark/diurnal light and smoke/no smoke were measured on 65 species in an orthogonal experiment, 21 of which were retested after storage for 12 months. The effect of storage for several years was also assessed under a diurnal light regime. In addition, the effects of preimbibition heat (80 degreesC), and chilling on germination were also measured. A single temperature regime (15 degreesC night/25 degreesC day) was used in all treatments for comparative purposes. Most species had high viability and germinability under a diurnal light regime. Small shrub species included, however, a large proportion of species with entrenched dormancy. Light enhanced germination of 21 species significantly, whereas dark stimulated germination of only eight species. Heat and cold treatments also stimulated some germination but more often inhibited germination or produced no effect. Smoke stimulated germination, relative to other cues, in only one species (Ajuga australis) and more often inhibited germination or produced no effect. The relationship between variation in germination (stimulation, no effect or inhibition) of species in six growth-form classes was tested by using contingency tables for each treatment. No significant relationship between growth form and the effects of light, smoke or chilling was detected. Preimbibition heat effects were, however, significantly different among growth forms. Subshrubs showed a higher than expected proportion of species with a heat stimuli while herbaceous species showed a higher than expected proportion of species inhibited by preimbibition heat. Germinability generally increased in herbaceous species when stored at ambient temperatures while it remained relatively constant in woody species. Conversely, viability decreased in herbaceous species but remained relatively more constant in woody species. The effects of seed storage and high germinability suggest that most perennial herbaceous species have transient or short-term persistent seed banks. Germinability, with and without cues, was also negatively correlated with increasing seed size and larger growth forms. These traits might be related to the need for woody species, with soil-stored seed banks, to spread establishment risks in an environment where herbaceous competition and herbivory are likely to be important selection factors.

It typically grows in salt marshes at the periphery of shallow lagoons. In this habitat, the water level fluctuates greatly both within and between years. Such fluctuations may induce significant interannual variations in marsh-plant populations. In this study, we experimentally determined the effects of different water availability conditions, imposed at various stages of plant development, on the performance of A. laurentianus. Waterlogging had no significant effect on net carbon assimilation rate, plant growth, and biomass allocation. However, a drought stress at the time of reproductive-bud differentiation had a negative effect on flower-head production. We propose that occasional reproductive failures resulting from late-summer droughts may cause significant interannual fluctuations in the size of A. laurentianus populations, potentially making them more susceptible to local extinction.																	0008-4026					JAN	2000	78	1					40	46		10.1139/b99-158							WOS:000085816400006						
J	Elberling, H				Elberling, H			Spatial pattern of Lesquerella arctica: Effects of seed bank and desiccation cracks	ECOSCIENCE												High Arctic plant communities are often sparsely vegetated, but the opportunities for seedling establishment, provided by the unvegetated ground, are seldom exploited. In order to identify the processes controlling the micro-scale distribution of Lesquerella arctica. a typical High Arctic perennial herb, I related the distribution of seeds, seedlings, and adult plants of L. arctica to the distribution of conspecific individuals and to desiccation cracks. All individuals of L. arctica were mapped within an area of 10 m x 16 m at a polar semi-desert in central Ellesmere Island, Canada, and seed bank samples were collected close to L. arctica plants both along desiccation cracks and randomly. Greenhouse seedling emergence from the seed bank samples gave an estimated minimum seed bank of 187 germinable seeds/m(2) for the upper 1 cm of soil. which is within the range of observed seed bank sizes in similar High Arctic communities. Densities of both seeds and seedlings of L. arctica decreased with distance from adult plants, creating an overall clumped distribution of adult plants. Desiccation cracks contained more L. arctica seeds, seedlings, and adults than would be expected from a random distribution, probably because desiccation cracks acted as seed traps. Consequently, the micro-scale distribution of L. arctica is primarily a result of a varied spatial incorporation of seeds into the seed bank, and the distribution of adult plants directly reflects the distribution of germinable seeds in the seed bank.																	1195-6860						2000	7	1					86	91		10.1080/11956860.2000.11682576							WOS:000087579900013						
J	Webster, KL; Johnson, EA				Webster, KL; Johnson, EA			The importance of regional dynamics in local populations of limber pine (Pinus flexilis)	ECOSCIENCE												Limber pine (Pinus flexilis) populations in the Kananaskis Valley of Alberta have many of the traits of patchy metapopulations based on the reconstruction of the dynamics of 13 local populations. The populations exist in open canopied stands on high stress habitats of rocky ridges, scree slopes, and gravel creek beds. All populations showed continuous recruitment and low mortality. No population showed any evidence of local extinction as a result of negative population growth. Wildfire caused varied responses in the populations from extinction of the local populations to little or no effect. Populations extirpated by fire were quickly recolonized. Seed dispersed by the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) appears to be responsible for this rapid recolonization following wildfire. Limber pine does nor persist in the seed bank for more than two years. Therefore, the Limber pine populations are regionally persistent because rare extinction events (wildfire) are followed by prompt recolonization by seed dispersed by Clark's nutcracker from other local populations.																	1195-6860						2000	7	2					175	182		10.1080/11956860.2000.11682586							WOS:000087610500008						
J	Booth, BD; Larson, DW				Booth, BD; Larson, DW			Constraints on the assembly of cliff communities at the seed bank stage	ECOSCIENCE												Seed banks on cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment, southern Ontario, Canada, were examined and compared to different, but immediately adjacent, communities on plateaus and talus slopes to evaluate the role of the seed bank in controlling the mature vegetation of cliff-face communities. Soil samples were collected five times at two sites over three years. Data were analyzed three ways: multiple discriminant analysis on community composition, univariate ANOVAs of seed density data, and analysis of seed characteristics. The emergence of constraints on final plant community structure was dearest for the discriminant analysis: year of collection separated the seed bank centroids the mast, but a secondary effect we observed was the clear separation of the three community types and their association with species found in their specific mature communities. ANOVAs and the analyses of seed characteristics did not show statistically significant community-related sorting. Although the cliff-face community structure was discriminated at the seed bank stage, it was not directly correlated with the above-ground vegetation; therefore subsequent processes such as seed germination and seedling survivorship must also be responsible for final community composition.																	1195-6860						2000	7	3					326	335		10.1080/11956860.2000.11682602							WOS:000088908900009						
J	Booth, BD; Larson, DW				Booth, BD; Larson, DW			Constraints on the assembly of cliff communities at the seedling stage	ECOSCIENCE												Seedling establishment of woody species was examined to determine whether this stage was an important filter, removing species from the pool of potential colonists on cliff faces. Earlier studies had already explored the roles of seed rain and seed bank as regulators of community structure. In this study, newly germinated seeds of seven tree species were planted in crevices and on ledges of natural cliff faces and were censused regularly for three years. When harvested, seedling roots and shoots were measured and dry weights taken. The study was also repeated on artificial cliffs constructed of limestone blocks in order to observe rooting characteristics. On the natural cliffs, Thuja occidentalis generally survived better than Pinus strobus, Picea glauca, Larix laricina, Betula papyrifera and B. alleghaniensis. The latter two were not planted until the second year of the experiment and survived into their second year. These results were similar to those in the artificial cliff experiments. There were several root and shoot characteristics and biomass allocation patterns that were associated with Thuja. Seedlings were shorter and had extensive root systems, but their root:shoot ratios were 1:2. They were able to maximize the length of root systems, but minimized biomass allocation to the roots. Seedlings of Betula papyrifera, which are also present occasionally on cliff faces, were also short and with extensive root systems. These results suggest that seedling establishment is an important process determining community composition on cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment, but that the process is protracted over several years. seedlings of many species are able to survive for one year; following this, however, there is a gradual decline in survivorship.																	1195-6860						2000	7	3					336	344		10.1080/11956860.2000.11682603							WOS:000088908900010						
J	Wang, W; Ma, KP				Wang, W; Ma, KP			Acorn demography of Quercus liaotungensis in broad-leaved deciduous forests of Dongling Mountain Region	EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA												Quercus liaotungensis is dominant tree species in warm temperate zone of China. Sexual reproduction may be critical for Quercus liaotungensis population to colonize and regenerate, so acorns in soil seed bank and seed rain were investigated in five broad-leaved deciduous forests (Quercus liaotungensis forest, Betula dahurica forest, Betula platyphylla forest, Quercus liaotungensis coppice, immature Quercus liaotungensis forest) of Dongling Mountain Region. The different layer soil samples were collected to estimate the seed density of soil seed bank and to investigate spatial distribution of seed in soil. In addition, in order to compare the density between seed min and seed on the surface of soil, forty-seven seed traps were randomly set up in Quercus. liaotungensis forest, and quadrat adjacent to each trap were set up. The seed density of seed rain and seed on soil surface was estimated through the seed fallen in the traps and on soil surface respectively The results are as follows: the viable acorn densities are very low in soil seed bank of all the forest sites except in the Quercus liaotungensis forest site. The average depth of scorns distribution in soil ranges from 2.25 cm to 6.50 cm. Not including Quercus liaotungensis forest site, the viable acorns in other four forest sites all deposited in litter layer and 0-3 cm soil layer. The viable scorns produced before current year were not found in soil seed bank. Quercus liaotungensis generally form transient bank. The viable seed density of seed rain is significantly higher than that of viable acorns on the soil surface, indicating that animals remove and cache acorns from the soil surface where acorns originally reach.																	1335-342X						2000	19	1					27	38									WOS:000168969500004						
J	Peroni, N; Martins, PS				Peroni, N; Martins, PS			Influence of shift cultivation dynamics on the creation of diversity of ethnovarieties propagated as clones	INTERCIENCIA												The Atlantic Rainforest is an area of importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Many traditional communities of peasants maintain secular agricultural practices. The relationship between these communities and their environment is of great relevance to the proposition of conservation strategies, because these communities have been interacting with the Rainforest environment through many generations. This paper analyses the influence of agricultural management techniques of shift cultivation on the creation and maintenance of genetic variability of clops at infra and interspecific levels in areas of Atlantic forest in the southern coast of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil We have determined the diversity of crops used by traditional family units, establishing inter actions between the management processes used by the agriculturists and the life history components of their crops. For edible uses, 24 ethnospecies were cited (common names), corresponding to II botanical families and 161 varieties. We also discuss ethnotaxonomical features of cultivated species. The maintenance of diversity and its amplification at the garden level are consequences of the interaction between farmer management and life history components of the crops. Natural dispersion and the establishment of soil seed banks associated to disturbance cycles stimulating colonization are examples of processes involved in the dynamics of diversity amplification.

First, information about the family Cactaceae is discussed, concerning aspects such as distribution and general characteristics. Seed distinctive features are mentioned, such as colour, form, and size. Aspects of seed physiology, such as germination and dormancy, as well as seed dynamics including dispersal, predation, and soil seed bank formation, are included in the discussion. Techniques of propagation and some aspects of longevity and conservation are mentioned. The areas where there is scarce information available are highlighted, and, therefore, are important areas in which to continue research in order to generate data for immediate and future conservation efforts.

J	Tracy, BF; Sanderson, MA				Tracy, BF; Sanderson, MA			Seedbank diversity in grazing lands of the Northeast United States	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the species composition of soil seed banks from 9 farms (36 pastures total) located in the northeast United States. Our objective was to quantify the soil seed bank composition of pastures managed for intensive grazing and hay production. Seeds from pasture soils were allowed to germinate in a greenhouse under natural light conditions. Seedlings were identified as they germinated, and the experiment was concluded after 4 months, Germinable seed was dominated by annual (40%) and perennial (23%) forbs most of which contributed little useful forage for cattle, Perennial grasses (11%), except for bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), were largely absent from the germinable seed bank, while legumes (19%) were more abundant. Seed bank species composition showed little similarity (44%) to the existing vegetation. Exceptions were bluegrass, white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber ex Wiggers). These species were abundant in both the germinable seed bank and existing vegetation on most pastures. Overall, our study suggests that seed banks in these northeast pastures support abundant white clover and bluegrass seed, both of which are important forages for cattle. Soil seed banks, however, will not supply a diverse assemblage of useful forages. If a manager seeks to establish diverse, mixed-species pasture, then re-seeding pastures with desired mixes may be the best option.																	0022-409X					JAN	2000	53	1					114	118		10.2307/4003401							WOS:000088365800017						
J	Yorks, TE; Leopold, DJ; Raynal, DJ				Yorks, TE; Leopold, DJ; Raynal, DJ			Vascular plant propagule banks of six eastern hemlock stands in the Catskill Mountains of New York	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												We estimated species composition and densities of vascular plant propagule banks in six eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands in the Catskill Mountains:of New York. Soil samples were collected and observed in a glasshouse; germinants were identified and removed over a one year period. Yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) seeds, evergreen woodfern (Dryopteris intermedia) spores, and hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) spores germinated in abundance from the propagule banks (means of 722, 2858, and 296 m(-2), respectively) even though hay-scented fern only occurred in the understory of one stand. Seed densities were intermediate and propagule species richness values were low compared to previous studies of northeastern forests. Existing vegetation was also characterized; hemlock was the dominant tree species in all stands (67-87%; of basal area), with lesser abundances of red maple (Acer rubrum), yellow birch and/or American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), red maple, yellow birch, evergreen woodfern, shining clubmoss (Lycopodium lucidulum), and common wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) occurred in understories of most stands. Understory vegetation and propagule banks indicated potential stand replacement by evergreen woodfern and, eventually, yellow birch in the event of a major disturbance leading to hemlock mortality. However, hay-scented fern could become abundant if woody species are over-browsed by while-tailed deer.																	0040-9618					JAN-MAR	2000	127	1					87	93		10.2307/3088750							WOS:000085628500009

Restoration and conservation efforts are underway in some areas of the world, but progress may be limited by the paucity of information on the role of seeds in bed dynamics. Although flowering occurs in most of the 58 seagrass species, seed germination data exist for only 19 of the 42 species that have some period of dormancy, with only 93 published references to field and/or laboratory studies. This review addresses critical issues in conservation and restoration of seagrasses involving seed dormancy (e.g. environmental vs physiological), existence and type of seed bank (transient or persistent), and factors influencing seed germination (e.g, salinity, temperature, light). Results of many earlier published studies relating seed germination to various environmental factors may need re-examination given more recent published data which show a confounding influence of oxygen level on the germination process. We highlight the importance of conducting ecologically meaningful germination studies, including germination experiments conducted in sediments. We also identify questions for future research that may figure prominently in landscape level questions regarding protected marine or estuarine reserves, habitat fragmentation, and restoration.

J	Kost, MA; De Steven, D				Kost, MA; De Steven, D			Plant community responses to prescribed burning in Wisconsin sedge meadows	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												In northern temperate regions, sedge meadows dominated by the tussock-sedge Carex stricta Lam. (Cyperaceae) were historically a fire-maintained community type. In two Wisconsin natural areas (Lulu Lake and Summerton), we assessed the effects of time since prescribed spring burning on plant composition and aboveground biomass in eight sedge meadows representing a partial chronosequence of zero to seven years since burning, plus no burning. We recorded plant species cover in line-intercept transects and measured live biomass and litter in sample plots along transects. Responses were prominent during the first two pears after burning. In the Lulu Lake meadows, live biomass and annual forb cover reached their highest values during the first growing season after burning, whereas cover and frequency of perennial forbs were elevated for two seasons. Plant litter was removed by burning but returned to preburn levels in one to two years. In the Summerton meadows, where seven years had elapsed since the last fire, burned and unburned meadows did not differ in Live biomass, litter, or relative cover of plant life-forms. It appears that periodic burns do not cause major shifts in the relative dominance of sedges and grasses, which are long-lived clonal perennials. However, because litter removal promotes recruitment of shorter-lived forbs, prescribed fire can enhance sedge meadow diversity by allowing plant species with different life histories to temporarily share dominance with the more abundant graminoids. Periodic seed inputs by forbs to the wetland seed bank may be a desirable fire management objective for maintaining sedge meadow diversity.																	0885-8608					JAN	2000	20	1					36	45									WOS:000085019900005						
J	Vinther, E; Hald, AB				Vinther, E; Hald, AB			Restoration of an abandoned species-rich fen-meadow in Denmark: changes in species richness and dynamics of plant groups during 12 years	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A period without management had transformed the vegetation of a species-rich fenmeadow, with no external change in the hydrological regime, into three communities: alder thicket (unmanaged 15 years), tall herb and sedge dominated communities (unmanaged 11 years). Following reintroduction of management (felling of alder thicket, mowing and grazing) the vegetation development was monitored and species cover was measured along a permanent transect before and during 12 years of restoration succession. Management increased the density of fenmeadow species and made the three communities more similar. The appearance of new fen species and the increase in species density followed immediately after the introduction of management. Thereafter, only a few new species appeared and the turnover index stabilised. Management by mowing and grazing both increased species density of herbs and promoted establishment of biennials and hemicryptophytes. Other plant groups responded differently to management: mowing increased total cover, the cover of grasses, and promoted phanerophytes and chamaephytes; grazing reduced the influence of these groups and promoted 'sedge & rush' and geophytes. Restoration was particularly successful in the felled alder thicket, but the success was caused by spreading of species from the pool of species within the site and establishment of species having persistent seed bank, i.e. inherent good potential for restoration. The results are discussed in relation to use of functional plant groups and Ellenberg N- and L-indices as response indicators for monitoring restoration progress.																	0107-055X						2000	20	5					573	584		10.1111/j.1756-1051.2000.tb01608.x							WOS:000169404800010

Roth (Convolvulaceae) seeds	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												The impermeability of the Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth (Convolvulaceae) seed coat may change if the seeds are exposed to different temperatures during the six months of the dry season, i.e. from dispersal to the beginning of the rainy season. The effects on seed coat dormancy of three constant storage temperatures (15 degreesC, 25 degreesC and 35 degreesC), over a six month period were evaluated. 96% of the impermeable newly collected seeds were not affected by storage at 15 degreesC: 97% of these remained hard and only 3% germinated; while seeds stored at 25 degreesC and 35 degreesC had broken seed coat dormancy in nonscarified seeds, increasing germination up to 80% and 95%, respectively. Results show that: a) under the three thermal conditions, seeds maintained their viability during six months, b) seed coat impermeability was preserved at low storage temperature with the potential formation of a seed bank, and c) seed coat dormancy was broken by the high storage temperatures of 25 degreesC and 35 degreesC, and the resulting permeable seeds could germinate in the favorable conditions of the rainy season.																	0031-9457						2000	67						187	194									WOS:000166805500023						
J	Carrera, AL; Sain, CL; Bertiller, MB				Carrera, AL; Sain, CL; Bertiller, MB			Patterns of nitrogen conservation in shrubs and grasses in the Patagonian Monte, Argentina	PLANT AND SOIL												We analysed the main plant strategies to conserve nitrogen in the Patagonian Monte. We hypothesized that the two main plant functional groups (xerophytic evergreen shrubs and mesophytic perennial grasses) display different mechanisms of nitrogen conservation related to their structural and functional characteristics. Evergreen shrubs are deep-rooted species, which develop vegetative and reproductive growth from spring to late summer coupled with high temperatures, independently from water inputs. In contrast, perennial grasses are shallow-rooted species with high leaf turnover, which display vegetative growth from autumn to spring and reproductive activity from mid-spring to early-summer, coupled with precipitation inputs. We selected three evergreen shrubs (Larrea divaricata Cav., Atriplex lampa Gill. ex Moq. and Junellia seriphioides (Gilles and Hook.) Moldenke) and three perennial grasses (Stipa tenuis Phil., S. speciosa Trin. and Rupr. and Poa ligularis Nees ex Steud.), characteristic of undisturbed and disturbed areas of the Patagonian Monte. N concentration in expanded green and senesced leaves was estimated in December 1997 (late spring) and June 1998 (late autumn). Deep-rooted evergreen shrubs displayed small differences in N concentration between green and senesced leaves (low N-resorption efficiency), having high N concentration in senesced leaves (low N-resorption proficiency). Shallow-rooted perennial grasses, conversely, showed high N-resorption efficiency and high N-resorption proficiency (large differences in N concentration between green and senesced leaves and very low N concentration in senesced leaves, respectively). The lack of a strong mechanism of N resorption in evergreen shrubs apparently does not agree with their ability to colonize N-poor soils. These results, however, may be explained by lower N requirements in evergreen shrubs resulting from lower growth rates, lower N concentrations in green leaves, and lower leaf turnover as compared with perennial grasses. Long-lasting N-poor green tissues may, therefore, be considered an efficient mechanism to conserve N in evergreen shrubs in contrast with the mechanism of strong N resorption from transient N-rich tissues displayed by perennial grasses. Evergreen shrubs with low N-resorption efficiency provide a more N-rich substrate, with probably higher capability of N mineralization than that of perennial grasses, which may eventually enhance N fertility and N availability in N-poor soils.																	0032-079X						2000	224	2					185	193		10.1023/A:1004841917272							WOS:000165153600002

We installed three permanent monitoring plots in two areas (total 18.6 ha) at Mt. Trumbull, AZ. Trees were thinned and the sites burned in 1996 and 1997. A 5 ha area was seeded with native shrub, grass and forb species; the remaining 13.6 ha were unseeded. Pretreatment species richness ranged from none to five species per plot. We recorded 13 graminoid and eight shrub species in the seeded area, and four graminoid and four shrub species in the unseeded area. The greatest increase in species richness in both seeded and unseeded plots occurred approximately 1.8 years posttreatment. Perennial native species dominated plant cover by 2.8 years, although annual native forbs dominate the soil seed bank. Perennial grasses are nearly absent from the seed bank. The seeded area had the highest diversity, but it also had twice as many normative species (14 versus 7 in the unseeded plots). By August 1999, maximum species richness reached 51 species on the seeded plot. Of these species, 80 percent were native. Although seeding increases diversity, it may also have the long-term tradeoff of introducing new genotypes and species, both native and nonnative.																							2000		22					67	73									WOS:000174706000010

Today, over 2000 accessions of woody fynbos plants are maintained, as well as over 500 bulbous accessions. The genotypes are maintained as living plants, either in the field or in pots in a nursery. These maintenance methods are costly and fire or drought could totally decimate the collection. Currently, research is focusing on the establishment of a seed genebank maintaining representative samples of the species of floriculture merit. The seed bank material can be used to conserve the species and provide material suitable for disease screening, while the field genebank will maintain superior hybrid genotypes.

Prescribed fire can enhance oak regeneration but few studies have examined the effects of fire on other ecosystem components, including understory vegetation. In 1994, a multi-disciplinary project was initiated to study the use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool in mixed oak ecosystems in southern Ohio. Here, I report on the response of understory vegetation after 3 years of early spring (dormant-season) fires. Each year, from 1995 to 1998, species' frequencies were recorded in 1,728 2m(2) quadrats in four 75 to 100 ha study areas. Each study area included a control, infrequently burned (1X), and frequently burned (3X) unit. In all, 428 vascular plant species were identified. Surface fires have altered the understory environment by greatly reducing the quantity of leaf litter on the forest floor, but light availability has increased only slightly as the tree canopy has remained closed. Several groups of species have responded consistently to fire, including seed bank increasers, tree seedlings, and spring monocots. On control plots, few species have increased or decreased in frequency by more than 5 percent. On 1X plots, 18 species have increased and 5 have decreased; on the 3X plots, 22 species have increased and 18 have decreased in frequency. From 1995 to 1998, species richness (nearly all native species) increased on the burned plots relative to the control plots. This was particularly true at the quadrat level, where richness has decreased slightly on the control plots but increased by 11.4 and 10.4 percent on 1X and 3X plots, respectively. From our research in Ohio and from other studies in the CHR, we conclude that dormant-season prescribed fire may be used to promote oak and pine regeneration while maintaining or increasing the diversity of native understory species.																							2000	274						64	74									WOS:000166733200008

Whilst in situ conservation measures are the priority, ex situ conservation techniques are urgently needed as a back-up and to provide propagating material for investigation and re-introduction. Seed storage is a valuable method of ex situ conservation. There is a lack of information on the seed biology of aquatic plants. Often, flowering and/or fruit development occurs below the water surface and the seeds are never exposed to air drying. Consequently, it has been suggested that seeds of aquatic plants may not tolerate rapid enforced desiccation and would thus be unsuited to long-term storage in seed banks. In this paper, the seed storage physiology of 87 aquatic species is described and discussed. Only six (6.9%) of these species can be described as having recalcitrant seed storage behaviour, three (3.4%) have intermediate seed storage behaviour and a further 13 (14.9%) are unclassified; the remaining 65 species (74.7%) have orthodox seed storage behaviour. These figures suggest that, contrary to the prediction that aquatic plants are likely to have recalcitrant seed storage physiology, the relative proportions of seed physiology types in aquatic plants appears to be closer to those predicted for the world's total spermatophyte flora. Conventional seed banking methodologies would therefore be a reliable method of conserving many aquatic plant species whose existence may become threatened in the future.

A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to determine the effect of smoke on the germination of two arable grass weeds, wild oats (Avena sterilis ssp. ludoviciana L.) and paradoxa grass (Phalaris paradoxa L.), and a rangeland weed, parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.). Both arable weeds were stimulated by a range of smoked water concentrations (5-100%) while the germination of the non-dormant seed of P. hysterophorus was reversibly depressed by moderate concentrations of smoked water (5-10%). In a further experiment with soil seed bank samples collected from five arable and one rangeland site near Brisbane, the soil was treated with aerosol smoke produced from burning native vegetation. The germination of three introduced weed species, molasses grass (Melinus minutiflora Beauv.), green panic (Panicum maximum Jacq.) and common verbena (Verbena officinalis L.) were stimulated by smoke. No other weed or native species was stimulated by the smoke treatment. These observations are discussed in the light that smoke may play an important ecological role in the management and control of introduced weeds in native and arable communities in Australia.																			0-85199-404-0				2000							347	359		10.1079/9780851994048.0347							WOS:000089733500034

An intriguing feature of some species with intermittent germination is that all or most of their seeds in the seed bank have been classed as non-dormant. Despite this, seeds from a population of such species vary in germination response. Factors acting during seed development (temperature, moisture, burial, damage from microorganisms) can influence subsequent germination performance. Developmental (e.g. age of the inflorescence) and positional (within or between inflorescences on the parent plant) effects can also be important. In the seed bank, after dispersal, factors such as depth in the soil, burial under leaf litter, and the orientation on the soil surface can affect the germination responses of individual seeds. A clearer understanding of the combined effects of these factors will enable agriculturalists and others to manipulate the overall germination patterns of seed populations and especially to decrease intermittency.																			0-85199-404-0				2000							363	374		10.1079/9780851994048.0363							WOS:000089733500035

These have varied responses to: (i) post-maturation temperatures and duration to allow afterripening; (ii) amounts of irrigation for germination in winter or summer conditions; and (iii) differences in seedling 'point of no return' and duration of drought tolerance according to ecotype and root length when dehydrated, as in some other annual plant species of the Negev Desert. Seed germination of Plantago coronopus of the Negev was regulated by local desert soils collected, from ten natural locations along the annual average rainfall gradient, from 50 to 325 mm, which affects soil carbon and crust flora and thickness. The afterripening and optimal temperatures for P. coronopus seed germination are affected by post-maturation temperatures, duration, as well. as temperatures and hours of light during wetting. Annual plants in the Negev were found to have different sets of survival strategies of seed dispersal and germination. The genotypic differences and phenotypic plasticity, affected by environmental factors during seed maturation include seed dispersal 'escape' or 'protection' strategies, preventing massive seed collection by seed eaters. The 'opportunistic' or 'cautious' germination strategies reduce the risk to species survival, as only a small part of the large seed bank is 'ready to germinate' after a rain event. The delayed point of no return and seedling drought tolerance may also increase species survival under unpredictable distribution of rain.																			0-85199-404-0				2000							389	399		10.1079/9780851994048.0389							WOS:000089733500037

Weedy foxtail seed behaviour, the physical environment in which this behaviour occurs, and the seed morphology through which transduction of environmental signals to the embryo occurs are reviewed. Seed behaviour is characterized by seed development on the parent plant, afterripening in the soil seed bank, and seed germination and seedling establishment. The soil habitat can stimulate foxtail seed behaviour through the environmental signals of water, temperature and oxygen. The transduction of these signals are communicated through seed structures to the embryo. Notably, water and gas entry into the seed symplast is restricted to the placental pore region at the base of the seed. Water entry via the placental pore is never impeded when unfrozen, but the entry of gas occurs only when it is dissolved in imbibition water. The amount of dissolved gas that enters the seed is a function of temperature, solubility and availability from the soil atmosphere. The possible unifying role that soil oxygen-water availability might play in describing both seed behaviour and biogeographical distribution is discussed.																			0-85199-404-0				2000							411	423		10.1079/9780851994048.0411							WOS:000089733500039

Campsite soils had higher available nitrogen, lower microbial community diversity, and lower seed bank density than undisturbed soils. In the greenhouse, there was no significant difference in plant growth on disturbed versus. undisturbed soils. In the field, seedling establishment patterns did not vary between experimental plots with five different soil treatments (ranging from a control to a compost and inoculum amendment). Addition of seeds and transplants increased seedling density, but not growth. Microclimatic variation may be the overriding limiting factor at this site.																							2000	5	15					216	221									WOS:000165332900024

This included the examination of the number of species and individuals, the phenophases, the reproduction rate and the soil seed bank. The weed communities were compared with the vegetation of other typical crops at the same site. Since sage is cultivated in rows with an intensive mechanical weeding, it could be shown that the diversity of weeds as regards their current vegetation and the soil seed bank is reduced in sage fields. The species structure was found to be shifting towards plants with shorter life cycles, unspecific requirements on the germination temperature and a suitable camouflage among the sage semishrubs. The soil seed bank varies according to whether it is situated in the rows or between them, and it diminishes considerably within the rows. The weed coenosis of camomile fields was found to have many individuals and a rich spectrum of species typical for the site. Species with a germination optimum at lower temperatures, high demands on the light intensity and short life cycles benefit from the camomile culture. To maintain their reproduction, some weeds require a rotation of crops with cereals with a low coverage level and a late harvest.																	0340-8159						2000					S7		91	98									WOS:000086515000011

In the integrated system where conservation tillage is practised an intermediate increase in the soil seed bank and in the number of plants in cereal crops before weed control was observed. Compared with the initial composition (conventional management), after six years the soil seed bank has hardly changed, the increase of the number of plants in the fifth and sixth year is significant. The weed phytomass shows a high negative correlation to the crop yield. Most of the species with an increasing tendency in the integrated system were perennials, possess pappi favourable for wind dispersal or are monocotyledonous. Epilobium ciliatum is the species with the highest rate of increase. Up to now, this neophytic plant from North America is not described to be an important arable weed in Central Europe. In the organic system both the yield of the cultivated crops and the weed density (number of plants, phytomass, seeds in soil) significantly increased. The lack of a negative correlation between the yield and the weeds phytomass suggests that crops and weeds both have profited from the continuous increase of organic matter in the soils. As in the integrated system wind dispersed and perennial species show the highest rates of increase. But here, also all other species with a high constancy became more frequent.

J	Gallagher, RS; Fernandes, ECM; McCallie, EL				Gallagher, RS; Fernandes, ECM; McCallie, EL			Weed management through short-term improved fallows in tropical agroecosystems	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												Weeds in tropical agricultural systems can cause serious economic damage, and their control often requires the commitment of substantial resources in the way of labor, capital, or pesticides. Tropical shifting cultivation systems employ a fallow period to help overcome weed infestations in addition to improving soil productivity and reducing other pest populations. Short-term, intensive fallow systems that employ herbaceous and woody species to facilitate rapid restoration of soil productivity have evolved as an alternative to long-term fallows. Short-term fallows can impact weeds at all growth stages and play a role in the integrated management of weeds and crops. Fallow management that promotes vegetative soil cover may reduce weed recruitment due to attenuation of soil temperature and/or shift in light quality at the soil surface. Residues or litterfall from fallow species may alter the chemical and microbial ecology of the soil to favor losses from the weed seed bank due to germination, loss of seed vigor, or seed decay. In addition, fallow vegetation can influence weed seed predation. Enhancement of soil productivity should increase the vigor of crop growth and enable crops to better compete with weeds. The burning of fallow species residues may result in weed seed death due to extreme temperatures or may induce seed germination by the release of mechanical dormancy or chemical germination cues. Certain weeds may serve as improved fallow species due to their high nutrient scavenging efficiency in low-fertility environments and their ease of establishment. Short-term improved fallows can be an important component of integrated weed management, particularly by promoting the prevention and tolerance of weeds in crops.																	0167-4366					DEC	1999	47	1-3					197	221		10.1023/A:1006271614502							WOS:000084972800012

M.; Backeus, I			Soil seed bank and regeneration potential on eroded hill slopes in the Kondoa Irangi Hills, central Tanzania	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. The soil seed bank of the severely eroded Kondoa Irangi Hills, Tanzania was studied in order to determine the seed density and composition and to establish the relationship between seed bank and standing vegetation. The area had not been grazed for 15 yr prior to the study. A recently grazed area was used for comparison. The seed bank density (at 0 - 5 cm depth) ranged from 344 to 915 8 seeds/m2 in the dry season and 172 to 5107 seeds/m2 in the wet season. The seed bank was very heterogeneous, both spatially and temporally, and it showed significant variation in size and composition in both sampling periods. The species similarity between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation in all plots was low (S Phi rensen's index = 0.000.44). The highest similarity was found in the recently grazed area. The seed bank was dominated by annuals and by early successional species. It is concluded that re-vegetating the hill slopes with woody vegetation by using the seed bank will be difficult because seeds of woody species were not found in the soil.																	1402-2001					DEC	1999	2	2					209	214		10.2307/1478984							WOS:000208472100006

Effects of disturbance caused by traditional Spanish rural land use on the regeneration of Cytisus multiflorus	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. Cytisus multiflorus is a leguminous matorral shrub native to the NW Iberian Peninsula, where it is one of the most important species in the extension of matorral at the expense of set-aside agricultural land. Dehesas have traditionally been used for extensive livestock raising and matorral was periodically burnt, cut or pulled out. The two latter practices are now out of use. However, burning is more frequent than in the past. The effects of fire, cutting, and pulling out of C. multiflorus on its regeneration was studied in order to ascertain whether the presently increasing distribution of the species relates to fire-stimulated regeneration or to the reduction of other traditional practices. Three years after treatment two sets of parameters were determined: 1. Plant origin: seedlings and different ramet types (ramets=resprout clumps), density, weight, and biomass as well as the percentage of resprouting. 2. Seed persistence at various soil depths. The possible mechanisms of breaking dormancy and plant emergence in different years after fire were studied in other experiments. The results suggest that the regeneration mechanism in C. multiflorus is stimulated by fire, but it is not an exclusive relationship. Stimulation occurs also after other disturbances leading to the total elimination of aerial biomass. The present expansion of the species does not appear to result from the abandonment of some traditional practices, such as cutting or pulling out, but from frequent fires (resulting in aerial-biomass elimination).

J	Losvik, MH				Losvik, M. H.			Stimulation of seed germination in an abandoned hay meadow	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. In order to stimulate germination from the soil seed bank in a formerly species-rich hay meadow for conservation purposes, eight gaps were made in each of four habitat types: (1) Dry/open, (2) Dry/shaded, (3) Moist/open and (4) Moist/ shaded; the meadow was abandoned 12 yr before the experiment started. The mean tree cover of the gaps was reduced from 50 % to 22 %. Light was estimated as distance to nearest tree towards south and shade as tree cover. Soil moisture content was estimated from topography and measured from soil samples. There were no significant differences in total herb number between strata before the experiment started. The number of the target group herb indicators of old, traditional management, was however higher in dry, open areas than in shaded areas whether moist or dry. After the treatment, 15 herbs appeared anew in the gaps, nine of these were indicators of traditional management. 80 % of the indicators present after treatment were either new or had increased in frequency in the gaps. More indicators of traditional management appeared in gaps in the open, on dry soils in slopes than in shaded gaps, on moist soils and flat surface. In order to stimulate germination from the seed bank of as many herb indicators of traditional management as possible in abandoned hay meadows of the region, dry, sloping areas, situated as far as possible from large trees towards south and in the open, should be chosen for making gaps for germination.																	1402-2001					DEC	1999	2	2					251	256		10.2307/1478988							WOS:000208472100010						
J	Zahawi, RA; Augspurger, CK				Zahawi, RA; Augspurger, CK			Early plant succession in abandoned pastures in Ecuador	BIOTROPICA												We compared early plant succession in four abandoned pastures of differing age since abandonment and a nearby secondary forest site in northwestern Ecuador. Two "Open" pastures had no tree canopy covering, and two "Guava: pastures had a well-developed canopy cover of Psidium guajava. No sire had been seeded with pasture grasses. All pastures were compared in a chronological sequence; two were monitored For 18 months. Species richness was consistently higher in Guava sites than in Open sites and it continued to increase over time, whereas it remained static in Open sites. Species richness was highest in secondary Forest. Recruitment of tree saplings in Guava: sites was lower than in secondary forest; however, it was nearly absent in Open sires. The seed bank contained predominantly herbaceous species ar all sites, and was highly dissimilar to aboveground vegetation. Dominance-diversity curves for Guava sires showed a more equitable distribution of species thar increased over time. In contrast, dominance-diversity curves for Open sires were static and indicated dominance by a few aggressive species. Soil characteristics among sites were variable; however, a principal components analysis on soils isolated the older Open site from all others. The older Open site had the lowest species richness and was dominated by Baccharis trinervis, an aggressive shrub species. The site appears re be in a state of arrested succession and some form of restorative intervention may be necessary to initiate succession coward a forested condition. Succession in Guava sites appears headed toward secondary forest, whereas it does nor in Open sites.

Physiological dormancy was broken effectively by cold stratification at 1%C, but embryos required temperatures greater than or equal to 15:6%C for growth after physiological dormancy was broken. Gibberellic acid substituted for cold stratification. Breaking of physiological dormancy in seeds exposed to natural temperatures in a greenhouse occurred during winter, and embryo growth and germination occurred in late winter - early spring. Furthermore, seeds in the greenhouse remained viable until the second and third (spring) germination seasons. Thus, T. mirabile seeds have the capacity to form a short-lived persistent soil seed bank. Buried seeds of T. mirabile apparently go through an annual dormancy-nondormancy cycle. Seeds buried in September 1994 were nondormant when exhumed in April 1995 and April 1996 and incubated in light at 25:15%C for 2 weeks, but they were dormant in June 1995 and September 1995. Seeds of T. mirabile have nondeep simple morphophysiogical dormancy. This is the first report of nondeep simple morphophysiological dormancy being broken by cold, and not by warm, stratification.																	0008-4026					DEC	1999	77	12					1769	1776		10.1139/b99-149							WOS:000085568800007						
J	Argaw, M; Teketay, D; Olsson, M				Argaw, M; Teketay, D; Olsson, M			Soil seed flora, germination and regeneration pattern of woody species in an Acacia woodland of the Rift Valley in Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The objectives of this study were to determine the composition, density and spatial distribution of the soil seed bank of woody species, as well as their regeneration pattern in two different land use systems, controlled (ranch) and open grazing, in an Acacia woodland of the Rift Valley in Ethiopia. We also compared the species composition of the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation to find out if differences exist in the soil seed bank and advance regeneration between the two land use systems. The germination requirements of seeds of the woody species were also investigated under laboratory conditions. Acacia senegal, Acacia seyal, Acacia tortilis, Dichrostacys cinerea and Balanites aegyptiaca were encountered in the above-ground vegetation in both systems. Seeds of only A. tortilis (90 +/- 32 seeds m(-2)) from the ranch, and A. senegal (5 +/- 3 seeds m(-2)) and A. tortilis (72 +/- 34 seeds m(-2)) from the open system were found in the soil seed bank along transects with patchy horizontal pattern. The two systems were not significantly different in density of soil seed banks of A. senegal and A. tortilis. Jaccard's similarity index showed that only a few woody species were common in the soil seed flora and above ground vegetation. However, all of the species accumulated seeds (58 +/- 43-331 +/- 130 seeds m(-2)) in/on the soil under the canopy. Very large numbers of seeds of A. tortilis (19382 +/- 9722 seeds m(-2)) and D. cinerea (1278 +/- 494 seeds m(-2)) were also found in barns. Most of the seeds recovered from the soil samples (60-80%) were found in the litter layer. Acid and mechanical scarification improved legume germination (36-99% and 60-99%, respectively) over boiling water (0-48%). Treatment means differed significantly for all the legumes (p < 0.001) but not for Balanites. Height and diameter class distribution of regeneration of A. tortilis and D. cinerea in both systems and A. senegal in the open system had a negative exponential correlation (r(s) = -0.5, -0.25 and -0.86, respectively). A. seyal and B. aegyptiaca showed poor regeneration. Horizontal distribution of advance regeneration of all the species was patchy. Advance regeneration of A. seyal, A. tortilis and B. aegyptiaca were not significantly different, while that of A. senegal and D. cinerea were significantly different between the two systems. Poor representation of species in the soil seed bank along transacts; and in the different height and diameter classes may be attributed to the low density of mature trees as well as the mode and strategy of seed dispersal. Ungulate and wind dispersed species (e.g. A. senegal; A. tortilis and D. cinerera) were highly favoured. Patchiness in the distribution of seeds and advance regeneration was also a result of endozoochory. Dispersal of non-ungulate dispersed seeds (A. senegal, A. seyal and B. aegyptiaca) was restricted to the canopy zone. Piles of seeds of A. tortilis and D. cinerea: that were found in barns were a result of consumption of their pods by cattle. High concentration of seeds in the litter layer may be due to low soil disturbance and larger size of seeds. The height and diameter class distribution of A. senegal (in the open system), A. tortilis and D. cinerea also indicated that the species have good regeneration. Results from the germination tests indicated that seeds of the legumes require pre-sowing treatments to give a rapid, uniform and improved germination. Intervention through artificial regeneration should be employed to improve the density and regeneration capacity of these species with hampered regeneration at both systems.

Hull) subject to different management regimes across Great Britain	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Heather plants were collected from 34 populations in Great Britain, which differed according to their geographical location and associated management histories. Comparisons of differential grazing regimes were made across 10 sites in the first year of study, whereas the influence of differential burning regimes was considered at four sites during the second year. The extent of genetic variation, both within and between the selected heather populations, was examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA fingerprinting methodologies. Initially, high genetic variation within populations obscured differences between populations. Heather stands that were geographically close proved to be genetically similar. Site latitude and longitude were strongly associated with genetic differences between heather populations; however, a range of grazing and burning management treatments had no consistent effect upon genetic diversity. The results represent the first national survey of genetic variation at the DNA level within UK populations of this important heathland species. They provided insights into the genetic structure of heather-dominated heathlands, revealing a lack of clonal dominance within populations, but rather a much more varied genetic makeup than might have been expected given the species' ability to propagate vegetatively. The processes that influence genetic diversity in heather populations are discussed, and the potential role of molecular techniques in heathland conservation is considered.

J	Ferguson, RN; Drake, DR				Ferguson, RN; Drake, DR			Influence of vegetation structure on spatial patterns of seed deposition by birds	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The bird-disseminated species in the seed rain and the soil seed bank were sampled on Mana Island, New Zealand, to assess the importance of communally roosting starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) as seed dispersers. Density and species composition of dispersed seeds were compared between forested sites and grassland, representing potential perch sites and non-perch sites, respectively, to determine the influence of vegetation structure on deposition patterns of bird-dispersed seeds. Mean density of bird dispersed seeds falling in forest was 3742 +/- 914 seeds m(-2) compared with 7.7 +/- 1.0 seeds m(-2) in grassland. This enormous disparity was reflected in the seed bank, with mean densities of 86 852 +/- 16 579 and 883 +/- 189 seeds m(-2) for forest and grassland sites, respectively. Species richness in forest ranged from 3 to 23 species 0.25 m(-2) for the seed rain, and from 1 to 19 species 0.002 m(-2) for the seed bank. Relative abundance of most species differed between the seed rain and seed bank. The seed rain was dominated by native woody species (66.9% relative density of identified species); alien species comprised 26.6%. Native woody species were proportionally less important in the seed bank (51.1%) which was instead characterised by an increased proportion of alien species (45.3%), some of which may have persistent seed banks. The potential role of frugivorous birds in facilitating succession from grassland to native forest may be inhibited by a lack of dispersal of native seeds into grassland areas, and by the longevity of seeds of alien species in the soil.																	0028-825X					DEC	1999	37	4					671	677		10.1080/0028825X.1999.9512661							WOS:000084817700007						
J	Ne'eman, G; Fotheringham, CJ; Keeley, JE				Ne'eman, G; Fotheringham, CJ; Keeley, JE			Patch to landscape patterns in post fire recruitment of a serotinous conifer	PLANT ECOLOGY												Obligate seeding species are highly specialized to fire disturbance and many conifers such as cypress, which are adapted to high intensity stand-replacing fires, have canopy seed banks stored in serotinous cones. Resilience of these trees to fire disturbance is a function of disturbance frequency and one focus of this study was to determine the effect of patch age on postfire recruitment. A second focus was to determine the extent to which fire induced a landscape level change in the location of the forest boundary. Prior to a fire in 1994, a large Cupressus sargentii forest was a mosaic landscape of different aged patches of nearly pure cypress bordered by chaparral. Patches less than 60 years of age were relatively dense with roughly one tree every 1-2 m(2) but older patches had thinned to one tree every 3-15 m(2). Older trees had substantially greater canopy cone crops but the stand level seed bank size was not significantly correlated with stand age. Fire-dependent obligate seeding species are sensitive to fire return interval because of potential changes in the size of seed banks - facing both a potential 'immaturity risk' and a 'senescence risk'. At our site, C. sargentii regeneration was substantial in stands as young as 20 years, suggesting that fire return interval would need to be shorter than this to pose any significant risk. Reduced seedling recruitment in stands nearly 100 years of age may indicate risk from senescence is greater, however, even the lowest density seedling recruitment was many times greater than the density of mature forests - thus this cypress would appear to be resilient to a wide range of fire return intervals. Changes in landscape patterning of forest and chaparral are unlikely except after fire. Factors that inhibit tree establishment within the shrubland, as well as factors that affect shrub establishment within the forest border likely affect the 'permeability' of this ecotone. After the 1994 fire this boundary appeared to be stable in that cypress recruited best within the shadow of burned canopies and cypress were weak invaders of adjacent shrublands.

J	Mathis, MJ; Middleton, BA				Mathis, MJ; Middleton, BA			Simulated herbivory and vegetation dynamics in coal slurry ponds reclaimed as wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The biodiversity of coal slurry ponds can be inhibited, at least in part, by dense stands of Phragmites australis, In this study, we demonstrate that species richness can be increased in coal slurry ponds if the dominant species (P. australis and Typha latifolia) are removed and that underwater herbivory simulated by cutting will kill emergents. The study was conducted in the greenhouse and the field in both flooded and drawndown conditions. Stems of plants of P. australis and T. latifolia were cut in a greenhouse and the cut plants of both species showed a decline in survivorship (25 and 42% survival, respectively) whereas all uncut plants survived. In a reclaimed coal pond at Pyramid State Park, Illinois, neither P, australis nor T. latifolia survived cutting underwater, but all of the uncut plants survived. Regrowth measured as total biomass of stems was less among flooded versus freely drained plants (0.3 and 2.6 g biomass, respectively). Cut versus uncut plants, combining freely drained and flooded, had less below-ground biomass (99.4 and 254.4 g, respectively). In the greenhouse study, oxygen levels in rhizomes subsequent to cutting were measured using an oxygen electrode and millivolt meter. Oxygen levels in P. australis were lower in cut versus uncut plants both in flooded (15.0 vs. 16.3% ambient O-2, respectively) and freely drained conditions (14.5 vs. 15.0%, ambient O-2, respectively). Similar responses to cutting were demonstrated by T. latifolia. In an unreclaimed coal slurry pond with monospecific stands of P. australis, plant species richness increased in cut plots as compared to uncut plots (29 vs. 2 species, respectively) between March and September, 1995. This study demonstrated that species richness can be increased in coal ponds by mechanical cutting and this potentially by herbivory; however, the additional species were mostly exotics.

J	Cavieres, LA; Arroyo, MTK				Cavieres, LA; Arroyo, MTK			Soil seed banks in Phacelia secunda JF Gmelin (Hydrophyllaceae): altitudinal variation in the Andes of central Chile (33 degrees S)	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												It have been proposed that the formation of a seed bank would not be a successful strategy in alpine zones suggesting a tendency to decrease the size of seed bank with elevation. Taking advantage of the wide altitudinal range of Phacelia secunda J.F. Gmelin (Hydrophyllaceae) in central Chile, we study the variation in the size of seed bank that this species forms at several altitudes. The study area was located in the Andes of central Chile (33 degrees S), where P. secunda's seed bank was analyzed at 1600, 2200, 2900 and 3400 masl At each altitude 25 plots of 1 m(2) were demarcated. At each plot adult individuals were counted and a soil sample of 5 cm depth was taken with metallic bores of 7.2 cm diameter. The soil samples were retrieved to a nursery and seed germination was monitored for two months. After this period, ungerminated seeds were separated in a series of sieves of several sizes. The retrieved seeds were subjected to a Tetrazolium test in order to determine their viability. The mean size (+/- 2EE) of the seed bank of P. secunda at several altitudes fluctuated between 19.6 +/- 26.7 seeds /m(2) at 1600 m up to 255.4 +/- 155.9 seeds/m(2) at 2900 m. Against expectation, in P. secunda there was a tendency to form more numerous seed banks with increasing altitude. This tendency would be the result of a selection of this reproductive strategy in the fluctuating environments of higher altitudes.

We plotted seed mass against variance of seed dimensions of 71 herbaceous species and obtained information on their persistence in the soil from a previous experiment on germinable seed banks. We identified a certain seed mass/shape combination beyond which no seed was persistent in the soil, with the exception of the annual Tagetes minuta. Our results confirmed the patterns previously reported for British species: small and compact seeds tend to persist in the soil for a longer time than big and elongated or flattened seeds. We suggest that the value of seed mass and shape as predictors of persistence in the soil can be extended beyond the British flora to herbaceous floras from other humid temperate regions.

J	Keddy, P				Keddy, P			Wetland restoration: The potential for assembly rules in the service of conservation	WETLANDS												One of the pressing problems for applied ecologists is the efficient restoration of structure and function to degraded ecosystems. Where some other conservation activities, such as protection of existing wilderness, continue to require making the best of increasingly bad situations, the goal of restoration raises the pleasing prospect of measurable improvement in landscapes. Restoration simultaneously provides the ultimate test for the discipline of community ecology: ecologists should be able to build an ecosystem in the same way an engineer builds a bridge, with a list of parts connected in specified ways leading to certain reliable outcomes. Failures would reveal that scientists do not adequately understand the system. Practical considerations suggest the application of tools that already exist rather than the invention of new ones. The objective of this paper is to suggest that two valuable tools may already exist, tools that provide an intellectual foundation for restoration ecology. Such a foundation is necessary because there has been a tendency for restoration ecology to represent a haphazard collection of individual cases rather than a well-defined discipline with repeatable methods. One possible scheme for unifying studies of restoration is that provided by assembly rules, where predictions are based upon key environmental factors and the responses of species to those factors. The potential of such assembly rules is introduced using three examples: fish in wetlands, plants in salt marshes, and plants in prairie potholes. I then describe an experiment where a standard species pool of wetland plants was sown into twenty-four different sets of environmental conditions, illustrating how landscapes can select communities out of larger pools. A second possible tool is indicators of ecosystem integrity. These can measure whether a project actually works. Clear discrimination between success and failure can improve restoration procedures by accelerating the evolution of management principles and techniques; Holling has called this process 'adaptive environmental assessment.' I conclude with the optimistic view that restoration already has the tools for continued progress; what is needed is primarily their intelligent application. That is, rather than ending with a typically academic plea for more research, I suggest (for a change) char what is needed is only the discriminating application of procedures and principles that already exist.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	1999	19	4					716	732		10.1007/BF03161780							WOS:000084526200002						
J	Damgaard, C				Damgaard, C			Coevolution of a plant host-pathogen gene-for-gene system in a metapopulation model without cost of resistance or cost of virulence	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												A metapopulation model of a one-locus gene-for-gene system in a giant host and a biotrophic pathogen is described. The model allows subpopulations to go extinct, and, due to characteristic differences in life-history strategies, the plant host is assumed to be recolonized from a seed bank, whereas the pathogen is recolonized by migration. It is shown that variation in the gene-for-gene system can be maintained at a noticeable level without assuming cost of resistance or cost of virulence, if the probability of extinction depends on the host mean fitness in the subpopulation The level of variation in the pathogen population increases with increasing extinction rate, genetic drift and fitness of the infected host, but decreases with increasing migration rate. Generally, these effects are magnified for life cycles in which selection occur before genetic drift and after migration. The metapopulation model generates positive associations between the virulence allele and the resistance allele without assuming cost of resistance or cost of virulence. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Hyatt, LA; Evans, AS; Baskin, CC				Hyatt, LA; Evans, AS; Baskin, CC			Annual dormancy cycles in Lesquerella fendleri (Brassicaceae) seeds stored under both field and laboratory conditions	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Patterns of germination over time were investigated in a short-lived desert perennial species, Lesquerella fendleri (Gray) S. Wats. Field-collected seeds were either buried in the field in cloth bags or stored in a glass jar under laboratory conditions. Regular germination tests were conducted under a range of alternating temperatures (buried seeds) or under differing water regimes (laboratory-stored seeds). Testing revealed Lesquerella fendleri to have an annual dormancy-nondormancy cycle, which was manifest regardless of seed storage conditions, suggesting that cycles may be partially endogenously regulated. Increasing seed germinability in field-stored seeds (maximum of 30% in year 1 and 95% in year 2) leads to the formation of a seed bank for at least 1 year and enhances the possibility of spreading germination events through time. This allows parent plants to maximize fitness in randomly fluctuating environments. The existence of two seedling flushes in the field and single germinability peaks in growth chambers suggests that dormancy cycling may support the formation of a metapopulation with subpopulations which are, although physically intermingled, genetically distinct.																	0008-4026					NOV	1999	77	11					1648	1654									WOS:000085329100012						
J	Weltzin, JF; McPherson, GR				Weltzin, JF; McPherson, GR			Facilitation of conspecific seedling recruitment and shifts in temperate savanna ecotones	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												In contrast to documented increases in woody plant dominance of savannas and grasslands of North America, oak (Quercus L.) savannas that form lower tree lines in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico have been stable over the last several centuries. We sought to identify potential biotic and abiotic constraints on seedling recruitment of Quercus emoryi within the context of potential shifts in lower tree line. We used held surveys to describe seedling distribution at and below lower tree line, and to determine the potential. for acorn dispersal from lower tree line into adjacent grassland. Field and greenhouse experiments were used to test explanatory hypotheses generated by descriptive surveys. Q. emoryi seedlings were located almost exclusively beneath mature, conspecific tree canopies within the woodland and savanna and were absent from adjacent semidesert grassland in 1993 and 1995. Seed bank surveys indicated that acorns were concentrated beneath tree canopies and were dispersed into adjacent grassland in low numbers. Although soil N, C, and P were about two times greater beneath trees than in adjacent grassland, experimental nutrient amendments to subcanopy and grassland soils indicated that soil nutrients did not limit Q. emoryi growth. Reciprocal transfers of subcanopy and grassland soil to subcanopy and grassland microsites indicated that microsite was more important than soil source for seedling growth. Overstory shade was important at all stages of seedling development investigated: the provision of artificial or natural shade increased rates of seedling emergence and subsequent survival as much as 19-fold and increased recruitment rates between 30- and 60-fold. We conclude that rates of Q. emoryi recruitment within grasslands below tree line are relatively low and are constrained by low rates of seed dispersal coupled with a low probability of seedling emergence. In contrast, large numbers of acorns are dispersed directly beneath Q. emoryi trees, where they have a higher probability of emergence than in adjacent grassland. Survival rates of emerged seedlings were low, regardless of landscape position. Thus, observed patterns of seedling distribution on the landscape resulted from interactions between seed dispersal and habitat-specific response of seedlings to environmental variation. Results of this and complementary research suggest that the lower tree line in southern Arizona is stabilized by self-enhancing feedback mechanisms of overstory shade, seed dispersal, and seedling establishment, coupled with strong abiotic constraints beyond the current ecotone. These processes stabilize the woodland-grassland ecotone both spatially and temporally, consistent with Wilson and Agnew's one-sided positive feedback switch. Although this switch would not produce an indefinitely stable vegetation mosaic, upslope or downslope shifts in lower tree line are apparently resistant to decadal or even century-scale climatic perturbation. The observed shift in tree line in the last millennium was less likely the result of slow, spatial progression of autogenic safe sites than the result of episodic and infrequent allogenic processes that simulated or negated the importance of conspecific, biogenic safe sites.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				NOV	1999	69	4					513	534		10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0513:FOCSRA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000083599400006						
J	Acosta, LW; Sabbatini, MR; Fernandez, OA; Burgos, MA				Acosta, LW; Sabbatini, MR; Fernandez, OA; Burgos, MA			Propagule bank and plant emergence of macrophytes in artificial channels of a temperate irrigation area in Argentina	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The irrigation district of the lower valley of Rio Colorado (62 degrees 37' W, 39 degrees 23' S) was examined during 1995 and 1996 to evaluate propagule bank abundance and regeneration in five irrigation and five drainage channel sites. Six 15 cm deep cores from each site were collected in late winter and sectioned into two subsamples. One was sieved to identify taxa and propagule density and the other was placed under controlled laboratory conditions to record emergence over 90 days. Mean propagule density of Potamogeton pectinatus (260 tubers. m(-2), 173 rhizome nodes. m(-2) and 246 seeds. m(-2)) and Zannichellia palustris (968 seeds. m(-2)) was higher in irrigation than in drainage channels. By contrast, higher values in drainage channels were recorded for Ruppia maritima (4352 seeds. m(-2)) and Chara contraria (35633 oospores. m(-2)). Plant emergence in P. pectinatus was independent of channel type. Higher and lower values were registered in irrigation channels for Z. palustris and the other two species, respectively. Plant emergence in relation to propagule density for all the species ranged from 24% to 56%, and no differences were found between irrigation and drainage channels. Results are discussed in relation to the established vegetation and the different management and environmental conditions of both types of channels.																	0018-8158					NOV	1999	415						1	5		10.1023/A:1003808713907							WOS:000085019200001

Grufberg and Erodium cicutarium (L.) L'Herit are very abundant on the rangelands of central semi-arid Argentina, especially. on wet springs. Available information on these species deals with their ecophysiology, demographic response to grazing, nutritive value, etc., but no information within the region has been detected on their seed bank dynamics and dormant status of buried seeds. The main objective of this work was to study the seasonal variation of the seed bank of these species as related to shrub and grazing influence. Dormancy states and viability of buried seeds were also studied. Results indicate that the seed bank is abundant, especially in the case of M. minima, and it seems to be more abundant in the grazed area than in the ungrazed area. The seed bank showed low seasonal variation and shrubs seem to have only minor effects. Two simultaneous dormancy states were detected in both species and all seeds tested for dormancy resulted viable.

J	Jones, TA; Nielson, DC				Jones, TA; Nielson, DC			Intrapopulation genetic variation for seed dormancy in Indian ricegrass	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides [Roem. & Schult.] Barkw. = Oryzopsis hymenoides [Roem. gr Schult.] Ricker = Stipa hymenoides Roem. & Schult.) may buffer its seed banks over time via morphological (lemma and palea) and physiological (seed coat) seed dormancy. However, Indian ricegrass seed dormancy has usually not been examined from a genetic perspective. Because a positive relationship between seed dormancy and seed size has long been noted within Indian ricegrass populations, we wanted to determine if genetic variation for seed dormancy was present among seed morphs. We also wanted to determine if genetic variation for seed dormancy was present in material without polymorphism. The T-593 population from McKinley Co., N.M., has 3 seed morphs produced on genetically distinct plants,'elongate' (2.24 mg/seed), 'globose' (3.00 mg/seed), and 'jumbo' (8.70 mg/seed). Following a 3-week prechill, elongate seed showed higher germination (66%) than globose seed (20%) over 6 tests (pairs of seed lots), while jumbo seed did not germinate without scarification. Jumbo seed had thicker (181 mu g) lemmas than globose (93 mu g) or elongate (52 pg) seed. Individual plants of the nonpolymorphic cultivar, Rimrock, were selected for high or low germination following a 3-week prechill. The spring following seed harvest, germination with prechill was greater for progeny lines of the high-germination selections (45.5%) than low-germination selections (3.8%) with Rimrock intermediate (11.8%). This heritable difference in germination was accompanied by only small differences in lemma and palea thickness and no difference in seed mass. Genetic variation in seed dormancy may be found both between morphs (interpreted as variation for morphological dormancy) and within morphs (interpreted as variation for physiological dormancy). Genetic variation for seed dormancy can be as great within a population as between populations.																	0022-409X					NOV	1999	52	6					646	650		10.2307/4003636							WOS:000083957000015						
J	Haywood, JD				Haywood, JD			Durability of selected mulches, their ability to control weeds, and influence growth of loblolly pine seedlings	NEW FORESTS												Several mulches of natural, synthetic, or blends of natural and synthetic fibers were tested around newly planted loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings on a sheared and windrowed site in central Louisiana, USA. The vegetation was primarily winter annuals, some residual grasses and forbs, and sparse woody regrowth. Study 1 was rotary mowed just prior to planting in March 1992, and 35 mulches and an untreated check were established. In Study 2, 15 mulches and an untreated check were established in a 1-year-old rough in March 1993. In both studies, a single loblolly pine seedling formed each plot established in a randomized complete block design, with 10 blocks as replicates. Each block was planted with a separate open-pollinated loblolly pine family. Nearly all mulches had deteriorated to some extent after three growing seasons. Synthetic mulches were generally more durable than the natural or natural/synthetic mulches. Mulching eliminated the established vegetation and germinants, and vegetation did not readily reestablish following the deterioration of a mulch. The soil seed bank apparently was not sufficient to regenerate areas that were once covered with mulch and many of the natural materials deteriorated into a fibrous cover that acted like a natural litter layer. Both of these residual weed control effects - insufficient soil seed bank and formation of a fibrous cover - were important in stopping vegetation from reestablishing after a mulch had deteriorated. After three growing seasons, the loblolly pine seedlings generally grew better if mulches were used.																	0169-4286					NOV	1999	18	3					263	276		10.1023/A:1006699910149							WOS:000083421400005						
J	Habrouk, A; Retana, J; Espelta, JM				Habrouk, A; Retana, J; Espelta, JM			Role of heat tolerance and cone protection of seeds in the response of three pine species to wildfires	PLANT ECOLOGY												The post-fire regenerative ability of Pinus halepensis, Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris, three of the most important pine species present in the West Mediterranean basin, has been analyzed in the light of seed tolerance to different temperatures and times of exposure, and of seed position during the fire event (seeds inside cones versus free seeds). The combination of different fire intensities and degrees of seed protection allows us to draw different scenarios during the fire event: canopy scenarios (seeds inside cones), surface scenarios (seeds on the ground surface), and soil scenarios (seeds in the top soil layers). There were interspecific differences in the pattern of cone opening under the different heat treatments: cones of P. nigra and P. sylvestris showed similar percentages of opening, but considerably higher than those of P. halepensis. In the three species, seeds inside cones showed higher percentages of germination than those that were free, emphasizing the important role of cones in the protection of pine seeds from high temperatures. The percentage of germination decreased when both the temperature and the time of exposure increased, and there was also a significant species effect: P. halepensis showed higher germination rates than P. nigra, and both were higher than P. sylvestris. The overall scores of seed germination of these three pine species under the conditions tested suggests that their regeneration after fire should come either from the soil bank, or from the canopy bank, but rarely from the ground surface. As the existence of a permanent seed bank in Mediterranean pines is probably limited or nil, pine recruitment after fire appears to be mainly controlled by the existence of a canopy seed bank. The contribution of this canopy bank to the differences in postfire regeneration success of the three pine species is discussed in the light of their seeding phenology and the effects of fire severity on cone opening. The results obtained in this study contribute to explain the successful regeneration of P. halepensis, and the failure of P. nigra and P. sylvestris after fire.

J	Wiles, LJ; Schweizer, EE				Wiles, LJ; Schweizer, EE			The cost of counting and identifying weed seeds and seedlings	WEED SCIENCE												Bioeconomic weed management models help growers achieve appropriate weed management with less herbicide by matching management to the weed population in a held. Growers, however, will not use bioeconomic models unless cost-effective methods to sample their weed populations are identified. Counting and identifying seeds and seedlings is the most time-consuming and costly part of sampling weed populations. The time required for this process was investigated and modeled as a first step in developing sampling plans for growers using WEEDCAM, a bioeconomic model for weed management in Zed mays L. in Colorado. The time required to count and identify seeds or seedlings was recorded for 9,405 soil cores (5 cm in diameter and 10 cm deep) and 9,726 quadrats (18-cm band over 1.52 m of crop row) collected or examined in eight corn fields in eastern Colorado. The time required to count and identify seeds was best described using a log-linear regression with time increasing with the number of seeds and species and the amount of sand in the core. The average cost of determining there are no seeds in a core is $1.07 for a core from a field with 37% sand and $4.32 if the field has 88% sand. The average cost of counting and identifying 36 seeds of four species is $2.70 and $10.88 for cores with 37 and 88% sand, respectively. The time required to count and identify seedlings was best described using a log-linear regression with time increasing with the number of seedlings and species. Classifying seedlings as grass or broadleaf did not improve the model. The average cost of determining that a quadrat is weed-free is $0.02. The average cost of counting and identifying 37 seedlings is $0.05, $0.07, $0.19, and $0.26 per quadrat for 1, 2, 4, and 6 species, respectively. The cost of identifying seeds and seedlings in eastern Colorado Z. mays fields to use WEEDCAM is estimated as $2.71 per core for the seed bank and $0.08 per quadrat for seedlings.																	0043-1745					NOV-DEC	1999	47	6					667	673		10.1017/S0043174500091311							WOS:000085139000008

The effects of the initial spatial pattern of infestation, herbicide, and combine harvesting on seed bank densities and on expected yield losses of the infested crop were studied within a 634 m(2) area. In the absence of herbicide, all seed bank populations were large and typical of values in the literature; those with patchy initial distributions spread quickly over the entire held. The effects of intraspecific competition ensured that even after 10 yr, the average seed bank density from three patterns with the same initial density consistently retained the same rank order: the initially uniform pattern consistently ranked largest; a patchily distributed moderate infestation ranked next; a more patchily distributed heavy infestation ranked least. Expected grain yield losses sometimes exceeded 40%. With the introduction of a herbicide, seed densities declined exponentially but the rank order with regard to spatial pattern remained. Relatively dense patches occasionally persisted for longer than 10 yr. The economic threshold for treatment was achieved within 2 and 5 yr, depending on the infestation pattern, but the model predicted that it would take many more than 10 yr before infestations could be completely eliminated. The effects of harvesting by combine were modeled. In all cases, the speed of the spread of infestation along a row appeared to be largely due to the combine rather than to natural dispersal or other cultivation practices. The proportion of seeds removed by the combine was an important determinant of the number of years required to drive the population below the economic threshold and of the probability of long-term eradication of the weed metapopulation.

Nevertheless, it is important to examine arable weed communities in more extensive cropping systems to increase our knowledge on how arable plant communities are constructed. Plant composition and seed bank of an arable weed community were sampled in an arable wheat field in Vaucluse (south-eastern France) at 1-m intervals along five 25-m perpendicular transects from the herbaceous field boundary. The-results showed that seed bank distribution and plant composition are primarily influenced by distance from the field boundary in the crop edge rather than soil characteristics or wheat density.

(Anacardiaceae)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Soil seed bank dynamics, greenhouse seed germination and field seedling survival were compared in the weakly-clonal shrub Rhus aromatica Ait. and the strongly clonal shrub R glabra L. (Anacardiaceae). Although both species had persistent soil seed banks, their sizes and dynamics differed greatly. The high seed density (5668 +/- 1267 m(-2) to 8739 +/- 3303 m(-2)) in R glabra was depleted by ca, 5% annually and replenished with 1102 +/- 316 to 1828 +/- 486 seeds m(-2), whereas the low seed density (9 +/- 5 to 138 +/- 68 m(-2)) in R aromatica was depleted by ca. 50% annually and replenished with 37 +/- 7 to 69 +/- 18 seeds m-2. Seeds of both species germinated within established populations. However, recruitment from seedlings was successful in It aromatica but not in R glabra, which depended exclusively on root suckering for aboveground population increase. This difference in local recruitment modes between the two species was correlated with differences in soil seed bank dynamics and other life history traits, such as fecundity, seed weight, seed dormancy seed dispersal, seedling establishment and growth form. The results of this study have important implications about life history evolution in that they suggest that various traits related to increasing sexual reproduction in time and space evolved in concert with clonal reproduction in clonal woody species.																	0003-0031					OCT	1999	142	2					266	280		10.1674/0003-0031(1999)142[0266:CSSBDI]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000083027500006

The fundamental premise is that by reintroducing an appropriate combination of native perennial plants, a simplified version of a previously occurring vegetation land ecosystem) could be reinstated that would utilize the sparse and irregular water resources available in an efficient and complementary fashion, while also showing considerable resistance and resilience to moderate livestock grazing. The long-term goal is, on the basis of such a simplified system, to progressively achieve, through additional reintroductions and other manipulations, a state similar to that of the "ecosystem of reference," an example of which is provided in the nearby Bou Hedma National Park. In this paper we report various aspects of the experiment related to germination and establishment of four supposed keystone species (Rhanterium suaveolens, Plantago albicans, Stipa lagascae, and Cenchrus ciliaris) sown infield conditions, and compared to the ecosystem of reference for a number of parameters related to the structure and functioning of the ecosystems under study. Over a 4-year period, distinct changes in the desired direction were observed in the experimental plots, and positive effects of controlled grazing were also recorded.																	0890-3069					OCT-DEC	1999	13	4					357	368		10.1080/089030699263249							WOS:000083148700005						
J	Grundy, AC; Mead, A; Burston, S				Grundy, AC; Mead, A; Burston, S			Modelling the effect of cultivation on seed movement with application to the prediction of weed seedling emergence	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Effective weed control is essential in field vegetables. However, the range of available herbicides has been continually reduced for commercial and toxicological reasons over the last decade. In order to predict the optimum weeding period and to apply alternative control strategies successfully, a realistic estimate is needed of the size, timing and duration of a flush of weed emergence in a crop. The soil weed seed bank is the primary source of future weed populations, and therefore provides a unique resource for predictive management purposes. 2. Models have previously been developed to predict the emergence of weed species from different burial depths and to simulate the vertical movement of weed seeds following seed bed preparation. 3. In this investigation a vertical movement model was extended to include the effects of four cultivation implements on the horizontal displacement of weed seeds. These implements were a rotavator, a spring tine, a spader and a power harrow. 4. The rotavator caused a backward movement of seeds; neither the spring tine nor spader had a significant effect on the horizontal displacement of seeds; whilst the power harrow had the greatest capacity to move seeds forward > 0.5 m in the soil. 5. This investigation combined depth of burial and vertical movement models to simulate the likely outcome of different sequences of spring tine, spader, rotavator and power hat-row on subsequent weed seedling emergence. For example, sequences including multiple passes of a spader increased the numbers of emerged seedlings, whilst for those where the rotavator dominated the sequence, a marked reduction in seedling numbers was predicted. The findings of a series of simulations are viewed in the light of existing methods of weed control based on soil cultivation, for example the stale seed bed technique. 6. The combined model provides the basis for a decision support system to aid the control of weeds. Additionally, it provides a research tool to improve understanding of the dynamics of the weed seed bank and the implications of seed bed preparations for future populations. The combined model has helped to identify areas of weed seed ecology requiring further study, essential for the development of true dynamic models.																	0021-8901					OCT	1999	36	5					663	678		10.1046/j.1365-2664.1999.00438.x							WOS:000083414300004						
J	Kyereh, B; Swaine, MD; Thompson, J				Kyereh, B; Swaine, MD; Thompson, J			Effect of light on the germination of forest trees in Ghana	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Seed germination in light and dark, and responses to irradiance and light quality, were tested in shadehouse experiments for 19 West African tropical forest tree species representing a wide range of ecological types. Germination in forest gaps of different size was tested for 11 species. 2 Percentage germination was reduced in the dark only for three small-seeded species that are common in forest soil seed banks: Musanga cecropioides, Nauclea diderrichii and Milicia excelsa. Percentage germination of the other 16 species, including four widely regarded as 'pioneers', was unaffected. 3 Effects of different irradiances in shadehouses, where the seeds were watered, were significant for some species, but there was no consistent pattern. Irradiance effects in forest gaps, where the seeds received only natural wet season rainfall, were more widespread and substantial, and were most commonly shown as a depression of percentage germination at high irradiance. 4 Effects of light quality (neutral vs. green shade;red:far-red = 0.43)were insignificant at 5% irradiance in shadehouses for all species except Nauclea diderrichii. In growth chamber experiments, the low energy response was only evident at 1.0 pmol m(-2) s(-1) (< 1% of unshaded forest irradiance) in Musanga and Nauclea. 5 The speed of germination was affected by irradiance in many species, but the effect was small compared. with differences between species, in which time to complete germination varied between 3 weeks and over 6 months. 6 Seeds of Ceiba pentandra and Pericopsis elata planted in deep forest shade (2% irradiance) and in a small gap (30% irradiance) germinated well in both sites, showed exponential biomass growth in the gap but a linear decline in mean seedling biomass and subsequent. death in deep shade. 7 Light-mediated germination is relatively rare among these forest trees, even among pioneers, so that the working definition of a pioneer should be seen to depend more on a species' ability to survive in forest shade. The effects of canopy opening on seed germination are small except in the largest openings, which severely depress germination in a number of species, including some species with strongly light-demanding seedlings.

J	Kleyer, M				Kleyer, M			Distribution of plant functional types along gradients of disturbance intensity and resource supply in an agricultural landscape	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE					41st Symposium of the International-Association-for-Vegetation-Science	JUL 26-AUG 01, 1998	UPPSALA, SWEDEN	Int Assoc Vegetat Sci				In this study, plant functional types are understood as groups of plants with similar biological traits displaying significant optima or maxima on a gradient plane of resource supply and disturbance intensity. The biological traits refer to expansion, vegetative regeneration, generative reproduction, dispersal and seed bank longevity. 129 Vegetation samples were taken in an agricultural landscape in southwestern Germany, covering a wide range of terrestrial vegetation types - but with the exception of forests and wetlands. For each site, also soil data were recorded. Mean daily soil moisture was estimated with a simple model. Soil moisture, balanced nitrogen supply and available phosphorus were combined into a factor 'resource supply'. In addition, disturbance intensity was estimated for each site. This factor was based on (1) frequency of disturbance, (2) disturbance depth below or above the soil surface, and (3) proportion of the area affected by a discrete disturbance event. 30 plant groups with similar biological characteristics resulted from a cluster analysis, based on a compilation of 19 biological traits for a regional species pool. Logistic regression on a gradient plane of disturbance intensity and resource supply yielded response curves for 28 groups. The dependent variable was defined as the probability of encountering all members of a group in a sample. 17 groups display a significant response curve on the gradient plane. Plants with a potential for long-range dispersal are concentrated on sites with low or high disturbance intensities (e.g. fallow land, fields, lawns). On sites with medium disturbance intensity (e.g, meadows) and low to medium resource supply, small-range dispersal pre dominates. There are no distinct trends concerning seed bank longevity. The potential for vertical and lateral expansion increases with decreasing disturbance intensity. Only at medium disturbance intensities does vertical expansion correlate positively with resource supply. Rapid detachment of daughter individuals occurs more often on productive sites than on less productive sites. Diversity of groups with similar biological traits is highest on sites with medium disturbance intensities.																	1100-9233					OCT	1999	10	5					697	708		10.2307/3237084							WOS:000084056200010						
J	Bekker, RM; Lammerts, EJ; Schutter, A; Grootjans, AP				Bekker, RM; Lammerts, EJ; Schutter, A; Grootjans, AP			Vegetation development in dune slacks: the role of persistent seed banks	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The soil seed bank composition was determined at four sites in the dune slack 'Koegelwieck' on the Dutch Wadden Sea island of Terschelling. At three different sites in the slack, where sod-cutting experiments down to the mineral sand had been carried out, the established vegetation and seed bank were assessed after 5, 9 and 39 yr of undisturbed development, respectively. In addition, a fourth site in the slack was investigated, where vegetation development had proceeded for 80 yr since plant colonization of bare soil and where nowadays a vegetation dominated by Calamagrostis epigejos and Salix repens occurs. Together these four sites can be regarded as a chronosequence of dune slack formation. Clear time sequences were detected in the seed bank data. Many late successional species showed a significant increase in the number of seeds during the succession. Some of the early successional basiphilous pioneer species such as Anagallis minima, Centaurium littorale, Littorella uniflora, Radiola linoides and Samolus valerandi, showed either a decrease during the time of succession or an optimum in the vegetation while remaining present in the seed bank in low but detectable numbers. They could, therefore, play a role in re-establishment of the vegetation after sod-cutting. One of the target species, Schoenus nigricans, established within a few years after removal of the sod. However, no seeds of this species have been detected in the soil below either of the successional stages. Based on the species disappearance from the established vegetation and based on the independent data of Thompson et al. (1997) an estimation of seed longevity could be made for several Red List species of wet dune slacks.

J	Schutz, W; Rave, G				Schutz, W; Rave, G			The effect of cold stratification and light on the seed germination of temperate sedges (Carex) from various habitats and implications for regenerative strategies	PLANT ECOLOGY												The germination responses of 32 temperate Carex species were tested in light and darkness at five constant temperatures and under one fluctuating temperature regime, before and after cold-wet stratification. Using a linear logistic regression model, the probability of germination tested across all species was found to be significantly higher after stratification, in light and at the fluctuating temperature. In addition, the probability increased with temperature. Stratification increased germination in 28 species and had very little or no effect on four species. There was almost no germination in darkness prior to stratification, and the germination in light was considerably higher in all but two species compared with that in darkness. Thus, it can be concluded that the Carex species tested have broadly similar germination response patterns. The fact that Carices can be released from high levels of primary dormancy by low-temperature stratification implies that they are spring germinators. A light requirement after stratification in the major fraction of seeds and the capability of almost all investigated sedges to respond to fluctuating temperatures make it likely that persistent seed banks are formed. Additionally, sedges generally seem to have a high temperature requirement for germination which prevents them from emerging at the very beginning of the growing season. Regeneration by seed is probably largely restricted to gaps resulting from late spring disturbances where buried seeds have an opportunity to germinate and grow. Differences in germination were apparent between species occupying different habitats. Overall germination was significantly higher in wetland species than in dry-site species, probably owing to the greater capability of wetland species to respond to fluctuating temperatures. Differences in germination between forest and open-site species can be attributed to the higher capability of forest sedges to respond to low temperatures and temperature fluctuations. The influence of seed weight on germination was not significant in the 18 species adapted to wet, open habitats. There was, however, a tendency for the germination percentages to be low for large-seeded Carices. The interpretation of habitat differences is difficult due to a positive correlation between seed weight and dry habitats.																	1385-0237					OCT	1999	144	2					215	230		10.1023/A:1009892004730							WOS:000082532500007						
J	Sendtko, A				Sendtko, A			Succession of xerothermic vegetation in abandoned vineyards of the Tokaj region (northeastern Hungary) - studies in phytosociology and population biology	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												The Tokaj region is a traditional wine-growing area with subcontinental climate. The research area includes a wide range of abandoned vineyards with grassland, fringe, shrub and woodland communities. The reconstruction of land-use history reveals six fallen: periods. Sites abandoned between 85 and more than 125 years ago are bearing stands of the Pruno-Quercetum as well as Prunetalia, Geranion, Festucetalia valesiacae and Sedo-Scleranthetalia communities. No longer grazed semi-dry grass lands of the Cirsio-Brachypodion are liable to colonization by fringe species, especially Peucedanum cervaria. Outdoor sowing experiments with this species show establishment rates between 0.9 and 1.5 % with the highest values in microsites with low vegetation and small amounts of litter. On recently abandoned sites Stipa pulcherrima forms extensive stands alter 10 to 15 years, Maximum dispersal distance of marked Sripa diaspores (plumes) was 34 m but 58 % of the diaspores were found within 1 m distance to the mother plant. In seed trap experiments the majority of xerothermic species show even lower dispersal distances. Seed bank studies indicate that few of them form a long-term persistent seed bank. Accumulation of buried seeds already in time of cultivation is therefore unlikely. Colonization of the vineyards by xerothermic species can only take place after abandonment. Although hampered by poor dispersal ability anti short seed viability xerothermic species are successful due to the close interlinkage of newly abandoned vineyards and old sites acting as propagule sources.																	0340-269X					SEP 30	1999	29	3					345	448									WOS:000083115400003

Each year the same plots were treated with 0, 1/3, 2/3 or 3/3 of the 'normal dose of either of two herbicides. The weed species that emerged varied between years and locations, but were unaffected by treatments. The total number of weed plants and the frequency of individual species varied in all fields, but the changes differed greatly between fields, dosages and years. The seed bank was increased by the lowest herbicide dose and unaffected by the higher doses. The percentage of emerged weeds decreased with time, but varied between the fields. The per cent emergence was lower on untreated than on treated plots. The weed abundance in previous years and the size of the seed bank affected the plant number, but the air temperature after sowing was just as important. Even soil temperature in spring prior to tillage influenced weed emergence.																	0906-4710					SEP	1999	49	3					134	142		10.1080/09064719908565560							WOS:000087074700002

Couft.), an actinorhizal nitrogen-fixing shrub, to determine their distribution in the soil and to identify the factors that stimulate them to germinate following removal of the vegetation. Seeds were extracted from the soil of adjacent field and forest sites currently lacking sweet fern in Orono, Maine. Both sites contained approximately 2000 seeds.m(-2) with the greatest concentration at a depth of 60-80 mm. The seeds were 4.0-5.5 mm long, enclosed by a pitted, woody pericarp, and 8% contained embryos. Many seedlings emerged in disturbed plots (vegetation removed and upper soil mixed) in May and June 1997, but none appeared after 24 July. Seeds collected in May and June germinated readily in a growth chamber (30-45% germination) whereas only 2-5% of July- and August-collected seeds germinated indicating induction of secondary dormancy. August-collected seeds showed strong germination after greater than or equal to 15 days of moist chilling at 4 degrees C indicating relief of secondary dormancy by chilling. Temperature fluctuation with on amplitude of 10 degrees C strongly stimulated germination. Presence of annual secondary dormancy cycles and stimulation by strong temperature fluctuation assures that seed-bank seeds germinate under conditions that allow the seedlings to become established.																	0008-4026					SEP	1999	77	9					1378	1386		10.1139/b99-081							WOS:000084866800025						
J	Ohtsuka, T				Ohtsuka, T			Early stages of secondary succession on abandoned cropland in north-east Borneo Island	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												A study on community structure and floristic change in the early stages of the tropical old-field succession in an intensive shifting cultivation area, Sabah, north-east Borneo Island, was conducted in March and September 1997. Dense therophytic communities were established soon after abandonment, and rapidly changed: namely, from Galinsoga parviflora (in approximately 1-2 months) to Crassocephalum crepidioides (in approximately 3-5 months) and further to Conyza sumatrensis (in approximately 1 year). These therophytic communities were replaced by perennial grass and shrub species, such as Imperata cylindrica and Eupatorium odoratum, within 3 years after abandonment. At this stage, a few pioneer tree species such as Trema orientalis made a sparse canopy layer approximately 3-4 m high. The three pioneer annuals have wind-dispersed small seeds. The plant densities of the three annuals did not appear to change between areas fallow for 1 month and 4 months. Almost all of the seedlings of the three annuals might simultaneously have invaded the fallowed field soon after abandonment. The three pioneer annuals take a different amount of time to reach their respective mature sizes. This resulted in the rapid successional changes in the tropical old-field succession. The seed-bank annuals, whose seeds germinate after the winter pre-chilling, occurred in the temperate old-fields as the first-year pioneers under seasonal condition. Intermittent shifting cultivation and tropical conditions without seasonality favour the occurrence of wind-dispersed annuals with a spatially fugitive strategy.				, 大塚俊之/V-6687-2019	, 大塚俊之/0000-0002-9032-7933												0912-3814	1440-1703				SEP	1999	14	3					281	290		10.1046/j.1440-1703.1999.143304.x							WOS:000082489900009						
J	DeSimone, SA; Zedler, PH				DeSimone, SA; Zedler, PH			Shrub seedling recruitment in unburned Californian coastal sage scrub and adjacent grassland	ECOLOGY												Shrub species of southern Californian coastal sage scrub recruit seedlings immediately after fire but also recruit in unburned coastal sage scrub stands and annual grasslands. We examined the influence of natural disturbances other than fire on shrub seedling establishment, especially the role of small-scale disturbance. Our goals were to determine: (1) whether seedling recruitment is associated with gaps in grassland, scrub, and grassland-scrub ecotones; (2) the identity of gap-creating agents; (3) the influences of biotic (vertebrates and ants) and abiotic (late spring moisture) disturbances on seedling establishment; and (4) whether disturbance effects vary spatially, both among and within (gap vs, nongap microsites) the three zones. We censused natural seedlings and vegetation gaps monthly in belt transects for two growing seasons and also measured seed banks at three 16-yr-old sites of adjacent grassland and coastal sage scrub. We initiated factorial experiments at one site to determine effects of animals, gaps, and late spring moisture on seed and seedling numbers. Gap-creating agents varied among the three zones, but seedlings were associated with gaps in each. Animals, especially small mammals, were important in creation and maintenance of gaps. Animal effects varied among but not within zones. Small mammals positively affected seedling recruitment in the grassland (germination on pocket gopher mounds) and negatively affected seed numbers of species with larger and multiple-seeded propagules in the ecotone and scrub; they created and/or maintained gaps in all three zones. Late spring moisture did not play an important role in shrub seedling recruitment in any zone. Because coastal sage shrub seedlings lose transpiring surfaces during drought, they may be less vulnerable than evergreen mediterranean shrubland species to the variability in both annual and seasonal extent of rainfall that is typical of mediterranean climates.																	0012-9658					SEP	1999	80	6					2018	2032		10.2307/176675							WOS:000082408300018						
J	Egan, TP; Ungar, IA				Egan, TP; Ungar, IA			The effects of temperature and seasonal change on the germination of two salt marsh species, Atriplex prostrata and Salicornia europaea, along a salinity gradient	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The purpose of this study was to determine whether seasonal temperature changes interact with salinity concentration to inhibit germination. Flooding of a marsh may also influence the size of the seed bank. Soil cores (6.0 cm diameter x 7.5 cm deep) were collected from four salt marsh zones in Rittman, Ohio. Salt was most concentrated at the innermost zone, which contained almost exclusively Salicornia europaea, and least concentrated at the outermost zone, which contained mainly Hordeum jubatum and Atriplex prostrata. Soil cores were collected during April, June, and October 1996 and were placed in temperature treatments of 5 degrees/15 degrees C, 5/25 degrees C, 15 degrees/25 degrees C, and 25 degrees/35 degrees C (dark/light). Seeds were germinated for 8-10 wk, and the seeds that did not germinate were counted from a 2.2-cm-diameter subsample. Results demonstrated that for both S. europaea and A. prostrata, the total number of seeds that germinated decreased throughout the growing season. The number of ungerminated seeds decreased throughout the year for A. prostrata, but for S, europaea, the number of ungerminated seeds increased from April to June and then decreased from June to October. For both species, the ratio of germinated to total seeds decreased from April to June and increased from June to October. Over the growing season and in all salinity zones, the 5 degrees/25 degrees C temperature treatment was the most stimulatory to seed germination. We suspect that a flooding event in June that killed the standing vegetation may have reduced soil salinity and allowed more seeds than usual to germinate, thus effectively eliminating the S. europaea seed bank. Thus, seed banks play a significant role in these salt marsh habitats by providing a new source of seeds for the establishment of later cohorts after flooding or salt stress eliminates an early cohort of seedlings.																	1058-5893					SEP	1999	160	5					861	867		10.1086/314185							WOS:000083670400007	10506467					
J	Reinhold, K				Reinhold, K			Evolutionary genetics of sex limited traits under fluctuating selection	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Ultimately based on the different gamete size and the resulting sex roles, most animal species have acquired traits that occur only in one of the sexes. For those sex-limited traits the impact of a single selection event is reduced, because the genes coding for these traits also occur unexpressed in the other sex and are therefore partly hidden to selection. All sex-limited traits thus show a storage effect analogous to a seed bank. This storage effect has to be considered when measuring the effect of fluctuating selection on sex-limited traits. Here, I develop appropriate equations to measure the ability of an allele to invade a population when fluctuating selection acts on sex-limited traits. A comparison of the equations for X-chromosomal and autosomal traits gives the following result: the evolution of traits limited to the heterogametic sex should preferentially involve X-chromosomal genes and the evolution of traits limited to the homogametic sex should preferentially involve autosomal genes. This difference between the sexes may contribute to explain (1) the large effect of X-chromosomal genes in causing hybrid sterility in the heterogametic sex and (2) the large effect of X-chromosomal genes on sexually selected traits in heterogametic males.

In a previous study we had found higher rates of local extinction for smaller populations, for species with shorter life cycles, and for species with higher habitat specificity. We compiled information on seed longevity from recent literature. Seed longevity had a highly significant effect on the rate of population extinction. Rates of local extinction were lower for species with seed longevity >5 years (33.8%; 31 species) compared with species with shorter-lived seeds (1-5 years: 60.7%, 46 species; <1 year: 58.5%, 81 species). The integration of seed longevity into our analysis did not change our previous conclusions on the dependence of local extinction rates on habitat specificity and on life form. Species in our data set with higher habitat specificity tended to have shorter-lived seeds than species with lower habitat specificity. Thus, most characteristic species of calcareous grassland do not persist in the seed bank and can not rely on this mechanism as a buffer against local extinction.

J	Lenssen, J; Menting, F; van der Putten, WH; Blom, K				Lenssen, J; Menting, F; van der Putten, WH; Blom, K			Control of plant species richness and zonation of functional groups along a freshwater flooding gradient	OIKOS												We investigated the role of plant interactions in producing the zonation of strong competitors, i.e. clonal dominants, and weak competitors, i.e. interstitials. In addition, it was tested whether the effect of plant interactions on species richness depends on the position on the flooding gradient. During one growing season vegetation canopy was removed at a low elevation, dominated by Phragmites australis and at a high one, dominated by tall forbs, mainly Urtica dioica. The seed bank was examined and in half of the plots seeds of clonal dominants from high elevations and interstitials from low elevations were sown to ensure that seeds of both groups were present at both zones. At both elevations, removal of vegetation canopy resulted in a strong increase of interstitial species, but interstitials from low elevations failed to establish in cleared plots at the tall forb zone. This could not be attributed to the absence of seeds and we concluded that conditions unfavourable for germination, rather than plant interactions determine the zonation of interstitials from the P. australis zone. Many seedlings of tall forb dominants emerged in cleared plots at the low elevation. However, number of seedlings rapidly declined during the first year. Hence, abiotic conditions, most probably flooding, prevented seedling establishment of tall forb dominants at zones dominated by P. australis. Canopy removal increased species richness at the low elevation in the first year only, whereas at the higher elevation species richness in cleared plots remained higher throughout the second year when the canopy was no longer removed. We therefore concluded that species richness of freshwater shorelines is controlled by abiotic factors in the frequently flooded zone and by plant interactions at higher elevations.				van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011	van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442												0030-1299					SEP	1999	86	3					523	534		10.2307/3546656							WOS:000082248200012						
J	Enright, NJ; Goldblum, D				Enright, NJ; Goldblum, D			Demography of a non-sprouting and resprouting Hakea species (Proteaceae) in fire-prone Eucalyptus woodlands of southeastern Australia in relation to stand age, drought and disease	PLANT ECOLOGY												Population size-structures, seed production, canopy seed storage (serotiny), and recruitment were investigated in relation to fire, drought and disease for a pair of co-occurring resprouting and non-sprouting shrub species from the genus Hakea (Proteaceae) in fire-prone Eucalyptus woodlands in western Victoria, Australia. The non-sprouter species, Hakea decurrens, showed faster height growth, higher seed production and higher seed viability than the resprouter, Hakea rostrata. Population size structures in stands up to 24 years since last fire showed no evidence of inter-fire recruitment for either species. Following a fire in 1990 in a mixed species stand 15-20 years old, the estimated number of viable seeds released from canopy-stored seed banks was approximately equal for both species. However, the rate of seedling establishment in the first year was about 10 times higher, and seedling suvivorship over the first 5 years was seven times higher, for the non-sprouter. Seedlings of Hakea decurrens and resprouts of Hakea rostrata began to produce seeds within three years of the last fire, while the few surviving seedlings of Hakea rostrata showed no evidence of reproductive maturity after six years. Inter-fire recruitment was recorded for the non-sprouter, Hakea decurrens, in the oldest stand (burned in 1967) between 24 and 28 years since last fire. This was associated with an increased rate of seed release from serotinous fruits due to the onset of high rates of adult plant mortality. High adult mortality and increased seed release correlated with increasing stand age, the occurrence of severe drought, and the likely presence of Phytophthora cinnamomi, a fungal pathogen which damages the root system, reducing water and nutrient uptake. There were no new recruits for the resprouter Hakea rostrata in this stand, but old plants continued to resprout from basal lignotubers and no mortality was observed. While recruitment of strongly serotinous shrub species is commonly described as being restricted to the immediate post-fire period, the present study illustrates that other events (e.g., senescence, drought, disease) can lead to recruitment of serotinous non-sprouters and may be important in the maintenance of populations during unusually long periods without fire.

J	Ferrandis, P; Herranz, JM; Martinez-Sanchez, JJ				Ferrandis, P; Herranz, JM; Martinez-Sanchez, JJ			Effect of fire on hard-coated Cistaceae seed banks and its influence on techniques for quantifying seed banks	PLANT ECOLOGY												The impact of fire on hard-coated Cistaceae (Halimium ocymoides, Cistus ladanifer, and C. salvifolius) soil seed banks in a Mediterranean 'maquis' shrubland, and its effect on seed germinability were studied. The study also contrasts the effectiveness of two widely used techniques for quantifying seed banks, the seedling emergence and the physical separation methods, in relation to fire. The null hypothesis that a massive enhancement of physically-dormant Cistaceae seed germination by fire would make use of the time-consuming physical separation technique unnecessary was tested. Fire reduced Cistaceae seed banks in the 0-2 cm deep soil layer by both seed fire-consumption and lethal temperatures, revealed by the significant decreasing of the seed bank density and by the increase of apparently-intact but soft-unviable seeds, respectively. In contrast, no damage was recorded in the 2-5 cm soil layer. A dramatic seed bank depletion (> 90%) in both soil layers was recorded one year after fire in the burnt area, coinciding with a significant increase of seedling density confined to the first post-fire year. The ecological consequences of this massive post-fire seed bank input are discussed. A germinability test revealed that germination of surviving Cistaceae seeds was significantly enhanced in all cases except for the C. salvifolious seed bank in the deeper soil layer. However, final germination levels (60-75%) did not correspond to the magnitude of seed bank depletion, especially for C. salvifolious, which suggests that other environmental factors not exclusively associated with fire may also be important in softening Cistaceae seeds. Germination enhancement by fire soil-heating was not high enough to reject the physical separation technique, at least in the deeper soil layer. The simultaneous use of both seedling emergence and physical separation is recommended for reliable seed bank estimates when a physically-dormant hard-seeded component can be expected in the soil, as in many Mediterranean ecosystems, regardless of fire occurrence.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218												1385-0237					SEP	1999	144	1					103	114		10.1023/A:1009816309061							WOS:000082532400008						
J	Ne'eman, G; Izhaki, I				Ne'eman, G; Izhaki, I			The effect of stand age and microhabitat on soil seed banks in Mediterranean Aleppo pine forests after fire	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil samples from three microhabitats (gaps, beneath shrubs and beneath trees) in five stands of various post-fire ages (6-55 years) were collected in an east Mediterranean Aleppo pine Pinus halepensis forest. Total germinable seed bank densities varied between 300 and 1300 seeds per m(2). Herbaceous taxa were the major constituents of the germinable seed bank in gaps, regardless of stand age. Perennials were the major components beneath shrubs in all stands except the youngest stand where herbaceous species were the major components in all microhabitats. Important tree and shrub species (e.g., Pinus halepensis, Quercus calliprinos, Pistacia lentiscus, Phillyrea latifolia) of the mature pine forest were not an important component of the soil seed bank and therefore, little resemblance was observed between the above-ground plant species composition and soil seed bank composition. This is consistent with the fact that these species regenerate by resprouting rather than by germination from the seed bank. Both microhabitats and forest-stands, which were of different ages, contributed to the variation in taxa richness, germinable seed density and diversity among samples. The effect of small-scale spatial heterogeneity (among microhabitats) was much more pronounced. In contrast to other studies, species richness, species diversity, and density of seed banks did not decrease with post-fire age. Moreover, stand age was a poor predictor for these attributes of the soil seed bank in an Aleppo pine forest. The heterogeneity plays an important role in conservation and management of this ecosystem.

J	Morgan, JW				Morgan, JW			Defining grassland fire events and the response of perennial plants to annual fire in temperate grasslands of south-eastern Australia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Many species-rich Themeda triandra grasslands in south-eastern Australia have been burnt annually in summer as a land management practice for decades. The characteristics of annual fires (maximum surface temperatures, maximum soil temperature changes at 10 mm depth, Byram fire intensity and duration of surface heating) were compared to fires that occur less frequently (2, 4 or 7-year inter-fire interval). The impacts of annual summer fires on seed survival, perennial plant dynamics and flowering were also documented at two sites over two years. Annual grassland fires differ principally from other grassland fire types in their duration of surface temperatures above 100 degrees C (i.e., < 1 min versus > 2-3 min in grasslands burnt at 4-7-year intervals). This was correlated to fuel load, but not rate of spread or Byram fire intensity. Maximum surface temperatures were variable within annual fire events (98-458 degrees C ) and did not differ significantly from those observed in other grassland fires. All sites experienced temperatures above 350 degrees C but no site had its soil temperature increase at 10 mm depth by > 10 degrees C during fire. Byram fire intensity was lower in annually burnt sites, but positively correlated with rate of spread moreso than fuel load. Many perennial species (34-55%) and most perennial individuals (70-83%) avoid the annual summer fire event by being dormant at the time of burning. All perennial species regenerated rapidly by vegetative means after fire and seedlings were absent or rare for most species. As a result, turnover of species at the small-scale was low. Annual burning permits high perennial species richness (mean 18 species/0.25 m(2)) and high numbers of individual perennial plants (range 189-1036 plants/0.25 m(2)) to co-exist at the small-scale. Seasonal plant density maxima peaked in spring, 6-8 months after fire, and the number of plants in a species' population each year following fire depended on their seasonal response more than their direct fire response. The direction and magnitude of population change from one year to the next was species and site specific and did not correlate with life form or a plant's ability for vegetative spread. All perennial species have a short secondary juvenile period (i.e., 6-11 months) but relatively few individual plants flower in any one year. Seed that has made its way into the soil is completely protected from the direct effects of fire and hence, occasional post-fire seedling recruitment may be possible for all species. Maintaining annual burning in grasslands as a management regime is unlikely to lead to a decline in richness and plant density in the short-term. Rather, delayed burning (i.e., > 3 year intervals), and the impact that this may have on interval dependent processes such as above-ground competition, are predicted to have more substantial long-term effects on the small-scale dynamic of this community.																	1385-0237					SEP	1999	144	1					127	144		10.1023/A:1009731815511							WOS:000082532400010						
J	Holmes, PM; Richardson, DM				Holmes, PM; Richardson, DM			Protocols for restoration based on recruitment dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem function: Perspectives from South African fynbos	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												South African fynbos ecosystems are under threat from alien plant invasions and transformations to alternative land uses. If large-scale habitat loss and species extinction are to be halted, restoration actions are urgently required. We postulate that by adopting an approach in which an understanding of community and ecosystem dynamics is applied to restoration practices, protocols can be developed which will lead to more efficient restoration. This understanding is based on a review of the relevant ecological literature, focusing on recruitment dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem function, which are particularly relevant to restoration. We develop a conceptual framework for restoration and apply our protocols to a case study area on the Cape Peninsula. Before ecological restoration can begin, the cause of transformation must first be removed or ameliorated. The next step is to ensure that the important ecological processes are functioning. We contend that a fully functioning community requires a good balance of the major growth-form, regeneration, and nutrient acquisition guilds. Fire is the natural disturbance event initiating recruitment in fynbos. It is, therefore, essential to either bunt a site or provide fire-related germination cues in order to stimulate recruitment. Where guilds are under-represented, corrective reintroductions will further improve the long-term resilience of the restored community. Many taxa have persistent soil-stored seed banks, so it is important to conserve topsoil and optimize use of this local species pool. Seed dispersal distances are generally very short, and in highly transformed sites it will be necessary to reintroduce seed of the major guilds in order to restore community structure and functioning. Post-fire succession in fynbos begins with the full complement of species; species gradually die out from the vegetation according to their respective life spans. In order to stimulate germination and promote successful establishment, it is important to sow seed after fire or site clearing in late summer or autumn. Introducing seed or plants at a later stage in the succession is very likely to fail. Because of the localized distributions of many taxa, extreme care must be taken when selecting species for reintroduction if local gene pools are to be conserved.

J	Toh, I; Gillespie, M; Lamb, D				Toh, I; Gillespie, M; Lamb, D			The role of isolated trees in facilitating tree seedling recruitment at a degraded sub-tropical rainforest site	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Successional development at abandoned farmlands in southern Queensland, formerly occupied by sub-tropical rain forest is centred around scattered, isolated trees. Soil seed banks contain few woody plants and most tree species appear to be recruited from seed dispersed into the site by birds or bats. Scattered, low-growing trees <3 m in height act as the initial focus for the activities of seed-dispersing birds, but this process is accelerated by the development of taller trees >6 m in height that act as bird perches. The identity of these trees and whether or not they offer a fruit reward appears to matter less than their structure and suitability as a bird perch. The process of seedling recruitment may be accelerated when two or more trees form a cluster. The proportion of seedlings that survive and grow beyond 150 cm in height appears to be very small. Most of those that do can be classed as secondary rather than primary forest species, even though many primary forest species initially colonize the site. These observations were used to develop guidelines to accelerate the recovery of rainforest at degraded sites. The guidelines promote the early establishment of species that are usually poorly dispersed (e.g., large-fruited species), planted in scattered clumps. The guidelines should be suitable for situations where relatively large areas are in need of rehabilitation.																	1061-2971					SEP	1999	7	3					288	297		10.1046/j.1526-100X.1999.72022.x							WOS:000082633800008						
J	Cavieres, LA				Cavieres, LA			Persistent seed banks: delayed seed germination models and their application to alpine environments	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Seed banks are ecological and evolutionary important for many plant species. Seed banks are classified as transient if seeds germinate in the same year when they are produced, or persistent if a proportion of seeds germinates during the year of production, with some seeds remaining viable at least one year after. Due to harshness of climate, in arctic and alpine environments vegetative reproduction would be more advantageous than sexual reproduction. Moreover, considering the high longevity of species inhabiting this zone, the maintenance of seeds in the soil would not be necessary. However, numerous studies have reported the presence of soil seed banks in many arctic and alpine sites. Most of these works are descriptions on the composition and magnitude of the seed bank; with no distinction between transient and persistent components. Also, in these studies there is no discussion whether seed bank is a reflection of an accumulation of seeds whose persistence is favored by the good soil conditions to maintain viable seeds, or a life history trait that has been selected in alpine environments. Here I review three theoretical models that predict conditions for the evolution of seed dormancy and discuss their application to alpine zones. According to the analyses, the presence of seed dormancy and formation of persistent seed banks could be expected in alpine plant communities as a life history trait selected in those environments. Experimental evidences indicate that alpine species have the seed dormancy mechanisms that enable them to form highly longeve persistent seed bank.

J	Shaffer, PW; Ernst, TL				Shaffer, PW; Ernst, TL			Distribution of soil organic matter in freshwater emergent/open water wetlands in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area	WETLANDS												We measured soil organic matter (SOM) concentrations in a large sample (n = 95) of freshwater emergent and open water wetlands in the Portland, Oregon, USA, area as part of a study of the ecological development of mitigation wetlands. Mean SOM concentrations were higher in naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) than in mitigation wetlands (MWs) at 0-5 cm (SOM = 9.75 and 5.83%, respectively, p = 0.0001) and at 15-20 cm (SOM = 6.85, 4.68%, p = 0.0551). If temporal accumulation of SOM is occurring, it is slow; we found no significant relationship between SOM and wetland age (p = 0.6003) and no significant change in SOM concentration in soils in MWs sampled in 1987 and 1993. Concentrations of SOM were not significantly related to land use but were related to soil series, texture class, and association, and to hydrogeomorphic class. For a subset of wetlands monitored for hydrology, we also found a significant negative relationship between SOM and the extent of inundation by standing water. Mitigation may be leading to direct loss of SOM, probably resulting from soil management practices during project construction. We also show that hydrologic regime significantly affects SOM. Because most projects in our study were built in pre-existing wetlands and have extensive areas of open water, our results suggest that low concentrations of SOM are likely to persist. For SOM and probably for SOM-supported wetland functions, fundamental goals of mitigation and wetland management (in-kind wetland replacement, no-net-loss of structure and function) are not being achieved, at least in the short term. The success of mitigation, in terms of SOM, could be improved by better project design and better management of soils during project construction.																	0277-5212					SEP	1999	19	3					505	516		10.1007/BF03161689							WOS:000082677100004

We examined recovery of tundra vegetation in Alaska, U.S.A., 23 yr after fire and 24 yr after bulldozing. Primary productivity, depth of thaw, and vascular giant diversity were compared between disturbed and undisturbed tundra to determine whether recovery was complete. Productivity, species richness, and diversity did not differ between burned and unburned plots. Depth of thaw, however, remained greater in burned relative to unburned plots. In contrast, depth of thaw was the only characteristic that did not differ between bulldozed and control plots. Productivity and species richness were greater in bulldozed plots, but diversity was less than control plots. The differences between the two disturbances suggest that, ultimately, recovery depends more on the impact of disturbance on vegetation than changes in the abiotic environment. Vegetative propagules persisted in the soil after fire, but not bulldozing. Therefore, recolonization after fire included plants from the seed bank and vegetative propagules. Vegetation on bladed plots was dominated only by seed bank species. Thus, more than two decades after disturbance, recovery of tundra vegetation appeared to be a function of the nature of the disturbance.

J	Maluf, AM				Maluf, AM			Intraspecific competition between Amaranthus hybridus L. and A-viridis L.	PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA												Intraspecific competition trials were carried out for Amaranthus viridis L. and A. hybridus L., the latter species with two distinct biotypes, a green and a purple type. Three independent trials were made, with five different seed densities per pot for each species or biotype. In general terms, seeds that germinated promptly were responsible for the formation of the next generation, these early seedlings being more competitive. The carrying capacity was reached with 20 seeds per pot, no increase in the number of adult plants observed by increasing the seed density. This shows that the environmental suporting capacity, not the size of the seed bank in the soil, regulates the population size. A similar conclusion holds true for dry matter yield. Under competition, the species A. hybridus - green biotype and A. viridis produced larger biomass for reproductive structures (22% to 34%) than A. hybridus - purple biotype (15% to 18%), the former species being therefore better r-strategists than the latter.																	0100-204X					AUG	1999	34	8					1319	1325		10.1590/S0100-204X1999000800001							WOS:000082981100001

J	Hyatt, LA				Hyatt, LA			Differences between seed bank composition and field recruitment in a temperate zone deciduous forest	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Although much is known about variation in both seed bank composition and disturbance effects in temperate deciduous forests, understanding of how these components interact to determine the importance of seed banks to regeneration is limited. To examine the interactive influences of seed bank composition and postdisturbance environment on seed bank recruitment, a seed bank transplant experiment was conducted in a disturbed temperate zone deciduous forest in eastern Pennsylvania. On average, 75% of the seed bank remained ungerminated. This was mainly the result of failed germination by alien species. The postdisturbance environment differed in its influence or the two dominant species, Rubus allegheniensis and Phytolacca americana. Whereas R. allegheniensis recruitment did not differ between postdisturbance environments, significantly more P. americana seedlings emerged under more open conditions. Different proportions of P. americana seeds germinated from the two seed bank sources. These results show that a large portion of the seed bank remains ungerminated under natural disturbances, and the age and history of the component seeds may influence the regenerative function of seed banks in natural ecosystems.																	0003-0031					JUL	1999	142	1					31	38		10.1674/0003-0031(1999)142[0031:DBSBCA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000081350300003

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of reseeding as routinely practiced to revegetate such sites. Three different conditions at the sire were evaluated: (1) an area that had been blades to remove topsoil then reseeded with exotic and native species and fenced to exclude livestock (ungrazed-bladed-reseeded) (2) a control area inside the fence that had not been bladed or reseeded (ungrazed), and (3)for further comparison, an area outside the fence that was undisturbed by the milling and remediation efforts but has received normal grazing pressure (grazed). Each condition was represented by three plots,from which soil samples and transect data were collected. The diversity of species and total number of viable seeds in the seed bank (top 5 cm of soil) were lowest in the ungrazed-bladed-reseeded plots (P < 0.05). These plots also had lower plant cover (15%) than the ungrazed plots (24%) (P < 0.05), comparable to the cover on, grazed plots (11%), even after 10 years of grazing exclusion. We conclude that at this site the results of topsoil removal and replacement were not effectively remediated by reseeding. Although these methods may be effective in moister climates, more intensive efforts to reintroduce vegetation may be required in desert sites such as this.																	0890-3069					JUL-SEP	1999	13	3					253	264		10.1080/089030699263294							WOS:000081940600003						
J	Halpern, CB; Evans, SA; Nielson, S				Halpern, CB; Evans, SA; Nielson, S			Soil seed banks in young, closed-canopy forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington: potential contributions to understory reinitiation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												During early stand development, coniferous forests of the coastal Pacific Northwest commonly pass through a period of dense shade and intense competition during which the abundance and diversity of understory plants decline dramatically. In young, managed forests, silvicultural thinning has been proposed to enhance the structural and floristic diversity of the understory. Although germination of buried seeds is likely to be stimulated by thinning, we know little about the composition of the soil seed bank in these forests. We used the greenhouse emergence method to assess the potential contribution of the seed bank to understory reinitiation in 40- to 60-year-old, closed-canopy forests on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. Seed banks were well developed (610-7009 germinants/m(2)), containing 46 native and exotic species representing a diversity of life forms. However, many common forest understory species were absent; only 11 species were typical understory plants and these comprised < 10% of all germinants. In contrast, 30% of all species and 50% of all germinants were exotic, ruderal forbs. Wind-dispersed annuals and perennials dominated litter samples, whereas ruderal forbs and graminoids with limited dispersal dominated soil samples. Our results suggest that silvicultural thinning will enhance the establishment of ruderal, exotic species but will contribute little to the regeneration from buried seed of the vast majority of forest understory plants.																	0008-4026					JUL	1999	77	7					922	935		10.1139/b99-085							WOS:000084044700003						
J	Abs, C; Fischer, A; Falinski, JB				Abs, C; Fischer, A; Falinski, JB			Vegetation ecology of primeval and managed forests. Comparison of Tilio-Carpinetum-stands in the Bialowieza forest area (Northeastern Poland)	FORSTWISSENSCHAFTLICHES CENTRALBLATT												As the number of representative primeval forest stands in Central Europe is extremely small concrete ideas about their specific features are scarce. The near natural ("primeval") forests of Bialowieza National Park/Northeastern Poland and the surrounding managed stands allow an exemplary study of this subject. The composition of field layer and soil seed bank as well as the structure of the tree and shrub layer were compared between a primeval forest stand within the National Park and a stand in an adjacent managed forest, both belonging to the oak-hornbeam community (Tilio-Carpinetum). The floristic structure of the primeval and managed forests studied is largely identical. Species relying on disturbance are somewhat more frequent in the managed stand; this slight difference, however, does not justify a distinction of phytosociological types. The contrast is more marked in the seed bank, with clearly higher proportions of disturbance indicators in the managed stand. The most pronounced difference between primeval and managed forest is found in stand structure: Individuals are more aggregated, and deadwood is more abundant in the primeval stand. As these features result from relatively short-term processes of mortality and regeneration it is likely that formerly managed forests can re-develop primeval character within reasonable time-spans. Concerning the vegetation and stand structure the aim of forest national parks and natural forest reserves to provide restoration of "primeval forests of tomorrow" seems to be realistic.																	0015-8003					JUL	1999	118	3					181	196									WOS:000081793200005						
J	McCall, RK; Gibson, DJ				McCall, RK; Gibson, DJ			The regeneration potential of a threatened southern Illinois shale barren	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												The soil seedbank of a threatened shale barren community was monitored for one year to determine the regeneration potential of the site following restoration efforts by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Sixty-four soil samples were collected from sixteen 50 m(2) circular plots distributed equally between restored and unrestored sections of the barren. Data were analyzed using a Mann Whitney test and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). A total of 50 taxa were identified from the seedbank. All but four species were native to southern Illinois and fourteen differed significantly between restored and unrestored portions of the barren. The distribution of plots along the first two axes of two detrended correspondence analyses, based upon the seedbank or aboveground vegetation, showed a clear separation of restored and unrestored plots. Soil moisture and overstory canopy coverage appeared to be the two main variables influencing species' distribution along these axes. Comparison of the seedbank with previous site inventories indicated a shift in species composition in the restored portion of the shale barren since restoration began. It is anticipated that, as restoration efforts continue, the site will shift from a mesic to a xeric association of vegetation, such as Schizachyrium scoparium and Vulpia octoflora, representative of barrens communities.																	0040-9618					JUL-SEP	1999	126	3					226	233		10.2307/2997277							WOS:000081667200005						
J	Buhler, DD				Buhler, DD			Weed population responses to weed control practices. I. Seed bank, weed populations, and crop yields	WEED SCIENCE												Weed control practices affected the weed seed content of the soil, weed seedling populations, and corn and soybean yields in two 4-yr field experiments. When the initial weed seed density was high, giant foxtail seed numbers in soil declined rapidly under weed-free conditions. Changes in seed densities when initial densities were low varied over years. Mechanical and chemical control treatments had variable effects on weed seed numbers over the course of the experiment. Weed seed numbers and weed densities were sometimes greater if herbicides were banded, but crop yields were similar to full-rate herbicides in both experiments in all years. When the initial density was low giant foxtail seed numbers in soil increased over the course of the experiment regardless of the weed control treatment. Seed densities of broadleaf species decreased under the same conditions. Also, when initial weed densities were low, weed control and crop yields were less sensitive to weed control practices than at high weed densities. Weather factors that influenced treatment efficacy had a major affect on weed populations and crop yield responses to the weed control treatments over years. The interactions of weed control practices, weed populations, and crop yields were complex, initial weed density and species composition interacted with weed control treatments and weather patterns to generate the results observed.																	0043-1745					JUL-AUG	1999	47	4					416	422		10.1017/S0043174500092018							WOS:000083247500009						
J	Peterson, DE				Peterson, DE			The impact of herbicide-resistant weeds on Kansas agriculture	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Herbicides are important components of weed management programs for most Kansas farmers. Monocropping systems and repeated use of the same or similar herbicides in some areas of the state have resulted in the development of herbicide-resistant weeds. The development of herbicide-resistant weed populations can have an immediate and a long-term effect on the cost, implementation, and effectiveness of weed control programs. In Kansas, resistance to triazine herbicides has been confirmed in kochia (Kochia scoparia), redroot pigweed, common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis), Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), and downy brome (Bromus tectorum) populations, and resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides has been confirmed in kochia, Russian thistle (Salsola kali), common waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), shattercane (Sorghum bicolor), and common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). The frequency and distribution of herbicide resistance varies among species. Producers who experience herbicide resistance problems adjust their weed control program accordingly. Producers that have not encountered an herbicide resistance problem tend to continue with a successful herbicide program until it fails, The recommended management strategies for herbicide-resist ant weed populations include an integrated system of crop rotation, rotation of herbicide modes of action, tank-mixes of herbicides with different modes of action, and cultivation. The greatest direct cost to the producer occurs during the first year of poor weed control. The first response to an herbicide failure often is to reapply the same herbicide that has worked well previously. By the time the producer realizes that the treatment is not going to work, it usually is too late for any other remedial action. Consequently, the farmer experiences reduced crop production from weed competition, high herbicide costs, and a tremendous increase in the seed bank. The increase in seed bank may cost the farmer the most in the long run because the increased weed pressure often requires an intensified control program for several years.																	0890-037X					JUL-SEP	1999	13	3					632	635									WOS:000085867600032						
J	Crowley, G; Garnett, S				Crowley, G; Garnett, S			Seeds of the annual grasses Schizachyrium spp. as a food resource for tropical granivorous birds	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Seed dynamics of the annual tropical grasses Schizachyrium fragile (R. Br.) A. Camus, S. pachyarthron C. Gardner and S. pseudeulalia (Hosok.) S.T. Blake were studied with the aim of documenting fluxes in granivore: food resources. In S. fragile, seed production began in the early dry season, and seed output was primarily influenced by seedling survival. Following seed-fall, there were 651 S. fragile seeds/m(2) (393 kernels/m(2)) and 1014 S. pachyarthron seeds/m(2) (593 kernels/m(2)) across the study area, with a combined kernel biomass of 14.1 x 10(3) g/ha. Seed densities remained stable through the dry season, then declined rapidly after wet season rain. Initial wet season rains of up to 25 mm, 40 mm and 50 mm resulted in seed-bank germination of < 5%, 57%, and 93%, respectively. Some seeds were buried by rain and resurfaced or germinated later, but about 30% was lost. Widespread and abrupt depletion of the seed-bank is likely to occur at the start of about 8% of wet seasons on central Cape York Peninsula, leaving little seed, either for subsequent germination or as food for granivores. Burning early in the dry season, when most seeds were still on the plants, reduced seed densities by 85%. The proportion of seeds with sound kernels was reduced in areas burnt by dry season fires, both directly after the fires and, subsequently, as a result of preferential granivore activity. Areas burnt in the dry season were thus depleted of seed earlier than were unburnt areas. Food availability for granivores should therefore be optimized by fire regimes that include a range of burning histories, including fires in both early dry and early wet seasons as well as keeping other areas unburnt.

The parameters we emphasize are (i) the production of seeds and asexual stems (both of which, we argue, are a function of basal area density), (ii) the dispersal of seeds by wind (or the dispersion of asexual stems) as a function of distance from source, (iii) dormant seed bank capacity, (iv) organic layer depth as a determinant of germinant mortality and asexual bud response, and (v) shade tolerance as a partial arbiter of the density of advanced regeneration. Having identified the gaps in our knowledge, we conclude by suggesting a shea term research agenda whose completion would lead to the parameterized functions that would, constitute the recruitment subroutine in a landscape-scale forest dynamics simulator.																	0045-5067					JUN	1999	29	6					824	839		10.1139/x98-112							WOS:000081365600020

When using the seedling-emergence method to analyse a soil seed bank the greenhouse conditions should match the germination requirements of the species involved. Although the seedling-emergence method is common practice in ecological studies, the germination characteristics of many species are not known, or are only partly known. 2. Before carrying out a large-scale seed-bank study in a wet dune slack, we tested the water requirements of the species in the seed bank,comparing a waterlogged soil with a moist soil. Four species germinated in significantly larger numbers in a waterlogged soil, seven species in a moist soil and 11 species showed no significant difference. When a species was present in low densities, it was often missed using the less appropriate treatment. 3. These results emphasize the need for a preliminary study before carrying out a seed-bank analysis and show the danger of using a 'standard' method to analyse soil samples from different habitats.																	0269-8463					JUN	1999	13	3					428	430		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00329.x							WOS:000081534300016						
J	Strand, JA				Strand, JA			The development of submerged macrophytes in Lake Ringsjon after biomanipulation	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The maximum water depth of submerged vegetation and the number of sites colonized by submerged macrophytes in Lake Ringsjon were studied in 1992, 1993 and 1996, and compared with data from 1947 and 1988, in order to investigate the development of submerged macrophytes after the biomanipulation of the lake (completed 1992). The submerged vegetation has declined considerably since 1947, both in species number and outer water depth. The submerged macrophytes in Lake Ringsjon did not show any clear improvement in outer water depth or number of sites colonized after biomanipulation. The lack of any larger increase in Secchi depth after biomanipulation along with a shortage of suitable habitats (i.e. substrate), waterfowl grazing and species composition of the macrophyte populations are discussed as possible reasons for the poor development of submerged macrophytes in Lake Ringsjon.																	0018-8158					JUN	1999	404						113	121		10.1023/A:1003728730563							WOS:000083700800014						
J	Osman, AE; Salkini, AK; Ghassali, F				Osman, AE; Salkini, AK; Ghassali, F			Productivity and botanical composition of Mediterranean grassland in relation to residual phosphate	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												The effects of residual phosphate (P) fertilizer were monitored for six seasons on Mediterranean grassland. The phosphate fertilizer was originally applied annually at three rates (0, 25 and 60 kg P2O5/ha) for 7 years (1984-1990) to phosphate-deficient grassland at Tel Hadya, northern Syria. The herbage biomass productivity, botanical composition and the seed bank in the soil were monitored for six seasons (1991/92-1996/97). The experiment was grazed at two annual stocking rates (1.1 sheep/ha (low) and 2.3 sheep/ha (high)). The experimental site was typical of native grassland within the cereal zone of west Asia, where cropping is not possible because of shallow, stony soils and steep slopes. Available soil phosphorus in May 1991 was 6.5, 20.8 and 40.1 mg P/kg under the 0, 25 and 60 kg P2O5/ha treatments and 6.6, 13.4 and 14.8 mg P/kg respectively, in May 1997. Yields of both legumes and total herbage (legume+grass+other species) were significantly influenced by the residual phosphate. Legume yields were between 6- and 7-times the control yield in the first two years of the study. This decreased with time but was still in the range of 1.5 to 1.9 times the yield of the control in 1997, six years later. Total herbage yield was consistently higher on the plots previously fertilized with P, which ranged between 1.5- and 2.5-times the control. Both legume seed and grass seeds were significantly larger with residual P, which ranged between 5.4- and 2.0-times the control for the legume and 2.5- and 1.4-times for the grasses. All these factors have practical implications for the use of P fertilizer on grassland which could help control soil erosion and improve livestock production on marginal lands on which farming communities largely depend.																	0021-8596					JUN	1999	132		4				399	405		10.1017/S0021859699006462							WOS:000082380600003

The effects of stock exclusion on annual plant community structure was slight, and was different in the seed bank and in the growing community because of little correspondence between the two. Stock exclusion favoured a few species, but never decreased the abundance of invasive species. It had little or no effect on species diversity. We conclude that grazing exclusion of the order of a decade is not enough to reverse changes produced by long-term grazing. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Edwards, GR; Crawley, MJ				Edwards, GR; Crawley, MJ			Herbivores, seed banks and seedling recruitment in mesic grassland	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 An experiment was carried out in a species-poor acid grassland to determine the effect of insect, mollusc and rabbit herbivory on the size and composition of the seed bank and on seedling recruitment from the seed bank and seed rain. From 1991 to 1997, insects and molluscs were excluded with pesticides, and rabbits with fences. Seedling recruitment was monitored over 22 months in gaps established in the vegetation in summer 1995. 2 The most common species recorded from the seed bank in early summer 1995 were dicots (17 species), but perennial grasses (five species) were numerically the most abundant (65% of total). There was no relationship between the species composition of the seed bank and the established vegetation. 3 The size of the seed bank of eight species was greater on fenced plots, a result that reflected increased seed rain where rabbits were excluded. Insects and molluscs had no effect on the size of the seed bank of any species. The number of species in the seed bank was not affected by any of the herbivore exclusions. 4 A comparison of seedling emergence in gaps formed over the original soil with gaps where the soil had been sterilized indicated that only Galium saxatile and Cytisus scoparius recruited fi-om the seed bank. Seedling recruitment was almost entirely derived from the recent seed rain, was dominated by the most abundant perennial grasses in the vegetation (Festuca rubra and Holcus lanatus), and had a species composition that resembled the established vegetation. Results highlight that the potential for seedling establishment in gaps to bring about vegetation change in this grassland is low. 5 Six species had higher seedling densities on rabbit-fenced plots, but the significant effect of fencing disappeared by plant maturity for most species. Survival of seedlings was lower on fenced plots where non-grazed biomass accumulated, so that after 22 months Agrostis capillar is was the only species with more plants present where rabbits were excluded. Rumex acetosa and Stellaria graminea showed higher seedling emergence where molluscs were excluded. More seedlings of Rumex acetosa were also found where insects were excluded. These invertebrate effects were still evident at plant maturity.

J	Falinska, K				Falinska, K			Seed bank dynamics in abandoned meadows during a 20-year period in the Bialowieza National Park	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The relationship between size and floristic composition of the seed bank and vegetation dynamics was studied between 1976 and 1996 in 0.75 ha of an abandoned Cirsietum rivularis meadow. The plot was divided into 100-m(2) (10 x 10m) quadrats and sampled 5-yearly to map the vegetation and determine the soil seed bank. 2 Densities of seeds in the soil fluctuated as succession proceeded. The initially small seed bank trebled by 15 years after abandonment, before falling, after 20 years, to approximately the same as in the initial stage. 3 The floristic richness of the seed bank decreased during succession, with the number of species falling from 38 to 25. The diversity of life forms, however, increased in later periods, with tall herbs, shrubs and trees appearing after 10 years. 4 Seed bank floristic composition is apparently both a product of the species composition of the current vegetation and a record of the long-term substitution of species. Other factors, including the structure of the vegetation, also influence the accumulation of seeds in the soil. 5 Although changes in number of species show a directional pattern, the seed bank size fluctuated in the course of succession on these fertile wet meadows.																	0022-0477					JUN	1999	87	3					461	475		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00364.x							WOS:000081304700009						
J	Carrington, ME				Carrington, ME			Post-fire seedling establishment in Florida sand pine scrub	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												This study deals with a quantification of pre- and post-fire seedling establishment and microsite characteristics in two Florida sand pine scrub sites burned in May 1993. In addition, life history characteristics related to seedling establishment are described for five perennial species - Calamintha ashei, Chapmannia floridana, Eriogonum floridanum, Garberia heterophylla and Palafoxia feayi. Post-fire seedling establishment in sand pine scrub was sparse (median = 1, 12 seedling/m(2)), with 17 of 35 species establishing seedlings. Chapmannia, Eriogonum, Garberia and Palafoxia resprouted and flowered after fire; Eriogonum and Garberia had strong post-fire seedling establishment responses within 19 months post-fire. Calamintha individuals were killed by fire, but this species had a strong post-fire seedling establishment response, presumably from seeds in a soil seed bank. Eriogonum and Calamintha seedlings established preferentially in plots centered on conspecific adults. For these species with poor seed dispersal, spatial patterns of seedling establishment may be influenced more by pre-fire adult plant location than by post-fire microsite conditions. Post-fire seedling density in sand pine scrub was much lower than in California chaparral and South African sand plain lowland fynbos.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				JUN	1999	10	3					403	412		10.2307/3237069							WOS:000082205100011						
J	Parrotta, JA; Knowles, OH				Parrotta, JA; Knowles, OH			Restoration of tropical moist forests on bauxite-mined lands in the Brazilian Amazon	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												We evaluated forest structure and composition in 9- to 13-year-old stands established on a bauxite-mined site at Trombetas (Para), Brazil, using four different reforestation techniques following initial site preparation and topsoil replacement. These techniques included reliance on natural forest regeneration, mixed commercial species plantings of mostly exotic timber trees, direct seeding with mostly native early successional tree species, and mixed native species plantings of more than 70 tree species (the current operational restoration treatment at this site). Replicated fixed-radius plots in each treatment and in undisturbed primary forest were used to quantify the canopy and understory structure and the abundance and diversity of all vascular plant species. Treatment comparisons considered regeneration density, species richness and diversity for all floristic categories, and, for trees and shrubs, the relative contribution of initial planting; and subsequent regeneration from soil seed banks and seed inputs from nearby primary forests. With the possible exception of the stands of mixed commercial species, which were superior to all others in terms of tree basal-area development but relatively poor in species richness, all treatments were structurally and: floristically diverse, with a high probability of long-term restoration success. Of these, the mixed native species plantings appeared to be at least risk of ar rested succession due to the dominance of a broader range of tree species of different successional stages or expected life spans. In all treatments, several locally important families of primary forest trees (Annonaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Palmae and Sapotaceae) were markedly underrepresented due to a combination of poor survival of initial plantings and limitations on seed dispersal from the surrounding primary forest.

J	Edwards, GR; Crawley, MJ				Edwards, GR; Crawley, MJ			Effects of disturbance and rabbit grazing on seedling recruitment of six mesic grassland species	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seeds of two grass (Arrhenatherum elatius and Festuca rubra), two herb (Plantago lanceolata and Rumex acetosa) and two legume (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) species were sown in summer 1995 at four densities (no seed, 1000, 10 000 and 50 000 seeds m(-2)) into an established rabbit-grazed grassland given factorial combinations of rabbit fencing (with and without fences) and soil disturbance (with and without cultivation). On plots where no seeds were sown, only the species with persistent seed banks (P. lanceolata, L. corniculatus and T: repens) showed enhanced seedling emergence in response to disturbance. In disturbed soil, seedling densities of all species increased with increasing density of sown seeds, the effects of which were still evident for plant cover 2 years after seed sowing. In undisturbed vegetation, A. elatius, F. rubra, P. lanceolata and R. acetosa showed increased seedling densities following seed sowing; but in each case, there was an upper asymptote to seedling recruitment, presumably due to microsite limitation. Rabbit grazing reduced seedling densities, with this reduction being more pronounced with disturbance than without. However, the effect of rabbit grazing did not persist for some species; seedling mortality of R. acetosa, P. lanceolata, L. corniculatus and T: repens was higher on plots without rabbit grazing, so that plant densities of these species in summer 1996 and plant cover in summer 1997 were greater on grazed plots. The results indicate interactions between soil disturbance, propagule availability and herbivory, rather than disturbance alone, will play an important role in controlling seedling recruitment and species habitat distributions in grasslands.

J	Ekstam, B; Johannesson, R; Milberg, P				Ekstam, B; Johannesson, R; Milberg, P			The effect of light and number of diurnal temperature fluctuations on germination of Phragmites australis	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed germination of the wetland emergent perennial Phragmites australis is stimulated by diurnally fluctuating temperatures. A germination experiment in darkness and light at different temperature regimes showed that P. australis germinated as well in darkness as in light over most of the temperature regimes tested. The germination requirements could partly explain why this species, despite a large annual production of small seeds, does not accumulate a persistent soil seed bank. A second experiment examined the effect of one to four diurnal temperature cycles with amplitude of fluctuations ranging from 0 to 30 degrees C; diurnal mean temperature of 15 degrees C. Germination in the absence of fluctuations was low, and logistic model estimates showed a positive effect of number of temperature cycles which was strongly influenced by amplitude size. For seeds that have fallen on moist ground during the winter, these laboratory results predict that a few large diurnal temperature fluctuations could be sufficient for onset of germination in the subsequently warmer spring period. Seeds that are located under water, however, are predicted to remain ungerminated until the water level falls. Hence, we suggest that the requirement for fluctuating temperature, in addition to being a sensor for 'exposed' seed sites, is also effectively acting as a germination timing mechanism.

J	Dittmar, LA; Neely, RK				Dittmar, LA; Neely, RK			Wetland seed bank response to sedimentation varying in loading rate and texture	WETLANDS												This study examined effects of two sediment textures applied in two loading rates on seedling recruitment from the seed bank in a wetland. Total seedling density (TSD) of an unsedimented, control treatment was 6.8-fold higher than the average density in sedimented treatments (2,085+/-971 seedlings m(-1) versus 305+/-80 seedlings m(-2)). Consequently, biomass in the control, was significantly greater than biomass among sedimented treatments (84.4+/-29.5 gm m(-2) versus 24.6+/-8.9 gm m(-2)). Large sediment loads also significantly decreased TSD compared to low sediment loads (192+/-72 seedlings m(-2) versus 417+/-87 seedlings m(-2)). Sediment texture did not significantly alter seedling density, but TSD was markedly suppressed by coarse-texture sediment relative to fine-texture sediment (258+/-67 seedlings m(-2) versus 351+/-92 seedlings m(-2)). In addition, seedling density was significantly and positively correlated with seed mass in the coarse-textured treatments and in the low-loading treatments. The response to sedimentation by individual plant taxa was not consistent and presumably varied as a function of life-history characteristics. Species richness and diversity were significantly greater under the low loading treatment than the high loading treatment.																	0277-5212					JUN	1999	19	2					341	351		10.1007/BF03161765							WOS:000080960700004						
J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW			Seed dormancy in the wetland winter annual Ptilimnium nuttallii (Apiaceae)	WETLANDS												Seeds (mericarps) of Ptilimnium nuttallii have linear, underdeveloped embryos that must grow from about 0.2 to 1.3 mm in length before the radicle emerges from the seed (fruit); thus, seeds have morphological dormancy (MD). in addition to MD, about 70% of the seeds also have physiological dormancy (PD) at maturity in mid-July; thus, seeds have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). Whereas fresh seeds with only MD (26-29%) germinated in light during 2 weeks of incubation at 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15 degrees C, those with MPD required exposure to high temperatures (25/15, 30/15 degrees C), which broke PD, before they would germinate. The high temperature requirement for loss of PD means that seeds have nondeep simple MPD. Seeds buried in soil in July 1991 and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes came out of PD during the summers of 1991-1996, and those failing to germinate in autumn of each year re-entered PD during winter. Thus, seeds have an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle with respect to PD, and MD can be broken only while seeds are not physiologically dormant. Light was required for embryo growth in 55-98% of the seeds, but the light requirement varied with year. Consequently, embryo growth and germination are restricted to autumn, and seeds on the soil surface are more likely to germinate than those buried in soil. Results of this study indicate that P. nuttallii is a strict winter annual with a long-term soil seed bank. The annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle would prevent germination in spring when high water levels in the habitat might be inhibitory for successful seedling establishment.																	0277-5212					JUN	1999	19	2					359	364		10.1007/BF03161767							WOS:000080960700006						
J	Rossell, IM; Wells, CL				Rossell, IM; Wells, CL			The seed banks of a southern Appalachian fen and an adjacent degraded wetland	WETLANDS												Bogs and fens are rare communities in the southern Appalachians of the USA. Many have been degraded, and little ecological information beyond cursory floral inventories is available to help guide conservation and restoration efforts. The seedling emergence technique was used to examine the soil seed banks of open and closed canopy regions of a southern mountain fen in North Carolina. We also examined the seed bank of an adjoining portion of the floodplain, which had been drained and cleared for a golf fairway and is now slated for restoration. A total of 32 taxa emerged, with graminoids (particularly Juncus spp.) dominating all three seed banks. Seedlings were assigned to one of five plant types: woody, rush, sedge, grass, or forb. Significantly more woody seedlings emerged in soils from the closed canopy fen than in soils from the other two areas. Most rush seedlings emerged in open canopy fen soils, more sedge and forb seedlings emerged in floodplain soils, and more grass seedlings emerged in floodplain soils than in closed canopy fen soils. A discriminant function analysis separated the open canopy fen from the closed canopy fen and floodplain by seedlings of woody plants and rushes. The floodplain was separated from the open and closed regions of the fen by sedge and grass seedlings. These patterns in seed bank composition bore little similarity to the standing vegetation in the three areas. Restoration activities planned for the floodplain are intended to restore its hydrology and microtopography, which will strongly influence recruitment from the seed bank and surrounding seed sources.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	1999	19	2					365	371		10.1007/BF03161768							WOS:000080960700007

The model was parameterized using data from the literature and subjected to sensitivity analysis. Tactics generated from the resulting model were compared with standard-herbicide weed control in continuous corn (Zea mays L.) having a long-term history of various tillage and herbicide application regimes. The model recommended preemergent and postemergent weed control based on weed seed and weed seedling densities, respectively. Using standard-herbicide weed control resulted in fewer weed seeds in the soil each year compared with model-based weed control. Variation among model-based weed control treatments applied to plots with different management histories was eliminated over the course of the study as weed populations shifted in response to weed control practices, The result was a 98% relative abundance of foxtail (Setaria spp.) seedlings after 3 yr of model-based treatments, compared with 70% in standard-herbicide treatments. In 1994, the model reduced herbicide use and weed control treatment costs, but often reduced corn yields and net economic returns. In 1995. model-based treatments maintained or increased corn yields and net returns. In 1996, however, model-based treatments consistently reduced corn yields and net returns. Variability in control treatment effectiveness and weed-crop interaction greatly affected the performance of the model. The use of decision-aid models in weed management is still a developing technology. Interactions of the weed seed bank, weed emergence, treatment effectiveness, weed-crop interference, and environmental conditions are very complex, The model could become a valuable tool for producers if consistency of weed control were improved by better understanding and modeling of threshold levels and accounting for weed seed production and by adding data on weed emergence, seed production, yield loss, and control efficacy.																	0002-1962					MAY-JUN	1999	91	3					386	392		10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100030006x							WOS:000082130300006						
J	Scursoni, J; Benech-Arnold, R; Hirchoren, H				Scursoni, J; Benech-Arnold, R; Hirchoren, H			Demography of wild oat in barley crops: Effect of crop, sowing rate, and herbicide treatment	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Wild oat (Avena fatua L.) is a major weed in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in Argentina. During 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996, demographic studies of wild oat in barley crops Here conducted to assess the effect of herbicide treatment, crop, and sowing rate on the demographic processes of seedling establishment, survival rate, reproductive performance, preharvest seed dispersal rate, and fate of seed in the soil during the fallow period. The herbicide was diclofop-methyl: methyl 2-[4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid. Increasing barley sowing rate from 160 plants m(-2) to 280 plants m(-2) effectively reduced the amount of wild oat seeds that entered the soil seed bank by 50% through lowering fecundity. Diclofop-methyl reduced the number of seeds that entered the soil seed bank sevenfold (1050 us. 140 seeds m(-2)) through a reduction in both seedling survivor rate and reproductive output. In addition, the diclofop-methyl treatment delayed the onset of seed maturity and reduced the dormancy level of the seeds produced by the surviving plants. Half the number of wild oat seeds entered the seed bank in a barley than in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. This was through a lower wild oat reproductive output and a higher rate of seed dispersal related to the later harvest time of wheat relative to barley. These data indicate that integrated control of wild oat should include herbicide treatment, crop selection, and sowing rate.																	0002-1962					MAY-JUN	1999	91	3					478	485		10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100030020x							WOS:000082130300020						
J	Kesel, R; Urban, K				Kesel, Raimund; Urban, Katharina			Population dynamics of Gentiana pneumonanthe and Rhynchospora fusca during wet heathland restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												. The population dynamics and reproductive strategies of two rare wet heathland species, Gentiana pneumonanthe and Rhynchospora, were studied in experimental permanent plots in a wet heathland near Bremen, NW Germany, to assess how effective sod cutting and mowing are in promoting these species. In one experiment, small plots (0.25 m2 - 4 m2) were sod-cut or mown; in the second, one large plot 30 mx 50m) was sod-cut. The development of the vegetation and the number of shoots of the two target species were recorded annually. Sod cutting lead to the highest shoot numbers of Gentiana in the long run, whilst mowing was more effective at the beginning of the experiment. Seedlings and adult shoots slowly became more and more abundant after sod cutting. In contrast, Rhynchospora soon formed closed stands after sod-cutting, first through seed germination and then through fast clonal growth of the established individuals. Moist soil or short inundations promoted the germination and seedling establishment of Gentiana, whereas drought negatively affected seedling recruitment. Long periods of inundation severely reduced the population at first, but high numbers of seedlings were found in the following growing season. For the disturbance-dependent Gentiana and Rhynchospora, the availability of gaps within the vegetation is of crucial importance. To promote existing populations, we suggest small-scale sod cuttings which create gaps without disturbing existing flowering individuals too much. For degenerated stands of wet heathland we recommend large-scale sod cutting to activate the seed bank. Additionally, seed introduction may be helpful to encourage the development of a wet heathland with characteristic floristic composition.																	1402-2001					MAY	1999	2	1					149	156		10.2307/1478892							WOS:000208472000017

Plots mulched with pruning from the three trees had a lower weed seed bank in the first year of cropping than unmulched plots. In the second year of cropping, the weed seed bank was higher than in the first year in the Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena,la leucocephala mulch treatments by 41 and 65 % respectively. Senna siamea had a lower seed bank at all times of sampling. Talinum triangulare, Sedges, Oldenlandia corymbosa and Ageratum conyzoides were the dominant species in the seed bank of all treatments. Mulched plots had a low seed bank of Oldenlandia corymbosa, and Ageratum conyzoides in all treatments but Talinum triangulare and sedges remained largely unaffected. Future weed control strategies with mulches in this area should therefore target the first named species. For weed management, Senna siamea mulch was the most effective in reducing seed bank.																	0949-5460					MAY	1999	73	1-2					25	30									WOS:000080813600006

The seed bank was lower in Enterolobium cyclocarpum fallows than in the other tree fallows at both 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths. Nuclea latifolia and Terminalia,, superba tree fallows had the highest seed banks despite the fact that they had the highest floor litter cover. There was no correlation between light transmission and seed bank suggesting that other factors than shade were responsible for the differences in the seed bank observed in the different tree plantations. Generally, Talinum triangulare, sedges, Ageratum conyzoides, Spermacoce ocymoides and Oldenlandia, corymbosa were the dominant species in all tree fallows.																	0066-1759					MAY	1999	73	1-2					38	42									WOS:000080813600009

Species composition at Curlew Valley was most distinctive among the four study sites. In all four sites, average seed size decreased in this order: shrub, herbaceous perennial, and annual species. Mean seed sizes were similar across the Curlew Valley, Rock Valley and Silverbell sites but much smaller at the Jornada site. Most species have small seeds, but the number of seeds varied greatly among these small-seeded species; i.e. seeds of these species could be highly abundant or very rare in the seed banks. In contrast, very few species have large seeds and the seeds of these species were always rare. The possible roles of underlying soil and climatic factors in structuring desert seed bank structure are discussed.

J	Tikhonova, VL				Tikhonova, VL			Long-term storage of seeds	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												Current topics in long-term storage of seeds of economical and wild species are discussed: development of seed banks, temperature conditions for storage, and the cryoconservation of seeds and its consequences. From the analysis of data known from the literature and obtained by the author, the prospects of using moderate (-20 degrees C) and deep (-196 degrees C) freezing for long-term storage of seeds are considered. Studies on the germination of seeds after cryoprenservation (180 species), field emergence, growth and development of plants raised from frozen seeds and their progeny provide evidence that deep freezing of seeds is a highly promising strategy for seed banks pursuing the long-term storage of seeds. Cryopreservation, leading to an abrupt arrest of metabolism, is apparently the most promising means to extend the longevity of seeds with a short life span (microbiotics).																	1021-4437					MAY-JUN	1999	46	3					400	408									WOS:000080212500015						
J	Renner, KA; Swinton, SM; Kells, JJ				Renner, KA; Swinton, SM; Kells, JJ			Adaptation and evaluation of the WEEDSIM weed management model for Michigan	WEED SCIENCE												The WEEDSIM bioeconomic model was developed in Minnesota and was designed to support weed management decisions for both soil-applied and postemergence weed control programs in Zea mays and Glycine max. In this research, we adapted the WEEDSIM weed management model to Michigan by modifying the crop yield loss functions and herbicide efficacy ratings. We then validated the components of the model and determined whether WEEDSIM led to more profitable weed management than recommendations from SOYHERB or CORNHERB, computer decision aids based solely on herbicide efficacy and cost. The crop year significantly influenced the weed-free yield in Z, mays and G. max, but the weed-crop interference function did not change each year. Total weed seed increased in the untreated compared with the weed-free control over the 3-yr period. Weed seed did not increase significantly in WEEDSIM preemergence/postemergence (PRE/POST), WEEDSIM postemergence, or CORNHERB or SOYHERB treatments compared with the weed-free control, although annual grass seedling density at the time of postemergence herbicide application had increased by 1995 in the WEEDSIM postemergence treatment in G. mau because of a 2,4-D amine application only in Z, mays in 1994. WEEDSIM PRE/POST and CORNHERB provided excellent weed control in all three years, and WEEDSIM PRE/POST resulted in gross margins over weed control costs equal to or greater than CORNHERB recommendations. In G. max, Chenopodium album and annual grass control was excellent in all three years for WEEDSIM PRE/POST, WEEDSIM postemergence, and SOYHERB treatments. The highest average gross margin for the 3-yr study was from mechanical weed control in 76-cm-wide rows of G. max ($806 ha(-1)) and from SOYHERB in 38- and 19-cm-wide rows of G. max ($776 and $808 ha(-1), respectively). WEEDSIM recommendations controlled weeds and maintained crop yield in both Z. mays and G. max.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	1999	47	3					338	348		10.1017/S0043174500091876							WOS:000082104600016						
J	Wei, W; Qian, YQ; Ma, KP				Wei, W; Qian, YQ; Ma, KP			Gene flow between transgenic crops and their wild related species	ACTA BOTANICA SINICA												Risk assessment is paid increasing attention along with the more and more releases of transgenic crops. Gene now between transgenic crops and their wild related; species is the main issue in the risk assessment. Transgene may escape spatially by pollination and escape temporally via seed bank as well. The formation of hybrids between transgenic crops and their wild related species is the evidence of spatial escape of transgene, that is the beginning of temporal escape of transgene. Many factors may influence the formation of hybrids between transgenic crops and their wild related species, and the fate of hybrids as well. The dispersion of crop pollens was studied with statistical models 50 years ago, and current mathematical models for describing the transgene escape are greatly improved. Physical isolation and the application of male sterile cultivars may prevent the dispersion of transgenic pollens, but it may not thoroughly cut off the gene flow between transgenic crops and their wild related species. The experience and knowledge obtained from small scale release have to be further deliberated as these will be used for risk assessment on commercialized release.																	0577-7496					APR	1999	41	4					343	348									WOS:000081946500001

The germination of inoculated seed was significantly reduced, and cytological investigation showed that F. oxysporum had penetrated and colonized dormant seeds of O. cumana. Germ tubes of microconidia penetrated all parts of the thick, complex seed testa, and seed contents were completely destroyed. Hyphae dissolved the endosperm cell walls and metabolized the cytoplasm which was rich in lipid- and protein-bodies. Thus, the inoculation of soils with F. oxysporum may be used to reduce the Orobanche seed bank. (C) 1999 Annals of Botany Company.

J	Franceschinelli, EV; Kesseli, R				Franceschinelli, EV; Kesseli, R			Population structure and gene flow of the Brazilian shrub Helicteres brevispira	HEREDITY												Helicteres brevispira is a pioneer species of the tropical riparian forest whose populations appear to cycle through episodes of extinction and recolonization. Therefore, genetic consequences of founding events may strongly affect the genetic structure of its populations. An analysis of F-statistics showed that the studied population of N. brevispira is genetically substructured with the highest values of F-ST found in areas of high plant densities. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that genetic patches have diameters of 3-6 m. Although pollinator movements are usually between plants which are 3-6 m apart, longer flights occur and the neighbourhood area is estimated to have a diameter of 15 m. This suggests that genetic patches are smaller than the neighbourhood area. Seed dispersal is limited, mostly less than 2 m from the mother plants. Thus, short seed dispersal, seed dormancy and founder effects in the seed bank may be the most important determinants of genetic structure in populations of H. brevispira. Factors such as drift and inbreeding may also increase the level of substructure in this population, but the equilibrium model of isolation by distance does not fit our data.

J	Mahy, G; Vekemans, X; Jacquemart, AL				Mahy, G; Vekemans, X; Jacquemart, AL			Patterns of allozymic variation within Calluna vulgaris populations at seed bank and adult stages	HEREDITY												We investigated the spatial genetic structure within and between two plots of Calluna vulgaris and the extent to which the soil seed bank differed genetically from adults at seven allozyme loci. Averaged over the two plots, the seed bank and adult populations contained very similar levels of genetic diversity. Moreover, seeds contained in a single soil core (100 cm(3)) exhibited similar mean allozyme diversity to the surrounding adult population, indicating that the seed bank preserves genetic diversity at a very local scale. Few differences in allelic frequencies were found between the seed bank and its surrounding adult population in each plot. Mean G(ST) indicated a lack of differentiation between the two plots at adult (G(ST) = 0.008) and seed bank (G(ST) = 0.002) stages. Low interplot differentiation is consistent with the outcrossing mating system of the population (t(m) = 0.91 in one plot) and its history of human disturbance. In contrast, spatial autocorrelation analysis of adults indicated a genetic structure at a very local scale, with positive autocorrelation for all alleles below 2 m in one plot and with a pattern of positive autocorrelation below 8 m in the two plots. Current limitation to seed dispersal rather than spatial extension of clones is thought to be responsible for local genetic structure.

Also, because of their microscopic size, direct examination and obtaining an estimate of recruitment, growth and mortality of these stages in the field is difficult. A method of removing microscopic algal stages from natural rock surfaces using watertight tents and water-soluble chemicals is presented. Also discussed is the use of a previously described method of fluorescent labelling these microscopic stages that, when examined under UV light, allows for their precise identification and growth to be determined. Together, these methods can be effective in examining the ecology of algal microscopic stages in the field.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 1	1999	399						253	259									WOS:000082676900031

We monitored species composition and hay yield using point quadrats and biomass samples. Species frequencies changed little during 10 yr (1988-1997) while hay yields showed large fluctuations according to mean relative humidity in April-June. We performed a seed-addition experiment to test whether the establishment of meadow species is limited by lack of diaspores or favourable microsites for germination and recruitment from the seed bank. We sowed ca. 12 000 seeds of 12 species originating from a nearby meadow individually in plots of a 4 x 6 unbalanced Latin square with four treatments, burning, mowing, mowing and removal of a layer of decayed organic matter, and a control. We monitored the fate of seedling individuals for 24 months. Seedlings of all species were established and survived for 12 months, 10 species survived during at least 24 months, some reached a reproductive stage. Species responded to different qualities of microsites provided by the different treatments thus required different regeneration niches. Spontaneous long-distance immigration was insignificant. We conclude that the former species composition of abandoned meadows cannot easily be restored by mowing alone because many plant species of meadows do not have persistent seed banks and immigration over distances of more than 25 m and successful establishment is very unlikely.

J	Partel, M; Mandla, R; Zobel, M				Partel, M; Mandla, R; Zobel, M			Landscape history of a calcareous (alvar) grassland in Hanila, western Estonia, during the last three hundred years	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												The landscape history of the largest calcareous seminatural alvar site (ca. 700 ha) in Estonia, is described with the help of a historical map from 1705 and aerial photographs from 1951, and recent vegetation mapping from 1991-1996. The seminatural, species rich alvar grasslands originate and are maintained by grazing of domestic animals. Three hundred years ago the area was mainly open grassland with sparse shrubs and some fields. Forty years ago the vegetation pattern was similar, with some smaller forests and forest clear-cut areas present. Now, since grazing has ceased for ca. 40 years, only 30% of the area remains as open grassland and 70% as forest. Identification of clusters of field layer vegetation using the program TABORD resulted in 8 clusters, which agreed with the empirically determined community types. The field layer within the young pine forest (up to 20 year old pines) is similar to the open alvar grassland. In older forests, the field layer has already changed. There were no phytosociological differences found between ancient grasslands and grasslands on former arable fields or forest clear-cut areas. Decrease in species richness, compared to open grassland. was most drastic in forests of age 20-40 years where the canopy was most closed. Forests have spread more extensively in areas with deeper soil. The continuation of traditional management (grazing and tree cutting) in alvar grasslands is urgently needed in order to keep seminatural alvar grasslands open. The possibility to restore open grasslands remains as long as there is a pool of grassland species available, especially in younger forests.

Seven additional species were represented by physically intact, non-viable seeds. Over 90% of the persistent seed bank was concentrated in Montiopsis sericea (Portulacaceae), Pozoa coriacea (Umbelliferae), Phacelia secunda (Hydrophyllaceae) and Oxalis compacta (Oxalidaceae). Examination of the seed/cover ratio revealed different propensities for persistent seed bank formation among species. and annuals formed persistent seed banks more frequently than perennial species. Abundance in the standing vegetation had predictive value for abundance in the persistent seed bunk only when non-persistent seed bank species in the standing vegetation were discarded from the analysis. At the local scale, species diversity in the persistent seed bank and standing vegetation were correlated, but compositional similarity was low. Secondary down-slope dispersal promoted by frost heaving in combination with runoff and life-form correlates are discussed as possible factors accounting for poor correspondence between the persistent seed bank and the standing vegetation at a local scale. The high Andean seed bank is similar to or larger than that reported for two Arctic tundra sites, but smaller than for a northern hemisphere subalpine site. If seed bank size is considered in relation to plant cover, the Andean seed bank greatly exceeds that of one Arctic site. Our study constitutes the first demonstration of a sizable persistent seed bank at an alpine site in the South American Andes and in southern hemisphere temperate mountains in general.

The model uses a sigmoid function to simulate the growth of crops and weeds that compete for a maximum yield potential. Thresholds for weed control are based upon critical levels of weed biomass, The dynamics of the weed population are determined by the efficacy of representative herbicides on individual weed species and by seedbank parameters. Herbicide efficacy is determined by a log-logistic dose-response curve for each species. Simulation of a rotation with winter oilseed rape/wheat/wheat/barley showed contradictory predictions of herbicide use, because herbicide use in a rotation with either glyphosate- or glufosinate-tolerant oilseed rape was not reduced in the amount of kg a.i, ha(-1) compared with a traditional treatment, whereas the treatment frequency (number of standard recommended doses per unit area) decreased.

J	Rasheed, MA				Rasheed, MA			Recovery of experimentally created gaps within a tropical Zostera capricorni (Aschers.) seagrass meadow, Queensland Australia	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The recovery of experimentally cleared plots in a meadow dominated by Zostera capricorni was monitored monthly by measurements of leaf shoot density and estimates of above-ground biomass from September 1995 to September 1996. The rate of recovery, relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction and the role of the seed bank on recovery were examined by manipulating the supply of sexual and asexual propagules. Cleared plots were mostly recolonised by Zostera capricorni. Recolonisation occurred principally by asexual growth from surrounding rhizomes. There was no significant recovery by sexual means, although flowering and fruiting were observed during the study period from July through to December with the highest density of sexual shoots in early spring (109.7+/-24.4 shoots m(-2)). Seeds stored in sediments played no role in recovery. Above-ground biomass and shoot density in cleared plots where asexual regrowth was allowed recovered to the level of the uncleared controls after 12 months. Control (uncleared) plots showed distinct seasonality in above-ground biomass, peaking in spring (71.2+/-3.4 g DW m(-2)), but not in shoot density, indicating that shoots became smaller rather than less numerous in winter. The rate of asexual recovery slowed in autumn corresponding to the period of biomass decline,in the control plots but rapidly increased in late winter and spring. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Stacey, GN; Lynch, PT; Benson, EE				Stacey, GN; Lynch, PT; Benson, EE			Plant gene banking: Agriculture, biotechnology and conservation	AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH												Seed banks have provided a secure basis for plant gene banking. However there are plant species of agricultural, biotechnological and ecological importance for which seed storage is not appropriate. Vegetatively propagated germplasm and plants producing recalcitrant seeds, require the rise of in vitro techniques to assist in genetic resource management Cryopreservation of plant tissues and cell cultures has developed rapidly in recent years and has now reached a stage, for certain species, at which ii can be used as a routine tool to secure stable and reliable banks of germplasm. Thus, this is an appropriate point at which to review the fundamental requirements and approaches needed for the operation of gene banks of cryopreserved plant germplasm. in this paper we discuss plant genetic resource management iii the light of the experience gathered in the development of cryopreserved collections of micro-organisms and animal cell cultures. Experiences of cryo-conservationists from other disciplines can provide significant benefits to plant conservationists and biotechnologists involved in the establishment of plant gene banks and in the development of appropriate conservation strategies.																	1120-6012					MAR-APR	1999	10	2					9	14									WOS:000080728700005

Soil samples were taken at two depths: upper layer at 0-2 cm and deeper at 2-5 cm, in a burned area and in one nearby which did not suffer from the fire. The specific richness values, obtained 2 years after the fire, in samplings carried out in the field as well as the soil seed bank were higher in the burned area than the control. The number of germinated seeds was also higher in the burnt area than the control and more abundant in the surface stratum than the deeper one in both areas. In the control area the richness was 33 species, while in the burned area the richness was greater by five species. On the other hand, the cover value was 58 % in the burned area and 61 % in the control area. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).

(Hymenophyllaceae) at its northern distributional limit	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Genetic diversity in the Killarney fern, Trichomanes speciosum Willd. has been investigated in south-western Scotland, the northern-most limit of the distribution of the sporophyte. T. speciosum is unique amongst European pteridophytes in that both phases of the life cycle are perennial and capable of vegetative propagation. Within sites no variation was revealed by allozyme electrophoresis, even where both generations were growing together. In contrast, diversity was observed among sites, with seven different multilocus phenotypes (MLPs) present in the aroa. Two of these MLPs covered large areas while the others were restricted to one, or few localities. Asexual reproduction of the gametophyte via gemmae is assumed to be the main means of dispersal in recent times, allowing single clones to become widespread, while the overall genetic variability may be attributed to sexual reproduction and spore dispersal in historic times under more favourable climatic conditions. We suggest that it is not inbreeding, nor lack of genetic variation that limits sporophyte production, but rather the prevailing climatic conditions. The sporophyte is extremely rare and vulnerable. However, when the gametophyte is considered, the species is neither threatened with extinction; nor does it appear to face the danger of marked genetic erosion, because the long-lived gametophyte stage contains all of the genetic variability present in the area and can be regarded as a valuable 'seed-bank'.

J	Didham, RK; Lawton, JH				Didham, RK; Lawton, JH			Edge structure determines the magnitude of changes in microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments	BIOTROPICA												Edge structure is one of the principal determinants of the extent and magnitude of edge effects in forest fragments. In central Amazonia, natural succession at forest edges typically produces a dense wall of vegetation dominated by Cecropia spp. that buffers the forest interior. Fire encroachment into forest edges, however, eliminates the soil seed bank, enhances plant mortality, and promotes succession to an open, Vismia-dominated edge that does not buffer the forest interior. Contrasting open, fire-encroached forest edges and closed, non-fire-encroached edges were examined in central Amazonia to assess the effects of edge structure on microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments. Edge penetration distances for most microclimate and vegetation structure variables were as much as two to five times greater at open edges than at closed edges. The magnitude of these differences suggests that edge structure is one of the main determinants of microclimate and vegetation structure within tropical forest fragments. Edge effects also varied systematically with fragment area. For a given edge type, 100-ha fragments had consistently lower canopy height, higher foliage density, higher temperature, a higher rate of evaporative drying, lower leaf litter moisture content, and lower litter depth than continuous forest, at all distances from the forest edge. These differences, however, were relatively minor compared to the striking differences in edge penetration between open and closed forest edges. For organisms in small fragments, the difference between open and closed edges may be the difference between total edge encroachment on one hand and an effective nature reserve on the other, relatively independent of absolute fragment area.

Multivariate analysis performed on the overall data show that compositions and structures of the different plant communities are mainly influenced by the site geographic position along an ecological gradient developing from the Seine river estuary toward the upper stream of the river. Over the 3 years of observation, a significant increase of the species diversity (Shannon's index) and richness was observed in the reaped plots compared with the plots that were abandoned after disturbances. However, there was no significant difference between the two treatments in the species diversity as well as richness. Results are discussed in view of conservative management of calcicolous meadows, since these seminatural ecosystems are especially threatened in Western Europe.

J	Preston, CA; Baldwin, IT				Preston, CA; Baldwin, IT			Positive and negative signals regulate germination in the post-fire annual, Nicotiana attenuata	ECOLOGY												The litter of many plant species is known to inhibit germination, and this phenomenon is commonly interpreted as allelopathic inhibition of one species by another. However, an alternative interpretation is that seeds may be using environmental signals to inform the timing of their germination and thereby use dormancy as a mechanism of habitat choice. Nicotiana attenuata Torr ex Wats. (Solanaceae) is typically found for less than three years after fire in the sagebrush, blackbrush, and pinyon-juniper forests of the Great Basin desert of North America. A dormant seed bank is established during this ephemeral post-fire period, and pyrolysis products of alpha-cellulose (containing only C, H, and O) in wood smoke are known to initiate germination in dormant seeds of this species. We demonstrated in a glasshouse experiment that germination into burned soils las compared to unburned) results in a 12-fold increase in lifetime seed production, which reflects a minimum estimate of the fitness benefit of making accurate germination decisions. With seed bioassays, we examined the distribution of this smoke signal in the A, soil layer at several burned areas in southwestern Utah, United States to determine whether the presence of this smoke-derived germination cue predicts the spatial and temporal occurrence of N. attenuata populations after fires. Although we found no evidence for the germination signal in areas that had not been burned for 30 yr, the occurrence of the germination signal did not perfectly coincide with the distribution of populations. We found evidence for its transport by wind and water into adjacent unburned areas (from 40 m to 1 km away from a burned site) and its persistence over time (for greater than or equal to 7 yr), making this signal an unreliable indicator of the plant's habitat. To resolve this discrepancy, we examined the effect of unburned A, soil horizon on smoke-induced germination. The litter-containing A, soil horizon land aqueous extracts thereof), collected from underneath seven dominant species from later stages of post-fire succession, completely inhibited germination of both dormant and nondormant seeds, even in the presence of a smoke cue in excess of that required to elicit germination. The inhibitory effect was limited to the early stages of germination (48 h after exposure to smoke),and we confirmed these results with natural seed banks. We demonstrated that the A, soil horizons and their aqueous extracts are not toxic to N. attenuata seeds or growing plants, and they have no effect on lifetime seed production. Moreover, they do not inhibit the germination of the nondormant, conspecific native tobacco, N. trigonophylla, which grows in the same area but is not associated with fire. Hence, these negative factors do not function in allelopathically mediated competitive interactions between N. attenuata and later successional species. We propose that the occurrence of N. attenuata populations after fires can be explained by the combined stimulatory effect of smoke-derived signals on the dormant seed bank and the inhibitory effect of signals from unburned litter, and that both signals are required for N. attenuata to identify its germination niche.

J	Miller, PM				Miller, PM			Effects of deforestation on seed banks in a tropical deciduous forest of western Mexico	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Seed density and seed bank species composition were determined by germination trials on soils collected during the initial phase of deforestation in a Mexican tropical deciduous forest. The reference forest, pre-burn, 1-d post-burn, and 1-y post-burn soils contained 700, 1000, 70 and 3500 germinating seeds m(-2) of 30, 30, 8 and 13 species, respectively. A total of 43 dicotyledonous species were identified. Percentages of herbs, vines, shrubs and small trees/shrubs were similar in reference forest, pre-burn, and 1-d post-burn soils; herbs were the most common growth form. Pasture conversion greatly altered seed bank species composition; 81% of the species that germinated from the seed bank before burning were absent from the seed bank 1 d after the fires. One-year post-burn soil was dominated by monocots; only 3% of the seedlings were herbs; no vines, small trees/shrubs or trees germinated. The reference forest and the pre-burn soils had 18 dicot species in common and the highest similarity index, 0.43; six of the shared species were herbs. One-day and 1-y post-burn soils had the lowest similarity index, 0.05. Burning the slashed forest and conversion to cattle pasture depleted the original seed bank, replacing it by one dominated by pasture grasses.																	0266-4674					MAR	1999	15		2				179	188		10.1017/S0266467499000747							WOS:000080174000004						
J	Bobowski, BR; Hole, D; Wolf, PG; Bryant, L				Bobowski, BR; Hole, D; Wolf, PG; Bryant, L			Identification of roots of woody species using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Within the last two decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding seedbank dynamics and the contribution of the soil seed bank to a postdisturbance plant community. There has been relatively little progress, however, in understanding perennial bud-bank dynamics and the contribution of the soil bud bank to secondary succession. This lack of information is due primarily to the inability to reliably identify roots, rhizomes and lignotubers that lie dormant beneath the soil surface. This investigation addressed the issue of identification of below-ground woody structures. The first objective was to develop a method that used molecular tools to identify woody plant species from subsoil tissue samples. The second objective was to develop a key in which molecular markers served as criteria for the identification and differentiation of selected tree and shrub species common to the mountains of northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Application of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified rbcL appears to be a reliable method to identify and differentiate 15 plants to the genus level. Two restriction enzymes, DpnII and HhaI, provided restriction site polymorphisms in the PCR product. The fragment number and length were used to develop an identification key. However, plants not analysed in this 'exploratory key' might share the same banding patterns, resulting in a false identification of unknowns.

J	Moles, AT; Drake, DR				Moles, AT; Drake, DR			Potential contributions of the seed rain and seed bank to regeneration of native forest under plantation pine in New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The seed rain, seedbank, and vegetation were studied in a Pinus radiata plantation destined for restoration to native forest, in order to gain information on the vegetation dynamics and potential future vegetation composition of this forest. A total of 1812 +/- 245 seeds m(-2) from 34 species fell in the seed rain between October 1996 and May 1997. The seed bank had a density of 8841 +/- 1157 seeds m(-2) and contained at least 45 species. Alien species contributed 2% of the seedlings and saplings, 6% of the adults, 9% of the seed rain, and 30% of the seed bank, and accounted for 28 of the 69 species identified in this study. As long as disturbance to the forest is minimal, native species can be expected to dominate regeneration. However, only 30 species of seed plants were present as seedlings, saplings, or adults, and several late-successional native species have become locally extinct. The seed rain is a potential source of recruits for these species (12 of the 34 species found in the seed rain were not present in the vegetation), but some species will need to be actively reintroduced if the forest is to be returned to its pre-human condition.

J	Lavorel, S; Rochette, C; Lebreton, JD				Lavorel, S; Rochette, C; Lebreton, JD			Functional groups for response to disturbance in Mediterranean old fields	OIKOS												Experimental disturbance and fertilization in two Mediterranean old fields, three and nine years old, respectively, were used to identify functional groups for response to disturbance. Five morphological traits (canopy structure, height, lateral spread, habit and plasticity) and five regeneration traits (life cycle, seed mass, fecundity, dispersal mode and germination seasonality) were used for species classification. Correlation patterns of species composition and species attributes with disturbance treatments were analysed in order to characterize groups of response to disturbance. The classification based on morphological traits was repeatable across fields and reflected natural correlation patterns among attributes. Erect rosettes with low morphological plasticity and moderate lateral spread, mostly grasses, were intolerant of disturbance. Partial rosettes with low morphological plasticity and wide lateral spread, e.g. Asteraceae species, colonized disturbed locations. Flat proto-rosettes with a plastic architecture were indifferent to disturbance in the young plot but required disturbance to establish in the older plot. The classification based on regeneration traits repeatedly identified germination period to be correlated with disturbance response. Species with early germination were intolerant of disturbance while late-germinating species colonized disturbances. These groups were clearly distinct from groups based on natural attribute correlation patterns which related primarily to seed mass, and secondarily to dispersal mode and fecundity. Effects of fertilization were detected only within disturbed quadrats of the old plot. Fertilization favoured the colonization of disturbances by species with a partial rosette and low plasticity and by species with late germination and high fecundity. These results, complemented by direct analyses on individual traits, are mostly consistent with previous descriptions of the ruderal strategy. This study shows that additional understanding can be gained from a deductive approach that examines more specific traits such as derailed descriptors of plant architecture and seasonal germination dynamics. Our results are intended to contribute to the general discussion on the identification and use of functional classifications. In particular, it is argued that communities such as Mediterranean old fields, where the dynamics is already well understood, should serve as testing grounds for new methods and the development of theories to be later applied to less well known vegetation types.																	0030-1299	1600-0706				MAR	1999	84	3					480	498		10.2307/3546427							WOS:000078916600011

Experiments were conducted during 1994/95 and 1995/96. To estimate predation rates, trays covered with wire meshes to prevent rodent predation, and with fine sheer net (tulle) in the control treatment were used; 100 weed seeds were sown in each tray, and the number of remaining seeds was registered every 15 days. Pitfall traps were used to identify insects species occurring in the field and to estimate their abundance. The carabid Notiobia cupripennis was captured in pitfall traps, the higher population found during March (4.5 and 5.8 insect/trap in conventional tillage and 2.7 and 3.3 insect/trap in no-tillage). The highest predation rates was also registered in March (5.6% and 8% in conventional tillage and 2.7% and 3.8% in no-tillage) and both systems were significantly different as to abundance and predation. No significant differences were found from April to June, and the number of insects and predation rates decreased. There was a positive correlation between the predation rates and the values of insect abundance in both years.

J	Clewell, AF				Clewell, AF			Restoration of riverine forest at Hall Branch on phosphate-mined land, Florida	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												I describe a 1.5-ha riverine headwater forest (Hall. Branch) that was created 11 years earlier on phosphate-mined and reclaimed land near Tampa, Florida, U.S.A. Favorable hydrologic and edaphic conditions were realized, owing to the proper positioning of the project site in an effectively reclaimed landscape. The soil had developed a distinct A horizon and an incipient B horizon. Planted trees, mainly species of Acer; Fraxinus, Ilex, Liquidambar, Magnolia, Persea, Quercus, Taxodium, and Ulmus, shared dominance with short-lived volunteer willows (Salix caroliniana) that had already begun to senesce. The tree canopy exhibited 85% cover, and some trees had grown to 12.5 m tall. Basal area reached 8.31 m(2)/ha for trees 10 cm or more in diameter at breast height. Ten planted tree species produced seeds and yielded seedlings. The floristic composition over the decade consisted of 22 species of trees and 208 shrubs, vines, epiphytes, ferns, graminoids, and forbs. Thirty-eight non-arboreal species were directly transplanted, others arose from a seed bank in muck that was amended on wetter sites, and the rest volunteered via natural dissemination. The frequency of non-arboreal plants was collectively 98%. Seventy-three species at the restoration site were characteristic of the mature, undisturbed reference ecosystem. A corresponding area within the reference ecosystem contained essentially the same number of species and the same array of life forms. Copious plant reproduction has transformed the planted forest into an intact ecosystem that no longer needs restoration assistance.																	1061-2971					MAR	1999	7	1					1	14		10.1046/j.1526-100X.1999.07101.x							WOS:000079197400001						
J	Cuevas, JG; Arroyo, MTK				Cuevas, JG; Arroyo, MTK			Absence of a persistent seed bank in Nothofagus pumilio (Fagaceae) in Tierra del Fuego, Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												The soil seed bank, allowing a plant species to maintain a fraction of its seeds dormant until conditions are adequate for germination and establishment of seedlings, is considered an adaptation for facing spatial and temporal environmental variation. Theory suggests that various factors favor, while others disfavor the evolution of the dormancy in the persistent soil seed bank. In this paper we determine whether the tree species, Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp, et Endl.) Krasser (lenga), forms a persistent soil seed bank, given that it exhibits several characters predisposing it to form a persistent seed bank, while other characters disfavor its formation. The potential for persistent seed bank formation was evaluated through seed burial experiments and examination of soil cores in two contrasting environments with respect to microclimate and soil type: the forest floor (450 m elevation) and the alpine zone (700 m elevation) on cerro Balseiro, Tierra del Fuego, 54 degrees S, Chile. Nothogagus pumilio forms a transient seed bank during part of the summer and winter (february-september), but lacks a persistent bank (maintenance of seed viability for more than one year). Within the forest habitat, 69-76% (depending on soil depth) of the seeds germinated at the beginning of the spring, the remainder being totally inviable at this stage. In the alpine zone, germination was lower (7%), but viability of the ungerminated seeds (19%) was significantly higher than in the forest site. No viable seeds were found in soil cores taken in the two sites seven months after seed dispersal. The results for both sites suggest that storage conditions and germination characteristics an important factors determining the potential for soil seed bank formation. We propose that extensive seedling banks, persisting up to 25 years in Nothogagus pumilio, are an alternative to persistent seed bank formation in a forest habitat where soil conditions for seed storage are unfavorable.

J	Orr, DM				Orr, DM			Effects of residual dormancy on the germinable soil seed banks of tropical pastures	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												Measuring the size and composition of germinable soil seed banks is important in understanding changes in composition in grazed pastures. However, using only one wetting cycle to germinate seeds in soil cores may underestimate the size of germinable seed banks because residual seed dormancy may prevent some seed from germinating. This short communication reports the germination of grass and forb species from 2 Queensland pasture communities during 6 wetting cycles conducted over 5 years. Seed of all species germinated during the first wetting cycle but there was a marked difference between the germination of grasses and forbs in subsequent wetting cycles. More than 80% of Astrebla spp., Iseilema spp. and Heteropogon contortus seed germinated during the first wetting cycle, whereas seed of Chloris divaricata and Eragrostis sororia had lower germination in the first cycle. The level of germination recorded for the forbs during the first wetting cycle varied from 10-60% with substantial germination continuing until the fourth wetting cycle. The implications of this residual dormancy are discussed in relation to the persistence of both grass and forb species. It was concluded that 2 wetting cycles are needed to quantify the size of the germinable seed banks for Astrebla spp., Iseilema spp. and H. contortus. However, for some forb species, 4 cycles may be necessary to measure the germinable seed present.																	0049-4763					MAR	1999	33	1					18	21									WOS:000083803200003						
J	LaDeau, SL; Ellison, AM				LaDeau, SL; Ellison, AM			Seed bank composition of a northeastern US tussock swamp	WETLANDS												A seedling and sporeling emergence assay was conducted on 50 soil cores taken from within Carer stricta tussocks (intra-tussock) and from paired, adjacent inter-tussock areas in the Hawkins Conservation Area, South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA, to test the hypothesis that local heterogeneity in water levels alters seed bank composition and subsequent seedling emergence patterns. Soil cores were sliced into 2.5-cm-thick sections and split into flooded and drawn-down treatments. Germination of buried seeds and spores was assessed in these treatments under greenhouse conditions for 6 months. Eighteen species emerged from both treatments combined: 17 from inter-tussock samples and 12 from intra-tussock samples. Pooled across sample depths and watering treatments, more species of grasses, forbs (exclusive of Impatiens capensis), and woody plants germinated from intra-tussock samples, while more pteridophytes germinated from the inter-tussock samples. Emergence of pteridophytes, grasses, and forbs was associated significantly with sample depth. More pteridophytes germinated from samples close to the swamp surface, while grasses and forbs were most abundant in samples 10-20 cm below the surface. In the drawn-down treatment, pteridophyte and forb seedlings were more plentiful from inter-tussock samples. In contrast, more forb seedlings emerged from intra-tussock samples in the flooded treatment. This variation in forb emergence seems to reflect differences in species composition within and between tussocks. Twenty-two species occurred in the standing vegetation of the study area, but only nine of these also occurred in the seed bank. The composition of standing vegetation atop and between tussocks did not differ significantly. Grasses, which dominated the seed bank, were absent from standing vegetation.

J	Smith, MA; Bell, DT; Loneragan, WA				Smith, MA; Bell, DT; Loneragan, WA			Comparative seed germination ecology of Austrostipa compressa and Ehrharta calycina (Poaceae) in a Western Australian Banksia woodland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Austrostipa compressa, a native ephemeral of southwest Western Australia was stimulated to germinate under a range of temperatures, in the presence of light, and exposure to smoke-water. This combination of environmental cues results in winter-maximum germination in immediate postfire and disturbed-soil environments of this Mediterranean-type climate. In contrast, Ehrharta calycina, an introduced perennial grass from southern Africa that has invaded Banksia woodlands, germinated under a wide range of temperature and light conditions, but showed no promotive response to smoke-water. Although A. compressa seeds tolerated heat shock better than E. calycina, the self-burial mechanism of A. compressa seeds ensures protection from fire. High-intensity fire could have a greater impact on E. calycina, as the seeds of this species tend to accumulate in the top of the soil profile where they are more susceptible to high temperatures. Although seeds off. calycina are more susceptible to high temperatures, survival of mature individuals by postfire resprouting ensures continued survival in native woodlands. Estimates of soil seed bank densities showed extreme variability, but some recently burnt areas of the Yule Brook Botany Reserve contained up to 8000 seed m(-2) of A. compressa and nearly 75 000 seeds m(-2) off. calycina. Viable soil seed bank densities of A. compressa are reduced with time-since-last fire, but areas of greater than 45 years since the last fire, still contained up to 119 seeds m(-2). In both species, only about half their soil seed bank germinates following fire, thus ensuring the potential for later recruitment. Massive soil seed populations of E. calycina in native Banksia woodlands pose a major problem to management of this plant community type.																	0307-692X					FEB	1999	24	1					35	42		10.1046/j.1442-9993.1999.00944.x							WOS:000078842900005

We used an on-going exclusion experiment to test the hypothesis that through their activities as seed predators and soil disturbers, these omnivores are important determinants of the density and relative species abundance of seeds in the soil seed bank of undisturbed primary rainforest. After 6.5 y of continuous crab exclusion, there was no significant difference in the density of seeds in the top 3 cm of soil between the control (3671 +/- 517 seeds/0.19 m(2)) and exclusion plots (3285 +/- 801 seeds/0.19 m(2)), nor was there any significant treatment difference in relative species composition. There were also no significant treatment differences when Muntingia calabura, which accounted for 91.9% of all seeds in the seed bank, was excluded from the analyses. We attribute the lack of a significant impact of red crabs to their probable inability to handle the very small seeds which occurred in the seed bank, and the low level of soil disturbance at the study site. We conclude that the observed impact of red crabs on the abundance and diversity of successional species in natural light gaps on Christmas Island is due to their impact on germinating seedlings alone, rather than any additional impact on the soil seed bank.

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY					8th International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment	MAY, 1997	PERTH, AUSTRALIA					Germination and establishment of aquatic plants in response to the addition of toxic and nontoxic cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa cells, the toxin, microcystin, or both nontoxic cells and dissolved microcystin was investigated in two glasshouse experiments and an in vitro germination experiment. The presence of high densities of cyanobacterial cells had a negative effect on aquatic plant establishment when cell densities were greater than 10(9) cells mL(-1). Plants that were shaded with 20% shade cloth also had reduced establishment compared to the control. The most sensitive plants were species of Chara acid Nitella. There was no evidence that dissolved microcystin (as cyanobacterial cell-free extracts) alone had a deleterious effect on aquatic plant germination and establishment. Dense cyanobacterial blooms may, therefore, have a role in preventing the establishment of aquatic plants through shading.

Opportunities have become available to reinstate such communities through agri-environmental initiatives e.g. the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) scheme. Lowland wet grasslands represent a severely declining habitat which are nonetheless a major element in eight English ESAs, where they have been targeted for protection, enhancement and re-creation. However; the continued agricultural usage of the land places constraints, both ecological and financial, upon the conservation of such habitats. This paper outlines the effects of intensive agriculture upon wet grasslands, the justification for their protection, and how targets for their conservation might be derived. Techniques and costs involved in the restoration of grassland are discussed. Finally the cost and effectiveness of re-creating lowland wet grassland are considered using the example of an ex-arable site within the upper Thames tributaries ESA. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

When agricultural lands are abandoned, they are often recolonized by the original vegetation. The object of this paper is to analize the first ten years of secondary succession on a field under a long time of agriculture abandoned after a wheat crop. On the first year, wheat with annual weeds (Chenopodium album and Portulaca oleracea) appeared. After the first year, one plot was colonized by Baccharis salicifolia and the others by Carduus acanthoides, Cerastium glomeratum, Ammi majus, etc. The last years constitute another stage where diversity is reduced and a strong dominance of Baccharis salicifolia or Carduus acanthoides becomes visible. Johnson grass appeared at the begining of the succession and stayed for the whole period with high abundance values. So far no species of the natural communities have established on this field, possibly because not enough time has elapsed yet or because they are absent from the seed bank or in the neighbourhood.																	0100-204X					FEB	1999	34	2					151	157		10.1590/S0100-204X1999000200001							WOS:000079259700001						
J	Brewer, JS				Brewer, JS			Effects of competition, litter, and disturbance on an annual carnivorous plant (Utricularia juncea)	PLANT ECOLOGY												The effects of removal of live plants and litter (using herbicide, clipping, and raking) on seedling establishment were examined in Utricularia juncea (bladderwort), an annual carnivorous plant of low frequency in wet, nutrient-poor pine savannas of the southeastern United States. In addition, the spatial distribution of this species in relation to crayfish disturbances was determined. The creation of competition-free gaps in the groundcover canopy in May 1996 (using herbicide) promoted establishment of this species at two sites by September 1997. Standing dead and litter left in herbicide-treated plots inhibited establishment. Density was near zero in undisturbed plots. Natural occurrences of this species were associated with crayfish mounds, which bury plant litter as they erode and increase in area. These results suggest that Utricularia juncea is a fugitive species that depends on disturbances or litter-free microsites to become established in wet, nutrient-poor seepage savannas in southern Mississippi. It is hypothesized that the production of carnivorous traps combined with relatively high allocation to reproductive structures (>90%) and the production of a persistent seed bank make it well-adapted to nutrient-poor and disturbed habitats.																	1385-0237					FEB	1999	140	2					159	165		10.1023/A:1009796818877							WOS:000078796600003						
J	Abernethy, VJ; Willby, NJ				Abernethy, VJ; Willby, NJ			Changes along a disturbance gradient in the density and composition of propagule banks in floodplain aquatic habitats	PLANT ECOLOGY												This study used germination methods to examine the density, species composition and functional composition of propagule banks in a series of riverine wetland aquatic habitats subject to varying degrees of hydrological and management-related disturbance. Under permanent inundation (the conditions prevailing at most sites during the growing season) propagule germination and species richness was low, with floodplain perennials and helophytes particularly affected. Densities of floodplain annuals were largely maintained through continued germination of a few flooding tolerant species. On damp mud (conditions associated with hydrological instability) total seedling number and species richness increased significantly, but species richness of germinating hydrophytes declined. Mean seedling density at 0-0.1m depth was 15450 +/- 4400 m(-2), reaching a maximum(162 050 m(-2)) in temporary backwaters. Annual (e.g., Lindernia dubia, Cyperus fuscus) and facultative ruderal species (e.g., Lythrum salicaria and Alisma plantago-aquatica) predominated. Vertical zonation of the propagule bank was weakly developed. The numbers of individuals and species germinating varied significantly between sites. The seasonal, most intensely. disturbed sites (temporary backwaters) supported a numerically large, species rich propagule bank based on floodplain annuals, while the permanent, less disturbed sites (ditches and an oxbow pond) had a small, species-poor propagule bank composed of hydrophytes and helophytes supplemented by allochthonous seed inputs. Sites intermediate on the gradient had a propagule bank dominated by facultative amphibious, ruderal hydrophytes. The composition of the seed bank and the established vegetation was most similar at the heavily disturbed sites where the seed bank was maintained by vigorously fruiting annuals and supplemented by inputs from temporary habitats upstream. At permanent sites much of the propagule bank composition could be accounted for by inputs of floodborne seed from the immediately adjacent floodplain. The established vegetation at such sites appeared to be maintained mainly by vegetative propagation with recruitment from the propagule bank likely only after severe disturbance. The potential contribution of functionally diverse propagule banks to sucessional processes within fluvially dynamic floodplain aquatic habitats is emphasised.

Gradually, such systems have either been abandoned or more intensively exploited, with a subsequent decrease in species numbers. Until recently, it was thought that restoration of these communities would be straightforward. However, abiotic constraints (with respect to eutrophication and acidification) have hampered restoration more than previously thought, Moreover, very recent research has revealed that biotic constraints can also be important: many plant species are not present in the soil seed bank and their dispersal is limited in the present fragmented landscape.																	0169-5347					FEB	1999	14	2					63	68		10.1016/S0169-5347(98)01544-4							WOS:000079417200008	10234254

In Central America it is one of the most noxious and serious weeds in several upland crops, causing severe yield losses. Experimentally, pre-emergence control with herbicides, weed elimination during the fallow period and zero tillage reduced itchgrass populations in comparison to conventional practices used by growers (no fallow management, soil preparation by disc harrowing and limited use of in-crop herbicides). Additional improvement in itchgrass management is brought about by inter-sowing legume cover crops. Of several legumes evaluated, mucuna (Mucuna deeringiana) and Canavalia ensiformis controlled the weed better and covered the soil, especially if planted simultaneously with maize. Itchgrass suppression by mucuna usually corresponded with increased grain yields but competition by the cover crop could reduce yields; a good compromise is to delay mucuna planting by two weeks in relation to maize. Integrated tactics to control itchgrass were evaluated in on-farm validation plots. Pendimethalin controlled itchgrass at the onset of validation plots and facilitated the establishment of the cover crop. Itchgrass densities were lower in validation plots than in grower's fields while infestation levels and the soil seed bank decreased over three years with integrated management. In general, corn yields were also higher in validation plots. Integrated itchgrass; management also proved economically feasible for smallholders. A promising alternative is biological control with the itchgrass smut, Sporisorium ophiuri, which prevents seed set and is host specific.																			1-901396-53-3				1999							131	140									WOS:000084242900019

Seed banks were sampled in the baseline year and after the final year of the five-course rotation in a number of split fields and various diversity indices were calculated. Generally, total seed density increased on integrated plots but was contained under conventional management. There were some indications of increased diversity on integrated plots at two sites. A greater number of differences was recorded between position in the field, where greater diversity was recorded in the 'margin' than 'field' samples. Integrated management, which included some spring cropping, resulted in greater importance of spring germinating species in the seed bank at two sites. Greater diversity would be expected in the vegetation of arable land where more varied agronomic practices create a greater variety of niches. The relatively small differences between the conventional and integrated management may not have been great enough to record marked differences in the diversity statistics used here.																			1-901396-53-3				1999							261	266									WOS:000084242900038

T. arvense seeds from unsprayed controls had a high germination rate (81-93 %), but the proportion of seeds germinating was highest at low dosage. Compared with control, the proportion of germinated seeds was reduced at highest herbicide dosage while the proportion of ungerminated, living seeds and of dead seeds was increased. The proportion of germinated seeds of S. arvensis seeds from unsprayed controls was lower (58-69 %) than in T. arvense. S. arvensis seeds responded to low herbicide dosage with a decreased proportion of ungerminated, but living seeds. The changes in germination of seeds from plants subjected to sublethal dosages are discussed in relation to side-effects on nontarget vegetation, persistent seed-bank and toxicological testing of herbicides.																			1-901396-53-3				1999							267	272									WOS:000084242900039

About 30% of these areas are predominantly infested by red rice in such intensity that it is not economic to grow rice as a commercial crop. In 1984/85, Campos et nl. (1986) developed adaptations to a no till system where, after soil preparation by primary tillage, it is irrigated in order to promote germination of the red rice seeds. When 30 - 40 cm high, red rice is sprayed with glyphosate at 1.62g a.i./ha and then the crop is planted. This system has been so successful in Brazil that several other rice producer countries have adopted the technique. This research suggests a new version for the system, which consists of several glyphosate applications with the red rice at earlier stages (5-10 cm). Periodic irrigation promotes germination of red rice by several flushes during 20 - 30 days and, application of glyphosate at 0.24 to 0.384 a.i./ha, 4 to 5 times, can control more red rice, reducing the soil seed bank considerably. This system allows reduced costs reduction for crop establishment and causes a lower environmental impact.																			1-901396-53-3				1999							369	372									WOS:000084242900055

As a consequence of these associations, consistently excellent weed control will be necessary to stabilize or reduce weed seed banks. For excellent weed control to occur in HTCs, application timing of associated herbicides will be the single most critical factor. The threshold for application timing will be simpler and more easily determined for weeds that emerge early and quickly. Weeds with protracted emergence periods, or those that simply emerge late, will be more difficult to control. Increases in seed bank densities may be expected for these latter species under HTC management.																			1-901396-53-3				1999							409	416									WOS:000084242900061

Fertility improvement by tethering livestock proved particularly effective in both depleting the soil seed bank and improving crop yield. Cotton trap crops were less so. Results are discussed in terms of a co-ordinated approach, including various cultural methods (rotation with leguminous non-host trap crops, tethering of livestock to improve fertility), with an annual Striga campaign to prevent seed shedding.																			1-901396-53-3				1999							575	576									WOS:000084242900088

J	Batygina, TB				Batygina, TB			Genetic heterogeneity of seeds	ACTA BIOLOGICA CRACOVIENSIA SERIES BOTANICA												The association of two opposing reproductive processes - sexual and asexual - in the course of evolution has given rise to seed multiplication. Genetic heterogeneity, based mainly on the different origins of embryos, appears to be one of the most important traits of seeds. Seeds may contain zygotic embryos, which arise by means of the sexual process (meiosis and fertilization). This mechanism is the main source of gene recombination, which determines genetic variation. However, somatic embryos developed without fertilization also may give rise to a new generation of plants. In connection with the problem of genetic heterogeneity of seeds, special attention has been paid to a new category, embryoidogeny, which seems to be a specialized form of vegetative propagation. The origins of embryos may differ, as these arise by means of monozygotic cleavage, nucellar, or integumentary embryoidogeny. Other apomictic embryos may be formed by means of gametophytic apomixis (diplospory or apospory, followed by diploid parthenogenesis or apogamety). Though these embryos are of different origins, they all are matroclinous offspring. Based on the origin of the embryos, several types of genetic heterogeneity of seeds can be distinguished, such as seeds with sexual (zygotic) embryos, seeds with hemigamous chimaerous embryos, seeds with parthenogenetic embryos, seeds with somatic embryos (embryoids), and seeds that contain sexual (zygotic) and parthenogenetic embryos and embryoids. This produces clones with different heredities in the offspring: clones of the parental organism (on the basis of gametophytic apomixis, nucellar and integumentary embryoidogeny) and clones of the new daughter organism on the basis of the zygotic embryo, including the zygote (monozygotic cleavage embryoidogeny, which is the source of monozygotic twins, triplets, etc.). Embryogenetic traits that determine the heterogeneity of the population should be taken into account together with other morphological traits of seed structure. The homeostasis of a species or population is to a large extent provided by the seed bank in the soil. Seeds stored in the soil represent an embryonal population of species.																	0001-5296						1999	41						39	50									WOS:000082446000005						
J	Evans, PM; Smith, FA				Evans, PM; Smith, FA			Patterns of seed softening in subterranean clover in a cool, temperate environment	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Environmental conditions affect seed softening patterns of annual legumes. These patterns have not been well established for cool, temperate environments. This work examines the effect of genotype and of growing and softening environments on the short-term loss of dormancy in subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) during the summer and early autumn. Burrs of six cultivars and one accession of subterranean clover that varied widely in maturity and hardseed level were placed to soften on the soil surface, over the summer-autumn period, under two contrasting environments in western Victoria, Australia: Hamilton and Telopea Downs. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the rate of hardseed breakdown both among cultivars and at the two locations. At the cooler site, Hamilton, the levels of residual hardseed after the summer averaged 75% lover all cultivars and growing sites), compared with 66% at Telopea Downs. There was no interaction between cultivar and location of softening. At the end of the period of field exposure the ranking from lowest to highest residual hardseed was 'Enfield' < 'Leura' = 'Gosse' < 'Dalkeith' < 'York' = SE008 = 'Nungarin'. High levels of embryo dormancy in Leura indicate that this cultivar has the capacity for delayed germination via embryo dormancy. The results suggest that in cool temperate environments high seed banks of subterranean clover can be achieved due to a lower percentage of seed softening, which in turn means a potentially greater long-term persistence of subterranean clover and the possibility of conducting 1:1 pasture-crop rotations in a rainfall zone where consistently high grain yields may be expected.																	0002-1962					JAN-FEB	1999	91	1					122	127		10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100010019x							WOS:000080036900019

That role depends on the vital rates (transitions) from seed production to sapling stages and on overall population growth. To determine the state of our understanding of recruitment limitation we examined how well we can estimate parameters corresponding to these vital rates. Our two-part analysis consists of (1) a survey of published literature to determine the spatial and temporal scale of sampling that is basis for parameter estimates, and (2) an analysis of extensive data sets to evaluate sampling intensity found in the literature. We find that published studies focus on fine spatial scales, emphasizing large numbers of small samples within a single stand, and tend not to sample multiple stands or variability across landscapes. Where multiple stands are sampled, sampling is often inconsistent. Sampling of seed rain, seed banks, and seedlings typically span <1 yr and rarely last 5 yr. Most studies of seeding establishment and growth consider effects of a single variable and a single life history stage. By examining how parameter estimates are affected by the spatial and temporal extent of sampling we find that few published studies are sufficiently extensive to capture the variability in recruitment stages. Early recruitment stages are especially variable and require samples across multiple years and multiple stands. Ironically, the longest duration data sets are used to estimate mortality rates, which are less variable tin time) than are early life history stages. Because variables that affect recruitment rates interact, studies of these interactions are needed to assess their full impacts. We conclude that greater attention to spatially extensive and longer duration sampling for early life history stages is needed to assess the role of recruitment limitation in forests.

Ten compound soil samples from each community at two soil depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) were taken. In general, the density of the germinable seed bank of L. pinnat a was larger in autumn after the seed rain, increased with its relative cover in the established vegetation, and sharply decreased with soil depth. The seed bank of L. pinnata was classified as short-term persistent. Its density was higher in moist swards, where it was abundant and could produce flowers and fruits, than in stony grasslands where its cover was very low, or tall-tussock grasslands, where no flowering events were recorded. On those bases, moist-sward patches are expected to play a more important role than, tall-tussock grasslands or stony grasslands in the maintenance of local populations of L. pinnata.

At Merredin, a mixture of 2 biserrula accessions was grazed, shallow cultivated, or left uncultivated and ungrazed. Seed bank size, seedling regeneration, and seed softening were measured over 2 years. At Perth, softening of biserrula, yellow serradella, and subterranean clover seeds grown at 2 sites (Binnu and Northam) was compared on the soil surface and after burial at 2 and 10 cm over a period of 2 years. Seed bank size of biserrula at Merredin ranged from 14 000 to 17 500 seeds/m(2). Regeneration was greater in the second year (800-1700 seedlings/m(2)) than in the first year (40-600 seedlings/m(2)). In both years the shallow cultivated treatment recorded the highest number of seedlings. About 90% of biserrula and serradella seed remained hard after 2 years on the soil surface, compared with only about 10% of subterranean clover. Serradella softened more rapidly when buried 2 cm below the soil surface (8-12% hard) than it did on the soil surface (84-92% hard) (P < 0.05). In contrast, the softening of subterranean clover decreased with increasing depth. Biserrula was intermediate, although it too softened most rapidly at 2 cm (78-95% hard compared with 82-97% on the surface) (P < 0.05). Rate of seed softening in all species decreased with increasing depth of burial below 2 cm. Of the 4 accessions of biserrula, an accession from Greece (83% hard after 2 years exposure) was significantly softer than the other accessions. The results indicate that biserrula is very hardseeded, although there is sufficient variation in hardseededness for the selection of somewhat softer lines. Its pattern of softening suggests that biserrula may be successful in the ley farming system (crop/pasture rotations) of southern Australia.																	0004-9409						1999	50	6					1073	1081		10.1071/AR98061							WOS:000081590400018						
J	Casanova, MT; Brock, MA				Casanova, MT; Brock, MA			Life histories of charophytes from permanent and temporary wetlands in eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The results of an experiment on the demography of charophytes in permanent and temporary sites in two wetlands are outlined and the charophytes that germinated and established are described in relation to their life histories. Three life-history patterns are represented. First, Monoecious annual species germinate easily and rapidly aft er inundation, they grow quickly and initiate sexual reproduction at the expense of vegetative expansion, produce relatively few, large oospores and die in winter. Second, Dioecious annual species are slower to germinate than Monoecious annuals, they grow more slowly, but also initiate sexual reproduction early in life. They usually produce large numbers of small oospores and die in unfavourable seasons. Both winter-growing and summer-growing Dioecious annuals were represented in experiments. Third, Dioecious perennials germinate after a lag time and establishment; vegetative growth and expansion takes place early in spring. Reproduction in Dioecious perennials is stimulated by increasing water temperatures and other environmental cues. Vegetative reproductive organs are produced in autumn and individual shoots can be very long-lived. Life-history parameters such as germination requirements, establishment requirements and timing of vegetative growth and reproduction can be important in determining the distribution patterns in charophytes.																	0067-1924						1999	47	3					383	397		10.1071/BT97086							WOS:000081899900011						
J	Casanova, MT; Brock, MA				Casanova, MT; Brock, MA			Charophyte occurrence, seed banks and establishment in farm dams in New South Wales	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Farm darns are an important and common water resource in rural Australia. They provide relatively permanent surface water for stock and wildlife. They typically have high turbidity and high levels of disturbance by stock. The occurrence of charophytes in these water bodies was examined, as well as the conditions under which they germinated and established. Charophytes were found in 15% of 65 farm darns surveyed in two regions in New South Wales, Australia. However, charophytes germinated from 64.5% of farm dam seed banks sampled (n = 17). Species found were Chara australis R.Br., C. fibrosa Agardh ex Bruzelius, C. globularis Thuillier, C. muelleri A.Br., Nitella cristata A.Br. and N. tasmanica A.Br. Farm darns in which charophytes were found both in the survey and in the seed bank had lower turbidity, lower dissolved phosphorus levels and more extensive submerged plant communities than average. Charophytes established from the seed banks under experimentally induced water regimes when high water clarity was maintained and the disturbance of stock grazing was removed. Farm darns can support populations of perennial and annual charophyte species, and provide a habitat that is less available in naturally occurring shallow water bodies of the regions.																	0067-1924						1999	47	3					437	444		10.1071/BT97099							WOS:000081899900015						
J	Bell, DT				Bell, DT			Turner Review No. 1 - The process of germination in Australian species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Australian species germinate under the combination of environmental conditions where the potential for survival is enhanced. Most species also have dormancy mechanisms that prevent all seeds from germinating in any particular rainfall event. Immaturity of the embryo prevents some species from germinating until environmental parameters change to more favourable conditions. Seed-coat inhibitors may also delay germination, with some seed requiring ingestion and dispersal by animals or a series of rainfall cycles to facilitate germination. Adaptations to fire include germination mechanisms facilitated by impervious seed coats, seed-coat inhibitors and biochemical sensing of water-soluble components of smoke and the high soil nitrate levels found following the burning of vegetation. Germination is generally limited under saline soil conditions until rainfall dilutes concentrations to near-zero water potentials. Australian species tend to germinate under temperatures that approximate the rainfall season in their native habitat. Light sensing by Australian species ensures germination takes place only near the surface for some species or only under complete burial conditions in others. More recent research has emphasised the interaction of multiple and sequential cues to relieve dormancy and initiate germination. Knowledge of germination mechanisms provides a basis for better land management, enriched conservation, improved rehabilitation and advanced horticulture, forestry and farming practices.																	0067-1924						1999	47	4					475	517		10.1071/BT98007							WOS:000082861100001						
J	Read, TR; Bellairs, SM				Read, TR; Bellairs, SM			Smoke affects the germination of native grasses of New South Wales	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The germination responses to plant-derived smoke of seeds of 20 native grass species from New South Wales, Australia, were tested under laboratory conditions. The species belonged to 14 genera including Bothriochloa, Chloris, Cymbopogon, Danthonia, Dichanthium, Digitaria, Eragrostis, Eriochloa, Microlaena, Panicum, Paspalidium, Poa, Stipa and Themeda. The interaction between smoke and husk-imposed dormancy was examined by removing the floral structures surrounding the seeds, when sufficient seeds were available. Smoke was shown to be an important environmental stimulus for breaking the dormancy of native grasses; however, the response differed considerably between different genera and between species of the same genus. For almost half of the species, smoke significantly increased the germination percentage. Panicum decompositum showed the greatest response, with germination increasing from 7.7 to 63.1% when smoke was applied. Panicum effusum had no germination in the absence of smoke, but 16.7% germination when smoke was applied. Stipa scabra subsp. scabra had germination significantly reduced by smoke from 30.2 to 19.9%. Five species had their germination rate, but not the final germination percentage, affected by smoke, and a third of the species were unaffected by smoke. For five of the species, Chloris ventricosa, Dichanthium sericeum, Panicum decompositum, Poa labillardieri and Stipa scabra subsp. falcata, this is the first report of a smoke-stimulated germination response. For those species with germination promoted by smoke, retention of the covering structures did not prevent smoke stimulation of germination. Sowing smoke-treated husked seeds is likely to be preferable as it would still promote greater germination, whereas dehusking seeds can result in the seeds being more susceptible to desiccation and fungal attack in the field. It is suggested that other grassland communities that respond to pyric conditions may also contain species that respond to smoke.																	0067-1924						1999	47	4					563	576		10.1071/BT97124							WOS:000082861100005

J	Lynch, AJJ				Lynch, AJJ			Distribution, ecology and rarity of the nationally vulnerable species Pultenaea selaginoides (Fabaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Pultenaea selaginoides Hook.f. (Fabaceae) is a Tasmanian endemic shrub classified as nationally vulnerable. Only four populations of P. selaginoides totalling fewer than 1000 individuals are known to be extant, and one of these populations consists of only six individuals. The habitat of P. selaginoides is restricted to sites in flood-prone, riparian areas or coastal ridgelines subject to cloud-lie and runoff retention. However, there appears to be unoccupied habitat available. Pultenaea selaginoides can resprout or coppice after disturbance or regenerate from the soil stored seed bank. Most populations are producing seed, and large quantities may be produced. Germination of the seed can be induced by short-term temperatures of 60-100 degrees C. Only the largest population is formally reserved, but all sites should be managed for the perpetuation of P. selaginoides. Because of the narrowness of its distribution, its low total population size, its innate seed dormancy, the ageing of most of the populations, and the uncertaintpy about the precise causes of its rarity, P. selaginoides should continue to be regarded as vulnerable to extinction.

J	Chapman, R; Bolger, TP; Le Coultre, IF				Chapman, R; Bolger, TP; Le Coultre, IF			Seed dormancy release in three common pasture grasses from a Mediterranean-type environment under contrasting conditions	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Pastures in the Mediterranean region of Australia are typically comprised of a mixture of winter annuals, including grasses and legumes, which utilise a seed bank to survive the long, dry summer. The risk of out-of-season summer rain requires species from such environments to adopt appropriate strategies to protect their seed banks. The seed bank strategies of the grasses from these environments have, so far, received little attention. We conducted an experiment to observe the dormancy release characteristics of 3 grasses common to these environments when stored under contrasting thermal regimes. The grasses studied were great brome grass (Bromus diandrus Roth), annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.), and barley grass (Hordeum leporinum Link). The different species displayed contrasting dormancy release characteristics over the summer. Two of the species examined (great brome grass and annual ryegrass) displayed relatively late release from dormancy which gave high levels of protection from false breaks. The other (barley grass) displayed earlier release from dormancy which would enable it to better exploit earlier true breaks but make it more sensitive to false breaks. Unlike pasture legumes, high and fluctuating temperatures were not necessary for the seeds of these grasses to become germinable. In fact, exposure to high temperatures appeared more likely to suppress release from dormancy.																	0816-1089						1999	39	2					143	147		10.1071/EA98139							WOS:000080958300003

A study in Ontario found that estimated weed seed return to the soil surface was influenced by the duration of weed control in corn and the prevailing environmental conditions.

J	Schutz, W				Schutz, W			Germination responses of temperate Carex-species to diurnally fluctuating temperatures - a comparative study	FLORA												Effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on the germination of 34 temperate Carex-species were investigated. Experiments were conducted on recently matured seeds at 22 degrees C mean temperature with fluctuation amplitudes of 0 degrees-16 degrees C, and at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean temperature) in light and darkness before and after a cold-wet stratification. At 22 degrees C mean temperature, seed germination increased in almost all investigated species with increasing temperature amplitudes, in both light and darkness. The average germination percentage across all species was 29.4% in light and 5.1% in darkness. The averaged amplitude required to reach 50% of maximum germination was 9.8 degrees C. Species with little sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in light showed a clear sensitivity in darkness. The germination percentage was 4.0% for species with seed weights >0.9 mg and 23% for species with seed weights <0.9 mg. By means of a principal component analysis the investigated species could be divided into three groups: (1) species with considerable germination at constant temperature, (2) species with a high germination percentage in response to strong fluctuations but no germination at the constant temperature and at low amplitudes and (3) species which did not germinate at all or showed a low degree of germination at high amplitudes in light. The germination percentage of recently matured seeds was generally lower at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean) than at 28/16 degrees C (22 degrees C mean). Cold-wet stratification enhanced germination at 22/10 degrees C in 33 species in light, and in 26 species strict dark dormancy was relieved. Sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, a need for relatively high temperature fluctuations to trigger germination and reach 50% of maximum germination and prolonged lag-phases of non-stratified seeds were common features of almost all investigated sedges and might favour the built-up of persistent seed banks. The capacity to respond to fluctuating temperatures in particular provides a mechanism favouring spring germination. Sedges occurring in dry or mesic habitats showed a lower sensitivity to alternating temperatures than sedges of wet habitats. In contrast to forest species of other taxa, forest sedges were highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, thereby restricting their germination to vegetation gaps. The variation in response to fluctuating temperatures and stratification in general were relatively small in the investigated Carer species, thus suggesting that their germination behaviour was determined not only by habitat conditions.																	0367-2530					JAN	1999	194	1					21	32		10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30876-9							WOS:000078418100003						
J	Trabaud, L; Renard, P				Trabaud, L; Renard, P			Do light and litter influence the recruitment of Cistus spp. stands?	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												After a major disturbance (such as fire or soil upsetting), large numbers of Cistus spp. seedlings may appear and ensure population recruitment, but in the absence of such disturbances seedlings are rare or nonexistent in mature Cistus stands. What are the causes? Two factors, little studied until now, have been examined: the influence of litter and of light reaching the soil surface. In two types of stands, one dominated by C. monspeliensis and the other by C. albidus, an experiment was undertaken by removing the vegetation cover and by the presence or absence of litter to examine the establishment of seedlings. The seed bank in the soil was also studied to determine its size. Seeds were also subjected to a temperature of 52 degrees C to simulate exposure to full sunlight in summer and determine whether this had any affect on their germination rate. Light and litter had no effect on the germination, irrespective of the quality or intensity of light reaching the soil or the presence or absence of litter; there were always few seedlings and there was no significant difference in numbers between treatments. There was a large seed bank in the soil and these seeds were capable of germinating following experimental conditions: the heat stress applied proved to be too slight to break seed dormancy, although they were viable because they germinated after scarification. In existing Cistus spp. stands, Cistus spp. seeds germinate with difficulty, and lack of recruitment could lead to disappearance of local communities unless they are subjected to disturbances.																	0792-9978						1999	47	1					1	9									WOS:000080371400001						
J	Ferrandis, P; Herranz, JM; Martinez-Sanchez, JJ				Ferrandis, P; Herranz, JM; Martinez-Sanchez, JJ			Fire impact on a maquis soil seed bank in Cabaneros National Park (central Spain)	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The direct impact of fire on the soil seed bank and the changes observed one year later were studied by analysis of seed content in sample layers at depths of 0-2 cm and 2-5 cm. Fire had a severe but selective impact on the sail seed bank: species with transient seed reserves accumulating on the soil surface were eliminated, whereas species with persistent buried seed reserves tended to remain in the soil after the passage of fire. Thick seed coats were shown to be an efficient mechanical protection barrier to fire. One year after fire, trade-off between input and output into seed bank produced a conspicuous recovery of seed density and species richness on the soil surface, and a pronounced impoverishment in the 2-5-cm-depth soil layer. In general, seed banks of woody species were severely depleted due to the lack of replacement following fire, with the exception of Erica, which maintained a high seed bank density in the upper soil layer. The post-fire recovery of soil seed populations was mainly due to two clearly differentiated groups of annuals. The first group was of species whose seeds survived fire, germinated, and completed their phenological cycle. They were mainly fire-ephemerals. The second group consisted of wind-dispersed species whose soil seed banks had suffered a very severe (even total) depletion by fire. They were mainly Gramineae and Compositae species which behaved as opportunistic fire-sensitive invaders.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218												0792-9978						1999	47	1					17	26		10.1080/07929978.1999.10676747							WOS:000080371400003						
J	Dunbar, KR; Facelli, JM				Dunbar, KR; Facelli, JM			The impact of a novel invasive species, Orbea variegata (African carrion flower), on the chenopod shrublands of South Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												This study measured the impact of an introduced plant species, Orbea variegata (African carrion flower), upon the dominant shrub Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush) and the annual plant community in chenopod shrublands of South Australia. Shrubs with Orbea growing underneath were likely to be less healthy than shrubs without Orbea. Pre-dawn water potential and growth of saltbush decreased in the presence of Orbea. Orbea appears to limit water availability to saltbush either by direct competition, a decrease in rainfall penetration through the soil, or a combination of both. Orbea also reduced both the germinable soil seed bank and the biomass of annual plants. Our data suggest that Orbea has a severe detrimental effect on the native vegetation. We speculate that Orbea has the potential to spread further into the chenopod shrublands during years of particularly high summer rainfall. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Brown, CL; Whelan, RJ				Brown, CL; Whelan, RJ			Seasonal occurrence of fire and availability of germinable seeds in Hakea sericea and Petrophile sessilis	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Although the season of fire occurrence is known to affect recruitment to plant populations, it has received little attention. This study investigated the dynamics of the canopy-stored seed banks of two Australian obligate seeder shrubs, Petrophile sessilis and Hakea sericea (Proteaceae), with the objective of determining the changes in viable seed supply over a year. 2 The total number of germinable seeds in the canopy, each month for 12 months during 1996-97, was estimated from separate measures of (i) pre-dispersal predation of fruits; (ii) seed predation of insect parasitoids; (iii) viability of intact seeds; and (iv) loss of seed viability following experimental heating. 3 The two species had very different seed bank dynamics throughout the year. The seed store of P. sessilis appeared to be being replaced annually, as seeds in the older fruits rapidly lost germinability and new fruits matured to replace them. For H. sericea, the seed store appeared to be accumulating each year, because older fruits retained a high level of germinability. 4 The study indicates that no one fire season will maximize the germinable seed release after fire for all species. Management strategies should therefore include varied seasons of prescribed burning to avoid compositional change and a decrease in diversity that may result from a single-season approach.

J	Lundholm, JT; Simser, WL				Lundholm, JT; Simser, WL			Regeneration of submerged macrophyte populations in a disturbed Lake Ontario coastal marsh	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Previous studies in disturbed Great Lakes coastal marshes have determined that seed banks for submerged macrophytes tend to be depauperate if not absent. This was thought to be a major factor that would prevent the regeneration of macrophyte populations under improved conditions, so the transfer of seed or adult plants from healthy wetlands within the same region has been recommended as a restoration strategy. Cootes Paradise is a large, disturbed coastal marsh with a poor seed bank for submerged plants. In this report a large increase in submerged macrophyte population densities following the reduction of carp (Cyprinus carpio) densities from approximately 700 kg/ha in 1996 to 50 kg/ha in 1997 is documented. Much of this regeneration occurred in areas devoid of aquatic vegetation in 1996. It was determined that these plants developed from vegetative structures buried in the sediment. It is recommended that detailed surveys of both seed and vegetative propagule banks be undertaken before assessing the likelihood of the recovery of submerged macrophyte communities in disturbed coastal marshes.

A large-scale field survey and factorial field experiments indicated that grazers maintain the fucoid community through selective consumption of annual algae. Interactive effects between grazers and dormant propagules of annual algae, stored in a 'marine seed bank', determine the response of this system to anthropogenic nutrient loading. Nutrients override grazer control and accelerate the loss of algal diversity in the presence but not in the absence of a propagule bank. This implies a novel role of propagule banks for community regulation and ecosystem response to marine eutrophication.																	0171-8630						1999	185						309	314		10.3354/meps185309							WOS:000082636700027

Typical responses involve alterations of sediments and soils, as well as micro and macro flora, and the associated faunal uses. Oligotrophic ecosystems, dominated by sedges (Cladium or Carex) typically respond to P fertilization by increasing productivity. In the longer term, opportunistic species (such as Typha) may replace the original vegetation. Less obvious changes occur sooner in soils, algae and microbes. Wetland soils in general, and Everglades peats in particular, have sorption capacity for phosphorus. That storage is typically considered to be reversible, and the sorbed P to be available. New additions of P-containing waters may either increase or decrease this temporary P storage on a time scale of weeks. On approximately the same time scale, algal and microbial communities may undergo expansion and shift to a new species composition. Existing wetland flora respond to an increase in P availability by increasing biomass, and by reapportioning that biomass from below to above ground parts. This is termed fertilizer response and proceeds over several turnover times to a new state characteristic of the new nutrient availability. If the magnitude of the P load increase is sufficiently large, the macrophyte community (if any) may undergo alteration, as new wetland species are able to assert dominance, and replace some or all of the antecedent species. This change in community species composition is also to some degree dependent on seed banks and vegetative reproduction, and adjacent community structure. Physical processes, such as shading out and the accretion of new rooting media, are long-term influences that contribute to the structure of the replacement ecosystem. The speed of community shifts is typically slower than the fertilizer response. Under continuously wet conditions, the several large and small components of the wetland biogeochemical cycle produce accretion of new organic sediments. A first-generation model of the carbon and P cycles produces estimates of the alteration of the rhizosphere, which may then be used as an indicator of potential macrophyte colonization. The components of the model include P removal rates linked to surface water concentrations, and the relation between P accretion and soil accretion, as evidenced in soil column P profiles. Calculations of time trends in root zone average P content are then possible, which may then be used as a trigger variable in the prediction of community changes. Stochastic processes are not included in this deterministic model and create the need for probability density overlays. Calibration of the model to existing Florida wetland data shows reasonable representations of field phenomena.																			1-56670-331-X				1999							621	642									WOS:000080499000028						
J	Mayor, MD; Boo, RM; Pelaez, DV; Elia, OR				Mayor, MD; Boo, RM; Pelaez, DV; Elia, OR			Soil seed bank variation with depth in the Province of La Pampa, Argentina	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												This study was carried out in a research area in the southern Caldenal, a central semi-arid region of Argentina, from which large herbivores are excluded. Samples were collected from the surface litter, 0-4 cm and 4-8 cm deep soil layers. Number of individuals per species in the samples was determined by a combination of seed count and a germination technique. Species diversity per stratum and similarity between strata were calculated. The bulk of the propagules were concentrated in the surface litter and in the top soil layer, with a sharp decrease with depth. Many Medicago minima fruits were found in the surface litter. Seeds from preferred grasses, most of them of the Stipa. genus, were found chiefly in the 0-4 cm soil layer. Except for Larrea divaricata, woody species that are relatively abundant in the plant community were absent. The three strata were very similar; diversity decreased with depth.																	0031-9457						1999	64	1-2					141	148									WOS:000082498200026						
J	Wali, MK				Wali, MK			Ecological succession and the rehabilitation of disturbed terrestrial ecosystems	PLANT AND SOIL					International Symposium on Disturbed Ecosystems	NOV 13-15, 1997	COTTBUS, GERMANY	German Fed Minist Educ & Res, Brandenburg State Environm Protect Agcy, Lignite Minning Co, Lusatia Brandenburg				Soil and vegetation development on surface-mined coal sites in a mixed grass prairie region were studied as (a) naturally revegetated chronosequences of 1, 7, 17, 30 and 45-year old sites, and (b) on sites that were regraded, received topsoil, and were fertilized and seeded. In both cases, vegetation and soils of adjacent, relatively undisturbed areas were also studied for comparison. Species richness was lowest (26 species) at the 1-year old site and highest (114 species) at unmined sites; species richness increased youngest to the oldest sites. Stand ordinations revealed that the site age was the most important factor influencing species richness and abundance. On the younger sites, the environment was characterized by unleached parent materials high in electrical conductivity, SO4, Mg, Ca, and Na and plants growing there were non-native, annual pioneers. At about 30 years, the edaphic conditions had moderated somewhat, and the species complex had a greater number of native species. However, even after 45 years, there were clear differences among mined and unmined sites both in species composition and edaphic conditions. Rates of nutrient accumulations over the 45-year time gradient were as follows: organic C 131 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N 25 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), P 0.1 kg ha(-1) yr(-)1, and K 4.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). C/N ratios showed the widest range for 1-year old sites (5-40), but 70% of the 45-year old sites showed values below 15, comparable to unmined sites. Distributional diagrams of plant species revealed their topographic and habitat preferences which may be helpful in formulating species prescriptions for revegetation. Stand-environmental complex ordinations with 53 variables in the matrix showed topographic variables to be the most important, followed by site age. This study attempted to evaluate simultaneously two major environmental factors-time and topography, as these influence the development of soils and vegetation concomitantly. The use of canonical correspondence analysis facilitated the resolution of these two major environmental factors in illustrating the relationships between the species and the environments in which they grow. Simulations with the CENTURY model of C and N dynamics on north- and south-facing slopes provided useful insights into the recovery time of mined systems. All carbon pools (except passive) were larger on the north-facing slopes than on the south, as was the accumulation of organic N. Rehabilitation of mined areas is now required by law and regulations applicable in the region under discussion mandate the following steps: regrading of ridges to blend in with the surrounding topography, spreading topsoil, fertilizing and seeding. The course of vegetation and soil development of such sites was studied intensively for four years and revealed that the first year vegetation, irrespective of desirable species seeded, was dominated by the pioneer forb, Kochia scoparia. Its replacement by seeded grasses was quick. The rapid replacement of Kochia by grasses appears to be related to the production of allelochemics by Kochia and its acting as a nurse crop in the first year. Although allelochemics may be produced by Kochia as a defense mechanism for herbivory, the compounds seem to produce ionic imbalances (P, Mn, Zn) which hasten its own demise through autotoxicity. Like the abandoned mined sites, dispersal of seeds in space (immigration) seemed to be more important than from seeds in the topsoil (seed banks- dispersal in time). But in contrast to abandoned mined sites, the managed sites showed (a) a very rapid replacement of pioneers, (b) three to five times faster rates of leaching of ions capable of diminishing plant growth, (c) 5-8 times faster rates of mineralization of ions that promote growth, and (d) successional trends followed the facilitation and auto-inhibition pathways. A comparison of abandoned and managed systems clearly shows that by following the legal mandates, the rehabilitation process can be achieved many decades sooner with human assistance.																	0032-079X						1999	213	1-2					195	220		10.1023/A:1004475206351							WOS:000083717400020

(Aquifoliaceae), an evergreen holly. It is either planted, or harvested from wild trees from the subtropical rainforests, at Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. In this last country, the world's leading producer and consumer of mate, has been extensively planted since 1903, overcoming problems such as the natural low germination rates of its seeds. From 1930's onwards, overproduction of fresh mate for the "yerba mate" industry, has led to regulatory legislation and progressively better quality control procedures upon raw materials, thus restricting misuse of alternatives Ilex species, such as I. dumosa Reissek, I. theezans C. Martius ex Reissek, etc., then involved in the industrial preparation of mate. On the other hand, market demands for uniformity concerning both quality and higher yields, have induced to start in 1974 several plant selection programmes, notably clonal propagation and interclonal breeding of selected superior progenitor trees. This fact, which obviously restricts genetic variation of a given crop species, is accompanied by a high-scale deforestation process occurring in almost the whole of Ilex paraguariensis' natural distribution area. In spite that Ilex L. has about 220-300 representatives in the rich South American native nora, hardly a dozen sympatric species occur within and/or the neighbourhood of Ilex paraguariensis' wild distribution area (i.e. Southern Brazil, Eastern Paraguay and Northeastern Argentina). This region originally almost completely covered by subtropical rainforests, which housed not only Ilex paraguariensis and its relatives -Ilex brasiliensis (Spreng.) Lees., I. brevicuspis Reissek, I. dumosa Reissek, I. microdonta Lees., I. taubertiana Lees., I. theezans C. Martius ex Reissek, Ilex affinis Gardner, I. chamaedryfolia Reissek, I. integerrima (Vell. Cone.) Lees. and I. pseudobuxus Reissek-, but also a great variety of beneficial animals such as insects involved on Ilex pollination and seed propagating birds, is nowadays a rich agroforestrial area. Extensive crops, such as maize, soybean, wheat, Parana pine, etc., and also cattle breeding, have replaced such original rainforests housing Ilex spp., thus enhancing a deep erosion process of the plant genetic resources for the mate crop. Consequently, efforts have been done by the INTA (the governmental leading Argentinean Agricultural Research Institution) at the Cerro Azul Experimental center (province of Misiones, Argentina) in order to collect and preserve alive specimens, not only from different geographical origins of Ilex paraguariensis, but also of another wild nex species. Although it has not yet been possible to fmd alive nex affinis Gardner individuals, Ilex argentina Lillo, a wild taxon from NW Argentina with an historical record as regional substitute of genuine mate, is also grown at Cerro Azul. In spite of high space and care costs originated in the maintenance of such collections as small-sized experimental plantations at Cerro Azul, they still constitute today the unique available alternative, as more rational techniques as seed bank and/or tissue culture are still under study and development for the particular case of these Ilex species. Evaluation of basic biological, phytochemical and agronomical character of these species is also being carried on. Few additional data on each species are also commented in the present paper.																	0567-7572		90-6605-991-5				1999		500					137	144		10.17660/ActaHortic.1999.500.20							WOS:000084109200020

This suggests site-specific weed management could be valuable and, in fact, herbicide use had been reduced 40 to 60% in trials of this management strategy; however, there have been few cost-benefit analyses of site-specific weed management. Our goal was to quantify the cost of identifying and counting weed seeds and seedlings to create seed bank and seedling maps for site-specific weed management. We sampled 1225 or more sites in eight commercial corn fields. Soil was collected just after planting and seeds were extracted by elutriation. Seedlings were sampled in 152 cm of crop row at the time for a postemergence decision. A model for describing the time required to count and identify weed seedlings was a log-linear form with time as a function of the number of seedlings and the number of species and, for seeds, a log-linear form with time as a function of the number of seeds and percentage of sand in the soil.																			0-89118-140-7				1999							499	510									WOS:000089526200044

The spatial distribution of a pest within a field must be known for site-specific management to be possible. With knowledge of the characteristic distribution of a pest, cost-effective sampling plans and management units can be designed for site-specific management. In 1997, two center pivot irrigated corn (Zea Mays L.) fields in eastern Colorado (175 and 130 ac.) were sampled and analyzed for weed seed bank and seedlings populations, triazine resistant pigweed seed bank, plant parasitic nematodes, white mold sclerotia, and western corn rootworm egg populations. Many crop and field attributes were sampled by other collaborating researchers. Research sampling plans were based on the biology of each pest, and time and cost constraints. Three research sampling plans were used: regular, random-directed, and star grids. There were a total of 682 observation sites in Field 1 and 621 observation sites in Field 2 that were used to sample pest populations. The size of each pest population varied between fields. Within a field pest populations tended to be spatially aggregated. Weed distributions and density varied among species. As average weed seedling or seed densities increased, the number of observation sites that were weed-free decreased. Spiral, stunt, and lesion nematode species were detected in both fields. The nematode species observed separately were spatially aggregated, but when the species were combined the spatial distribution was uniformly distributed. White mold sclerotia were not detected in either field. Western corn rootworm eggs were detected in 19 of 91 observation sites leaving most of Field 2 rootworm free. It may be possible to design directed pest sampling plans that are based on crop and field attributes.																			0-89118-140-7				1999							511	522									WOS:000089526200045

The best germinated species are subtropical or warm temperate dwellers with evergreen leaves, and for many, their fruits mature in autumn to winter. In contrast, the hardly or not germinated species, mainly inhabit deciduous forest with clear seasonality, suggesting a strategy to make a seed bank under the soil in response to fluctuating climate conditions.																	0567-7572		90-6605-792-0				1999		505					379	383		10.17660/ActaHortic.1999.505.52							WOS:000085603400052						
J	El-Kassaby, YA; Edwards, DGW				El-Kassaby, YA; Edwards, DGW			Genetic control of germination and the effects of accelerated aging in mountain hemlock seeds and its relevance to gene conservation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Genetic control of germination parameters and the effects of accelerated aging in mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana [Bong.] Carr.) seeds were investigated using standard germination tests and simulated aging, respectively. Germination parameters were studied on seeds collected from individual trees from two natural populations (Sooke and San Juan) located on southern Vancouver Island, BC. Strong genetic control was confirmed by the high heritability estimates that ranged from 0.35 to 0.82 (stratified) and from 0.58 to 0.73 (unstratified) for Sooke and from 0.30 to 0.85 (stratified) and from 0.45 to 0.84 (unstratified) for San Juan, Simulated aging was conducted on eight seedlots collected from natural stands representing the species distribution in British Columbia. Stratified and unstratified seeds were aged at 100% RH and 37.5 degrees C for 0 to 21 days at 3-day intervals. Seed aging accounted for the majority of variation which ranged from 97.61% to 99.86% of the total variation observed. Gradual loss of seed viability was observed over the aging treatments with a total loss of viability after aging for 12 days. Differential losses in viability among seedlots were maximum after aging for 6 days. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of long-term storage and the reliance on seed banks for ex-situ conservation of this species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Crawford, ER; Young, DR				Crawford, ER; Young, DR			Spatial/temporal variations in shrub thicket soil seed banks on an Atlantic coast barrier island	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Potential species replacement within low-diversity shrub thicket communities was investigated for a Virginia barrier island. Seed bank species composition was quantified in a glasshouse study using soil samples collected beneath closed Myrica cerifera thickets, as well as from thicket gaps. Samples were collected from productive and aging thickets, corresponding to differences in soil age. These data were compared to species presently occurring within the thickets and gaps. Seedbank species composition was not indicative of current community composition for either the intact thickets or the gaps. Seed banks resembled a more pioneer community. Thirteen families, 23 genera, and 25 species were identified from the seed bank beneath the M. cerifera thickets. Four species were woody. The within-gap seed bank included 19 families, 30 genera, and 34 species. Eight species were woody. The current community included 21 families, 33 genera, and 36 species beneath the intact thickets as well as within the thicket gaps. Eighteen species were woody. The species richness of gaps was more than three times that of intact thickets. For low-diversity shrub thickets, gaps enhance species richness.																	0002-9122					DEC	1998	85	12					1739	1744		10.2307/2446508							WOS:000077696200010	21680334					
J	Albrecht, H; Mattheis, A				Albrecht, H; Mattheis, A			The effects of organic and integrated farming on rare arable weeds on the Forschungsverbund Agrarokosysteme Munchen (FAM) research station in southern Bavaria	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Since the compensation for unsprayed field margin strips was recently reduced in Germany, the area used in this way has rapidly declined. These experiences show that management restrictions for the sake of species conservation are only accepted when high compensation is paid and efficiency is regularly controlled. The aim of the present investigation was to determine if conservation of arable weeds could be reached by management systems without imposing such restrictions; Therefore, 110 ha farmland, situated in the Tertiarhugelland in southern Bavaria, was investigated to compare the effects of a change from conventional farming to an organic and an integrated cultivation system. Four years after the change to the integrated farming system, the number of rare species had decreased at 90% of all sampling points where they occurred. This development seems mainly to be caused by minimum tillage, which was applied to prevent soil erosion. In the organic management area, rare weed species were observed at 94 grid points. At 33% of them weeds decreased, at 41% they remained unaffected, and at 26% weeds increased in number. Among the species occurring often enough for a statistical analysis, four did not change significantly, while Legousia speculum-veneris was found more frequently. Investigations in the population development at selected points showed a differing response of individual species to these management changes. Nevertheless, frequencies as well as densities of the rare weeds stayed constant within the fields under organic management. This and the respective literature lead to the conclusion that the influence exerted on rare weed species by the organic cultivation system is neutral to positive. Thus, organic management could be at least a way to prevent further decline in rare weeds. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Urbanska, KM; Fattorini, M				Urbanska, KM; Fattorini, M			Seed bank studies in the Swiss Alps - II. Restoration plots on a high-alpine ski run	BOTANICA HELVETICA												Soil seed banks in trial plots, installed on a machine-graded downhill ski run at ca. 2500 m were studied about 10 years after restoration in spring and autumn samples. This is the first report on post-restoration development of the soil seed reserve in a high-alpine site. Unless otherwise specified, the data presented below refer to means+/-standard error values. The density of the germinable fraction of the seed reserve recorded in the autumn samples averaged 916+/-210 seeds per m(2) in the plots RPF; the corresponding value in the plots RPG was lower (611+/-333 seeds per m(2)). After the spring snowmelt in the following year a diminished density (698+/-270 seeds per m(2)) was observed in the plots RPE but in the plots RPG a considerable increase (3580+/-1701 seeds per m(2)) was recorded. The differences between the two plot groups and between sampling seasons were not statistically significant because of the large variance. In the autumn samples, seven species were identified among the retrieved seedlings, and two further species were registered in the small un-germinated fraction. The spring samples included only four identified species within the germinable fraction; no further species were determined among many dormant seeds. The alpha-diversity studies revealed some salient features: (1) the soil seed reserve included mostly immigrant species, and only few species used in the restoration were represented; (2) compared to the standing vegetation, much fewer species occurred in the soil samples: (3) the relative frequency of species in the seed reserve did not correspond to the species frequency in the plant cover of the plots. Considered both in the terms of diaspore accumulation and increase of alpha-diversity, the soil seed reserve developed within only ca 10 years after restoration represents an important symptom of active plant population processes occurring in the restoration plots.																	0253-1453					DEC	1998	108	2					289	301									WOS:000077822600007

Within the forest floor, acorns were placed within the L layer, at the upper-F/lower-F interface, and at the lower-F/mineral-soil interface. Winds for a backfire and headfire were generated by electric box-fans. After the burns, acorns were transferred to moist sand flats, stratified for an additional 16 days, then assessed for viability during a 45-day germination test. As depth within the forest floor increased, germinative capacity of acorns increased. All acorns placed within the L layer during prescribed burning failed to germinate. Germinative capacity of acorns placed at the upper-F/lower-F interface was lower (P=0.03) in the backfire (8.75%) than in the headfire (55.00%). At the lower-F/mineral-soil interface, there was no difference (P=0.09) in germinative capacity between backfire (92%) and headfire (89%), and their mean was no different (P=0.26) than the 93% achieved by unburned control acorns.																	1049-8001					DEC	1998	8	4					199	203		10.1071/WF9980199							WOS:000079118900003						
J	Grime, JP				Grime, JP			Benefits of plant diversity to ecosystems: immediate, filter and founder effects	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories - dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence: a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A 'mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.																	0022-0477					DEC	1998	86	6					902	910		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00306.x							WOS:000077806000001						
J	Enright, NJ; Marsula, R; Lamont, BB; Wissel, C				Enright, NJ; Marsula, R; Lamont, BB; Wissel, C			The ecological significance of canopy seed storage in fire-prone environments: a model for non-sprouting shrubs	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 A comprehensive data set on age, survival and reproduction for the non-sprouting (fire-killed) shrub Banksia hookeriana, encompassing 13 years of measurements at 15 sites in south-western Australia, and including 10 fires, was used to parameterize a computer model to investigate optimum plant life-history strategies in a fire-prone environment. Parameter ranges encompassed life-history information for other non-sprouting Banksia species from the same region. 2 The relationship between fire interval and level of canopy seed storage (serotiny) was analysed to identify the circumstances under which serotiny is favoured, and what degree of serotiny maximizes potential population growth rate. In addition to deterministic versions of the model, stochasticity in fire interval and conditions for recruitment were analysed. 3 The deterministic model indicated a maximum finite rate of natural increase (lambda = 1.15) when the fire interval was 16 years and all seeds were retained on the plant until fire occurred. Although the model failed to predict the intermediate degrees of serotiny present in nature, it supported the optimum fire interval predicted from canopy seed bank dynamics. 4 Changes to biological attributes associated with timing of reproduction and longevity shifted the optimum fire interval and estimated rate of population growth, but did not alter the conclusions concerning serotiny. Although shorter seed longevity and increased rates of predation and/or decay reduced the value of serotiny, even very low levels of canopy seed storage increased species fitness under intermediate fire frequencies (10-20 years). 5 If the probability of inter-fire recruitment and survival was increased, optimum growth shifted from strong serotiny under a regime of frequent fire (< 20 year interval), to weak (or no) serotiny where the interval between successive fires was long ( > 40 year interval). 6 Stochasticity around mean fire interval resulted in intermediate to strong (but not complete) serotiny being predicted as optimal once the CV for fire interval approached 100%, This result is interpreted as a bet-hedging strategy whereby spontaneous release of some seeds during the inter-fire period permits recruitment on rare occasions where fire interval approaches or exceeds the species longevity.

J	Goldberg, DE; Estabrook, GF				Goldberg, DE; Estabrook, GF			Separating the effects of number of individuals sampled and competition on species diversity: an experimental and analytic approach	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Species richness typically increases with the number of individuals sampled, although many ecological processes that influence species richness are also well known to depend on density of individuals. We separated the effects of density on species richness that are due to sampling, from those due to density-dependent ecological processes such as competition or predation, by manipulating the density of an entire community. 2 A seed bank from a community of desert annual plants that occur on semi-stabilized sand dunes in Israel was collected from the field and sown in an experimental garden at a range of densities from 1/16 to eight times the natural density. The species pool observed in the lowest density plots was used as the null community, which was repeatedly sampled to calculate the species richness land other diversity indices) in higher density plots that would be expected from sampling considerations alone. The significance of deviations of observed diversity from this expected diversity was then evaluated. 3 Both observed and expected number of species increased substantially with the experimental increase in density. However, observed species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were often significantly lower than that expected based on sampling considerations. The magnitude of the deviation from expected increased significantly with increasing density for richness and the Shannon-Wiener index. This provides some of the first direct experimental evidence from diverse natural assemblages that increasing competition among all the individuals in a community can lead to competitive exclusion.																	0022-0477					DEC	1998	86	6					983	988		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00319.x							WOS:000077806000008

These included Agrostis capillaris (the dominant species Frier to disturbance), Myosotis arvensis and Veronica arvensis. 3 Five species, including Sagina apetala, Senecio jacobaea and Veronica arvensis, showed significantly higher cover on plots where rabbit pellets were left in situ. 4 From calculations it appeared that rabbit-dispersed seeds accounted for 15% of the developing higher plant cover, other means of dispersal from outside the plot accounted for 40%. and regeneration from the seed bank accounted for 35%. 5 Similar calculations suggested that three higher plant species, Geranium molle, Myosotis arvensis and Senecio jacobaea, appeared to depend most on non-rabbit dispersed seed for colonization of bare ground. 6 High concentrations of Ui-rica dioica in pellets contrasted with its poor establishment in the experiment. However, the other common species in the pellets, Sagina apetala, Senecio jacobaea and Veronica arvensis, all established in greater numbers on the plots where the pellets were not removed. 7 Seed bank content correlated well with the pattern of regeneration for Agrostis capillaris, Holcus lanatus. Myosotis arvensis and Veronica arvensis. However, removal of the seed bank did not have a significant effect on the regeneration of either of the most common species in the seed bank, Rumex acetosella and Sagina apetala. 8 No species appeared to be reliant on only one mechanism for regeneration from seed in disturbed areas in this community,				Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015	Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133												0022-0477					DEC	1998	86	6					1032	1041		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00327.x							WOS:000077806000012						
J	Peco, B; Ortega, M; Levassor, C				Peco, B; Ortega, M; Levassor, C			Similarity between seed bank and vegetation in Mediterranean grassland: a predictive model	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The similarity in species composition between seed bank and vegetation was analysed in Mediterranean grasslands in relation to altitude, topography and grazing. Soil samples were collected in permanent plots in autumn at the end of the summer drought period and in spring, before the new seed fall and after the natural winter seed stratification. The seed bank composition was determined by greenhouse germination over a nine-month period. Presence/absence of species in the standing vegetation throughout the complete annual cycle, and the percentage area of bare ground in October, were recorded in the same plots. The species composition of the standing vegetation is clearly determined by altitude, topography and grazing, while the floristic composition of the seed banks is only related to altitude and topography in the case of autumn seed bank and with any of the three factors in the spring seed bank. Relative abundances of grasses, legumes and forbs also show different patterns in vegetation and seed bank data. Sorensen similarity between the autumn seed bank and the vegetation declines as altitude rises, but there are no significant differences for topography and grazing. This similarity decreases in the case of the spring seed bank and does not show any significant relationship with any of the factors. The perennial/annual ratio and the proportion of bare soil in October are proposed as explanatory variables in a predictive model of similarity between the seed composition of the seed bank and vegetation.

The seed density increased substantially from lower marsh (2987 seed m(-2)) to upper marsh (141,509 seed m(-2)). The seed bank contained only dominant species in the lower marsh, however, the number of species in the seed bank increased towards the upper marsh. A. macrostachyum constituted about 97% of the seed bank. Density and height of plants were higher in the middle marsh. Plant cover and number of branches were lowest in lower marsh and increased substantially in next zone, with no significant differences among other zones. Dry weight accumulation was highest in lower-middle marsh.

J	Akinola, MO; Thompson, K; Hillier, SH				Akinola, MO; Thompson, K; Hillier, SH			Development of soil seed banks beneath synthesized meadow communities after seven years of climate manipulations	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Meadow microcosms were established from seed on low-fertility soil of known seed bank composition, and subjected to manipulations of simulated grazing, cutting date, temperature and fertility for seven years. The composition and density of the seed bank was then determined in five 2-cm soil layers (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 cm). The seed bank contained three distinct groups of species: species present in the original soil, sown species, and 'others'. The seed bank was little affected by the experimental treatments, presumably because the sown species made only a small contribution to the seed bank. Nearly all the species in the original soil are known to possess persistent seed banks and had survived, although at reduced density, for seven years. Density of the most abundant species in this group, Sagina procumbens, had changed very little over seven years, confirming the well-documented longevity of the seeds of this species. Seeds of sown species made up only about a quarter of the seed bank, despite accounting for virtually all the above-ground vegetation. Of the sown meadow species, only Plantago lanceolata and Alopecurus pratensis were relatively abundant in the seed bank. These results strongly support the conclusion of other authors that most meadow species, once lost owing to the effects of fertilizers or inappropriate management, will not reestablish from the seed bank. Among species which were neither sown nor present in the original soil, the majority possessed adaptations for wind dispersal and had presumably dispersed into the experimental plots from outside. The most abundant member of this group, Betula pendula, had dispersed from a nearby tree. Density of Betula seeds declined sharply with depth, consistent with the view that seeds on the soil surface are rapidly lost, mainly through germination, but seeds that become buried survive much better. Seeds of Betula appear to be persistent but not particularly long-lived.																	0960-2585					DEC	1998	8	4					493	500		10.1017/S0960258500004463							WOS:000078103200012						
J	Baskin, JM; Nan, XY; Baskin, CC				Baskin, JM; Nan, XY; Baskin, CC			A comparative study of seed dormancy and germination in an annual and a perennial species of Senna (Fabaceae)	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed dormancy and germination of Senna marilandica and S. obtusifolia were compared in greenhouse and laboratory studies. About 90% of the S. obtusifolia seeds were green and had hard seed coat dormancy, whereas the other 10% were brown and nondormant. Seed-colour morphs did not occur in S. marilandica, and nearly 100% of the seeds had hard seed coat dormancy. Seeds of S. obtusifolia were significantly heavier than those of S. marilandica. Mechanical scarification was very effective in overcoming dormancy in seeds of both species. However, concentrated sulfuric acid, absolute ethanol and boiling water were less effective in breaking dormancy in seeds of S. marilandica than in those of S. obtusifolia. Further, incubating seeds at 30/15 to 40/25 degrees C and dry-heat treatments at 80-100 degrees C were ineffective in breaking dormancy in S. marilandica, but significantly increased germination percentages in S. obtusifolia. In neither species were simulated daily/seasonal temperature shifts effective in breaking dormancy. Scarified seeds of both species germinated over a wide range of temperatures in both light and darkness. Under near-natural temperature conditions, seeds of S. marilandica germinated in spring only, whereas those of S. obtusifolia emerged in late spring and throughout summer. Both species can form a long-lived seed bank. Dormancy break by high field temperatures in seeds of S. obtusifolia allows this species to germinate throughout the warm growing season and thus contributes to its success as a weed in arable crops.																	0960-2585					DEC	1998	8	4					501	512		10.1017/S0960258500004475							WOS:000078103200013						
J	Hulme, PE				Hulme, PE			Post-dispersal seed predation and seed bank persistence	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												This study examines whether post-dispersal seed predators could be an important selective force in determining the seed bank strategies of grassland plants. It tests the hypothesis that species with persistent seed banks should sustain proportionally less predation of buried seeds than species which have transient seed banks and that this should be true irrespective of seed size. Results are drawn from a field experiment examining the relative susceptibility of surface versus buried seeds for 19 herbaceous taxa exhibiting different degrees of seed bank persistence. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that seed predators (rodents) influence the seed bank characteristics of seeds. Rodents removed proportionally more large seeds than small seeds and removed a smaller proportion of seeds with persistent rather than transient seed banks, independently of seed size. On average, burial reduced seed removal by almost 50%. The decrease in rates of seed removal following burial was marked for seeds with persistent seed banks but negligible for seeds with transient seed banks. Herbaceous plants with relatively large seeds (seed mass > 1 mg) that form persistent seed banks were either completely avoided or only consumed in small quantities by rodents. In contrast, large-seeded species with transient seed banks suffer high rates of seed predation. Models of life-history evolution predict tradeoffs between seed dormancy and seed mass since dormancy and seed size are correlated traits that both reduce risk in variable environments and thus will show patterns of negative covariation. This paper presents an alternative explanation for this trade-off based on experimental evidence of a negative relationship between seed bank persistence and predation risk.

J	Ashton, PMS; Harris, PG; Thadani, R				Ashton, PMS; Harris, PG; Thadani, R			Soil seed bank dynamics in relation to topographic position of a mixed-deciduous forest in southern New England, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We examined the floristic significance of soil seed banks in relation to valley, midslope and ridge sites in a 70-90-year old forest in northeastern Connecticut. A-horizon mineral soils were collected to 5 cm depth in the early spring from forest understory sites across the topography. Samples from each of the sites were exposed to full sun within a greenhouse. Records of germination were made at regular intervals over a 60-day period. These showed significant differences among sites in number of species and total number of germinants. Greatest numbers of species and germinants were recorded from valley sites and these progressively declined from midslope to ridgetop. Twenty-five different species were identified. Species were grouped into growth habits - graminoids, herbs, shrubs, trees, and vines. Over 61% of all germinants across all sites were graminoids. Seventy-four percent of all germinants in the valley sites were graminoids, with over 93% of them represented by two Sedge species, Carer glaucodea and C. lupulina. On the ridgetop sites graminoids were more evenly distributed among six different species. The percentage in each growth habit changed rank across topographic position with germinants of graminoids and trees most abundant on valley sites; herbs, on midslopes, and shrubs, on ridgetops. All germinants, except for those of the trees, Carer spp., and two herb species were weedy species that were not characteristic of the existing vegetation. Germinants of the trees, Carer spp., and herbs that were characteristic of the existing vegetation were mostly confined to soils from the valley sites. Two weedy herbs, Plantago major and Verbascum thapsus, are exotic introductions that originally came from Europe. Only one vine, Vitis aestivalis, from a midslope site germinated. Species diversity is higher on midslope sites than valleys and ridgetops. The significance of these findings in relation to site productivity and disturbance history is discussed.

This paper reports results of field experiments conducted for 6 yr to examine changes in weed seed numbers due to management practices. We evaluated the effect of tillage, herbicide application, and interrow cultivation on meed seed numbers in a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]/corn (Zea mays L.) rotation and in continuous corn. Treatment effects on meed seed numbers were more repetitive in soybean/corn than continuous corn. Foxtails (Setaria spp.) were the meed class most affected by treatments. Weed seeds were uniformly distributed among sampling depths in conventional tillage and concentrated near the soil surface in reduced tillage and no-tillage. We expected weed seeds to become more numerous in the top 5 cm of soil as tillage was reduced. Tillage, as a main effect, rarely influenced weed seed numbers; therefore, we inferred that weed seed losses at the surface must have increased in reduced-tillage plots. Seed numbers were uniform among soil depths if herbicides were broadcast, but differed if herbicides were banded or omitted, due to increased seed deposition at the surface. Tillage affected vertical distribution of seeds, while the quantity of weed seeds in the top 5 cm of soil was regulated by weed control practices. This indicates that reducing weed seed deposition could be helpful for maintaining weed seeds in reduced-tillage systems at numbers similar to those of intensively tilled systems.																	0002-1962					NOV-DEC	1998	90	6					793	799									WOS:000078678900013

J	Horvitz, CC; Pascarella, JB; McMann, S; Freedman, A; Hofstetter, RH				Horvitz, CC; Pascarella, JB; McMann, S; Freedman, A; Hofstetter, RH			Functional roles of invasive non-indigenous plants in hurricane-affected subtropical hardwood forests	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Native forest species exhibit a well-known range of ecological roles with respect to natural disturbance regimes, from pioneer phase to mature phase, and they regenerate from a range of sources, including dormant seeds, seed rain, pre-established juveniles, and resprouts from damaged adults. In contrast, the ecological roles of invasive, non-indigenous species in forest communities after natural disturbances are not well understood. Some previous studies of invasive species have emphasized their weedy nature and their ability to colonize anthropogenic disturbances. Tropical hardwood hammock forests in southern Florida experience frequent disturbance by hurricanes. Our studies of forest regeneration during two years following a recent severe hurricane suggest that invasive non-indigenous forest species exhibit the same range of ecological roles as native forest species and compete with native species for particular kinds of regeneration opportunities. To study ecological roles of non-indigenous species in regenerating forests after Hurricane Andrew, we set up four large study areas at each of three study sites that had differing amounts of hurricane-caused canopy disturbance. There were two pairs of 30 x 60 m research plots per site, and in each pair there was one control plot and one restoration plot; restoration areas were subject to an aggressive management program, focused on reducing non-indigenous vine cover. Within these study areas we subsampled vegetation in small study plots that were regularly spaced, and conducted vegetation censuses in April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2 yr, beginning in April 1993. We found that the source of regeneration for forest species was dependent upon the amount of canopy disturbance, the time since disturbance, and the autecology of the constituent species. Overall, 28% of the 90 species were non-indigenous: 34% of the vines (N = 32) and 24% of other life-forms (N = 58). Non-indigenous vines seemed to have a special role; not only could they compete with native vines, but they could also negatively affect the regeneration of other natives from a diverse array of sources including pre-established juveniles and resprouts from damaged adults. Both native and non-indigenous vine cover in unmanipulated study areas increased following the hurricane. Non-indigenous vine species had higher cover than native vine species, and many species formed dense "blankets." Non-indigenous species in general (not just vines) did not differ significantly from native species in seed mass, nor were they restricted to the pioneer type of life history. Many non-indigenous species had invaded forests prior to hurricane disturbance and had their own banks of pre-established juveniles; others recruited from dormant seeds, seed rain, and/or resprouts from pre-established adults. Based on information on source of regeneration and impact on native species, we propose a classification scheme for functional roles of non-indigenous invasive species in forests. To investigate whether non-indigenous taxa had roles in other geographic regions similar to those they had in Florida, we reviewed literature for 50 taxa belonging to genera that have species known to be invasive in southern Florida. We found that these taxa were invasive or had congeners that were invasive in other geographic regions (Western Australia, the Mariana Islands, Hawaii, the Mascarene Islands, and South Africa). We propose that taxa predominantly retain their invasive, functional-role type across regions. Thus, studies of ecological roles of invasive species with respect to natural disturbance regimes in one region may help us predict invasive roles in other regions.																	1051-0761					NOV	1998	8	4					947	974		10.2307/2640954							WOS:000077129600005						
J	Linder, CR				Linder, CR			Potential persistence of transgenes: Seed performance of transgenic canola and wild x canola hybrids	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Because wild, weedy-ephemeral species take advantage of periodic disturbance For growth and reproduction, many have considerable seed dormancy and longevity, coupled with germination cued on environmental changes correlated with disturbance. Brassica napus canola is derived from a weedy ephemeral and has sexually compatible wild relatives that are weedy ephemerals, most notably B. rapa. Hence, if transgenes introduced into B. napus canola alter its seed bank dynamics to be more similar to its wild relatives, the chance of transgene escape and persistence is increased. Further, if introgression of the transgene into a wild relative enhances or does not disrupt the seed bank dynamics of wild plants, the transgene could persist in wild populations. I conducted experiments with transgenic, oil-modified B. napus canola (high-stearate and high-laurate types) and wild B. rapa x B. napus canola hybrids (high-laurate type) to determine whether they possessed seed dormancy and germination cuing characteristics favoring persistence of escaped transgenes. Seeds of high-stearate B. napus canola and its untransformed parental type were germinated in growth chambers in a complete factorial design of light (full light, darkness, simulated foliage shade), nutrient concentration (high, low), and temperature (10 degrees, 20 degrees, 35 degrees C). Most combinations of factors did not alter high-stearate canola's timing of germination or total proportion of seeds germinated relative to its nonpersistent parental control. Where effects were seen, they were disadvantageous, with high-stearate seeds germinating more slowly than controls (35 degrees C:full light:high nutrient) and in lower proportions (35 degrees C:darkness:high nutrient and 35 degrees C:full Light:high nutrient). Ungerminated high-stearate seeds in treatment combinations having reduced germination were primarily dormant rather than dead. Although most of their dormancy was enforced by high temperature, under some conditions (35 degrees C:full light:high nutrients and 35 degrees C:darkness:low nutrients), I detected significantly higher levels of induced dormancy for high-stearate seeds relative to controls. Hence, persistent high-stearate canola seed banks could form under some field conditions. For high-laurate B. napus canola and high-laurate wild B. rapa x B. napus canola hybrids and their controls, I germinated seeds in growth chambers, varying light and nutrients using the same treatments as above in a complete factorial design. Temperature was maintained at 10 degrees C. High-laurate canola germinated later than its parental control, with the difference enhanced by low nutrients, In low nutrients, high-laurate canola also germinated at a lower proportion than its control. Both of these altered germination characteristics do not favor population persistence of high-laurate canola. Under some conditions (darkness:high nutrients), high-laurate canola had higher overall dormancy and induced dormancy than its control, suggesting the possibility of increased seed bank persistence. Finally, in spite of expectations that, the high-laurate wild x crop hybrid would show strong maternal effects, this hybrid and the hybrid control always germinated at proportions at or near 1.0, whereas the wild parent had very low germination proportions and high levels of dormancy, especially in simulated foliage shade. These results suggest that high-laurate wild-crop hybrids lack germination cuing mechanisms and will germinate primarily at inappropriate times. However, when they do germinate with wild B. rapa, they are likely to compete well with it because the high-laurate hybrids germinated and grew as fast or faster than their wild parental control. This should provide opportunities for backcrossing to wild B. rapa.																	1051-0761					NOV	1998	8	4					1180	1195									WOS:000077129600022

(Field pansy) were carried out from 1981-96 in a long-term experiment (rotation beets- winter wheat - winter barley) with different weed control frequencies in the cereal crops. Data from two experiments in winter wheat on seed production influenced by nitrogen fertilization and on losses of produced fresh seeds were added. In barley, the development of seed-producing plants was more important for the population than in wheat. Under fertilized conditions, the seed bank and the actual infestations only rose if weed control was consequently omitted in barley. Herbicide treatments according to economic thresholds for all parts of the weed infestation never focused V. arvensis, bur the population development was efficiently restricted by secondary effects of the applied herbicides. Development and reproduction of individual plants of V. arvensis were supported by N-fertilization. However, reduced fertilization supported the entire population, since in the than less competitive barley, V. arvensis can achieve a higher effective reproduction.																	0340-8159					NOV	1998	105	6					641	654									WOS:000078442000010						
J	Appleby, MWA				Appleby, MWA			The incidence of exotic species following clearfelling of Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Central Highlands, Victoria	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Invasion by exotic species following clearfelling of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. (Mountain Ash) forest was examined in the Toolangi State Forest in the Central Highlands of Victoria. Coupes ranging in age from < 1- to 10-years-old and the spar-stage forests (1939 bushfire regrowth) adjacent to each of these coupes and a mature, 250-year-old forest were surveyed. The dispersal and establishment of weeds was facilitated by clearfelling. An influx of seeds of exotic species was detected in recently felled coupes but not in the adjacent, unlogged forests. Vehicles and frequently disturbed areas, such as roadside verges, are likely sources of the seeds of exotic species. The soil seed bank of younger coupes had a greater number and percentage of seeds of exotics than the 10-year-old coupes and the spar-stage and mature forests. Exotic species were a minor component (< 1% vegetation cover) in the more recently logged coupes and were not present in 10-year-old coupes and the spar-stage and mature forests. These particular exotic species did nor persist in the dense regeneration nor exist in the older forests because the weeds were ruderal species (light-demanding, short-lived and short-statured plants). The degree of influence that these particular exotic species have on the regeneration and survival of native species in E. regnans forests is almost negligible. However, the current management practices may need to be addressed to prevent a more threatening exotic species from establishing in these coupes and forests.																	0307-692X					OCT	1998	23	5					457	465		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00753.x							WOS:000076426300006						
J	Oakley, BB; Franklin, JF				Oakley, BB; Franklin, JF			Bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata) distribution, successional dynamics, and implications for the role of the seed bank	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata (Dougl.) Walp.) is a largely unstudied early successional tree native to the Pacific Northwest. We used multiple regression and regression tree analyses to identify the most significant variables describing the distribution of bitter cherry populations in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. To determine if bitter cherry relies on a soil seed bank for regeneration after disturbance, we compared successional patterns to direct measures of buried seed. Measurements from 78 sites ranging in age from 1 to 50 years since disturbance and 29 years of permanent plot data showed density, constancy, and cover were low in the first decade after disturbance and did not peak until the third decade. Based on these patterns, we inferred that bitter cherry is not an obligate seed bank species. We did find viable seeds stored in the soil (25.0 +/- 6.4 seeds/m(2) (mean +/- SE) on sites with >600 live stems/ha) but concluded that historical disturbance intervals greater than the length of time seeds can remain viable in the soil have limited bitter cherry regeneration from a seed bank and, as a result, its distribution and abundance. Bitter cherry may play an increasingly important role in Pacific Northwest forests given the large areas of early successional habitat created by frequent timber harvests.

J	Tierney, GL; Fahey, TJ				Tierney, GL; Fahey, TJ			Soil seed bank dynamics of pin cherry in a northern hardwood forest, New Hampshire, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												The soil seed bank of the low-value, pioneer tree pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica L.f.) appears to increase markedly after multiple, large-scale disturbance events, which may result in interference with the growth of high-value species. Seven northern hardwood forest sites of varying age and disturbance history in the White Mountains of New Hampshire were examined to quantify the patterns of accumulation and depletion of the pin cherry soil seed bank. The pin cherry seed bank accumulated in a predictable fashion based on pin cherry stem abundance. High- and low-density populations accumulated approximately 440 and 1900 viable seeds per pin cherry stem, respectively. Depletion of the seed bank appeared to be negligible in stands between age 40 and 60, and moderate (30% loss over 20 years) in stands between age 95 and 115. Short (e.g., 60-year) harvest rotation times may triple the size of the pin cherry soil seed bank, causing proliferation of this species with consequences for ecosystem and community dynamics, whereas longer rotation times of 120 years may allow enough depletion of the seed bank to stabilize population sizes.																	0045-5067					OCT	1998	28	10					1471	1480		10.1139/cjfr-28-10-1471							WOS:000078057400005						
J	Mortsch, LD				Mortsch, LD			Assessing the impact of climate change on the Great Lakes shoreline wetlands	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Great Lakes shoreline wetlands are adapted to a variable water supply. They require the disturbance of water revel fluctuations to maintain their productivity. However, the magnitude and rate of climate change could alter the hydrology of the Great Lakes and affect wetland ecosystems. Wetlands would have to adjust to a new pattern of water level fluctuations; the timing, duration, and range of these fluctuations are critical to the wetland ecosystem response. Two "what if" scenarios: (1) an increased frequency and duration of low water levels and (2) a changed temporal distribution and amplitude of seasonal water levels were developed to assess the sensitivity of shoreline wetlands to climate change. Wetland functions and values such as wildlife, waterfowl and fish habitat, water quality, areal extent, and vegetation diversity are affected by these scenarios. Key wetlands are at risk, particularly those that are impeded from adapting to the new water level conditions by man-made structures or geomorphic conditions. Wetland remediation, protection and enhancement policies and programs must consider climate change as an additional stressor of wetlands.																	0165-0009					OCT	1998	40	2					391	416		10.1023/A:1005445709728							WOS:000076637300013						
J	Ghassali, F; Osman, AE; Cocks, PS				Ghassali, F; Osman, AE; Cocks, PS			Rehabilitation of degraded grasslands in north Syria: The use of Awassi sheep to disperse the seeds of annual pasture legumes	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Four experiments were conducted to facilitate the improvement of degraded grasslands in north Syria. The first examined the survival of legume seeds fed to penned Awassi wethers. The second and third observed the germination and establishment of legumes from faecal pellets in the field and in a glasshouse respectively. The fourth explored the possibility of transporting seeds from legume-rich (source) to legume-poor (target) grasslands using commercial hocks on communally-owned land. Seeds of small-seeded clovers passed through sheep in greater numbers (58-72%) than did seeds of larger-seeded species (10-40%). Of the clover seeds Trifolium campestre (seed size 0.45 mg) disintegrated least (72% passage) and T. haussknechtii (seed size 2.68 mg) disintegrated most (10% passage). Recoveries of Medicago noeana and Scorpiurus muricatus seeds were larger than expected on the basis of their seed sizes. Maximum rate of recovery was at 36 h after the seed meal for all species, all seeds were recovered by 120 h and 90% of the recovered seeds were passed in 72 h. Ingestion had little effect on the hardness and viability of most seeds. Experiments 2 and 3 suggested that seeds in pellets germinated and established as successfully as naked seeds. Burial increased establishment, whether in the field or under conditions of low moisture stress in the glasshouse. The small-seeded clovers, T. tomentosum and T. campestre, established most successfully whether from pellets or from naked seeds. About 500 seeds m(-2) were successfully transported from the source to the target grassland. About half were Trigonella monspeliaca, a naturally-occurring legume found on both the source and target grasslands. Of the species sown on the source grassland, 115 seeds m(-2) of Trifolium campestre (33% of the source seed bank), 62 seeds m(-2) of T. tomentosum (27%) and 78 seeds m(-2) of T. purpureum (21%) were detected in the target. Few medics were transported (for example, < 2% of M. noeana). Apart from Trigonella monspeliaca, Trifolium tomentosum (16 plants m(-2)) was the most frequent species found in the target grassland in the following April. The results suggest that using sheep is a cheap and practical way of dispersing the seeds of pasture legumes and thereby improving the degraded grasslands of north Syria. They clearly demonstrate the role of small-seeded legumes (<1 mg) in grassland improvement, especially the small-seeded clovers.																	0014-4797					OCT	1998	34	4					391	405		10.1017/S0014479798004086							WOS:000076640200003						
J	Jensen, K				Jensen, K			Species composition of soil seed bank and seed rain of abandoned wet meadows and their relation to aboveground vegetation	FLORA												Until the late fifties of this century species rich wet meadows were characteristic of the swampy alluvial plains in Schleswig-Holstein (north-western Germany). Today many of these meadows undergo successional changes due to abandonment. The vegetation development after abandonment can be characterised as a sequence of different successional stages. After an initial phase (successional stage I) follows a phase of clonal expansion of highly competitive species (successional stage II) and a phase of immigration and establishment (successional stages III and IV). In the course of succession species richness decreases and highly productive vegetation-stands develope. Species contributing to successional changes can either be present in the initial aboveground vegetation, in the soil seed bank or in the seed rain. The species composition of the seed bank and of the seed rain of different successional stages of abandoned wet meadows was investigated. Furthermore the relation between aboveground vegetation and seed bank and between aboveground vegetation and seed rain were determined using a cluster analysis. Seeds of some typical wet meadow (Lychnis flos-cuculi) and forage meadow species (Cardamine pratensis, Cerastium holosteoides, Ranunculus repens, Poa trivialis) are regulary present in the seed bank of later successional stages, whereas they are absent in the aboveground vegetation there. Thus the aboveground vegetation of permanent plots of the early successional stage I clusters with the seed bank of all permanent plots in the cluster analysis. On the other hand the aboveground vegetation of the permanent plots of the later successional stages II and III constitute cluster. The results of this study support the view, that even if the seed bank of later successional stages contains some species of earlier stages, the possibility to re-establish species rich meadows from species poor fallows is relatively low. This is due to the fact, that seedling-densities of meadow species are decreasing exponentially during succession. Furthermore, rare or endangered plant species are scarcely ever found in the seed bank. The seed rain contains almost exclusively species of the aboveground vegetation present on the permanent plots and the surrounding area. No diaspores of characteristic meadow species were trapped in the seed traps, if these species were absent from the aboveground vegetation or did not produce seeds during the investigation period. Thus, the similarity of the aboveground vegetation of all permanent plots with the seed rain is very high; cluster analysis indicates that the aboveground vegetation of each permanent plot clusters with the seed rain of the same plot. The great similarity of the aboveground vegetation of all permanent plots with the seed rain is caused by the small dispersal distances of most of the occurring species. Both diaspores of herbaceous (Urtica dioica, Galeopsis tetrahit agg.) and woody (Alnus glutinosa, Betula pubescens, Salix alba) invasive species were trapped in seed traps in some cases. It can be concluded that the seed rain of abandoned wet meadows has an essential impact on progressive secondary succession (transition between successional stage II and III and between successional stage III and IV), while it has only a subordinate role in restoring species rich wet meadows from abandoned sites, that is in regresive succession.

J	Teketay, D				Teketay, D			The role of light and temperature in the germination of twenty herbaceous species from the highlands of Ethiopia	FLORA												The effects of different light qualities, i.e. white light, darkness and light filtered through green leaves, as well as constant (10-30 degrees C) and diurnally alternating temperatures (20 versus 20/12, 30/12 and 35/12 degrees C) on seed germination of 20 herbaceous species from the highlands of Ethiopia were tested in a laboratory and a glasshouse. Species differed considerably with respect to the capacity of fresh seeds to germinate at 20 degrees C in light. Only six of the species showed more than 80% germination whereas in seven of the species germination ranged from 1-50%, and in seven of them none of the fresh seeds germinated. In the laboratory test of fresh seeds, 11 of the species had significantly higher percent germination in light than in darkness. In the glasshouse, percent germination from seeds incubated in daylight was significantly higher than those incubated in darkness or under leaf shade for 15 out of 17 species tested, indicating the induction of secondary dormancy during incubation in either darkness or leaf shade. The species showed diverse responses to the various constant temperature treatments. For six of the species germination was more than 50% at all of the constant temperatures whereas for seven of the species germination was less than 50% at the different constant temperatures. Germination was more than 50% at the constant temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C but lower than 43% at 10 degrees C for four of the species. For one of the species, germination was more than 50% at the constant temperatures between 10 and 25 but germination declined to 18% at 30 degrees C. Of the 16 species tested, 11 showed significantly higher germination from at least one of the alternating temperatures than the control. The results provide evidence that germination of almost all of the species studied is inhibited or greatly suppressed by either darkness or leaf shade or both, suggesting that germination and establishment of the species would be prevented if the seeds are buried deep into the soil or dispersed under vegetation canopy. The positive germination responses of seeds to alternating temperatures indicates that the species require disturbances resulting in the formation of gaps and/or in exposing seeds to the soil surface if they are buried deep into the soil or dispersed under vegetation canopy. The results agree well with the ecology of the species studied, since almost all of them are known to form persistent soil seed banks in the highlands of Ethiopia.																	0367-2530					OCT	1998	193	4					411	423									WOS:000076571400006

We investigated the vertical distribution of seeds in the soil, using data from nine studies in five European countries. We discovered significant correlations between seed shape and distribution in the soil. 2. The classification of the longevity of seeds of plant species has been improved by the introduction of a 'longevity index', expressing on a continuous scale the most recent information on seed longevity represented as the proportion of non-transient seed bank records in the database of Thompson et al. (1997). Remarkably, no difference in seed longevity was found if the index was based on direct observations only when compared with the index based on the complete data set where indirect, 'depth-derived' observations were included. 3. Seed longevity was best estimated using a multiple regression model with an integrated measure of seed size and shape and depth distribution of seeds. 4. The shape of seeds, known to be a consistent character of species, was shown to be constant within species, whereas depth distribution of seeds was highly variable among sites. This is consistent with the variability of seed longevity found in published seed bank data.

J	Davy, AJ; Dunsford, SJ; Free, AJ				Davy, AJ; Dunsford, SJ; Free, AJ			Acidifying peat as an aid to the reconstruction of lowland heath on arable soil: lysimeter experiments	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Soil acidification is prerequisite for the reconstruction of lowland heath communities dominated by Calluna vulgaris on land that has been cultivated intensively. Naturally occurring sulphidic peat from a coastal basin deposit was investigated as a potential soil modifier. Its total S and Fe contents confirmed the presence of pyrite (FeS2). 2. In a lysimeter experiment, the surface pH of peat dropped rapidly from 6.5 to 2.5 as pyrite oxidized to produce sulphuric acid. It increased only slightly in the following 5 years. The pH of leachate from the lysimeters dropped to c. 2.0, rising to c. 3.0 over 5 years. Large pulses of soluble iron and sulphate were released from the lysimeters, peaking in the first winter; the Fe discharge fell to background levels after 2 years but SO42- concentrations were still elevated after 5 years. Calluna vulgaris seeds were not able to germinate and survive on the raw peat, even with irrigation. Some seedlings became established on the control agricultural soil but succumbed rapidly to competition from arable weeds. 3. In a second experiment, we amended the surface 15 cm of agricultural soil with peat and compared its properties with bracken litter. The peat sample acidified less, but both peat and bracken incorporation resulted in surface acidification. Neither acidity nor Fe was released in leachates, although the expected pulse of SO42- was discharged from treatments involving pear. Calluna vulgaris seedlings established well on peat mixtures and responded to initial weed control and irrigation treatments. However, after 1 year, competition from Trifolium repens, Agrostis gigantea and Agrostis capillaris had extinguished the C, vulgaris populations, except on the bracken litter mixture where some seedlings persisted for a further 2 years. Weed roots had grown through all the surface layers and exploited the underlying arable soil. 4, The weed seed bank is a major obstacle to heathland reconstruction on arable soil. Pyritic peat has potential as a soil amendment to lower pH and fertility and improve water retention, but it would be needed in greater proportions and to greater depths than used here in order to reduce weed competitiveness. Its use would release large amounts of mobile sulphate into the soil, potentially an issue for groundwater protection; the evidence suggests that the soluble iron and acidity released would not penetrate to a great depth in the profile.

J	Boeken, B; Shachak, M				Boeken, B; Shachak, M			Colonization by annual plants of an experimentally altered desert landscape: source-sink relationships	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. We studied how annual plant species colonize a set of patches (natural and human-made) in a shrubland landscape in the Negev desert. We asked what patch properties and species' attributes affect colonization during 4 years after experimental formation of eight sets of pits and mounds. 2. The 'sink function' of patches was measured as the numbers of colonizing species, the proportion of patches colonized during each year, and the abundance of the colonizers. The effects of species' dispersal I-node and propagule size were examined. 3 In the first growing season, pits and mounds were colonized by large numbers of species. The total number of colonizing species was similar for the two patch types, but incidence was higher in pits than in mounds. 4 The early colonizers were mainly wind-dispersed and showed both high abundance and incidence. Dispersal mode did not affect colonization in the second year and later, nor did propagule size throughout the experiment. 5 Most early colonizers became resident in the patches, but pits and mounds showed some further colonization during the second year. In the third and fourth year both the numbers of colonizing species and their incidence decreased. 6 Pits were mainly colonized from outside the experimental units to which they belonged, whereas mounds received species mostly from the adjacent pits within the same units. 7 From the second year on, patches of undisturbed crusted soil were also colonized, mainly from the adjacent pits and mounds. The number of colonizing species in undisturbed patches increased during the last, high-rainfall, year both per patch and for the whole set of patches. 8 We conclude that the sink function of patches for colonization increases with removal of vegetation, soil crust and seed bank, with patch capacity to capture resource and plant propagules, and with amount of rainfall. Sink function decreased with time due to decreasing availability of new species, but increased with the presence of stronger sink patches in the vicinity. 9 We suggest that the concept of sink function, in terms of the numbers, incidence and abundance of species colonizing sets of patches, can be a powerful tool for linking community and landscape processes.																	0022-0477					OCT	1998	86	5					804	814		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.8650804.x							WOS:000076782200007

J	Cellot, B; Mouillot, F; Henry, CP				Cellot, B; Mouillot, F; Henry, CP			Flood drift and propagule bank of aquatic macrophytes in a riverine wetland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Drift of aquatic macrophyte propagules was investigated in a wetland along the River Rhone, during the first flood after the growing season (i.e. in the winter of 1995-1996). Input and output drift were studied at the beginning, around the top, and at the end of the river overflow in the upper reach of a cut-off channel. The soil propagule bank was sampled along the study area before and after the flood. The amount and composition of viable propagule drift and bank were determined, analysed and compared. Drift densities and richness were on average higher at the outlet of the channel than at the inlet (respectively: 23.2 vs 13.1 viable propagules/ 100 m(3) of water and 8.7 vs 2.6 taxa per sample). Immigrating taxa were mostly in the form of helophyte seeds, whereas numerous resident hydrophyte species left the disturbed area rather as vegetative propagules. Temporal variability in propagule bank structure was weak, and mean bank densities did not change before and after the flood (respectively: 33 047 +/- 10 510 vs 35 653 +/- 15 070 viable propagules/m(2) of ground, including Chara). However, the density of Elodea canadensis significantly increased after the flood while that of Eleocharis acicularis decreased. This contrast suggests that flood responses vary among species. Despite abroad overlap in the taxa (18 out of 25 were common both to drift and bank collections), no significant relationship occurred in composition or structural changes between flood drift and propagule bank. Flood acted as a means of distribution of existing propagules and also as a provider of new vegetative dispersal units.

J	Dalling, JW; Denslow, JS				Dalling, JW; Denslow, JS			Soil seed bank composition along a forest chronosequence in seasonally moist tropical forest, Panama	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												We used a forest chronosequence at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM) to examine changes in the abundance and species composition of seeds in the soil during forest succession. At each of eight sites varying from 20 yr to 100 yr since abandonment, and at two old-growth (>500 yr) forest stands, we established two 160-m transects and sampled the surface 0 - 3 cm of soil in cores collected at each 5 m interval. Seed densities were estimated from the number of seedlings germinated from the soil over a six-week period. Contrary to expectation, neither the density of the soil seed bank, nor species richness or diversity were directly related to age since abandonment, but the density of the soil seed bank was correlated with the abundance of seed-bank-forming species in the standing vegetation. In marked contrast to published studies, herbaceous taxa were rare even in the youngest stands, and the common tree species, which accounted for most seeds in the soil, were present in all stands. The pioneer tree Miconia argentea (Melastomataceae) was the single most common species in the seed bank, accounting for 62% of seeds and present in 92% of soil samples. Rapid recovery of the vegetation of young regrowth stands on BCNM, when compared to sites elsewhere may be partly due to allochthonous seed rain from nearby mature forest stands and the lack of seed inputs of weeds and grasses from agricultural and pasture lands which may inhibit forest succession.																	1100-9233					OCT	1998	9	5					669	678		10.2307/3237285							WOS:000077680200007						
J	Spier, LP; Snyder, JR				Spier, LP; Snyder, JR			Effects of wet- and dry-season fires on Jacquemontia curtisii, a South Florida pine forest endemic	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												South Florida pine forests have a diverse endemic flora that has evolved under the influence of recurrent fire. We studied the response of Jacquemontia curtisii Peter ex Hallier f. (pineland clustervine), a perennial herbaceous member of that flora, to experimental fires during wet and dry seasons. In each of three populations, three treatments were applied: wet-season (June) prescribed fire, dry-season (January) prescribed lire, and an unburned control. Flowering, fruiting, and seedling establishment were followed for up to one year. Mortality of adult plants was twice as great after wet-season burns than after dry-season burns even though fire temperatures were higher in the dry-season burns. Within a season of burning, mortality was greater for the more severely burned plants or the smaller plants. Wet-season burns produced over three times more flowers than not burning, in spite of mortality of more than half the plants. Burning stimulated germination from the soil seed bank. Dry-season burns resulted in five times more seedlings than wet-season burns and more of these seedlings were alive one year after the burn. It is likely that the long-term viability of Jacquemontia curtisii populations is favored by diversity in fire season and severity.																	0885-8608					OCT	1998	18	4					350	357									WOS:000076696900008						
J	Baldwin, AH; Mendelssohn, IA				Baldwin, AH; Mendelssohn, IA			Response of two oligohaline marsh communities to lethal and nonlethal disturbance	OECOLOGIA												Severity is recognized as an important attribute of disturbance in many plant communities. However, the effects of disturbances of different severity on patterns of regeneration in oligohaline marsh vegetation have not been experimentally examined. In these communities, a critical difference in the effects of disturbance severity may be whether the vegetation dies as a result of the disturbance or is merely damaged and hence capable of resprouting. We described the regeneration of vegetation in two Louisiana marsh community types, one dominated by Sagittaria lancifolia L. and the other by Spartina parens (Ait.) Muhl., following three levels of disturbance: no disturbance, a nonlethal disturbance, and a lethal disturbance. In the nonlethal disturbance, aboveground vegetation was clipped to simulate common disturbances such as fire and herbivory that remove aboveground vegetation but leave rhizomes intact. In the lethal disturbance vegetation was killed using herbicide to simulate disturbances causing plant mortality such as wrack deposition, sedimentation, scouring, and flooding following fire or herbivory. Regeneration was assessed over a 2-year period by measuring plant species richness, relative abundance, relative dominance, cover, and final biomass. To elucidate mechanisms for observed responses of vegetation, the species composition of the seed bank, light penetration, water level, salinity, and soil redox potential were evaluated. Despite differences in the structure of undisturbed vegetation in the two community types, they exhibited the same overall pattern of regeneration. Following nonlethal disturbance, the dominant species resprouted and quickly reestablished the structure of the vegetation. In contrast, recolonization following lethal disturbance occurred primarily via seedling recruitment, which resulted in marked shifts in community structure that persisted throughout the study. While the two communities responded similarly overall to disturbance, the response of individual species was not uniform; abundance, dominance, biomass, or cover increased for some species but decreased for others in response to disturbance. Seed bank species occurred in the vegetation following lethal disturbance in the Spartina community and in both disturbed and undisturbed plots in the Sagittaria community, indicating that the seed bank is a source of propagules for regeneration and maintenance of oligohaline marshes. Of the environmental variables measured, light level was most closely related to the effect of disturbance severity on community structure. Our results suggest that lethal and nonlethal disturbances have differential effects on regeneration of vegetation that can create pattern in oligohaline marshes communities.

J	Seabloom, EW; van der Valk, AG; Moloney, KA				Seabloom, EW; van der Valk, AG; Moloney, KA			The role of water depth and soil temperature in determining initial composition of prairie wetland coenoclines	PLANT ECOLOGY												In this study, we examined the effects of water depth and temperature on seedling recruitment from a prairie wetland seed bank. We collected seed-bank samples from natural and restored prairie pothole wetlands in northwestern Iowa and combined them into a single sample. We examined seedling recruitment from this seed-bank sample in an experimental study using a factorial design of 4 temperature treatments (5 degrees night and 15 degrees day to 20 degrees night and 30 degrees day) and 3 water-depth treatments (0, 2, and 7 cm). Principal Components Analysis showed that both water depth and temperature had significant effects on the composition of the seedling community as measured by changes in relative stem density and biomass. Water depth had its strongest effects on stem density while temperature had its strongest effects on biomass. For the 22 most common species, stem density varied with water depth for 95% of the species and with temperature for 50% of the species. Most species with water depth responses had lower stem counts as water depth increased, and for the majority of species with temperature responses stem density increased with temperature. Total, annual, and perennial species richness was negatively correlated with water depth. Total and annual species richness was positively correlated to temperature, while perennial species richness was unresponsive to temperature. In addition, species found at low elevations as adults emerged at higher rates in the deep water treatments while species that occurred at higher elevations as adults had their highest emergence rates in the low water treatments. Our results suggest that differences in environmental conditions along coenoclines can affect the initial distribution of species emerging from the soil seed bank. Water depth sorted seedlings according to their adult water-depth tolerances, and temperature determined the proportion of annuals in the seedling community.

J	Paice, MER; Day, W; Rew, LJ; Howard, A				Paice, MER; Day, W; Rew, LJ; Howard, A			A stochastic simulation model for evaluating the concept of patch spraying	WEED RESEARCH												The long-term economic benefits of 'patch' spraying are likely to be related to the initial spatial distribution of the target weeds, the demographic characteristics of the species and the weed control and crop husbandry practices to which they are subjected. This paper describes a stochastic simulation model developed to investigate the interaction between weed seed dispersal and patch spraying. Simulated weed plant and seed populations are generated and compared with data from field observations. Lloyd's Patchiness index is used to quantify the patchiness of the weed density distribution, and the parameter k of the negative binomial distribution is used as a measure of distribution shape. A method of assessing the spatial scale of weed aggregation is proposed. in which spatial weed density information is transformed into the frequency domain, using a discrete two-dimensional Fourier transform. In this paper, we simulate 'on/off' patch spraying (full or zero herbicide application rate). A quantitative analysis of the effects of sprayer resolution and weed seed dispersal range on the herbicide reduction and yield benefits from patch spraying is performed for three initial spatial seedbank distributions. The model is parameterized for the grass weed Alopecurus myosuroides Huds. Herbicide is applied in square areas (whose size is defined by the spatial resolution of the sprayer) in which mean weed density is greater than or equal to one plant m(-2). For a system conforming to this specification we show that for the control of A. myosuroides, it is unlikely that patch spraying would be profitable in the long term if the control area is larger than 6 m x 6 m. In some circumstances higher resolution may be required.																	0043-1737					OCT	1998	38	5					373	388									WOS:000076790500006						
J	Allphin, L; Windham, MD; Harper, KT				Allphin, L; Windham, MD; Harper, KT			Genetic diversity and gene flow in the endangered dwarf bear poppy, Arctomecon humilis (Papaveraceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Arctomecon humilis is a critically endangered species endemic to the Moenkopi shale of Washington County, Utah. Recovery plans for the species would: be improved by an understanding of genetic diversity and gene flow among its remaining populations. Ten variable isozyme loci were used to calculate genetic diversity statistics for study populations. Westerly populations possessed higher levels of genetic variability than other populations at the same isozyme loci. Three of the populations exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. No correlation existed between genetic distance and geographic distance. Most of the genetic diversity was distributed among populations with little gene flow between populations, suggesting that observed genetic differences may arise from genetic drift. For the westerly populations, similar genotypes were observed in the seedling and old age classes, while intermediate age classes typically possessed an alternate set of genotypes at Pgi-2. Mean heterozygosity increased with age class across populations. Westerly populations of A. humilis shared more alleles with the nearest geographic population of A. californica than other populations. Since the westerly populations contained more genetic variability and more alleles in common with a near relative, they may be relictual. Other populations may contain less genetic diversity due to founder effects and/or genetic drift.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				SEP	1998	85	9					1251	1261		10.2307/2446635							WOS:000076063900008	21685011					
J	Jones, RAC; Nicholas, DA				Jones, RAC; Nicholas, DA			Impact of an insidious virus disease in the legume component on the species balance within self-regenerating annual pasture	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												The consequences of sowing seed of burr medic (Medicago polymorpha) cultivars Circle Valley and Serena that was either free of or infected to different extents with alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) was studied in mixed species pasture swards that regenerated annually. The swards were grazed by sheep and the predominant plant species in them were burr medic and capeweed (Arctotheca calendula). Senna matured earlier and was more tolerant of AMV infection than Circle Valley. Each year, seed-infected medic plants were the source for virus spread by aphids to healthy medic plants. When the extent of infection was determined in the fourth to sixth growing seasons, the amount of virus spread in the medic component of the swards varied between seasons. Final infection in plots originally sown with infected seed ranged from 47 to 93 % for Serena and from 25 to 79 % for Circle Valley. Viral seed transmission rates in medic seed produced each year by these plots ranged from 19 to 31 % with Serena and from 3 to 7 % with Circle Valley. Final percentage infection within swards originally sown with healthy seed (control plots) was smaller regardless of cultivar (0.1-7 %) as were transmission rates in their harvested seed (0-0.6 %). AMV infection of the burr medic in regenerated plots originally sown with Circle Valley seed diminished medic seed yields, thereby decreasing the proportion of medic in the seed bank. This decreased germination of medic but increased germination of capeweed. In control plots, plant densities were up to 36 % greater in the medic and 52 % smaller in the capeweed components than in plots originally sown with infected Circle Valley seed. In plots containing Serena there was a smaller decrease in medic seed yields due to AMV infection, so the impact on germination was less. In the fourth to sixth years from sowing, when yields were determined at different times after grazing ceased, there was either a small decrease (up to 8 %) or no significant decrease in overall herbage yields due to infection with AMV. However, in plots originally sown with infected Circle Valley seed, the balance of medic to capeweed was altered in favour of capeweed, sometimes dramatically so (e.g. capeweed content increased from 19 to 45 % in the fourth year from sowing). In contrast, by the end of the growing season the balance of medic to capeweed was little altered by the presence of the virus in plots containing Serena. Thus, infection with this insidious virus disease substantially diminished the ability of Circle Valley but not Serena medic to compete with other species such as capeweed in self-regenerated, mixed species pasture swards. It did this both directly by decreasing the competitive ability of the medic plants that became infected during the growing season, and indirectly via seed production and the seed bank, by altering the proportions in which the species germinated.

J	Fuhlendorf, SD; Smeins, FE				Fuhlendorf, SD; Smeins, FE			The influence of soil depth on plant species response to grazing within a semi-arid savanna	PLANT ECOLOGY												Grassland patches within a semi-arid savanna were evaluated over 45-years for (1) local temporal dynamics of basal area for five dominant grass species within long-term heavily grazed and ungrazed treatments, (2) the influence of soil depth (resource availability) on vegetation dynamics, and (3) the applicability of community-level grazing response groups over fine-scale patterns of soil heterogeneity. Temporal patterns in species composition and basal area were dependent upon soil depth. In the heavy grazed treatment, Hilaria belangeri dominated deep soils while Erioneuron pilosum and Bouteloua trifida were restricted to shallow soils. In the ungrazed treatment, removal of grazing resulted in successional changes that were significantly different across soil depths. After 45 years without grazing, Eriochloa sericea was most abundant on deep soils while Bouteloua curtipendula was more abundant on intermediate and shallow soils. Community-level functional groups that are based on grazing were not appropriate when multiple pattern-driving variables were considered across multiple scales indicating that functional groups should only be applied to certain processes at specific scales. Within the ungrazed treatments, variable soil depths have resulted in a shifting mosaic in time and space where early- and late-successional species co-exist continuously but spatially separated within the community. In the heavily grazed treatment, species are somewhat spatially arranged by soil depths, but much of the inherent heterogeneity is eliminated and species composition is dominated by the three grazing-resistant short-grasses. Broad scale successional changes may appear linear and predictable while at finer scales, the same changes may be described as non-linear and dependent upon soil depth resulting in thresholds that are partially explained by weather patterns, seed bank limitations and competitive inhibitions.

J	Bekker, RM; Oomes, MJM; Bakker, JP				Bekker, RM; Oomes, MJM; Bakker, JP			The impact of groundwater level on soil seed bank survival	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed longevity of plant species is an important topic in restoration management, and little is known about the effects of environmental conditions on seed survival and longevity under natural conditions. Therefore, the effect of groundwater level on the survival of seeds in the soil seed bank of a natural grassland community was investigated. Large soil cores, mesocosms, were sampled from a grassland site and transferred to two basins under a glass roof. The mesocosms were subjected to different groundwater-level treatments (high and low, respectively 5 and 30 cm below the soil surface) for nearly three years. After that period the soil seed bank of the mesocosms was sampled. In total 15 789 seeds of 38 taxa emerged from the experiment. Significant differences between the number of viable seeds that emerged in the two treatments were found for several species. More seeds of Glyceria fluitans, Cardamine pratensis and Myosotis palustris germinated in the high water-level treatment, whereas fewer seeds of Juncus spp., Cerastium fontanum and Stellaria media were found in this treatment than in the low water-level treatment. The experiment showed that the anoxic conditions prevailing in the high water-level treatment were beneficial to the survival of seeds of species of wet grassland communities. Species of dry grasslands, although represented by only two species, survived better under aerobic conditions.																	0960-2585					SEP	1998	8	3					399	404		10.1017/S0960258500004323							WOS:000076198400009						
J	Jones, RM; Bunch, GA; McDonald, CK				Jones, RM; Bunch, GA; McDonald, CK			Ecological and agronomic studies on Chamaecrista rotundifolia cv. Wynn related to modelling of persistence	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												This paper reports the results of a series of studies on aspects of the persistence of the tropical pasture legume Chamaecrista rotundifolia (round-leafed cassia) cv. Wynn. The results are contributing to formulating a quantitative model of cassia persistence. The main study, at Samford in coastal southeast Queensland, was on the fate of cassia seed broadcast into cassia-free pastures in 1900 and 1991 to simulate seed set in an established cassia pasture. The study was carried out on a heavily defoliated and a lightly defoliated site. Seedling emergence and soil seed reserves were monitored for 3 (1991 sawing) or 4 (1990 sowing) years. There was a much higher recovery of viable over-sown seed as seedlings or soil seed in the second (50%) than in the first (13%) sowing. Approximately 40% of the second sowing was recovered as soil seed after 3 years compared with 6% from the first sowing. The difference is attributed to poorer quality of the 1990 seed sample. The rundown of seed banks was similar under both defoliation intensities, but there was greater loss of seed and fewer seeds recovered as seedlings on the tightly defoliated site. Other studies showed that: in early autumn at Samford, a cassia flower bud could develop into a mature pod and dehisce in 39 days, but a longer time was required in late autumn; there was a linear relationship between herbage yield and seed set but, for the same cassia presentation yield, ungrazed pasture set more seed than grazed pasture; seed quality of cassia varied between sites and years of collection, with quality lower in years with wet conditions during pod set; there was little predation of cassia seed placed on the soil surface at Samford, whereas, at Narayen Research Station in subcoastal southern Queensland, there was considerable predation during the hotter months; and hard seed breakdown of cassia occurred at lower temperatures than is the case for some Stylosanthes spp. Equations were developed which relate rooting depth of cassia seedlings and plants, and age of plants, to taproot diameter. The implications of these measurements for management of cassia pastures and for development of a model of cassia persistence are discussed. Further quantification of factors affecting seed set and the fate of seed will be required before a model of cassia persistence can be developed that will be reliably applicable to all time/site situations.

One extraction method accomplishes this by creating a slurry of soil and a concentrated inorganic salt solution. Centrifugation is then used to separate constituents of differing densities. We have found that centrifugation of giant foxtail seeds in 3.2 M potassium carbonate solution as conducted in a centrifugation/flotation extraction method can reduce viability as measured by germination and tetrazolium tests. In one experiment, centrifugation/flotation separation reduced germination of giant foxtail seeds from 94 to 52%. The likely cause of seed damage was the high pH of the potassium carbonate solution in conjunction with the increased hydrostatic pressure due to centrifugation. While centrifugation affected quantitative measures of seed viability, it did not alter qualitative viability estimates using a pressure test.																	0043-1745					SEP-OCT	1998	46	5					545	548		10.1017/S0043174500091074							WOS:000076436200009						
J	Cabin, RJ; Mitchell, RJ; Marshall, DL				Cabin, RJ; Mitchell, RJ; Marshall, DL			Do surface plant and soil seed bank populations differ genetically? A multipopulation study of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri (Brassicaceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed banks are an important component of many plant populations, but few empirical studies have investigated the genetic relationship between soil seeds and surface plants. We compared the genetic structure of soil seeds and surface plants of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri within and among five ecologically diverse populations at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in Central New Mexico. At each site, 40 Lesquerella surface plants and 40 samples of soil seeds were mapped and genetically analyzed using starch gel electrophoresis. Overall allele frequencies of soil seeds and surface plants showed significant differences across the five populations and within three of the five individual populations. Surface plants had significantly greater amounts of single and multilocus heterozygosity, and mean surface plant heterozygosity was also greater at the total population level and in four of the five individual populations. Overall soil seed (but not surface plant) homozygosity was significantly greater than predicted by Hardy-Weinberg expectations at the total and individual population levels. Although F-st estimates revealed similarly small but significant genetic divergence within each life-history stage, estimates of coancestry showed that fine-scale (0.5-2 m) genetic correlations among the surface plant genotypes were roughly twice those of soil seed genotypes. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis indicated that in the two geographically closest sites, the surface plants were slightly more genetically similar to each other than to their own respective seed banks. We also found weak and/or negative demographic associations between Lesquerella soil seed and surface plant densities within each of the five sites. We discuss the difficulties involved with sampling and genetically comparing these two life-history stages.

J	Kirsten, JH; Dawes, CJ; Cochrane, BJ				Kirsten, JH; Dawes, CJ; Cochrane, BJ			Randomly amplified polymorphism detection (RAPD) reveals high genetic diversity in Thalassia testudinum banks ex Konig (Turtlegrass)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Populations of Thalassia testudinum (Banks ex Konig) at the northern and southern limits of the west coast of Florida were compared with a Jamaican population using randomly amplified polymorphism detection (RAPD). With the exception of those from Apalachicola Bay, virtually all samples were distinct genetic individuals. Those putative clone mates that were identified often had other genets dispersed between them. Several distinct differences were observed between the northern and southern populations. The southern populations have higher percentages of the total possible number of bands present, of polymorphic bands, acid of bands exclusive to a population, as well as a greater number of RAPD phenotypes and a greater mean number of differences between phenotypes. The biological phenomena that may explain these patterns include increased reproductive success, decreased inbreeding or increased population size in the southern populations. A fourth possibility is unidirectional gene flow from north to south. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was done indicating that approximately 81% of the variation is within beds, suggesting a homogeneous species. Yet the populations were clearly distinguishable from one another at microgeographic ranges. The level of genetic variation observed is characteristic of species with the same life history traits as Thalassia testudinum and was not predicted based on field observations of the species. This study, in conjunction with other molecular seagrass studies done to date, challenges our understanding of seagrass growth, reproduction, and propagation. There does not appear to be any pattern of reproductive traits, such as dioecy, monoecy, vivipary, or seed banking, that can reliably predict levels of genetic variation in a given seagrass species.

J	Vaughton, G				Vaughton, G			Soil seed bank dynamics in the rare obligate seeding shrub, Grevillea barklyana (Proteaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Grevillea barklyana is a rare, obligate seeding shrub that occurs in fire-prone heath and woodland in southeastern Australia. The size and dynamics of the soil seed bank were investigated in populations 2-29 years after fire in order to identify fire frequencies that would threaten population survival. Plants began flowering 2 years after fire (16%), but maximum inflorescence and seed production did not occur until 15-16 years after fire when plants were full size. Seed production declined in older populations. Fruit:flower ratios were very low (0.1-5.3%), Most flowers (> 95%) failed to initiate fruits. Of the initiated fruits, about 60% aborted, 27% were attacked by parrots and 13% matured. An exclusion experiment showed that fruits attacked by parrots would have otherwise matured. Seeds were consumed on the soil surface by mammals, particularly rodents. Post-dispersal seed losses were consistently high in all months and in all populations (78-100%). Mortality of adult plants increased with time since fire. In the 29-year-old population, 30% of plants were dead and 33% were senescent. Recruitment was negligible in the absence of fire, but following fire the seedling to parent ratio was 20:1. Seedling survival was high (90%) following two years of above-average rainfall. The observed seed bank was small (3-16 seeds m(2)) and increased during the first 16 years after fire before declining in the 21- and 26-year-old populations. The size and dynamics of the seed bank may limit population numbers, especially if the intervals between fires are less than 10 years or greater than 25 years.																	0307-692X					AUG	1998	23	4					375	384		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00742.x							WOS:000075171700007						
J	Shea, K; Kelly, D				Shea, K; Kelly, D			Estimating biocontrol agent impact with matrix models: Carduus nutans in New Zealand	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We demonstrate the use of matrix models to assess the impact of biological control and other pest management strategies with a case study of Carduus nutans (nodding thistle) in New Zealand. Modeling can facilitate the choice of the best control agents, improve evaluation of biocontrol attempts, and assist in the design of integrated pest management plans. Field data for similar to 8000 mapped C. nutans plants at two sites in New Zealand were used to develop size-structured matrix models. The matrix models confirm that both populations of C. nutans were increasing in number, as is expected of a noxious weed in its invasion phase. Elasticity analysis indicated that seed/seedling and small-plant/seed transitions were more crucial to population growth than rosette survival rates. However, simulations of attack by the biocontrol agent Rhinocyllus conicus (nodding thistle receptacle weevil) showed that seed losses of similar to 69% would be required to make the populations decrease in size, far more than the observed losses of 30-40% in New Zealand, the United States, and Canada. This result accords with field observations of control failure in New Zealand, but not with records of successful control in North America. Other management possibilities, including the use of grazing management to suppress germination and an integrated weed management approach, were also assessed, using both deterministic and stochastic matrix models. This work indicates that, with continued suppression of germination in conjunction with a reduction of the input to the seed bank, it may be possible to control C. nutans in New Zealand.

J	Marone, L; Rossi, BE; De Casenave, JL				Marone, L; Rossi, BE; De Casenave, JL			Granivore impact on soil-seed reserves in the central Monte desert, Argentina	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Mechanisms of grass- and forb-seed input and output in the central Monte desert of Argentina were studied in 1995 to test the hypothesis that seed consumption by autumn-winter granivores, especially birds, has qualitative as well as quantitative effects on soil-seed reserves. 2, The abundance of perennial grass seeds in late summer soils (approximate to 2400 seeds m(-2) or 0.36 g m(-2)) remained unchanged the following early spring (approximate to 2400 seeds m(-2) or 0.39 g m(-2)), despite the incorporation of about 3000 seeds m(-2) or 0.71 g m(-2) newly produced grass seeds during autumn-winter. Grass seeds appeared to be heavily consumed, especially the medium-sized ones. 3, The annual forb-seed bank was about the same size in late summer (approximate to 5500 seeds m(-2) or 1.34 g m(-2)) as in early spring (approximate to 6500 seeds m(-2) or 1.53 g m(-2)). Since forb-seed production had been relatively low (approximate to 400 seeds m(-2) or 0.12 g m(-2)), these seeds apparently suffered negligible postdispersal losses. 4. This pattern of grass- and forb-seed loss coincides with the pattern of seed consumption by granivorous birds - on average, 93% of seed mass in bird stomachs was from grass seeds, while only 7% was from forb seeds. 5, Further evidence of a major impact of bird foraging on seed reserves is that the mass of particular grass seeds that was lost from soils was positively correlated with the mass of such seeds in bird diets, and that the main target of bird consumption, i.e. medium-sized grass seeds, suffered the highest postdispersal loss. 6. It is concluded that autumn-winter granivores in the central Monte desert, particularly birds, mainly consume newly produced grass seeds and that they might have major qualitative as well as quantitative impacts on soil-seed reserves.																	0269-8463					AUG	1998	12	4					640	645		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00226.x							WOS:000076276900016

Effects of high nutrient input on the longevity and viability of buried seed are examined. Seeds of 17 fen-meadow species were buried in nylon mesh bags at four sites in the Netherlands and one site in Great Britain in plots to which N, P, K fertilizers are applied. Prior to burial germination tests were conducted on the seeds of each species. This paper describes the results of the viability tests on the seeds that were exhumed after one and 2 years of burial. 2. The percentage of seeds that germinated after 1 year of burial was significantly lower than the pre-burial percentage for the majority of the species. After 2 years of burial the germination percentage further decreased. A few species, such as the Carex species, did, however, show an increase in germination percentage indicating that the burial conditions allowed dormancy controls to be broken. 3. Differences in the edaphic conditions between the sites appeared to affect germination percentages after 1 year of burial. A difference in germination response between sites was observed for Carex acutiformis, Filipendula ulmaria and Lychnis flos-cuculi. 4, A significantly higher germination percentage was found at the Great Britain site for F: ulmaria in the phosphate treatment compared with the potassium treatment and the control after 1 year of burial. In contrast to many literature assessments no significant effects of fertilizer application was found after 2 years. 5. For all sites, except one in the Netherlands, the total number of seeds that germinated was lower in 1996 than in 1995.																	0269-8463					AUG	1998	12	4					673	682		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00238.x							WOS:000076276900020

The soil seed bank of limestone grassland plots was investigated after 6 years of manipulation of temperature, rainfall, fertility and disturbance. An inoculum of seeds of species alien to the site was also added to the experiment. 2. The seed bank was largely made up of species that were native to the site and had small, persistent seeds. Large-seeded species, whether native or introduced. were rare or absent in the seed bank. Small-seeded species were generally more deeply buried than large-seeded species. Total seed density was comparable with that of other limestone grasslands. 3. Significant climate effects were few, although the seed bank of the winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana was increased by summer drought and that of Cerastium fontanum was increased by winter heating. 4. The density of seeds of native species declined in response to disturbance and increased fertility treatments, while that of introduced species increased. Changes in the seed bank lagged behind changes ill the vegetation, with introduced species making up a higher proportion of the vegetation than of the seed bank after 6 years of manipulation.																	0021-8901					AUG	1998	35	4					544	552		10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.3540544.x							WOS:000077750500007

The ecology of the woody shrub Cytisus scoparius was studied for 4 years in its native range in southern France to investigate how it call become an invasive weed. 2. The proportion of the seed bank that germinated each year was highest in disturbed plots and was correlated with the March rainfall. The seed bank declined at a rate of c. 50% per year when fresh seed rain was excluded, 3. The fate of 2863 seedlings was followed for a variety of treatments. 4. Seedling survival depended on disturbance: none survived their first summer in undisturbed plots; more than 40% survived their first summer and c. 14% survived to flowering age in plots that were initially cultivated. 5. Seedlings flowered first in their fourth year, although only c, 10% set seed. 6. Neither inter- nor intraspecific competition was found to affect significantly seedling survival on cultivated plots. However, some seedlings grown in the absence of interspecific competitors flowered and set seed in their third year. 7. Applications of insecticide, molluscicide or fungicide did not affect significantly seedling survival, growth or minimum age of reproduction on cultivated plots. 8. It is concluded that management strategies should minimize disturbance to competing vegetation, which can inhibit germination and smother emerging seedlings. In many circumstances strategies that target the seed bank, such as burning, are not expected to work. 9. Herbivores and pathogens may prevent stand re-establishment indirectly, by reducing the size, vigour and density of broom plants so that competing vegetation can persist and smother emergent seedlings following the death of the parent stand.

We compared the demographic responses of Hypericum cumulicola, a rare herbaceous species almost entirely restricted to Florida rosemary scrub, when transplanted to occupied or unoccupied patches. 2 Seedlings were transplanted and seeds buried into Florida rosemary scrub patches differing in time since last lire, and in the presence or absence of H. cumulicola. We used a replicated, factorial design to place the transplants and seeds in the field, and monitored their performance for 18 months. 3 Neither time-since-fire nor prior H. cumulicola site occupancy affected survival of transplants. Only time-since-fire affected growth. Time-since-fire, H. cumulicola occupancy, and their interaction affected reproductive effort, but these effects were not consistent between years. 4 Flowering and seed production led to subsequent seedling recruitment near transplants, mainly in recently burned sites. Genetic screening of transplants and seedlings showed that transplants in occupied sites could have crossed with nearby resident plants, but that offspring in sites previously unoccupied were likely to have been parented only by nearby transplants. 5 Seeds buried, and later exhumed, germinated after 1 or 2 years of burial, demonstrating a persistent soil seed bank from which populations could recover after fire. Neither time-since-fire nor H. cumulicola occupancy affected seed dormancy or germination. 6 Similar demography in unoccupied and occupied patches suggests that the patchy pattern of site occupancy by H. cumulicola is probably due to limited dispersal and periodic extinction, especially associated with long lire-free intervals. Conservation measures need to protect unoccupied patches to allow metapopulation dynamics and persistence.

J	Dalling, JW; Hubbell, SP; Silvera, K				Dalling, JW; Hubbell, SP; Silvera, K			Seed dispersal, seedling establishment and gap partitioning among tropical pioneer trees	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 We examined the abundance and distribution patterns of pioneer seeds in the soil seed bank, and of pioneer seedlings in 53 recently formed gaps, in a 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. The aim was to assess the importance of dispersal limitation (failure of seeds to arrive at all sites suitable for their germination) and establishment limitation (failure of seeds having reached a site to germinate successfully and establish as seedlings) in determining patterns of gap occupancy. 2 The abundance of seeds in the soil seed bank was strongly negatively correlated with seed size? but was not correlated with the abundance of reproductive-sized adult trees in the plot. In contrast, the abundance of pioneer seedlings > 10 cm height in natural gaps was strongly correlated with adult abundance, but was not correlated with seed size. 3 Seedlings were non-randomly distributed among gaps, but seedling abundance was not directly related to gap size, and there was no evidence of partitioning of the light environment of gaps by small seedlings. Large differences in growth and mortality rates among species were observed after 1 year, and this may result in the gap size partitioning previously found in saplings of the same species. 4 Seedlings of most species, particularly those with large seeds, were relatively more abundant than expected in gaps close to their conspecific adults. Proximity to reproductives, and by inference dispersal limitation, therefore exerts some effect on seedling distribution. None the less, large differences between seed and seedling abundances for some species, and low seedling occupancy rates in some gaps close to adult conspecifics, suggest that seedling emergence probabilities and species-specific establishment requirements may also be important determinants of local abundance.																	0022-0477					AUG	1998	86	4					674	689		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00298.x							WOS:000075695300012						
J	Lavoie, L; Sirois, L				Lavoie, L; Sirois, L			Vegetation changes caused by recent fires in the northern boreal forest of eastern Canada	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE					IAVS Workshop on Disturbance Dynamics in Boreal Forests	AUG 26-30, 1996	UNIV QUEBEC ABITI TEMISCAAMINGUE, ROUYN-NORANDA, CANADA	IAVS	UNIV QUEBEC ABITI TEMISCAAMINGUE			From 1980-1989, fires burned 32 440 km(2) of boreal forest, 200 km south of the forest-tundra border in northern Quebec, Canada. An assessment of the impact of fire on tree population densities was carried out by comparing the number of Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana in 83 sites before and after the sites burned in 1981, 1983, 1988 or 1989. Age structure analysis of post-fire populations burned in 1972, 1976 and 1983, along with the rapid exhaustion of the seed bank from burned trees, suggest that the majority of seedlings were established within 3 to 10 yr after fire. Consequently, given the absence of nearby living seed bearers, little (if any) further recruitment can be expected in the even-aged, regenerating populations. According to the tree density comparison (pre-fire vs post-fire), a shift from Picea- to Pinus-dominated communities occurred in most of the sites burned in 1981 or 1983, and in some of the sites burned in 1988 or 1989. The 1988 fire reduced the tree population density by 95 % in 10 of the 15 sites; total tree density decreased by at least 75 % in 28 out of 40 sites burned in 1989. This suggests that the areas burned in 1988 and 1989 will mainly regenerate as very open forests or lichen-heath communities that are more commonly found in the forest-tundra zone, north of the study area. Fire intensity, short fire interval, and unfavorable climate during and after fires are three plausible mechanisms associated with these post-fire vegetation changes.																	1100-9233					AUG	1998	9	4					483	492		10.2307/3237263							WOS:000076951800004						
J	Marone, L; Rossi, BE; Horno, ME				Marone, L; Rossi, BE; Horno, ME			Timing and spatial patterning of seed dispersal and redistribution in a South American warm desert	PLANT ECOLOGY												We measured newly-produced seeds entering the soil (Potential Seed Bank) to assess the timing and spatial patterning of Phase I dispersal in the central Monte desert, Argentina. Rates of forb- (6.13 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and shrub-seed input (48.9 mg m(-2) d(-1)) were maximum in early summer. The rate of grass-seed input, instead, was similar in early and late summer (7 to 8 mg m(-2) d(-1)). About 90% of forb- and shrub-seed mass entered the habitat through protected (i.e., under canopy) areas, whereas 70% of grass-seed mass did so through exposed areas. Adult plant location and the uneven impact of wind on shrub, forb and grass seeds may explain such patterns. We also compared the Potential Seed Bank with the soil seed bank in the following spring (Realized Seed Bank). Seeds that form transient banks in other ecosystems (e.g., shrub seeds of the genus Larrea, or perennial grass seeds like those of Pappophorum and Trichloris) prevailed in the Potential Seed Bank. Some annual forb seeds, instead, appeared to form a more persistent seed bank, and prevailed in the Realized Seed Bank (e.g., Chenopodium). Horizontal redistribution did not affect the spatial patterning of forb and shrub seeds, but produced a more homogeneous distribution of grass seeds in the habitat. The impact of wind could explain the redistribution pattern of grass seeds. Finally, we found almost 80% of total seeds in the top 2 cm of soil. The smallest grass and forb seeds (Sporobolus and Descurainia) as well as some medium-sized and large forb seeds (e.g., Glandularia, Sphaeralcea, Phacelia) were able to reach deeper soil layers in the central Monte desert.																	1385-0237					AUG	1998	137	2					143	150		10.1023/A:1009776601012							WOS:000075813700002						
J	Garcia-Fayos, P; Verdu, M				Garcia-Fayos, P; Verdu, M			Soil seed bank, factors controlling germination and establishment of a Mediterranean shrub: Pistacia lentiscus L.	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The recruitment strategy of Pistacia lentiscus, an evergreen sclerophyllous shrub inhabiting the Mediterranean region, was studied in order to identify the key factors controlling seedling establishment and survival. The capacity to develop a seed bank, the loss of seed viability with time, the presence of dormancy mechanisms, the conditions to promote seed germination and the seedling dynamics were investigated. The results show that P. lentiscus has a transient seed bank with rapid seed germination occurring within the year. Dormancy was not present as seeds germinated successfully without light or temperature pretreatments. Only pulp removal and a long and abundant rain event (greater than or equal to 7 days; greater than or equal to 100 L.m(-2)) appeared to be necessary for germination. Seed viability decreased drastically after 1 year. More seedlings emerged under shrub canopy than in open sites, as expected by the seed dispersal pattern and canopy effects on plant establishment. The high mortality observed in the few weeks after establishment indicates that seedling survival is a bottleneck in the recruitment process of P. lentiscus in dense shrublands. Some seedlings survived in a latent mode for at least 4 years. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

J	Morrison, DA; McClay, K; Porter, C; Rish, S				Morrison, DA; McClay, K; Porter, C; Rish, S			The role of the lens in controlling heat-induced breakdown of testa-imposed dormancy in native Australian legumes	ANNALS OF BOTANY												A high proportion of seeds of most species of the Fabaceae have testa-imposed dormancy, which prevents them from imbibing water even under favourable environmental conditions. This allows seeds to accumulate in a persistent soil seed bank. Dormancy is usually considered to be broken only when the testa is disrupted, particularly at the lens. In Mediterranean-type ecosystems, the primary natural mechanism causing the breakdown of this dormancy is the disruption of testas in the soil seed bank by heat from fires that warms the soil in which the seed bank occurs. We examined experimentally the role of the lens in controlling this heat-induced breakdown of dormancy in 16 native Australian species of the Faboideae and Mimosoideae. Two groups of patterns are recognized: species of the Mimosoideae: Acacieae and Faboideae: Mirbelieae, where water permeability is regulated by the lens; and species of the Faboideae: Bossiaeeae, where water permeability apparently occurs at non-localized regions of the tc:sta. The species in these two groups differ in the structure of their testas. Thus, testa-imposed dormancy does not represent a single dormancy mechanism in legumes, as is often assumed when dormancy is broken artificially.

J	Girel, J; Manneville, O				Girel, J; Manneville, O			Present species richness of plant communities in alpine stream corridors in relation to historical river management	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Since the early 19th century, particularly in the Alps, stream corridors have been affected by two major disturbances: diking/channelization which cut off large areas of floodplain and the infilling of by-pass channels which has raised the level of alluvial deposits by siltation. While these engineering works have favoured farming, some areas remained uncultivated. These are: (1) well-silted basins which became waterlogged a:Rer the water table was raised (sedimentation within the diked channel), (2) well-silted basins used to produce firewood, and (3) unsilted or insufficiently silted basins which still show evidence of landforms characterizing the ancient braided pattern. Anthropogenically provoked disturbances such as flooding/silting followed by agricultural practices such as clearing, mowing and grazing are responsible for the establishment of relatively young fens (< 150 years old) exhibiting a higher plant diversity than unsilted areas. A comparison was made between sites in the Isere valley and similar but more ancient habitats in the Rhone valley. This showed the role of flooding/silting operations in promoting a rapid reinstatement of biological richness in alluvial wetlands. However, it was evident that the more newly created sites were generally much poorer in species than the older sites. Conservation biologists interested in preserving species and plant communities in stream corridors of the Alps therefore need to incorporate a dynamic perspective of biological systems that includes the overriding impact of prior land-use and historical river management. It is suggested that old flooding techniques can be used again in order to preserve or enhance present biodiversity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Gill, AM; McCarthy, MA				Gill, AM; McCarthy, MA			Intervals between prescribed fires in Australia: what intrinsic variation should apply?	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Because of increasing concern over the constancy of intervals between prescribed fires within a vegetation type, we examine various sources of evidence that can be used to determine variation appropriate to the conservation of biodiversity while minimizing the chances of economically destructive fires. Primary juvenile periods of plants (especially of 'serotinous seeders') and non-breeding periods of birds (especially poorly dispersed species) suggest extreme lower limits for fire intervals whereas longevity of plant species which usually only reproduce after fire, set the extreme upper li:mits. Modelling of the behaviour of selected plant and animal species may be used to set 'optimal' mean intervals. Historical fire-interval data might seem a useful way to determine the variation about the mean fire-interval but data are scarce and interpretations are controversial. The Weibull distribution and its special case, the negative exponential distribution, have been the most supported in North American studies of unplanned fires. It has been argued that fire-interval distributions, before European settlement at least, were largely the result of large fires during, or following, extreme weather events (dry in forests, wet in the arid zone). Long weather records are most beneficial when they can be related to the areas burned each year. Practical solutions to the question 'what range of fire intervals should be used at any one site' may be achieved using highly simplified skewed distributions, constructed on the basis of land-management objectives.

J	Schneller, JJ				Schneller, JJ			How much genetic variation in fern populations is stored in the spore banks? A study of Athyrium filix-femina (L) Roth	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The genetic variation within spore banks of Athyrium filix-femina (L.) Roth from three sites in north-eastern Switzerland was investigated. At two sites spore banks were located beneath sporophyte populations. One collection site was 100m away from a sporophyte population. The gametophytes grown from the soil samples, the dimensions of which were 4 x 4 x 1.5 cm, and sporophytes from each site were analysed electrophoretically for either three or four variable allozyme loci. The spore banks from the different soil samples within and between populations revealed a considerable amount of genetic diversity. The most frequent alleles within the two sporophyte populations were, with a few exceptions, also the most frequent within the spore banks. The influence of single sporophytic individuals on the genetic composition of microsites seems to be considerably reduced by stochastic processes such as soil movement or the action of earthworms, which promote the mixing of spores from different spatial and temporal origins. It was shown that spores remain viable after passing through the gut of earthworms and that spore banks from even small soil samples revealed genetic diversity and could lead to a large number of genetically distinct sporophytes. The results suggest that fertilization seems to be close to random because the sporophyte populations sampled were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and had fixation index (F-is) close to zero.

J	Erkkila, HMJB				Erkkila, HMJB			Effect of different treatments on the seed bank of grazed and ungrazed Baltic seashore meadows	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Seed banks of two seashore meadows were studied on the west coast of Finland (latitude 61 degrees 30'-61 degrees 33'N, longitude 21 degrees 28'-21 degrees 41'E). Samples were taken in June to a depth of 10 cm in the geolittoral zone of the grazed and ungrazed transects. The grazed samples were halved lengthwise: one half was grown immediately, the other after cold treatment. One third of the all samples was treated as controls, one third was watered with brackish water, and one third was given a pesticide treatment. Altogether, 13 926 seedlings germinated and 25 species were identified (three annuals, two biennials, and the rest perennials). Most seedlings were perennial monocots, with Juncus gerardii Loisel. the most abundant species. The seed bank was significantly larger and richer in the ungrazed site than in the grazed site. Cold treatment reduced the number of germinating species and seedlings. In the grazed and non-cold-treated samples, the numbers of species and seedlings were highest in the pesticide treatment. In ungrazed samples there were no significant differences among treatments. After the cold treatment, the least number of species and seedlings was produced by the salt-water treatment. Changing brackish water to tap water led to a burst of germination, especially of J, gerardii. The seed bank of the upper geolittoral zone was richer than that of the middle geolittoral. The multivariate classification and ordination groupings are based on the abundances of J. gerardii and Glaux maritima L.; different treatments were not distinguishable. There was a low resemblance between the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation.

Tiller populations of these 2 grasses were studied for 2 years in the Nebraska Sandhills, Plant development was evaluated using a growth staging system which quantifies the development of tiller populations. A morphological growth index for each species was calculated from either the weighted average of tiller numbers reported as mean stage count (MSC) or tiller weight reported as mean stage weight (MSW) and correlated with the independent variables of growing degree days (GDD) and day of year (DOY), Correlation coefficients with the independent variables were greater than 0.97 for MSC and MSW within years and greater than 0.90 between years. Greater rainfall and warmer temperatures in 1991 increased the number of tillers in the more advanced morphological stages in prairie sandreed, but tiller weight rather than tiller number increased in more advanced stages of sand bluestem, A majority of the harvested tillers were vegetative throughout the sampling period but by the end of the growing season, a wide range of morphological stages were present. The use of grazing to prevent the formation of culmed tillers in these grasses may be unnecessary because of the high proportion of vegetative tillers and the wide range of morphological stages available for selection by livestock.

A coral of 58 vascular plant species emerged from soil seed bank samples with an average of 13.1 (+/- 1.6 SE) species recorded across geomorphic surfaces. The extant herbaceous layer vegetation (all vascular plant species less than or equal to 1 m in height) was more species-rich (137 species) than the seed bank flora with an average of 25.2 (+/- 2.8 SE) species. The number of plant species that emerged from soil seed bank samples varied considerably and ranged from 5 species in a floodplain coniferous forest to 34 species in a backwater slough habitat. Non-woody, perennial species dominated both the seed bank and extant floras. Species richness in both the soil seed bank and the ex:ant vegetation did not vary significantly across site inundation classes (low, moderate, frequent inundation). The low overall similarity between species composition of the soil seed bank and the extant vegetation suggests that only a subset of the herbaceous layer species that occur in Allegheny Plateau riparian forests relies on the seed bank as a mechanism for population regeneration and maintenance.																	0040-9618					JUL-SEP	1998	125	3					199	215		10.2307/2997218							WOS:000075480900003

J	Fernandez-Palacios, JM; Arevalo, JR				Fernandez-Palacios, JM; Arevalo, JR			Regeneration strategies of tree species in the laurel forest of Tenerife (The Canary Islands)	PLANT ECOLOGY												The laurel-forest of the Canary Islands is a montane cloud-forest. In order to gain some knowledge on the processes that maintain tree species diversity, we conducted an analysis of three different laurel-forest plots of the Anaga massif (Tenerife), varying in canopy composition but growing under similar environmental conditions. For each plot we recorded basal area of the canopy trees (h > 1.30 m), the density of suckers and seedlings (h < 1.30 m), as well as seed-bank composition. The plots have similar regeneration composition, which appears to be independent of differences in canopy composition. Laurus azorica is the most common seedling species, whereas Prunus lusitanica is the most abundant species among suckers and basal shoots. Neither Erica arborea nor Myrica faya, the two main canopy trees in one of the plots, were found in any of the stands as seedlings or suckers, despite their existence as viable seeds in the seed-bank. The regeneration composition and the canopy composition in one of the plots is remarkable different, revealing differents dynamics processes in the three plots. The results suggest the existence of three well-defined ecological groups: pioneer (regeneration primarily by seedlings), non-pioneer (regeneration by seedlings and suckers) and remnant species (regeneration primarily by suckers). These three groups and the effect of small scale disturbances (natural and human-induced), could help to understand the maintenance of tree species richness.

The treatments were: clear-cutting of trees with additional grazing and transplantation of sods from an open grassland with all possible sources of propagules. Species richness and composition were studied on a small-scale during 7 years in the transplanted patches of 20 x 20 cm and in their surroundings of 50 x 50 cm. In the cut and grazed site the species richness increased. Transplantation of sods from an open species-rich grassland did not result in higher richness even in their closest surroundings. In the forest, transplanted patches lost their high species richness by the second year. In the cut and grazed site, transplanted patches remained species-rich, but after 3 years, control patches reached the same level of species richness. In landscapes where former species-rich limestone grasslands are overgrown, but the local species pool has not yet changed, restoration of semi-natural grassland communities does not require the additional input of diaspores of grassland species. Transplantation of sods is potentially important method of community restoration in case of impoverished local species pools. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Brock, MA; Rogers, KH				Brock, MA; Rogers, KH			The regeneration potential of the seed bank of an ephemeral floodplain in South Africa	AQUATIC BOTANY												Germination from the seed banks of ephemeral floodplain wetlands of the Nyl River in South Africa was quantified in a glasshouse experiment to examine the potential of the seed bank for revegetation. Sediments from three sites with different wetting and drying histories (permanent, seasonal and occasional inundation) were collected in late summer after flooding and germination but before the seed bank was replenished. Samples were flooded artificially after dry, wet or wet/dry pretreatment and germination was recorded. Samples were then dried and reflooded to assess germination from the residual seed bank. All sites had a species-rich germinable seed bank, The water regime history of each site did not influence the number of species or individuals present in any trial or pretreatment. More species and individuals germinated in the first germination trial than the second. Fewer species germinated from the samples collected from above the water line than from underwater Sixteen species (12 aquatic) and 1392 individuals germinated in the first trial. Most species from the field communities also germinated from the seed bank. Twelve species, including 2 new species, germinated from the residual seed bank. Many of the species from these wetlands have persistent seed banks with staggered germination of propagules. Species maintain themselves over space (sites), conditions (water regimes) and time (trials) by a range of life-cycle patterns. Wetland communities that depend on their seed banks for revegetation between wetting and drying events may be altered by human-induced changes to water regimes.

J	Butler, BJ; Chazdon, RL				Butler, BJ; Chazdon, RL			Species richness, spatial variation, and abundance of the soil seed bank of a secondary tropical rain forest	BIOTROPICA												Despite the importance of the soil seed bank in tropical forest regeneration, little is known about spatial variability in species composition and abundance of seeds stored in the soil. To develop sampling methods For comparative studies, we examined species richness, spatial variation, and abundance of germinants from the soil seed bank in a 16 year old secondary, tropical wet forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at the intersection points of a gridded 1 ha plot (10 x 10-m grid, 121 samples) and in a nested 100 m(2) subplot (2 x 2-m grid, 36 samples). The 1 ha plot had a density of 4535 seeds/m(2) with 34 species observed. Based on a series of 100 randomized species accumulation curves, a Michaelis-Menten fit predicted a mean species richness of 36.3 species; the number of observed species was close to the predicted asymptote. A nonparametric, first-order jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 37.0 species. Eighty-five and 95 percent of the observed species richness is contained, on average, within 41 and 74 pooled samples, respectively. Within the 100 m2 nested subplot, a density of 5476 seeds/m(2) was observed, comprising 26 species with an estimated species richness (Michaelis-Menten fit) of 29.1 species. The jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 36.7 species. For species richness and abundance of both plots, spacial autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I) were not significantly different from zero at lag distances from 2 to 100 m, indicating a random distribution at these spatial scales. For this sire, accurate estimates of species composition depend upon the number of samples collected as well as the spatial distribution of sampling effort. Many small samples distributed over a large area provide greater accuracy and precision for estimating species richness of the soil seed bank.

J	Dupuy, JM; Chazdon, RL				Dupuy, JM; Chazdon, RL			Long-term effects of forest regrowth and selective logging on the seed bank of tropical forests in NE Costa Rica	BIOTROPICA												To investigate long-term effects of land use on the soil seed bank, we compared the abundance/density, species richness, life form distribution, and species composition of seeds stored in the soil of four 15-20 yr-old second-growth stands, two old-growth stands, and two previously selectively-logged stands in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rice. Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at 10 m intervals along three 120-160 m long transects in each stand (44-48 soil cores, 22-24 combined seed bank samples per site). Seed density was highest but variable in second-growth stands (8331-14535 seeds/m(2)), low and homogeneous in old-growth stands (2258-2659 seeds/m(2)), and intermediate and highly variable in selectively-logged stands (1165-6854 seeds/m(2)), which also had contrasting logging intensities. Species richness was strongly dependent on seed density, but showed less variation. Life form distribution did not differ statistically among or within land-use categories. In each stand, herbs-forbs, shrubs, and vines dominated the seed bank (> 75% of the species richness and abundance), whereas trees were a minor component (< 20% of the species richness and < 5% of the abundance) and were predominantly early successional. Shrubs and vines were most abundant in second-growth stands where regrowth vegetation was repeatedly cut before abandonment, whereas grasses and sedges were most abundant in the only forest stand that was completely surrounded by pastures. In terms of species composition, old-growth stands were more similar to selectively-logged stands than to second-growth stands, bur across stands, selectively-logged forests were most distinct from the other two forest types. An inventory of the standing woody vegetation in each site showed little representation of the woody taxa found in the seed bank. We discuss these results in the context of the main factors that have been postulated to influence the abundance, life form, and species composition of tropical forest seed banks, and explore the role of the latter during intermediate phases of tropical forest succession and regeneration.

J	Urbanska, KM; Fattorini, M				Urbanska, KM; Fattorini, M			Seed bank studies in the Swiss Alps. I. Un-restored ski run and the adjacent intact grassland at high elevation	BOTANICA HELVETICA												This preliminary study investigated soil seed banks in two high-alpine sites to assess the potential for unassisted recovery after disturbance. Comparisons were drawn between an unrestored ski run which was machine-graded about 27 years before, and the adjacent intact grassland. This is the first report on seed banks in the former site type. The soil seed reserve in the un-restored ski run included only 52+/-20 seeds per m(2), in spite of the fact that the ski run was graded ca. 27 years earlier, and intact vegetation occurred in close proximity; on the other hand, the seed reserve in the adjacent natural grassland averaged 2401+/-336 seeds per m(2). Only 3 species were identified in the seed banks of the un-restored ski run, whereas the number of species identified in the seed banks of grassland totalled 9. Distribution of species in the seed reserve was irregular. Not all species found in the soil cores contributed to the plant cover of the respective sites; discrepancies in frequency of species in the soil seed reserve vs, that in standing vegetation were a Iso recorded. The results indicate that in the graded ski run no unassisted recovery of vegetation from seed banks may be expected within a reasonable time period. It is concluded that improving seed deposition and seed production in situ should be considered a major issue in restoration schemes.																	0253-1453					JUN	1998	108	1					93	104									WOS:000074550900007						
J	Fischer, M; Matthies, D				Fischer, M; Matthies, D			Experimental demography of the rare Gentianella germanica: seed bank formation and microsite effects on seedling establishment	ECOGRAPHY												The persistence of populations of short-lived species requires regular reproduction and seedling establishment. A persistent seed bank can buffer populations against extinction in unfavourable years. We experimentally investigated seed fate in Gentianella germanica, an endangered biennial species characteristic for species-rich nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands in central Europe. We studied the effect of experimental gaps on seedling establishment from sown seeds and the fate of seeds buried in bags over two years. In December 1993 experiments were established at seven calcareous grassland sites in the Swiss Jura mountains. In spring 1994 seedlings emerged in all plots where seeds had been sown, including previously unoccupied patches. This suggests that limited dispersal within sites contributes to small population sizes. Significantly more seedlings emerged at sites with current populations of G. germanica than at unoccupied sites (5.95% vs 3.40%). Because this difference was not explained by germinations from the natural seed bank it indicates differences in habitat quality. Clipping of the vegetation and disturbance of the soil reduced vegetation cover in the following spring and enhanced seedling emergence. In undisturbed plots 4.5% of seeds sown produced a seedling in spring 1994, whereas in plots with clipped vegetation 9.9% and in disturbed plots 12.7% produced seedlings (p < 0.01). This suggests that management measures which create gaps in the vegetation (e.g. grazing) could positively influence population size and persistence of G. germanica. On average, we recovered 7.55% viable seeds after one year of burial in bags, and 4.05% after two years, indicating that G. germanica has a persistent seed bank. The demographic data indicate that the number of viable seeds in the seed bank exceeds the number of established plants in a population at least by a factor of 20. Restoration of extinct populations of the species from the seed bank may thus be possible if appropriate management measures are taken within a few years.

J	Pannell, JR; Barrett, SCH				Pannell, JR; Barrett, SCH			Baker's law revisited: Reproductive assurance in a metapopulation	EVOLUTION												Baker's Law states that it is more likely for self-compatible than for self-incompatible individuals to establish sexually reproducing colonies after long-distance dispersal, because only the former can do so with a single individual. This hypothesis, proposed by H. G. Baker 40 years ago is based largely on the observation that self-compatability is particularly frequent among colonists of oceanic islands. Here we argue that the principle of Baker's Law applies equally in the context of a metapopulation in which frequent local extinction is balanced by recolonization of sites by seed dispersal: metapopulation dynamics will select for an ability to self-fertilize. We review several studies that support this hypothesis and present a metapopulation model in which the seed productivity required by obligate outcrossers for their maintenance in a metapopulation is compared with that of selfers. Our model also estimates the reduction in the advantage of reproductive assurance to selfers as a result of perenniality and seed dormancy. In general, selection for reproductive assurance is greatest when the colony occupancy rate, p, is low and is much reduced when p approaches its maximum. This provides an explanation for the observation that many highly successful colonizers, in which p is often high, are self-incompatible. The basic model we present also lends itself to comparisons of metapopulation effects between unisexuality and cosexuality and between different modes of self-incompatibility.

J	Leishman, MR; Westoby, M				Leishman, MR; Westoby, M			Seed size and shape are not related to persistence in soil in Australia in the same way as in Britain	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Previous studies have shown that among British species, seeds that persist in the soil tend to be small and compact compared with non-persistent seeds. We tested whether or not this pattern is repeated among 101 Australian species, from a range of habitats. 2. Seed mass was plotted against variance of seed dimensions, across all species. Species with persistent seeds were found across the whole range of seed mass (0.217-648.9 mg) and variance (0.0000-0.2497), providing no evidence for a critical mass or variance which separated persistent from transient seeds. 3. We tested whether or not divergence within individual clades between persistent and transient seeds was associated with increased seed mass or seed dimension variance, using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Their was no consistent tendency found. 4. Thus for Australian species, persistent seeds were not smaller or more compact than transient seeds when compared across all species or when compared using PICs. Presumably the natural history of burial and disturbance operates differently in British and Australian habitats.

J	Araki, S; Shiozawa, S; Washitani, I				Araki, S; Shiozawa, S; Washitani, I			An experimental device for studying seed responses to naturally fluctuating temperature of surface soil under a constant water table	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. A simple experimental device was designed, in which seeds can be exposed to natural fluctuation of surface soil temperature under a constant soil moisture condition maintained by an automatic water supply system based on the principle of a Mariotte siphon. 2, Except for the period during summer drought, surface soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm and its fluctuation within the device were largely similar to the temperature of the surface soil subjected to natural fluctuation of moisture. 3. The seeds of Persicaria lapathifolia placed at the depth of 0 5 cm in the soil within the device germinated during the natural germination season of the species, while the seeds placed at the depth of 5 cm or beneath the 10 cm-thick layer of litter failed to germinate. 4. The ungerminated seeds retrieved in August did not germinate at the favourable alternating temperature in the laboratory test unless exposed to previous moist chilling, suggesting the induction of secondary dormancy. Therefore, higher summer temperatures but not summer drought or moisture fluctuation seem to have been responsible for the dormancy induction, because the dormancy was induced in the fully hydrated seeds.																	0269-8463					JUN	1998	12	3					492	499		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00210.x							WOS:000074764200021
