J	VANOVA, M; SPITZER, T; KLEM, K				VANOVA, M; SPITZER, T; KLEM, K			CONTROL OF DICOTYLEDONOUS WEED OCCURRENCE IN SPRING BARLEY	ROSTLINNA VYROBA												Our trials showed that spring barley could suppress dicotyledons effectively even in the field with a higher weed seed bank in the soil; in a lot of cases, an application of herbicides was not effective because no significant influence on the yield was found. Spring barley can suppress weeds and keep the field free of weeds till the harvest under certain conditions. The crop density plays an important role. It can be reached by an increased seeding rate or higher tillering. Conditions for powerful tillering based on cold weather and rainfall can be hardly foreseen. In the past, tillering was also supported by nitrogen top dressing applied at the 3rd-leaf growth stage of barley. Now, this application is strongly limited or completely eliminated. With regard to the fact that possibilities for the optimum density at low seeding rates are not sure it is necessary to reach the density required using a well considered seedling rate in relation to a variety. At adequate crop densities (750 to 850 ears.m-2), weeds are supposed to wither away in the shade and other ones will not emerge. The trials also show that it is not always easy to select out a suitable herbicide or a combination of them to control weeds in spring barley. Even in trials where a number of weeds at the beginning of the growing season was quite high and exceeded threshold values, only a low or no yield increase was observed after herbicide application. That can be caused either by the phytotoxicity of herbicides or the fact that the weed spectrum did not reduce the yield in those stands. Spring barley sensitivity to herbicides differs from that of winter wheat and some products can be detrimental. Mostly, herbicide rates applied to spring barley can be much lower than those applied to winter wheat. To recommend the weed control it is necessary to take into account that thresholds for weeds in spring barley are higher as compared to those in winter wheat. Weeds in winter wheat grow faster (during autumn and winter) than the crop while in spring, dicotyledons in spring barley grow slowlier than the crop in the field well prepared, and a strong competition of spring barley does not allow emerged weeds to develop. For good competitive ability the soil has to be well prepared in both the autumn and spring seasons. Not only the soil surface of the field should be treated because the compacted soil delays the initial crop growth and development. A sufficient amount of air in the soil is very important for a weak root system of spring barley and together with early sowing will secure rapid germination and growth. Agronomic and cropping practices for spring barley play a considerable role in consequent decision of using herbicides and their rates applied against dicotyledons in spring barley.

J	JANSEN, PI				JANSEN, PI			SEED PRODUCTION QUALITY IN TRIFOLIUM-BALANSAE AND TRIFOLIUM-RESUPINATUM - THE ROLE OF SEED COLOR	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Seed production is a crucial factor determining the survival of the small seeded annual pasture legumes Trifolium balansae and T. resupinatum, which are new to Australian farming systems. Work with other species suggests that seed colour may be an indicator for seed quality and hardseededness, which play a role in successful establishment of plants al the start of the growing season. Seed of Trifolium balansae cv. Paradana and T. resupinatum lines SA 12240, SA 14433 and cv. Kyambro, harvested directly from plants or retrieved from the seed bank, was investigated. Seed characteristics in all T. resupinatum lines were influenced by colour; brown seed was mainly soft, but little was produce by plants in the field. The percentage of brown seed in the seed bank was positively related to the percentage of soft seed and varied throughout the year. The difference between green and yellow T. resupinatum seed was less pronounced. Yellow seed had a lower thousand seed weight and germinated more slowly. The formation of green or yellow seed by plants was found to be controlled by both environmental and genetic factors.																	0251-0952						1995	23	2					353	364									WOS:A1995RX61400009						
J	Aparicio, A				Aparicio, A			Seed germination of Erica andevalensis Cabezudo and Rivera (Ericaceae), an endangered edaphic endemic in southwestern Spain	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Erica andevalensis is a recently described species, strictly edaphic endemic of ancient pyrite mining exploitations, which has been included in a list of endangered species subject to recovery plans in SW Spain. The germination of the seeds in the laboratory and their response to cool (chilling) pre-treatment has been studied in three consecutive germination trials. According to the evidence obtained,germination rates are dependent on whether or not the seeds received chilling treatment. Seeds without chilling pre-treatment germinated at low germination rates (6-21%) while germination rates of chilled seeds were higher (up to 86%). This probably means that seeds of E. andevalensis are mostly shed in a physiological dormant state which is only broken after one or two wet and cool periods. E. andevalensis is surely forming in its own habitat a type IV permanent seed bank (i.e. large and with little season variation), characteristic of species of unpredictably changing environments like its habitat is. 'Ecological longevity' of the seeds does nor seem to survive a three-four years period. Nevertheless, the 'potential longevity' of the seeds needs further investigation for genebank purposes, Significant differences in germination capability were observed between a sample of seeds which was air dried and stored at 4 degrees C for nine months and another sample of newly collected seeds. From a biological point of view, inbreeding depression in the self-compatible and mostly selling E. andevalensis if there is any, does not seem to be related to germination capability of the seeds.				abelardo, aparicio/E-3027-2010	abelardo, aparicio/0000-0001-7122-4421												0251-0952						1995	23	3					705	713									WOS:A1995TX85600014						
J	Defosse, GE; Bertiller, MB; Robberecht, R				Defosse, GE; Bertiller, MB; Robberecht, R			Germination characteristics of Festuca pallescens, a Patagonian bunchgrass with reclamation potential	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The influence of light, temperature, and soil water content on the germination of Festuca pallescens, an important forage species native to the steppe zone of Patagonia, Argentina, was examined in the laboratory. Seeds of F. pallescens, collected along an elevational gradient from 650 to 950 in a.s.l. on the Media Luna Ranch (43 degrees 63' S, 71 degrees 25' W) were tested for viability and germination. In petri dishes containing top soil of the collection area, 10 seeds were sown at a depth of 5 mm (dark treatment) and 10 on the soil surface (light treatment). The experiment was replicated five times at soil water contents 4, 8 and 16% and temperatures of 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. Seeds were considered germinated when either the coleoptile reached 5 min for the light treatment or when it protruded the soil surface for the dark treatment. Festuca pallescens seeds showed ed a viability of 99.5%. Exposure to continuous light delayed the beginning of germination, but had no influence on total germination percentages. A soil water content of 16% and medium to high temperatures (10, 15 and 20 degrees C) rapidly promoted germination, which reached 97% after 20 days of incubation. Germination was reduced by 40% at a soil water content of 8%. In all cases, a 5 degrees C soil temperature delayed the beginning of germination and slightly reduced its final germination percentages. Sporadic germination occurred at 4% soil water content at 10 degrees C, and none at any other temperature, Under field conditions, sowing should be practiced during the fall, when soil moisture and temperatures are optimum for germination.																	0251-0952						1995	23	3					715	723									WOS:A1995TX85600015						
J	Hakansson, S				Hakansson, S			Weeds in agricultural crops .1. Life-forms and occurrence under Swedish conditions	SWEDISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Weed communities on arable land are briefly discussed as early stages in (secondary) vegetation successions on disturbed ground, and weed control is looked upon as measures obstructing the successional course. The weeds are grouped into annuals, biennials and perennials and, further, into a number of subgroups, modifying some of the definitions given in the literature. Groups and subgroups, life-forms, are defined regarding reproduction, longivity and seasonal rhythm of development and growth, emphasizing the resulting tolerance or response to mechanical disturbance by, mainly, soil cultivation in different seasons. Differences in the occurrence of weeds of different life-forms in spring- and autumn-sown annual crops and in perennial crops on arable land, i.e. mainly leys, are illustrated and explained as consequences of the plant character. The life-form of a species sometimes varies for genetic or environmental reasons.																	0049-2701						1995	25	4					143	154									WOS:A1995UM14100001						
J	Hakansson, S				Hakansson, S			Weeds in agricultural crops .2. Life-forms and occurrence in a European perspective	SWEDISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												A grouping of weeds regarding their life-forms with special emphasis on their different occurrence in agricultural crops under Swedish conditions is tested for Europe as a whole. Data from a European weed survey made available by a group working in biological control are used. The occurrence of weeds of different life-forms shows, in principle, the same pattern for Europe as a whole as for Sweden and can be described satisfactorily by the grouping used in Sweden. As in this country, no typically biennial species are found among the more important weeds. Stationary and stoloniferous perennials, sensitive to soil cultivation, are of minor importance, particularly in annual crops sown or planted after soil cultivation. Annuals predominantly occur in these crops. In orchards and vineyards with their, at least partly, mechanically or chemically disturbed area they are more apparent than in Swedish perennial leys. Among the perennials, only those with strong creeping rhizomes or creeping roots are important weeds in annual crops, and some of them are even more important in orchards and vineyards than they are in Swedish leys.																	0049-2701						1995	25	4					155	161									WOS:A1995UM14100002						
J	Hakansson, S				Hakansson, S			Weeds in agricultural crops .3. Life-forms, C-3 and C-4 photosynthesis and plant families in a global perspective	SWEDISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Weeds are grouped regarding life-forms and occurrence, C-3 or C-4 photosynthesis and plant families. Relationships between life-forms and their occurrence in fields with annual and perennial crops, i.e. on ground differently disturbed by mechanical means, are analysed and compared with analyses for Sweden and Europe. The analyses are mainly based on 76 species among ''the world's worst weeds'' described by Helm et al. (1977). In addition, 46 species in the European and 74 in the Swedish weed flora are considered. Annual weeds mainly occur in annual crops, i.e. on ground frequently disturbed mechanically, but to some extent also in less disturbed areas. Stationary and stoloniferous perennials are more abundant on less disturbed ground, but those with a high seed production and a rapid seedling growth are often important weeds also in annual crops. Perennials with rhizomes of creeping roots are important weeds in both annual and perennial crops. The behaviour of a species as an annual or a short-lived perennial often varies. There are proportionally more C-4 plants among the perennial weeds, foremost among the rhizomatous perennials, than among the annuals. Most of them are Poaceae and Cyperaceae plants. Poaceae and Asteraceae are the families most represented in the weed flora throughout the world. Poaceae seems to have a particularly high representation in warm climates.																	0049-2701						1995	25	4					163	171									WOS:A1995UM14100003						
J	ESLER, KJ; COWLING, RM				ESLER, KJ; COWLING, RM			THE COMPARISON OF SELECTED LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS OF MESEMBRYANTHEMA SPECIES OCCURRING ON AND OFF MIMA-LIKE MOUNDS (HEUWELTJIES) IN SEMIARID SOUTHERN AFRICA	VEGETATIO												Selected life-history characteristics of Mesembryanthema species occurring on and off mima-like mounds (heuweltjies) were compared at Tierberg in the southern Succulent Karoo, South Africa. Seed production, the number of seeds retained in seed capsules and germination behaviour were measured in fourteen species of Mesembryanthema which were representatives of two sub-families: the Ruschioideae and the Mesembryanthemoideae. Species occurring on heuweltjies had low overall germination and high seed retention compared with those species occurring off heuweltjies. A strong negative correlation was found between the degree of seed retention and maximum germination. It was proposed that rapid germination and low seed dormancy in species occurring on the flats would be a viable strategy where competition for safe recruitment sites is strong. Species occurring on the flats are long-lived woody shrubs, thus the resulting high levels of seedling mortality probably do not have a major impact on population dynamics. Heuweltjies are sites of intense disturbance. Plant species that occur on heuweltjies can also occur off heuweltjies in disturbed vegetation. Opportunistic life-history characteristics allow these species to colonise disturbed areas. Heuweltjie species thus act as pioneers in a successional process which results ultimately in the re-colonisation of the long-lived flats species. Phylogenetic factors may also determine the species distributions. Members of the Mesembryanthemoideae did not occur off heuweltjies in undisturbed areas. Most Ruschioideae were found on the flats but the few species that occurred on heuweltjies shared similar characteristics with the Mesembryanthemoideae. The primitive life-history characteristics exhibited by the Mesembryanthemoideae enable them to exploit disturbed conditions.

J	REGNIER, EE				REGNIER, EE			TEACHING SEED BANK ECOLOGY IN AN UNDERGRADUATE LABORATORY EXERCISE	WEED TECHNOLOGY												The study of weed life cycles, reproductive strategies, and the soil seed bank is emphasized in the undergraduate weed science course at Ohio State University as central to an understanding of the survival of weeds in the environment. A laboratory exercise was conducted every spring and fall academic quarter from 1991 to 1993 to demonstrate the effects of long-term cropping and soil disturbance histories on weed seed banks and aboveground weed communities. Five sites with diverse histories of culture were sampled; these included a field cultivated in vegetables under continuous conventional tillage for 59 yr, a field cultivated in field corn under continuous no-tillage for 11 yr, a 24 yr-old turfgrass research farm, a 70 yr-old forest, and a section of the forest border. Students conducted a survey of the weeds growing at the sites and separated and identified seeds from soil samples over a 3-wk period in weekly 2-h laboratory periods. Students wrote reports interpreting the data based on their knowledge of the site histories, weed life cycles, and weed seed production and longevity characteristics. The data were consistent over academic quarters as well as with published research, indicating that the survey and soil sampling techniques provided a reasonably accurate representation of the weed flora and soil seed populations. Weeds found growing at the sites were primarily summer annuals at the vegetable site, and a mix of summer and winter annuals, biennials, and perennials at the remaining sites. Annual weeds dominated the seed banks of all sites with common lambsquarters, pigweed spp., and common purslane being the most commonly found seeds. The presence of most seeds in the soil could be explained by a combination of species seed production and seed longevity characteristics and species abundance in the standing community. Interpretation of the data required students to integrate and apply lecture material and provided an excellent thinking exercise.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	1995	9	1					5	16									WOS:A1995QQ42600001

Seasonal data on persistent seed bank showed a substantial loss of seeds in the seed bank after dispersal especially after rainfall where seeds either germinated or were washed deep into the soil. A high degree of similarity was observed between the buried seed bank flora and vegetation. There was a significant increase in mortality soon after recruitment followed by little change in population size during late vegetative phase. Mortality rate again increased at the time of flowering. Vegetative growth of plants increases significantly at the seedling stage but declined at the time of flowering. Biomass allocated to reproduction increased with the increase in the size of the seedlings which was shared by roots and shoots and later by root, stem and leaf. During flowering and fruiting time the reproductive allocations approached up to 30%.				Khan, Muhammad Ajmal/I-6429-2015; Khan, M. Ajmal/L-7721-2015	Khan, M.

J	HAUKOS, DA; SMITH, LM				HAUKOS, DA; SMITH, LM			COMPOSITION OF SEED BANKS ALONG AN ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT IN PLAYA WETLANDS	WETLANDS												We analyzed the composition of seed banks dong an elevational gradient (0-1 m) in playa wetlands of the Southern High Plains of Texas. Differing seed-bank composition along such a gradient may be one mechanism in the determination of vegetation structure in wetlands. We used the seedling-emergence technique under moist-soil and submerged treatments to ascertain the composition of seed banks in 8 playas. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in overall or common species seedling densities along the elevational gradient. Fluctuating water levels in a relatively shallow wetland, combined with the short linear distance of the gradient into a flat bottom, results in the uniform distribution of seed in playas. Additionally, wind action during periods when playas are dry may serve to distribute seeds throughout the wetland. Structure of vegetation in playas is determined principally by the varying soil moisture regime, which regulates composition of species germinating when other environmental conditions are suitable. When environmental conditions, including soil-moisture content, are appropriate for germination, each species in the seed bank could potentially be found throughout the wetland. When managing playas for specific plant species through manipulation of soil moisture, we can expect a comparable species response to similar treatments anywhere in the playa.																	0277-5212					DEC	1994	14	4					301	307		10.1007/BF03160636							WOS:A1994PZ38500006

Low seed densities, averaging 2000 m-2, were recorded, but dicotyledonous weed seed numbers usually increased following oilseed rape crops, reaching 26 000 m-2 in one field. Field-to-field variability was large. Samples could be grouped using multivariate techniques into those dominated by grass weed seeds and those containing mainly dicotyledonous weed seeds. Within TWINSPAN classifications, most fields maintained similar seed banks during the study period, indicating relative stability of communities. Differences present at the outset of the experiment, including variation between fields in the same treatment area, were maintained for the five years. Patterns were not associated with straw disposal or spring herbicide application. Oilseed rape crops did not cause qualitative change in seed bank communities, but allowed certain species, notably Stellaria media and Sonchus asper, to increase seed numbers. Smaller and less diverse seed banks in the area receiving most herbicide were not statistically significant. Seed banks gave poor predictions of following weed populations.

The present-day Arctic flora in some regions may therefore have derived at least some of its genetic inheritance from populations that survived in ice-free refugia in the high Arctic polar deserts during the latter stages of the Weichselian glaciation. Increasing evidence for sudden changes in climate at high latitudes in the past, suggests that Arctic vegetation would have been subjected to rapid climatic warming if it had maintained a presence in these regions during the late Weichselian. A review of what is known about plant survival in the high Arctic since pre-Holocene times, coupled with an examination of some of the physiological properties of modern populations in these regions is presented in an attempt to ascertain if high Arctic plants possess mechanisms which facilitate their capacity to respond either phenotypically or physiologically to climatic change.																	0932-8629					OCT	1994	107	5					271	278		10.1111/j.1438-8677.1994.tb00796.x							WOS:A1994PM38100001

J	HORVITZ, CC; SCHEMSKE, DW				HORVITZ, CC; SCHEMSKE, DW			EFFECTS OF DISPERSERS, GAPS, AND PREDATORS ON DORMANCY AND SEEDLING EMERGENCE IN A TROPICAL HERB	ECOLOGY												The influence of biotic and abiotic factors on seed fates are exceptionally difficult to analyze in natural populations because it is not usually possible to identify an emerging seedling with its history as a seed. Large seed size and the unusual feature that the seed body remains attached to the new seedling in the ant-dispersed herb Calathea ovandensis provided an opportunity for field experiments that examine the influence of(l) seed dispersers, (2) treefall gaps, and (3) post-dispersal predators on seed survival, seed dormancy, seedling emergence, and seedling distributions. In a seed depot experiment, seed-dispersing ants significantly affected the seedling emergence patterns in three ways. Seeds with rewards for ants: (a) had improved seedling emergence, by 1.6-fold (17.4 vs. 10.6%); (b) gave rise to seedlings with a mean dispersal distance that was threefold farther (34 vs. 114 cm); and (c) generated a non-leptokurtic seedling shadow(kurtosis: -0.60, not significant vs. 10.84, P < 0.001) in contrast to seeds without ant rewards. There was significant spatial variation in the effect of ant rewards on seedling emergence and also temporal variation in seedling emergence, the greatest number of seedlings emerging in an el Nino year. In two germination box experiments: (1) treefall gaps enhanced seedling emergence 180-fold (72.4 vs. 0.4%) compared to the deep shade, and ungerminated seeds in the deep shade were mostly dormant, not dead; (2) post-dispersal seed predation was very low (overall mean of 6.2%), with considerable microspatial variability, and pathogens and small invertebrates accounted for only one-fourth as much seed mortality as larger (vertebrate and large insect) post-dispersal predators. Seedling emergence in this ant-dispersed herb with a relatively long-lived seed bank depends upon a complex of factors, suggesting an interaction of the effects of biotic dispersal to local safe microsites with larger scale effects of spatial and temporal variation in the abiotic environment.																	0012-9658					OCT	1994	75	7					1949	1958		10.2307/1941599							WOS:A1994PK12900009

Ortho-dihydroxyphenol and cyanoglycoside concentrations were determined in seeds of over 80 species, drawn largely from the native British flora but including a number of weeds and other species of agricultural significance. 2. All seeds examined contained at least trace amounts of hydroxyphenols and three-quarters released hydrogen cyanide on hydrolysis. A highly significant correlation was found between (a) seed persistance in the soil and ortho-dihydroxyphenol concentration and (b) between protein content, as a measure of the nutritional value of the seed, and ortho-dihydroxyphenol content. No such relation was found with cyanoglycosides. 3. Particularly high concentrations of ortho-dihydroxyphenols were found throughout species within the order Myrtales (Onagraceae and relatives), all with little or no seed endosperm. 4. From this broad survey we conclude that ortho-dihydroxyphenols, as a class, play an important role in maintaining seed persistence in the soil, probably by deferring or decreasing the rate of decomposition by microbes as well as by defending against herbivory, and that this is one important mechanism, along with morphological adaptations, which confers longevity and persistence on seeds buried in cool temperature and relatively moist soil conditions.

These weed management systems included zero, low, medium, and high input systems. The weed seedbank increased faster in zero and low input weed management systems than in the high input weed management systems because of differences in weed control. Tillage influenced weed seed densities as well. Common ragweed, common lambsquarters, horseweed, and sicklepod seed densities often were greater in no-tillage than conventional-tillage plots. Common cocklebur and large crabgrass seed densities were usually greater in conventional-tillage than no-tillage plots. Smooth pigweed seed densities were not affected by tillage. Increasing weed management inputs diminished differences between tillage systems. Smooth pigweed dominated the weed populations after 4 yr in both tillage systems even in high input systems.

J	MILBERG, P				MILBERG, P			GERMINATION ECOLOGY OF THE GRASSLAND BIENNIAL LINUM-CATHARTICUM	ACTA BOTANICA NEERLANDICA												The germination ecology of the short-lived grassland biennial Linum catharticum L. was studied. Its seeds had a primary dormancy that was overcome by cold-treatment. Seeds buried in the soil became germinative in midwinter (December), but since the seeds germinate only at relatively high temperatures, autumn-sown seeds did not germinate in the field until late spring, at which time the average soil temperature was 20-degrees-C. During the first half of the summer, buried seeds re-entered dormancy, but by August this secondary dormancy became dormant again. Hence, buried L. catharticum seeds exhibited an annual dormancy cycle. Most exhumed seeds needed light to germinate, which is probably why L. catharticum accumulates a persistent soil seed bank. After 25 months, 96% of the seeds buried were still ungerminated and alive.

Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted in 1990 to 1992 to compare the seedling emergence patterns of diclofopmethyl-resistant and susceptible Italian ryegrass. Timing of seedling emergence in full sunlight differed for the two biotypes. In general, the herbicide-susceptible biotype emerged earlier than the resistant biotype. Greatest emergence for the susceptible biotype was in August and September, the period prior to typical winter cereal crop sowing. Soil shading enhanced resistant seedling emergence during August and September, suggesting that soil temperature plays an important role in regulating seed germination of this biotype. Before current-year seed shed, the seed bank in the experimental plots was found to contain three times as many viable resistant seeds as susceptible seeds. In a corroborating experiment, we found that Italian ryegrass seeds with a greater degree of dormancy were more likely to be herbicide resistant than those with a lesser degree of dormancy. Our results support the hypothesis that the timing of field tillages and herbicide use is a selective force for increasing seed dormancy and thus for changing seedling emergence patterns as herbicide-resistant Italian ryegrass weed populations evolve. The linkage between changes in seed dormancy and herbicide resistance traits has ecological and agronomical implications.																	0002-1962					SEP-OCT	1994	86	5					823	828		10.2134/agronj1994.00021962008600050014x							WOS:A1994PP64900014

Transect studies in dry rainforest and savanna woodland across varying intensities of lantana infestation show a negative correlation between the density of lantana and tree cover in rainforest. The density of pig rooting is very high in areas of the dry rainforest on deep soil that was not heavily infested with lantana. It is suggested that the digging activities of these animals may cause tree death and subsequent increased light penetration, which favours lantana. The species richness of the dry rainforest declines as the density of lantana increases. However, the saplings and seedlings and the soil seed bank of dry rainforest and savanna woodland tree species have comparable densities in heavy and light lantana infestations. The proliferation of lantana results in the build up of heavy fuel loads across the boundary of dry rainforest and savanna woodland. Recent fires have killed the canopy trees in a large area of dry rainforest within the Park. Active management of Forty Mile Scrub National Park is urgent and some initiatives are suggested.

In this investigation we found that there is a continuum of weight change from lighter central achenes to the heavier peripheral achenes. The main component of change is the pericarp. Outer achenes may also contain larger quantities of phenolic compounds than inner achenes. The differences in mass, morphology, and chemical characteristics may be significant enough to result in differences in germination behaviour. No such differences were seen in standard laboratory germination tests, though in a greenhouse experiment, seedlings from peripheral achenes emerged later and were larger and taller than seedlings from central achenes. The presence of phenolic compounds in the fruits of T. dubius suggests that the peripheral morphs may retain viability longer in the seed bank.																	0008-4026					SEP	1994	72	9					1282	1288		10.1139/b94-156							WOS:A1994PQ55400006

SMOKE-DERIVED GERMINATION CUES FOR POSTFIRE ANNUAL, NICOTIANA-ATTENUATA TORR EX WATSON	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												Some postfire annuals with dormant seeds use heat or chemical cues from charred wood to synchronize their germination with the postfire environment. We report that wood smoke and polar extracts of wood smoke, but not the ash of burned wood, contain potent cue(s) that stimulate germination in the postfire annual plant, Nicotiana attenuata. We examined the responses of seeds from six populations of plants from southwest Utah to extracts of smoke and found the proportion of viable seeds that germinated in the presence of smoke cues to vary between populations but to be consistent between generations. With the most dormant genotypes, we examine three mechanisms by which smoke-derived chemical cues may stimulate germination (chemical scarification of the seed coat and nutritive- and signal-mediated stimulation of germination) and report that the response is consistent with the signal-mediated mechanism. The germination cue(s) found in smoke are produced by the burning of hay, hardwood branches, leaves, and, to a lesser degree, cellulose. Moreover, the cues are found in the common food condiment, ''liquid smoke,'' and we find no significant differences between brands. With a bioassay-driven fractionation of liquid smoke, we identified 71 compounds in active fractions by GC-MS and AA spectrometry. However, when these compounds were tested in pure form or in combinations that mimicked the composition of active fractions over a range of concentrations, they failed to stimulate germination to the same degree that smoke fractions did. Moreover, enzymatic oxidation of some of these compounds also failed to stimulate germination. In addition, we tested 43 additional compounds also reported from smoke, 85 compounds that were structurally similar to those reported from smoke and 34 compounds reported to influence germination in other species. Of the 233 compounds tested, 16 paved to inhibit germination at the concentrations tested, and none reproduced the activity of wood smoke. By thermally desorbing smoke produced by cellulose combustions that was trapped on Chromosorb 101, we demonstrate that the cue is desorbed between 125 and 150 degrees C. We estimate that the germination cues are active at concentrations of less than 1 pg/seed and, due to their chromatographic behavior, infer that a number of different chemical structures are active. In separate experiments, we demonstrate that cues remain active for at least 53 days in soil under greenhouse conditions and that the application of aqueous extracts of smoke to soil containing seeds results in dramatic increases in germination of artificial seed banks. Hence, although the chemical nature of the germination cue remains elusive, the stability of the germination cues, their water-solubility, and their activity in low concentrations suggest that these cues could serve as powerful tools for the examination of dormant seed banks and the selective factors thought to be important in the evolution of postfire plant communities.

GERMINATION OF NICOTIANA-ATTENUATA IN RESPONSE TO SMOKE-DERIVED CUES AND NUTRIENTS IN BURNED AND UNBURNED SOILS	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												Nicotiana attenuata is a native tobacco that is commonly found usually one growing season after fires in the blackbrush, sagebrush and pinyon-juniper forests of the Great Basin desert of North America. This plant also occurs in isolated dry washes and roadsides for many consecutive seasons. Postfire annuals are thought to synchronize their germination from the seed bank with the postfire environment in response to increases in (1) fire-related cues or (2) nutrient supply rates resulting from the mineralization of nutrients by fire, or (3) the removal of allelochemicals produced by the dominant vegetation occupying the sites before the burn or the microbial community associated with the dominant vegetation. We examine the effect of these three changes on the germination of N. attenuata seed from artificial seed banks made with burned and unburned soil taken in 1993 from under four dominant shrub species (Coleogyne ramosissima, Yucca baccata, Lycium andersonnii, Purshia tridentata) of an area that burned in 1992 and from two dry washes in which N. attenuata populations have persisted since at least 1988. We utilize our recent discovery that aqueous extracts of wood smoke contain potent germination cue(s) for this species and the established observation that nitrate stimulates germination in many Nicotiana species. In two experiments, we added smoke-derived germination cues and nutrients separately and in combinations to the artificial seed banks, measured germination rates, and inferred the effect of burning by the response of the seed banks to these additions. Germination rates of seed in burned soil were consistently higher than those in unburned soil collected from under all species tested; concentrations of nitrate, P, Mn, and Ca were also higher in burned than unburned soils. Because the addition of more cue and nitrate to burned soil increased germination rates, these soil components may not be at concentrations sufficient to saturate the germination response one year after a fire. The germination of seeds in soil collected from beneath unburned Yucca bacatta plants increased to the same level as that found under burned plants of the same species with the addition of cue and nitrate. Similarly, unburned bitterbrush soil attained the same germination potential with the addition of cue and a complete nutrient solution as burned bitterbrush soil. We conclude that the effect of fire on the germination potential of bitterbrush and yucca soil is due to increases in germination cue and nutrients. However, since the addition of cue and nutrients to the unburned soils under blackbrush and wolfberry shrubs did not elevate the germination potential of these soils to that found in burned soils, we conclude that these species alter the soil so as to inhibit germination and burning reverses this alteration. The presence of persistent N. attenuata populations in washes could not be attributed to particular chemical characteristics of these soils. Additions of cue dramatically increased germination potential of these soils, whereas the addition of nitrate did not. The concentrations of most mineral nutrients resembled those found in the unburned sites with the exception of Mn, Cu, and Zn, which were higher. However, these cations do not influence germination rates. Treatment of soil taken from these washes with cue resulted in significant increases in germination of N. attenuata seeds in the natural seed bank compared to water-treated controls, demonstrating that the plants growing in washes also produce dormant seeds that require the smoke cue for germination.

J	HULME, PE				HULME, PE			POSTDISPERSAL SEED PREDATION IN GRASSLAND - ITS MAGNITUDE AND SOURCES OF VARIATION	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Post-dispersal seed predation by rodents and invertebrates, was studied in two grassland sites in Berkshire, UK. The influence of season, seed density, seed burial, seed species, as well as within- and between-habitat variation on the removal of nineteen species of herbaceous seeds was investigated using exclosure experiments. 2 Analysis examined two components of seed predation: seed encounter (the probability of at least one seed being removed) and seed exploitation (the proportion of seeds removed once encountered). Seed removal was greatest from treatments to which rodents had access, losses attributable to invertebrates were negligible. 3 Burial reduced rodent encounter at both seed densities used and explained almost 21% of the variation, while having only a limited effect on the proportion of seeds exploited. Burial increased the variation in encounter attributable to the other sources examined and altered the direction of habitat, season and species effects. Interpretation of surface seed predation data to details of plant recruitment for seeds which form buried seed banks should be undertaken with caution. 4 Examination of rodent seed removal patterns revealed that on average 14% of the variation in both seed encounter and exploitation was attributable to small-scale spatial differences within habitats related to the distribution of small mammals. 5 No significant between site variation was found for encounter (< 2%) while seed density effects accounted for approximately 11% of the variation. Single seeds were encountered less than half as frequently as seeds in groups of 10. Density-dependence varied with seed size, with predation of large seeds less influenced by a reduction in seed density. 6 No significant species variation was found for seed encounter (species means ranged from 50 to 60%). In contrast, species effects for seed exploitation were significant and species means ranged from 20 to 95%.

The production of fertile shoots responded strongly to management practices. On sites where mowing alternated with fallow, autumn mowing led to an increase of fertile shoot density in Schoenus ferrugineus and a decrease in Molinia caerulea in the subsequent season. Repeated annual mowing after long-term fallow raised the density in Schoenus and inhibited initiation of flowering shoots in Molinia. Seed set and viability were influenced mainly by climatic or other factors. Variation of seed production between sites and in consecutive years at the same site could thus be large. The relationship between total seed production and seed bank was weak, but it improved when germination rates were included in the calculation. As the seed bank was generally smaller than the viable seed production, low survival and a high turnover of seeds in the upper soil layers is assumed for both species. Implications for recruitment strategies are discussed.																	1100-9233					SEP	1994	5	4					569	578		10.2307/3235984							WOS:A1994PN43700016

Subsequent changes in cover, species richness and composition were observed over the two following vegetation cycles (until May 1990), and compared to the dynamics in undisturbed samples. The identity of the colonizers for each disturbance date were compared to the soil readily-germinable seed content, sampled simultaneously to the disturbances. The species richness of the samples within the fields increased the first year after disturbance. Within-field heterogeneity for taxonomic composition was unchanged, but species turnover was increased by disturbances. The dynamics of richness and composition followed consistent patterns in the three fields. These patterns were strongly related to the seasonal rainfall distribution and clearly linked to the germination timings of the species and to seed bank composition. The identity of species depending on season and treatment were independent between fields. The effects of small scale disturbances on patterns of species establishments and replacements depended on their timings. Disrupting the dominance by autumn established gasses and legumes, they opened windows for germinations of annual forbs and for spring establishment of perennials. These species were otherwise present as understory species or in the seed bank. Results of these experiments provide insights into the mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity in this Mediterranean old field system. Asynchronous small-scale disturbances appear to be effective in maintaining diversity as a result from the interplay of differences in regeneration niches, lottery for establishment, and the incidence of different conditions in time and space.																	0030-1299					SEP	1994	70	3					455	473		10.2307/3545786							WOS:A1994PK79700019

The total sample size was 112 and 86 questionnaires were returned - a response rate of 77%. The contribution of weed biology knowledge in the improvement of weed control technology was rated as 'substantial' or 'high' by 57% of respondents. The three topics of plant biology expected to make the greatest contribution to weed management in the future were (1) competition/interference, (2) dynamics of seed banks, (3) dormancy/germination. However, the three topics that were predicted to become relatively more important in the future (compared with the present) were (1) genetics/evolution, (2) interactions with other organisms, (3) computer modelling. With reference to herbicide usage, most respondents expect the use of herbicides in terms of area treated or number of applications to remain at about the same level as at present, or to decline slightly, during the next 10 years. They expect a much larger decrease in the tonnage of herbicides used. The use of conventional herbicides is expected to remain considerably more important than non-herbicidal methods of weed control. Only one respondent expected non-herbicidal control methods to become relatively more important than conventional herbicides by the year 2003. These results are compared with a similar survey conducted in the USA in 1991.																	0261-2194					AUG	1994	13	5					381	387		10.1016/0261-2194(94)90054-X							WOS:A1994NX67900010						
J	VANDERVALK, AG; SQUIRES, L; WELLING, CH				VANDERVALK, AG; SQUIRES, L; WELLING, CH			ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF AN INCREASE IN WATER-LEVEL ON WETLAND VEGETATION	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Three different approaches for assessing the impact of a permanent increase in water level on wetland vegetation were studied using a long-term, controlled. and replicated experiment. These three approaches were: (1) digitized vegetation maps derived from aerial photographs; (2) vegetation data (species abundance, species diversity) from 10 permanent quadrats in each cell;, and (3) Bray-Curtis similarity indices comparing the composition of the vegetation in permanent quadrats within a cell and among cells. This study was conducted in a 10-celled wetland complex in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. There were three water level treatments: (1) the normal or mean regulated water level in the surrounding Delta Marsh, (2) the medium (30 cm above normal), and (3) the high (60 cm above normal). There were four, three, and three cells (ranging in total area from 6 to 8 ha), respectively, in each treatment. The vegetation in all cells had been reestablished with a drawdown just prior to this study. To reduce cell-to-cell variation, we adjusted the indicators derived from vegetation maps from 1985 through 1989 by subtracting the mean values of the same indicators in 1979 and 1980, after 15-16 yr of normal water level conditions. The adjusted percentage of a cell covered with open water increased significantly and two other adjusted indicators, the number of vegetation types and the number of multispecies vegetation types, decreased significantly in the flooded treatments. The percentage of a cell covered with sparse emergent vegetation and percentage covered with standing litter did not differ significantly among treatments. In permanent quadrats, species richness, total shoot density of the emergent species, and the Shannon diversity index showed significant treatment effects: all three declined in the flooded treatments. The Simpson's index, however, did not show a treatment effect. When Bray-Curtis similarity indices comparing the vegetation either among permanent quadrats within a cell or for the same permanent quadrat in a cell among years were used, either within-cell vegetation heterogeneity or ongoing successional changes in the vegetation made it impossible to detect treatment effects.																	1051-0761					AUG	1994	4	3					525	534		10.2307/1941954							WOS:A1994NZ30800010

Vegetation was buried by deposits of ash and pumice from 1 to 3 m in depth from the 1977-78 eruptions. Three habitats were selected: tephra, tephra in gully and original surface. Plant density and plant cover data were analyzed separately. Environmental factors consisted of five quantitative variables (organic matter, elevation, distance from colonizing source, erosion and deposition of volcanic deposits) and three nominal variables (habitat types: tephra, tephra in gully and original surface). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the original surface played a special role in vegetation development because the old topsoil supplied both nutrients and seed-bank species. The CCA also suggested that the environmental factors that influence plant density and cover differ. Distance from colonizing source affected plant density while erosion affected cover. Using CCA, factors could be distinguished that influenced seedling establishment from vegetation expansion and vegetation recovery dynamics could also be more clearly interpreted.

An experiment was set up in 1986 on a species-poor grassland in Oxfordshire to determine the effect of sheep grazing management on vegetation change after cessation of fertilizer applications. Three seasons of grazing (winter, spring and summer) were applied. each with two grazing intensities, in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with two blocks in 16 paddocks. 2. Point quadrat surveys in 1990 showed that the grassland vegetation was dominated by perennial grasses and that the frequency distribution of species was highly skewed. Dicotyledonous species ('dicots') were extremely rare, having an overall frequency of only 0-43%. 3. The frequencies of eight of the 10 dominant grasses were significantly affected by grazing intensity although these effects depended on the grazing season, were species-specific and were generally small. 4. Intensive surveys of the dicots in 1990-91 discovered 40 species although most of these were rare. The dicots exhibited stronger and more consistent responses than the grasses, their abundances being significantly increased by increased grazing in one or more grazing periods. Dicot species number was significantly increased by increased grazing intensity in all periods. 5. The potential was studied for seedling establishment in gaps to bring about vegetation change. Regular monitoring of the natural recruitment of seedlings into artificially created gaps was carried out in each paddock. Comparison between the species composition of seedlings emerging in gaps where the soil had been replaced with a sterile loam and that of gaps formed over the original soil showed no evidence of a persistent seed bank and that all seeds were probably derived from recent seed rain. 6. No species novel to the vegetation emerged in the gaps and the species composition of seedlings in the gaps was significantly and positively correlated with that of the vegetation in a majority of the paddocks. However, some species differences in the contribution to the seed rain were noted. In particular, the dicots were over-represented. The number of grass seedlings in the gaps was decreased by increased summer grazing. 7. Therefore, grazing had complex effects on vegetation change. Change is likely to be slow. especially while fertility is high, because of the small responses of the grasses to the grazing treatments and the lack of input of novel species from a seed bank. However, the dicots may continue to increase under increased grazing because of their high seed production and the effects of grazing in increasing gap frequencies.

The impact of bloom picking on subsequent flower and cone production, seed bank dynamics and plant architecture was studied in three picked and three unpicked 13-year-old populations of Banksia hookeriana, a canopy seed-storing, fire-sensitive shrub, growing on infertile sands in dry-mediterranean scrub-heath near Eneabba, Western Australia. 2. Since reaching reproductive maturity at 4 years, bloom picking over the subsequent 9 years reduced plant canopy area and volume by 37% and 44% respectively, with a 56% reduction in the number of 1-year-old stems, compared with the unpicked plants. 3. A total of 13255 blooms ha-1 was picked over the 9 years, accounting for 29% of total production. Cockatoos removed a further 2477 blooms ha-1 (5% of the total), but removed over 3 times as many blooms in the unpicked plants (7562 ha-1, 7% of the total). 4. Resprouting was much more likely from cockatoo-damaged stems than from picked stems. 5. Picked plants produced 35% fewer blooms than unpicked plants, but percentage cone fertility and the number of follicles per fertile cone did not differ significantly. 6. Seed production and storage per individual plant were 50% and 57% lower respectively in the picked plants. 7. There was a slight increase in total insect-eaten seeds (4%), and a slight decrease in viable seeds (9%), in picked plants; but there were no significant differences in the fractions of seeds released, aborted or non-viable. 8. The reduced seed store following picking could adversely affect post-fire regeneration, particularly if fires were at short intervals followed by an unusually severe summer drought. 9. The study shows the usefulness of demographic studies in guiding management to resolve the conflict between commercial exploitation and the conservation of rare plant species.

BSP from a tidal freshwater wetland. When achenes began to come out of dormancy, they germinated to 50% first at 35/20-degrees-C, and then with additional stratification the minimum temperature for 50% germination decreased to 15/6-degrees-C. Germination of stratified achenes was inhibited by darkness and was completely prevented by hypoxia (inundation in closed jars). Seeds inundated in open jars and those in Petri dishes, however, germinated to > 80%. Germination declined sharply with depth of burial (0, 1, and 5 cm). Moisture regime (drained, saturated, and inundated) also significantly affected germination, but afterripening condition (cold greenhouse or 5-degrees-C) altered the effect. Interaction between depth of burial and moisture regime was significant (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05). At the end of the period of burial, nongerminated achenes transferred to the soil surface were capable of germinating over a 19 mo period. Storage conditions (approximately 0, 20, 50, and 100% relative humidity) of fresh achenes for 1 wk to 4 mo followed by at least 16 wk stratification at 5-degrees-C had no effect on total germination. However, storage at approximately 0% RH for 4 mo reduced the rate of germination. Light and oxygen requirements are reflected in the responses to burial and inundation. These, in turn, provide a mechanism for maintenance of a persistent seed bank (> 1 yr) following winter afterripening of achenes in the field.																	0040-9618					JUL-SEP	1994	121	3					230	239		10.2307/2997178							WOS:A1994PK88500002

Alternate rows of cowpea did not reduce Striga density but planting the cowpea and sorghum in the same row, in the same or alternating hills, reduced Striga density and numbers of Striga per sorghum stand. Yields of sorghum grain in the same-row planting treatments were not significantly less than sole sorghum yields, and 200 to 700 kg ha- 1 of cowpea grain was produced. Alternating stands of sorghum and cowpea within the same row gave the best yield of sorghum and greater reduction of Striga. Production of mature Striga with capsules decreased with increasing cowpea ground cover, so that while cowpea may not reduce Striga emergence, it may hinder Striga development, possibly reducing the Striga seed bank over time.																	0014-4797					JUL	1994	30	3					349	358		10.1017/S0014479700024467							WOS:A1994NX37800010

Stand persistence depends largely on plant persistence in crown-forming perennials that do not spread by stolons or rhizomes, but depends on seed production, timely germination, and seedling survival in annuals, biennials, and many short-lived perennials. Stolon- and rhizome-forming perennials can colonize unoccupied areas if management is favorable. Conversely, differentials in seed production, seed dispersal mechanisms, and seed survival allow reseeding annuals, biennials, and short-lived perennials to colonize areas that are more widely dispersed. Several pathogens and insects invade the stand each year, but to different intensities depending on climatic and crop management conditions. Other pathogens and insects reside in production fields and pastures, gradually increasing in population while reducing plant persistence, the seed bank, and seedling survival. Environmental and management stresses weaken plants, which are subsequently killed by combined influences of environmental stresses, resident insects, and pathogens. Improving disease and insect resistance is a major breeding objective for crown formers, but these efforts have to be supplemented by physiological improvement in stress resistance. To improve stand persistence of annuals, management and genetic information is needed on seed production capacity, hard seed content, seed bank management, and optimizing conditions for seed germination and seedling survival. The long-term goal is to improve cultivar persistence, and develop management systems to aid legume persistence in a wide range of grassland ecosystems. Educational programs are also essential.

Seedling recruitment, emergence fluxes, seedling survival, fecundity, initial and final seed banks and the annual rate of growth of the populations (lambda) with the two latter parameters were evaluated. Three pigweed emergence cohorts were evaluated. Seed production was only observed in first and second cohorts. First cohort contributed with higher density and greater number of seeds. Crop presence did not remarkably affect any of the parameters considered. The lambda increased on overage 53% in absence of the crop and 50% in presence of the crop when no chemical control and cultivation were performed. When a cultivation was done lambda increase oscilated between 9 and 20% depending on the year. When herbicides were used lambda show a population increase of 9% for postemergence applications and 28% for preemergence applications.																	0100-204X					JUL	1994	29	7					1041	1050									WOS:A1994PH39700006

Seeds were buried in soil and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes. Samples of seeds were exhumed at monthly intervals for 31 months and tested for germination in light and darkness at 12-h daily thermoperiods of 15:6, 20:10, 25:15, 30:15, and 35:20 degrees C. At maturity in autumn, seeds germinated to 84-95% in light at 30:15 and 35:20 degrees C, but to 0-69% at other test conditions. By late winter, seeds germinated to 95-100% at the five thermoperiods in light and in darkness. In summer and autumn, germination in light decreased at 15:6 degrees C, and in darkness it dropped to 0% at 15:6 degrees C and decreased at 20:10, 25:15, 30:15, and 35:20 degrees C. Following the second winter of burial, seeds germinated to near 100% at all thermoperiods in light and darkness. Thus, seeds exhibited an annual nondormancy - conditional dormancy cycle, being nondormant from midwinter to late spring and conditionally dormant in summer and autumn. Oenothera biennis is 1 of 10 species whose seeds live for 39-40 years or longer in soil and also have an annual conditional dormancy - nondormancy cycle. Seeds of six of these species, including O. biennis, can germinate in darkness in spring or summer at simulated habitat temperatures. Therefore, a light requirement for germination is not necessarily a prerequisite for long-term survival of buried seeds, and something other than darkness prevents germination of seeds of some species buried in soil.																	0008-4026					JUN	1994	72	6					779	782		10.1139/b94-098							WOS:A1994NY96100005

To evaluate the impact of the earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris L. on the vertical transport of seeds in the soil, laboratory experiments have been carried out. Moreover, the worm casts produced and their seed content have been quantified in two chalk grassland sites during one year. The experiment on seed transport has been carried out in cylinders with controlled numbers of worms and seeds at different depths in sterilized soil. Seeds used in this experiment proved to be eaten by the earthworms in preceding palatability tests. A significant translocation of the seeds in the cylinders with earthworms was recorded after an eight-week period. In spring earthworm activity was mainly found in the upper soil layers in the cylinders, whereas in summer the activity was spread over a larger vertical distance. The amount of worm casts collected on permanently marked plots in two different chalk grasslands was very high: a minimal quantity of c. 750 g m-2 of worm casts were produced yearly. The number of germinative seeds brought to the soil surface by worm casts was at least 60-100 m-2 each year. This means that earthworm activity has a substantial impact on the soil seed bank dynamics and hence on the possibility of plant recruitment in this species-rich ecosystem.																	0906-7590	1600-0587				JUN	1994	17	2					124	130		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1994.tb00084.x							WOS:A1994NW41700002

Analysis of pollen and seeds show that the high marsh has formed only within the past 100 yr, following increased sedimentation rates in the area. Variations in nutrient and trace metal accumulations over several decades show that pollutants from agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge are stored to a greater extent in high-marsh than in low-marsh sediments. Greater accumulation rates in the high marsh are probably related to its greater sedimentary organic carbon concentration.

J	BROWN, D				BROWN, D			THE DEVELOPMENT OF WOODY VEGETATION IN THE 1ST 6 YEARS FOLLOWING CLEAR-CUTTING OF A HARDWOOD FOREST FOR A UTILITY RIGHT-OF-WAY	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In the fall of 1984, a sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and black cherry (Prunus serotina) woodlot was clear-cut for the construction of a transmission right-of-way. The first years re-growth was dominated by seedlings of black cherry and white ash (total density of 4.5 stems m-2). Rapid proliferation of trembling aspen suckers, and growth of choke cherry (Prunus virginiana) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus) seedlings increased the density to 31.8 stems m-2 by the end of the second year. By the sixth year, the trembling aspen and choke cherry had declined, white ash had increased, and the overall density declined to 22.1 stems m-2. The relative densities of tree seedlings and sprouts were similar; the sprouts were considerably taller, however, and represented the major revegetation source. Therefore, a second phase of the study was undertaken to investigate the growth and survival characteristics of sprouts and suckers originating from the stumps of 317 trees. The most prolific sprouters, black cherry and white ash, exhibited the highest stem mortality, while the poorest sprouter (sugar maple) experienced better survival. After 6 years, the sprout numbers were converging on a range of five to seven stems per stump, irrespective of species. The height growth was greatest in the first year and has since declined. Black cherry and trembling aspen had the highest growth rates and white ash the lowest. Growth was correlated to parent tree height and diameter in the maple and aspen; the ability to predict growth from these parameters, however, is very poor.																	0378-1127	1872-7042				JUN	1994	65	2-3					171	181		10.1016/0378-1127(94)90168-6							WOS:A1994NX63500010						
J	KEITH, DA; BRADSTOCK, RA				KEITH, DA; BRADSTOCK, RA			FIRE AND COMPETITION IN AUSTRALIAN HEATH - A CONCEPTUAL-MODEL AND FIELD INVESTIGATIONS	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												We describe a model of heath vegetation, in which species were classified into five functional groups based on characteristics of their propagule pools, post-fire growth, timing and mode of reproduction and competitive status. The model assumes no recruitment without fire and a simple competitive hierarchy based on vertical stature. A critical feature of the model is an initial post-fire window of 5-6 yr in which competition from overstorey species on understorey species is reduced. Understorey functional groups differ in their ability to exploit this window. In the field, we tested five predictions derived from the model: (a) overall species richness of understorey varies inversely with overstorey density as a result of a trend in richness of woody species, but not in herbaceous species; (b) where an overstorey was present in the previous fire interval, post-fire population density is reduced in a functional group of understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, but not in a group of understorey obligate-seeding shrubs with soil seed banks; (c) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, post-fire regrowth in resprouting individuals is adversely affected by the presence of an overstorey in the preceding fire interval; (d) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, levels of pre-fire propagules are lower in the presence of an overstorey, reducing the density of post-fire recruits; and (e) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, recruitment relative to the pre-fire population is unaffected by overstorey species within the window of reduced competition. Of these, three tests (a,b,d) supported the model, one (e) may support the model, but the results were inconclusive and one (c) did not support the model. Limitations and further applications of the model are discussed. Our results suggest that maintenance of high densities of overstorey populations is in conflict with conservation of some understorey species. Models of the type we propose will help identify and resolve such conflicts and promote the judicious use of fire to maintain full species diversity of plant communities.																	1100-9233					JUN	1994	5	3					347	354		10.2307/3235858							WOS:A1994NZ88700008						
J	BONIS, A; LEPART, J				BONIS, A; LEPART, J			VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF SEED BANKS AND THE IMPACT OF DEPTH OF BURIAL ON RECRUITMENT IN 2 TEMPORARY MARSHES	VEGETATIO												The structure of the seed bank (including Chara oospores), in relation to depth within the sediment and disturbance, was studied in two Rhone delta temporary marshes for two years. The seeds of all species were concentrated in the top 2 cm of sediment with very low numbers beeing found below 4 cm. When an exclosure eliminated disturbances of the sediment by animals, the vertical repartition of seeds at site 2 was more pronounced than outside the exclosure. In experiment 1, the emergence capacity of seeds from different depths and buried under layers of sterile equivalent to those in the field was measured. Depending of the species, 22 to 98% of the seeds germinated from unburied seeds in the top 2 cm. Only 1% of the oospores of Chara (from site 2) at 2 to 4 cm depth in the sediment emerged. In experiment 2, surface seed bank samples were placed under 0, 2 or 4 cm sterile sediment depth. The samples contained numerous recent seeds and the emergence percentage reached 41% (for Ruppia maritima). Only the seeds of Zannichellia spp failed to germinate from a depth of 2 cm or more. The emergence percentage from 2 cm depth or more was always lower than at the surface. These experiments showed that both burial and ageing of seeds decrease germination capacity. The majority of the active seeds located at the surface germinate when the marsh is flooded. Seeds located between 2 and 4 cm can be brought back to the surface by disturbances and play the role of a reserve involved in maintenance of populations that go without seed production for one or some years.																	0042-3106					JUN	1994	112	2					127	139		10.1007/BF00044687							WOS:A1994NV18200004						
J	MEYER, SE; KITCHEN, SG				MEYER, SE; KITCHEN, SG			LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION IN BLUE FLAX (LINUM PERENNE, LINACEAE) - SEED-GERMINATION PHENOLOGY	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Linum perenne L. is a nonclonal perennial herb widely distributed across a range of habitats. Variation in seed germination patterns was examined for 21 Intermountain collections and for the commercial cultivar 'Appar'. Collections from sites with long, snowy winters were largely dormant at harvest and responded positively to chilling. Collections from middle elevation sagebrush-grassland sites were generally nondormant and contained a fraction induced into secondary dormancy by chilling. Collections from palouse prairie and pinyon-juniper sites were generally nondormant and unaffected by chilling, as was 'Appar'. When seeds of contrasting populations were planted in seed retrieval experiments at low, middle, and high elevation sites, their Geld germination phenology was predictable from laboratory experiments. In common garden experiments, there were significant among-sibship differences in germination for each garden-grown wild accession but not for 'Appar', suggesting that differences both among and within populations may be genetically based. Garden-grown seeds were generally less dormant than wild-collected seeds, possibly because of selection during propagation. Results demonstrated the existence of ecologically relevant among-population and within-population variation in germination phenology for blue flax. Seeds of high-montane populations are spring-emerging and have little provision for between-year carryover. Populations from lower elevation habitats with less predictable weather have seeds with contrasting germination patterns, allowing for emergence in both fall and spring as well as for seed bank carryover. 'Appar' seeds lack these predictive and carryover mechanisms.																	0002-9122					MAY	1994	81	5					528	535		10.2307/2445726							WOS:A1994NM60100002						
J	DELCASTILLO, RF				DELCASTILLO, RF			FACTORS INFLUENCING THE GENETIC-STRUCTURE OF PHACELIA-DUBIA, A SPECIES WITH A SEED BANK AND LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN POPULATION-SIZE	HEREDITY												The potential factors that may influence the genetic structure of the gynodioecious annual Phacelia dubia were assessed using electrophoretic and ecological information at a locality in which the population size changed by about three orders of magnitude. Fluctuations in population size appeared to have little influence on the allelic composition, heterozygosity and mixed mating system of the population. Despite wide fluctuations in total population size, the estimated effective population size during (N-e=20) and after the bottleneck (N-e=28) was little changed. Also, a significant spatial substructuring, evidenced by a dine in MDH and by the F-statistics, was observed before and after the bottleneck. The recovery of the population and the preservation of genetic diversity was attributable in part to the seed bank in the soil. Spatial gene flow via seeds was small compared with pollen flow and both were restricted. Nevertheless, substructuring contributes to a small portion of the total inbreeding. Also, the rate of apparent selfing of male steriles did not provide evidence of biparental inbreeding. Most of the inbreeding, however, was within subpopulations and autogamy appears to be the major contributor. It was concluded that the mating system is the leading factor determining the genetic structure and that the seed bank ensures genetic constancy in time in the face of large fluctuations in population size.				del Castillo, Rafael F/O-1431-2017													0018-067X	1365-2540				MAY	1994	72		5				446	458									WOS:A1994NL29100002						
J	SAMUEL, MJ; HART, RH				SAMUEL, MJ; HART, RH			61 YEARS OF SECONDARY SUCCESSION ON RANGELANDS OF THE WYOMING HIGH-PLAINS	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												The slow and uncertain rate of recovery of plant communities after severe disturbance is a major problem on rangelands. Earlier studies sketched the outline of secondary succession on mixed-grass prairie, but were based on 1 or 2 years of observation on different areas disturbed at different times in the past, or several years of observation of a single area. To provide a more complete picture of succession over decades, we began observations in 1977 on 4 areas disturbed from 1 to 51 years previously, and on undisturbed areas of the same 2 soil types with and without grazing. Observations continued for 11 years. Secondary succession proceeded through the usual stages: annual forbs, perennial forbs and annual grasses, short-lived perennial grasses, and long-lived grasses. Western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A Love] was an exception because it appeared much earlier and in much greater abundance than other long-lived perennial grasses. Blue grama [Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag ex. Steud.] may be another exception; total recovery of this grass may require centuries. Time of appearance in succession seemed to be related to availability of propagules and ease of establishment; persistence of species was related to competitive ability. Abundance of many species fluctuated widely from year to year, but fluctuations did not appear to be related to precipitation.

The preferential and extensive browsing of this indehiscent legume is apparently not due to any exceptional nutritive value of the pods and seeds. However, it is probably the strong rich aroma of the infructescence which initially attracts animals to this food source. The structure of the infructescence, ensures that upon location a large number of pods and seeds are consumed. Ingestion of the pods will provide fibre, lipid, fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids, nitrogen and protein.																	0167-6903					MAY	1994	14	3					273	277		10.1007/BF00024803							WOS:A1994NT12600012						
J	ZHANG, JH; MAUN, MA				ZHANG, JH; MAUN, MA			POTENTIAL FOR SEED BANK FORMATION IN 7 GREAT-LAKES SAND DUNE SPECIES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seeds of seven dune species were collected from sand dunes of Lakes Erie and Huron and buried to various depths in a natural sand dune habitat along Lake Huron. The seed samples were then retrieved after varying lengths of time and examined for their germinability and dormancy. Results showed that buried seeds remained viable for at least 2.5 years and had the potential to form a persistent seed bank. Seed banks were larger and longer lasting at greater depths of burial than those at shallow burial depths. The results suggested that failure to verify the existence of effective seed banks in previous studies may be due to insufficient number of samples, shallow sample depth, local population variations, and fruiting events. Several species also possessed a temporary, aboveground seed reserve formed by retention of a small proportion of viable seeds on the previous year's inflorescences. In some species, seeds retained aboveground were dormant and thus capable of forming a persistent seed bank when they entered the soil.																	0002-9122					APR	1994	81	4					387	394		10.2307/2445486							WOS:A1994NG66500001						
J	TSUYUZAKI, S				TSUYUZAKI, S			FATE OF PLANTS FROM BURIED SEEDS ON VOLCANO USU, JAPAN, AFTER THE 1977-1978 ERUPTIONS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The eruptions of 1977-1978 on Mount Usu in northern Japan resulted in the almost complete destruction of vegetation by a 1-3-m-thick accumulation of volcanic deposits. Erosion created gullies that removed these deposits and frequently exposed the old original soil. I previously confirmed that seedlings of 14 species (eight annual and six perennial herbs) emerged from seeds buried in the original topsoil. To clarify the role of the seed bank on volcanic succession, I monitored seedlings of seed bank species from 1983 to 1992. Nearly all the annuals, such as Polygonum longisetum and Rorippa islandica, originated from the seed bank. However, seed supply from the seed bank declined with time. Because seedling mortality was extremely high and reproductive success was low, due mostly to the instability of ground surface, these annuals emerged for several years but disappeared after 1989. The nitrogen-fixing and stoloniferous perennials, Trifolium repens and Lotus corniculatus var. japonicus, were derived only from the seed bank. They have gradually increased in cover and have become large enough to flower. The other perennials derived from the seed bank, most of which produce short rhizomes, did not increase in cover annually and thus contributed less to revegetation than nitrogen-fixing stoloniferous species. The fate of perennials seems to be dependent on the types of rhizome and stolen systems. Although recruitment from the seed bank was restricted to gullies, the seed bank was the major source of annuals and of nitrogen-fixing perennials in the gullies. Succession in the gullies was substantially different from that which occurred outside the gullies where plants mostly originated from seed immigration and vegetative reproduction from surviving plants, and annual and nitrogen-fixing plants were absent.

Using concurrent field and greenhouse seed flotation experiments, we compared seeds of A. perennis with seeds of a typical wind-dispersed milkweed, A. exaltata. Seeds of A. perennis floated significantly longer in both greenhouse and field experiments, with 15% and 35% still floating after 5 months; almost all seeds of A. exaltata sank within 2 weeks. A second greenhouse experiment conducted under three different soil-water regimes revealed significant differences in percent germination between species (A. perennis = 85.3 +/- 0.1%: mean +/- standard error; A. exaltata = 6.2 +/- 6.2%), and, to a lesser degree, among soil-water treatments within species. Seed germination tests revealed no significant change in viability for either species in any of the experiments conducted. Milkweed seeds can remain viable in water for long periods of time, but the remarkable ability of A. perennis to remain floating for more than 6 months may provide a ''floating seed bank'' that contributes to high levels of gene flow among populations of this floodplain species.																	0040-9618					APR-JUN	1994	121	2					160	169		10.2307/2997168							WOS:A1994NY13800007						
J	ALVAREZBUYLLA, ER; GARAY, AA				ALVAREZBUYLLA, ER; GARAY, AA			POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE OF CECROPIA-OBTUSIFOLIA, A TROPICAL PIONEER TREE SPECIES	EVOLUTION												Theoretical analyses of the genetic organization of pioneer species have postulated two very different scenarios. Some models have predicted that such species would show strong population substructuring, whereas other models have suggested that extinction and recolonization can augment gene flow and reduce interpopulation differentiation. We tested these alternative scenarios by analyzing the genetic structure of eight loci from populations of the pioneer dioecious tree, Cecropia obtusifolia, in the tropical rain forest region of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. The populations studied exhibit low overall F-ST values, no clear pattern of isolation by distance, and high estimates of gene flow. These results suggest either that the species is not at a genetic equilibrium under present levels of gene flow with populations derived from each other in the recent past, or that pollen and seed dispersal in this species occur over long distances (up to more than 100 km). Mating among relatives appears higher than expected by chance based on significantly positive fixation indices (F) and F-IS values at some loci. However, no direct evidence for biparental inbreeding was found. The multilocus and single-locus outcrossing rates for C. obtusifolia were estimated at t(m) = 0.974 (SE = 0.024) and t(s) = 0.980 (SE = 0.035), respectively. These are not significantly different from 1, and the difference, t(m) - t(s) = - 0.006 (SE = 0.018), is not significantly different from 0. These estimates, however, could be biased because in all enzymes, except PGM-1, we found statistically significant departures from the mixed-mating model used to estimate them. Two rare alleles were found only in seeds collected from the soil, and the greatest number of different alleles were found also in soil seeds. It is hypothesized that the seed bank may play an important role in the genetic buffering of C. obtusifolia. Significantly positive or negative fixation indices in adults at some loci and significantly different heterozygosities among different life stages (from seeds to adults) suggest the action of selection at some loci.

Six soil samples were collected from each of 34 sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic seed bank groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Mean group densities of germinants ranged from 25-144/M2. Dormant seed banks were least dense, and most sparsely distributed, in sandy soils. Seed bank samples were dominated by woody pioneer monsoon rain forest species, especially figs; exotic weeds and savanna taxa (e.g. Poaceae) were relatively more common at seasonally dry sites. Dormant seed banks comprised species mostly present in the standing vegetation, although a small number of germinants represented species not growing at half the sites. Regeneration of woody pioneers from dormant seed banks is least likely to be of importance on infertile, seasonally dry sites.																	1100-9233					APR	1994	5	2					161	168		10.2307/3236148							WOS:A1994NN71400003

Growth inhibitory effects of the forest organic matter on red pine seedlings was tested by a stair-step experiment using leachate of forest soil monoliths and also by a seed germination bio-assay using forest floor substrates. To test if higher burning temperatures can remove the allelopathic effects of red pine-Kalmia organic matter, a laboratory bioassay was conducted by germinating red pine seeds on the organic matter burned at 200, 400, 600 and 800-degrees-C. Deposition of dry needles and a thick duff layer under red pine stands affected seedling establishment. Red pine seedling establishment increased with the decreasing thickness of duff layer away from the stump of the seed-bearing trees. Wildfire helped in removing the duff layer and increased seedling establishment. A high fuel load within a 0 - 1 m radius around the tree stump caused a deep burn of the organic matter including part of the soil seed reserve. On a burned-over surface, more seedlings established in a band between 1 and 2 m around the stump than inside and outside the band. Primary root growth of red pine was severely inhibited when the seedlings were grown in unburned forest floor organic matter where Kalmia was the principal understory species. Water leachate of a Pinus resinosa-Kalmia soil monolith was inhibitory to red pine seedling growth. In greenhouse conditions, the seedlings grew well in burned-over soil from a Pinus resinosa stand. Burned organic matter from a red pine forest showed an increase in pH with a burning temperature of 600-degrees-C. Primary root growth of red pine seedlings was similarly increased with increasing temperature up to 600-degrees-C; at higher temperatures the root length of seedlings did not increase any further.																	1100-9233					APR	1994	5	2					179	186		10.2307/3236150							WOS:A1994NN71400005

The reference point was based on the average of total pesticide sales (kg ai) between 1981 and 1985. The goal was to halve the risks to users and to the environment. A two-pronged approach dealing with risk and with the actual reduction in agricultural pesticide use was developed. By 1991, 215 'unsafe' or less effective pesticide products were withdrawn by producers or cancelled by the National Chemical Inspectorate, leaving only 322 registered. Additionally, the government was able to report a 47% reduction in agricultural pesticide use where 64, 54, and 2% reductions occurred in insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, respectively. However, the treated area did not decrease. Pesticide reduction was achieved largely in cereal grain production by switching from high-dose to low-dose herbicides, reducing rates of herbicides, removal of inactive isomers from racemic mixtures, cancellation of TCA for quackgrass control, increased set-aside, and improved sprayer precision. During the same 5-yr period, Scotland achieved an equivalent reduction without government intervention, indicating that the reductions were largely due to changing herbicide technology. Determining the need for similar programs must take into account: 1. initial use rates (in 1987, average total pesticide use rates in the U.S. and in Sweden were 1.8 and 1.5 kg ai/ha, respectively, and following the mandate period, Swedish use has decreased to 0.8 kg ai/ha); 2. measurement criteria; and 3. the long-term effect of reducing herbicide rates on replenishing the soil weed seed bank reserves.																	0890-037X					APR-JUN	1994	8	2					350	359									WOS:A1994NV58100030

Only 52.6% of the achenes germinated. Germinated achenes were significantly heavier than ungerminated achenes. Germination time was independent of achene weight and embryo weight, but varied inversely with pericarp weight. Variable achene weight is evolutionarily advantageous. Heavy achenes are at an advantage in that their proportionately larger embryos and thinner pericarps facilitate germination, promoting competitive establishment of seedlings. Lighter achenes are also at an advantage through increased dispersibility, and their relatively thick pericarp provides a persistent seed bank. Evolutionary pressures presumably maintain the variability in achene weight of var, pilosus. These results are discussed in the context of the early midsuccessional ecology of var. pilosus.																	0002-9122					MAR	1994	81	3					259	264		10.2307/2445451							WOS:A1994NB04000001

I investigated the ecology of a leaf litter assemblage of twig-dwelling ants in lowland tropical wet forest and contrasted it with the better known ecologies of ground- and tree-dwelling ants. Nest densities at La Selva, Costa Rica were high (7.48 nests/m2) and potential nest sites were abundant. Colonies moved frequently (residence times for species ranged from 35 to 146 days) from one twig nest to another, occupying a wide range of twig types. Experiments with artificial nests showed that colonization was not reduced by the presence of resident ant colonies. Queenright nests (in which at least one queen is present) and queenless workers, as well as dealate queens, colonized artificial nests. Activity times and diet composition did not differ between the two species with largest sample sizes; workers were active under most conditions. Despite their abundance, twig-dwelling ants are apparently limited neither by availability of nest sites nor food. Many of the 32 species found coexisting at La Selva may be limited by high mortality during alate dispersal or colony movement.																	0006-3606					MAR	1994	26	1					61	72		10.2307/2389111							WOS:A1994NE09100008						
J	HAMILTON, MB				HAMILTON, MB			EX-SITU CONSERVATION OF WILD PLANT-SPECIES - TIME TO REASSESS THE GENETIC ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF SEED BANKS	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Ex situ conservation of wild plant species through seed banking is currently being recommended as a conservation strategy to help preserve the biological and genetic diversity of wild plants. Here I argue that ex situ collections may be ineffective at preserving genetic diversity and the evolutionary potential of populations for adaptive or neutral evolution Treating the collection of genetic variation for seed banks as simply a problem in efficient sampling of neutral, allelic genetic polymorphism is a limited view of the types and organization of genetic variation present in wild plant species. Perspectives on genetic variation from neutral alleles to quantitative variation are necessary when considering evolutionary change, Quantitative genetic variation and genetic correlations determine the degree and form of response to natural selection on polygenic traits. Population variation in the amount of quantitative genetic variation or structure of genetic correlations argues that different populations will respond differently to the action of natural selection and are therefore unique evolutionary entities. Unavoidable selection on single traits will cause indirect selection on genetically correlated traits, possibly resulting in phenotypic changes and a reduction of genetic variation Genotype-by-environment interactions demonstrate that the success of releasing seed bank genotypes in natural populations is dependent on the likelihood that seed bank material contains genotypes of high relative fitness in introduction habitats. Such actions can cause introduction of nonadaptive genotypes that will depress population fitness. Because not all types of genetic variation are highly positively correlated, sampling methods based on the neutral theory of alleles or allelic data will not necessarily capture representative quantitative genetic variation More research on the relationship and evolutionary significance of allelic and quantitative genetic variation in collections and wild populations is needed Initial and ongoing data on the fate of different types of genetic variation are required to determine the relative success or failure of ex situ conservation methods and to test assumptions of current programs. In situ conservation of ecosystems may offer distinct advantages for many plant species by preserving both genetic and ecological information.

Within the scope of the projekt, ''Ecosystem Research in the Vicinity of Bornhoeveder chain of lakes'', the seasonal dynamics of phytomass and nutrients of extensively used Ranunculo-Alopecuretum stands were observed with respect to the possibility of regeneration to species-rich wet meadows. Floristic observations revealed that throughout a period of five years with annual hay-making without fertilization, no characteristic species of wet meadows have established themselves. This indicates that the environmental conditions have not effectively changed yet. The high production of above-ground stand phytomass indicates yet a good availability of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. The dynamics of nitrogen yield in the above-ground phytomass showed that in order to achieve an efficient impoverishment of soil nutrients, it is necessary to cut the vegetation at least twice a year. Additionally, this management practice interferes positively with the structure of the plant composition. The success of restoration moreover depends on the biotic potential (recent vegetation, neighbouring vegetation, seed bank). In the investigated vegetation types the seed bank contains no characteristic species of wet meadows. Therefor apart from suitable management practices. a successful restoration of species-poor Ranunculo-Alopecuretum requires much more time.																	0367-2530					MAR	1994	189	1					37	50									WOS:A1994NG32500003

One may look for specific assemblages of traits corresponding to various 'strategies' of regeneration enabling species to coexist in the face of an ever-changing environment. Species differing in shade tolerance and occupying the same habitat would be expected to have such contrasting assemblages of regeneration traits. 2 Here, I present an analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of the seeds in the seed rain and the seed bank, and of newly emerged seedlings of Betula alleghaniensis, Acer rubrum, A. saccharum, and Fagus grandifolia. The study covers a four-year period and considers two spatial scales (stand and microsite). The species studied are typical of the hardwood forest of eastern North America and represent an increasing gradient of shade tolerance from Betula to Fagus. 3 Of the traits considered, only seed bank type and grain of dispersion, and seedling and seed bank dispersion patterns were useful discriminators between the four species studied. Shade intolerant species tended to have a persistent, coarse-grained and contagious seed bank, with newly emerged seedlings contagiously dispersed, while shade tolerant species often had a transient, finer-grained and randomly dispersed seed bank, with newly emerged seedlings randomly dispersed. 4 The widely held belief that species must differ in many key-characters in order to coexist has led to the search for coevolved assemblages of regeneration traits for sympatric species. However, when these traits are analysed in detail, few, if any such assemblages can be identified. Environmental heterogeneity in space and in time, from both biotic and abiotic sources, appears to favour the maintenance of some flexibility in the expression of regeneration traits.																	0022-0477					MAR	1994	82	1					39	53		10.2307/2261384							WOS:A1994NL94400006

The complete demographies of 16 populations of Cirsium vulgare were followed in a replicated experiment. The experiment was a factorial combination of two intensities of sheep grazing in each of three seasons - winter (grazed or ungrazed), spring (grazed or ungrazed), and summer (light or heavy grazing) giving eight treatments in two blocks 2 For 6 years from 1987 to 1992 the population sizes of C. vulgare were monitored in each of the 16 paddocks. After 1989 grazing in spring or winter or increased grazing in summer all increased population sizes. Population sizes fluctuated widely between years. 3 The effects of the grazing treatments and plant sizes on the transitions between nine life-history stages were determined. There were no grazing effects on seed numbers per flowerhead, postdispersal seed survival or between year seed survival in the seed bank. 4 More-intense summer or winter grazing increased seedling emergence by increasing the proportion of microsites with no canopy or with no litter. Emergence was found to respond positively to these factors. Seedling survival was increased by winter or spring grazing and winter grazing increased the year-to-year survival of small and medium-sized rosettes. These effects probably occurred through selective grazing decreasing competition from the dominant grasses. Larger rosettes had lower mortality rates which were unaffected by the grazing treatments. 5 There was a minimum rosette size threshold for flowering above which flowering probability increased with size. Because winter grazing increased the survival of smaller rosettes it increased the proportion of smaller rosettes in the populations and thus decreased the proportion of rosettes flowering. By the same process winter grazing decreased the average size of flowering rosettes and, because smaller rosettes produced fewer flowerheads, this treatment decreased the flowerhead number of flowering rosettes. 6 The lepidopteran seed predator Eucosma cana attacked a larger proportion of heads on plants with more flowerheads. By decreasing the average number of flowerheads per flowering plant winter grazing decreased the proportion of flowerheads on a plant attacked. 7 Matrix analysis of life tables for each paddock showed that winter and spring grazing and increased summer grazing all significantly increased the population growth rate lambda. The population sizes of each paddock correlated significantly with the estimated lambda values. 8 Elasticity analysis was performed on each matrix and elasticity values within each matrix were summed to give a value for fecundity (e(F)), Stasis (e(L)) and growth (e(G)). Triangular ordination of e(F), e(L) and e(G) showed that lambda became more sensitive to small changes in fecundity and less sensitive to small changes in stasis as grazing intensity increased.

J	ZAMMIT, C; ZEDLER, PH				ZAMMIT, C; ZEDLER, PH			ORGANIZATION OF THE SOIL SEED BANK IN MIXED CHAPARRAL	VEGETATIO												Seed densities, estimated from germinations under glasshouse conditions, were determine for fire-treated and control soils sampled from north and south facing stands of mixed Adenostoma fasciculatum - Ceanothus greggii chaparral that last burned 10, 17, 36, 62 and 86 years before 1987. A total of 53 species was recorded. Total germinable seed density was not influenced by aspect nor by an experimental fire treatment, however, densities varied significantly, but not predictably, over the time since fire sequence. Species diversity was significantly lower in the 86 year old stand, but neither diversity or richness was influenced by the fire treatment. Soils from north facing slopes supported a higher species diversity overall, and seed densities of six species were significantly higher on north than on south slopes. We identify two functional groups in the seed bank on the basis of the direct effects of fire on seed densities: a fire-dependent group, comprising 6 species and about 21 % of the total seed bank, in which germinable densities increased after the fire treatment, and a fire-independent group, made up of 11 species and almost two-thirds of the seed bank. The fire-independent group is further separated into two: a shrub-centred sub-group (Crassula erecta, Filago californica, Pterostegia drymarioides, Streptanthus heterophyllus and Cryptantha intermedia) maintained larger seed banks in older stands and was associated with shrub cover; and an opportunistic sub-group (Camissonia hirtella, Gnaphalium chilense, Mimulus pilosus and Senecio vulgaris) tended to have larger seed banks in younger stands and was associated with canopy gaps. Overall, the soil seed assemblage from this mixed chaparral does not appear to be tightly coupled to fire-generated opportunities for recruitment. The reason for this is that the fire-dependent group represents only 6 species. In addition, among the fire-independent species, the shrub-centred group of 5 annuals made up almost 40% of total soil seed density. This group shows ecological and taxonomic affinities with desert annuals.																	0042-3106					MAR	1994	111	1					1	16									WOS:A1994NC75700001						
J	BERTILLER, MB; CORONATO, F				BERTILLER, MB; CORONATO, F			SEED BANK PATTERNS OF FESTUCA-PALLESCENS IN SEMIARID PATAGONIA (ARGENTINA) - A POSSIBLE LIMIT TO BUNCH REESTABLISHMENT	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The pre- and postdispersal spatial patterns of the germinable seed bank of Festuca pallescens were evaluated in semiarid grasslands of Patagonia disturbed by sheep grazing. Before dispersal, the seed bank showed spatial heterogeneity and was significantly smaller than the postdispersal seed bank. The postdispersal seed bank was uniformly distributed in patches of bare soil. The size of the germinable seed bank varied with the topographic condition of sites. On slopes, bunches exhibited more panicles and the germinable seed bank was larger after dispersal and smaller before dispersal as compared with upland sites. Losses of the germinable seed bank during autumn and spring are partially accounted for by germination rates. Predominant westerly winds influenced the patterns of seed dispersal, but other agents such as predation or sheet wash may also be active, especially on slopes. The low persistence of the seed bank of F. pallescens, particularly at canopy gaps, indicates that this may constitute a primary control of the regeneration of this species in semiarid grasslands of Patagonia. Management of these grasslands for restoration should accordingly include practices oriented to an adequate replenishment of the germinable seed bank at these places.																	0960-3115					FEB	1994	3	1					57	67		10.1007/BF00115333							WOS:A1994MX95700006

The vertical distribution of seeds in the plots under the study was heterogeneous. 2. The majority of seeds were accumulated up to the dept of 30 cm. 3. Seeds of 5-6 species prevailed in the seed bank; however, the achenes of Chenopodium album agg. were absolutelly predominating. 4. Below lucerne, the highest total amount and species diversity of seeds were concentrated near the soil surface, having shown a rapid decrease towards the deeper layers. 5. Below annual crops, the quantity and species composition of seeds were reduced in the active zone of the soil (0-5 cm). A relatively homogeneous distribution of seeds up to the depth of 25-30 cm as well as a steep decrease of seed quantity and number of present species in the subsoil (30-40 cm) was found. 6. Regarding the distribution of seeds of the most frequent species with respect to the soil depth, there were the similar patterns.																	0006-3088					FEB	1994	49	1					53	57									WOS:A1994NT47900006						
J	HOLUB, M				HOLUB, M			LONG-TERM AND SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF THE SEED BANK IN ARABLE SOIL	BIOLOGIA												Short term and long term changes in the number of seeds and their species composition were studied in arable soils under an 8 years crop rotation. The following main conclusions were deduced from the results: The number of seeds in soil showed seasonal dynamics. Maximal numbers were found in the third and fourth quarter of year and minimal numbers were found in the second quarter. The maximal seasonal changes were in the active upper zone of soil. The changes in the seed content of the soil, were different in individual soil layers. There was minimal influence of crop rotation on the species composition of seeds of main species. The results confirm the general trends: seeds of 1-3 species have dominant roles in soil. The main part of a soil seed bank was created by a limited number of species whereas minimal number of seeds were in subsoil.																	0006-3088					FEB	1994	49	1					131	137									WOS:A1994NT47900023

Samples for seed germination and seedbank trials were taken from sites representing different zones of pollution. Generally, germinability of dwarf shrub seeds was not affected by distance from pollution source, except for Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum. The average density per site of seedlings that emerged from seed-bank samples varied between 278 and 416 seedlings/m(2). Empetrum nigrum sap. hermaphroditum and Betula sp. dominated in seed banks. Calluna vulgaris was also numerous at one site. As a whole, seedbank taxa were well represented in the above ground vegetation. There were no significant differences in seedling density between sites for dominant taxa. Our results indicate that seeds can retain viability even under a heavy pollution load and thus form a potential for vegetation recovery in polluted sites.																	0008-4026					FEB	1994	72	2					143	149		10.1139/b94-019							WOS:A1994NJ30900002						
J	KIRKMAN, LK; SHARITZ, RR				KIRKMAN, LK; SHARITZ, RR			VEGETATION DISTURBANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF DIVERSITY IN INTERMITTENTLY FLOODED CAROLINA BAYS IN SOUTH-CAROLINA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We manipulated the fire regime and soil disturbance in four grass-dominated Carolina bay wetlands during a prolonged drought period and examined vegetation composition and cover within dominant vegetation types prior to and after treatments. We used the seedling emergence technique to determine the role of the seed bank in the recovery process. Burning did not affect richness, evenness, or diversity (all vegetation types combined); however, soil tillage increased diversity, including both evenness and richness. Percent similarity of the vegetation before and after disturbance was greater in the burning treatment than in the tillage treatment, probably due to greater disruption of the rhizomes of the perennial vegetation by tillage. Vegetation types varied in degree of recovery, although dominance was not altered by either treatment. Several native fugitive species increased following disturbance, indicating that species coexistence in these Carolina bay wetlands depends on the life history characteristics of residual vegetation, as well as that of seed bank species. The seed bank (72 600 seedlings/m(2)) was larger and species richness (108 species) was greater than reported for most other freshwater wetlands. No differences in species richness, evenness, or diversity were detectable among the seed banks associated with different vegetation types in the bays. The floristic composition of the seed bank did not resemble the standing vegetation in patches dominated by large perennial grasses (Panicum hemitomon, Leersia hexandra, and Andropogon virginicus). In contrast, seed bank samples associated with vegetation dominated by an annual forb (Iva microcephala) or the small perennial grasses Panicum wrightianum or P. acuminatum var. unciphyllum more closely reflected the standing vegetation. Species appear to persist with recurring and multiple disturbances because of seed banks, rhizomes, morphological plasticity during inundation, sexual reproduction following inundation, and perenniality coupled with early sexual maturity. Conservation management of intermittently inundated wetlands should incorporate techniques to foster maintenance of endemic species richness and the recruitment of rare species. During periods of drought, it may be desirable to disturb the aggressive perennial vegetation to allow recruitment of less common species.																	1051-0761					FEB	1994	4	1					177	188		10.2307/1942127							WOS:A1994MU60500019

Density of germinable seeds was determined in each of 128 blocks of surface soil, each 7 x 7 cm, together forming a 112 x 56 cm rectangle, taken from a lowland, species-poor sown grassland in Devon. 2. The turf contained only six species, but seeds of 27 species germinated from the soil. The commonest species in the turf, Festuca rubra, was absent from the seed bank. The second most frequent species in the seed bank, Coronopus didymus, was absent from the turf. Trifolium repens was common in both. The seeds of several weed species had survived in the soil for up to 10 years. 3. Buried seeds of all the common species were significantly clumped. For species common to both, there was no evidence of significant correlation between small-scale abundance in the turf and the seed bank. 4. From the beginning of September to the end of December 1986, all worm casts (339 in total) were collected from 1 m(2) of grassland adjacent to the seed bank sampling site. The location of each cast was recorded. Seeds present in casts were determined by germinating them and identifying the seedlings. 5. The rate of cast formation did not vary over the 4-month period. Distribution of casts and seeds in casts were both significantly clumped. 6. A total of 819 seeds was germinated from the casts, over 85% of which were Cerastium fontanum. Several other species known to be common in the soil seed bank, especially Coronopus didymus and Trifolium repens, were rare or absent in worm casts. Seeds in worm casts were significantly smaller than those in the seed bank.																	0269-8463					FEB	1994	8	1					29	35		10.2307/2390108							WOS:A1994MW76100004

Study species included herbaceous and woody, obligate seeders and resprouters in two non-bradysporous but significant plant families (Restionaceae and Epacridaceae). In all species, seedlings were recruited only in the first autumn-spring after fire and occurred in similar densities as the estimated germinable annual seed input. Seedlings were absent from unburnt vegetation. Although most species retained some residual seeds after fire, tests (excised embryo culture) indicated that a negligible number of seeds were germinable. Regardless of fire response or species, there appeared to be a large loss of seeds each year and in most cases, only a small proportion of the annual seed production was used in post-fire recovery of plants. Based on seedling:parent ratios, all species had the capacity to reconstitute parent densities from germinants in the first year after fire, but high seedling mortality and no further recruitment resulted in less seedlings than replacements for four resprouter Restionaceae and three Epacridaceae (all obligate seeders) at the end of the third year after fire.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; 												1100-9233					FEB	1994	5	1					5	12		10.2307/3235632							WOS:A1994NE18400002

Of the 92 species recorded, 18 were present only in the seed-bank, 28 were more frequent and 24 were less frequent in the seed bank than in the vegetation and 22 were not detected in the seed bank. Among the species present in the seed bank, therophytes were over-represented. Species turnover in the vegetation was estimated from presence/absence data collected in 1980, 1986 and 1990. Turnover was high, but there were no differences between grazed and ungrazed subplots. The turnover for individual species was also high in many cases. There was no clear relationship between the turnover of a species and its presence in the persistent seed bank.

For annual plants, especially ruderals, seed bank behaviour may be the most important factor determining population persistence. Crop seeds may exhibit some dormancy and germination cueing in the soil but are expected to be less able to persist than their wild relatives, which often have considerable dormancy and longevity, as well as effective germination cueing responses. Crop-wild hybrids may have seed bank characteristics more suited to persistence, and maternal effects may favour persistence of hybrids having wild plants for their female parent. Escape of transgenes via crop-wild hybrids presents unique concerns not present for crops. Hybrids can undergo natural selection and may back-cross with wild plants. We suggest methods that can be used in conjunction with evaluation of the relative fitness of crop-wild hybrids that will determine the likelihood of back-crossing. Accurate assessment of escape in time and transgene persistence via crop-wild hybrids requires proper plant materials. We emphasize the use of null segregants as controls for transgenic crops and for generating crop-wild hybrid controls for transgenic hybrids. Since good empirical and theoretical understanding of how individual genes influence the fate of plants in different environments is lacking, evaluation of escape in time and the persistence of transgenes via crop-wild hybrids should be on a case-by-case basis.																	0962-1083					FEB	1994	3	1					23	30									WOS:A1994MX35900004						
J	CLARK, DL; WILSON, MV				CLARK, DL; WILSON, MV			HEAT-TREATMENT EFFECTS ON SEED BANK SPECIES OF AN OLD-GROWTH DOUGLAS-FIR FOREST	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Although many studies have investigated the density and species composition of soil seed banks, few studies have investigated the effect of disturbance on seed banks. An earlier field study (Clark 1991) showed that the density of buried seeds of an old-growth Douglas-fir forest after logging and slash-burning was significantly less than the seed bank density of an adjacent, undisturbed old-growth Douglas-fir forest. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms for this seed bank reduction. Six species found in the old-growth seed bank received experimental heat treatments that included six combinations of temperature, duration and soil moisture. Generally, germination percentages were not significantly affected when seeds were heated at 50C for one hour in either the wet or dry soil, but were significantly reduced at 100C for 15 min in both the wet and dry soils. When the seeds were heated at 75C for 15 min, germination was significantly reduced in the wet soit only. Because of the seeds' sensitivity to heat, few of these seed bank species are likely to be available for establishment after fire, even one of low intensity. This experimental study supports the hypothesis that seed mortality from elevated temperature during fire reduced seed bank densities of the old-growth forest and does not support the hypothesis that the reduction was due to stimulation of germination by heat. Although this study tested species with different growth forms and longevities, germination responses were generally the same for all species.																	0029-344X					FEB	1994	68	1					1	5									WOS:A1994NC04400001

Most of the seeds were found to be small and only 'apparent viability' was determined after flotation had been completed. The average size of the seed bank different significantly between the two sites and decreased with increased sampling depth. The flotation method yielded a significantly larger number of seeds per square metre than the emergence method. A combination of these two methods is, therefore, recommended for estimating the size of to germinable seed bank of the Brand se Baai area, due to the problems inherent to each method.				van Rooyen, Margaretha W/K-3559-2019													0254-6299					FEB	1994	60	1					81	84		10.1016/S0254-6299(16)30664-0							WOS:A1994NA22400012

The mean area covered by each of the 5 dominant emergent species in these cells declined significantly during the first year of flooding. There was no significant difference in the total acreage of emergents between flooding years. Three species were completely (Carex atherodes Spreng, Scolochloa festucacea (Willd.) Link) or almost (Scirpus lacustris L. spp. glaucus (Sm.) Hartm.) eliminated from the cells. Typha glauca Godr. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. still covered in the second year of flooding about 40 and 25%, respectively, of the area that they had occupied in the cells in the preflooding year. The mean elevation at which the two surviving species were found both increased 0.1 and 0.2 m over preflooding elevations during the first and second year of flooding, respectively. There is no evidence that during the flooding years any species migrated upslope toward more optimal water depths. Aboveground standing crop for all five species declined significantly during the first year of flooding, but was not significantly different between the two flooding years. Total belowground biomass did not differ between spring and fall, but declined significantly (about 20%) during the first year of flooding and remained about at that level during the second year. In the spring following the two years of flooding, mean total belowground biomass was only 40 g m-2, less than 10% of the belowground biomass during the preflooding year.																	0042-3106					FEB	1994	110	2					185	196									WOS:A1994MZ07900006

Seeds were dormant when produced in spring and remained largely dormant following exposure to summer conditions. Approximately 40% of viable seeds in the seed bank were carried over from year to year. Consequently, autumn recruitment of seedlings is due in large part to germination of seeds produced in previous years. Seedling emergence was mostly simultaneous following the first substantial autumn rains. Survival to reproduction differed between years; few individuals produced seeds prior to senescence in the dry year, whereas in the wet year most overwintering individuals successfully produced fruits.																	0003-0031					JAN	1994	131	1					98	108		10.2307/2426612							WOS:A1994MW29500011

The species additions to the vegetation in twelve 2.5 x 10 m plots were compared with the soil seed bank composition in the plots at the start of the experiment in 1990. Between 1990 and 1993, 33 cases were recorded of a new plant species appearing in a plot. Species additions occurred much more often in mown plots than in unmown ones. In 42% of the cases, the species had been recorded in the soil seed bank in 1990. However, many species present only in the seed bank in 1990 did not appear in the vegetation in 1993. We conclude that the seed bank is a poor predictor of future species composition of the vegetation.

The viability of buried seeds of this wet-grassland plant decreased only slightly during the 25-month burial period, showing that L. flos-cuculi has the potential to accumulate a persistent soil seed bank. Exhumed seeds germinated to 94-100% in light, throughout the study. In darkness, however, the germinability showed an annual cyclicity; 60-100% of the seeds germinated in the winter and spring while ca. 20% germinated in the summer. Induction of a secondary dark-dormancy in seeds in the summer could partly explain why this species forms a persistent seed bank.

J	CHAMBERS, JC; MACMAHON, JA				CHAMBERS, JC; MACMAHON, JA			A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SEED - MOVEMENTS AND FATES OF SEEDS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR NATURAL AND MANAGED SYSTEMS	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS												We develop a model that outlines the movements and fates of seeds after they leave the parent plant, and then we examine the relative influences of abiotic and biotic factors on those movements and fates. Phase I dispersal is movement of a seed from the parent to a surface, while Phase II dispersal includes subsequent horizontal or vertical movements. Although less studied, Phase Il dispersal is more likely to account for the patterning of plants in communities and ecosystems and is the focus of this review. Abiotic factors influence Phase II dispersal-the distance and type of movement depend on seed morphology, surface attributes, and the nature of the physical forces. Biotic factors (animals) move seeds to new sites passively either on body surfaces or by ingestion, or actively by consuming fruits or hoarding seeds. Animals also influence the movements of seeds through digging and burrowing activities. Arrival at microsites suitable for germination and establishment is critical and is affected not only by abiotic and biotic factors but also by seed morphology and germination responses. We emphasize that seed banks are much more dynamic than they are usually portrayed. Although often poorly quantified, seed mortality can occur at any point in the model. Sufficient differences exist among biomes that certain generalizations can be made regarding seed dynamics. Knowledge of seed movements and fates is essential for ecosystem restoration and conservation efforts and for the control of alien species in all biomes.																	0066-4162						1994	25						263	292		10.1146/annurev.es.25.110194.001403							WOS:A1994PU88300011

Although species composition varied considerably among life history categories, generally field seedlings mirrored the species composition of the seed rain. Seed rain, seed bank, seedlings observed in the field, and seed production patterns varied between species, across sites for a species, and between years.

SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE SEED BANK	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												It is possible that the use of harder-seeded varieties of sub. clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and the recently domesticated murex medic (Medicago murex) may improve annual legume persistence in pasture leys. To determine the mechanisms of production and persistence in these two species, the size and composition of the seed bank were compared in four varieties of sub. clover and two lines of murex medic over a three-year period at Forbes in central-west N.S.W. The rate of breakdown of hardseed and the loss of high temperature dormancy was also studied in the same genotypes under conditions of alternating temperature in controlled environment cabinets. In terms of the size of the total seed bank, the sub. clover cultivar wit,h the highest level of hardseed (Dalkeith) was the most successful genotype studied. This was the result of slower rates of hardseed breakdown compared to the other sub. clover cultivars, and better seed production compared to the two murex medic lines. Losses of seed from the seed bank were substantial, and were not all accounted for by germinated seedlings or grazing over summer. The sub. clover cultivars Junee and Seaton Park had the highest levels of high temperature embryo dormancy and the lowest proportion of seedlings germinating over summer. The level of sub. clover hardseed breakdown in the field corresponded well with the 60/15-degrees-C laboratory estimates of hardseed breakdown, even though soil surface temperatures over summer at Forbes were rarely in the range of 60/15-degrees-C.

J	COCKS, PS				COCKS, PS			COLONIZATION OF A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GRASSLAND BY INVADING MEDITERRANEAN ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL PASTURE SPECIES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Spatial variation in the composition of the soil seed bank was studied in a 5 ha area of pasture in South Australia dominated by naturalized annuals originating from the Mediterranean basin. The results were analysed with regression, cluster and principal component analysis. A total of 34 species was collected, including 17 grasses, seven legumes, eight broad-leaved species and two rushes. The total size of the seed bank was over 200 seeds dm-2, equivalent to about 450 kg ha-1. Although the site was nearly flat, elevation affected the distribution of all species, probably because of its effect on drainage in winter. Five legumes (Trifolium clusii, T. ornithopioides, T. dubium, T. glomeratum and T. subterraneum) dominated the seed bank, but the dominant species changed with elevation above the zone of winter-waterlogging. Of the grasses Serrafalcus hordeaceus and Vulpia spp. were present at well drained sites, while Lolium perenne and Hordeum geniculatum were found at low sites, with Holcus lanatus intermediate. Seeds of legumes were more frequent at sites where soil nitrogen and phosphorus were low, and seeds of grasses where they were high. The results are compared with those obtained from perennial species in north Europe, and the implications for pasture deterioration and improvement in Australia are discussed. It is concluded that genetic diversity is likely to be important in the successful invasion of pasture by Mediterranean annuals. The presence of several naturalized legumes in niches incompletely occupied by subterranean clover suggests that germplasm is available to increase the legume component of many annual pastures.																	0004-9409	1836-5795					1994	45	5					1063	1076		10.1071/AR9941063							WOS:A1994NU36300008

Ten of these were new records. Because seed of herbaceous plant hosts provides a possible route for virus persistence through dry summer conditions, AMV seed transmission was tested for in alternative hosts. Of ten species systemically infected by sap inoculation with AMV, seed transmission was detected in Melilotus indica (10%), Ornithopus compressus (0.1%) and Stachys arvensis (2%). Seed of seven naturally infected potential alternative host species was tested, and seed transmission found in Crassula decumbens (0.1%), M. indica (3%), O. compressus (0.2%), S. arvensis (0.4%) and Trifolium subterraneum (2%). Carry-over of AMV through seed transmission was detected in seedlings of Hypochaeris glabra (0.2%) and M. indica (0.6-0.8%) that germinated naturally in the field. In grazed, self-regenerated Medicago murex and M. polymorpha swards sown in 1987, the virus persisted for at least seven growing seasons. Levels of infection in M. polymorpha seed produced each year declined, but levels in the general seed bank remained higher due to presence of older seed. It is concluded that under the conditions of broadacre agriculture in the Mediterranean-type climate of Western Australia, seed transmission in C. decumbens, H. glabra and volunteer O. compressus is an alternative means by which AMV can persist over summer to act as sources of AMV for spread within annual medic pastures. However, persistence through seed of the annual medic cultivars sown and of naturalized annual Medicago species is the principal means of persistence. AMV persists readily from year to year following sowing of infected seed and is likely to cause a recurrent disease problem in annual medic pastures.

The swards were then grazed by sheep or mown to simulate grazing. The infected transplants were the primary virus source for subsequent spread by aphids. Spread initially centred on infected transplants resulting in circular expanding infected patches. Later, secondary patches, isolated affected plants and more generalized infection sometimes developed. The extent of spread within swards from the transplants varied with cultivar, BYMV isolate, site and year. Final BYMV incidence ranged from 12% of plants symptom-affected by isolate MI in cv. Junee in 1991 to 100% by isolate SMB in cv. Leura in 1992. BYMV spread mostly occurred in spring and was increased around the edges of areas of bare ground in swards. In two experiments at one site in which 'mini swards' of cvv. Green Range, Karridale and Leura were mown repeatedly, BYMV-infection decreased herbage yields (dry weights) by 12-16% while seed yields were decreased significantly (by 37-40%) in one experiment. In a gracing experiment at a second site with swards of cvv. Esperance and Karridale, BYMV-infection decreased overall yields of herbage by 18-39% and seed by 11-12%; herbage yield losses within symptom-affected patches were 28-49%. In a further grazing experiment at this site with swards of cvv. Junee and Karridale, BYMV-induced losses determined from symptom-affected patches were 21-29% for herbage and 15-25% for seed. In a grazing experiment with swards of cvv. Denmark and Leura at a third site, BYMV-induced overall herbage yield decreases of 8-12% were still recorded despite extensive BYMV spread to control swards; yield losses within symptom-affected patches were 18-25% for herbage and 35-47% for seed. Seed yield losses were due to decreased seed size (mean seed weight), fewer seeds being produced, or both. Estimates of the effects of different levels of BYMV infection on herbage yields in partially infected grazed swards were obtained for cw. Denmark. Karridale and Leura by plotting individual quadrat data for herbage dry weights against % symptom-affected plants. Losses increased in proportion to the level of infection, but their magnitude also varied with cultivar and experiment. It is concluded that BYMV infection of subterranean clover pastures is cause for concern, not only as regards herbage yield losses but also as regards depletion of the seed bank, which, when compounded year by year, results in pasture deterioration. Early and prolonged aphid activity, reseeding the pasture with susceptible cultivars, heavy grazing and extended growing seasons are all likely to magnify BYMV-induced losses.

J	ODGERS, BM				ODGERS, BM			SEED BANKS AND VEGETATION OF 3 CONTRASTING SITES IN AN URBAN EUCALYPT FOREST RESERVE	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Grass species, sedges and dicotyledons in the vegetation and the buried germinable seed of a natural subtropical eucalypt forest, a mown and a road bank site were identified in four consecutive seasons and the data peeled to give a more precise assessment of taxa present each year. Differences in the relative proportions of taxa, differences in species density, origin and life history of grass species in the seed bank and vegetation, as well as differences in biomass and rate of germination of buried germinable grass seed, in the three sites were investigated. In all three sites, grasses were the dominant taxa of the ground stratum of the vegetation with each site having its own group of mainly perennial grasses. The seed banks were dominated by grasses in the forest site, sedges in the mown site and dicotyledons in the road bank site. There were significant differences in species density of grasses in both the vegetation and buried germinable seed between sites, with the forest site having a significantly lower species density in its seed bank than the mown and road bank sites, and the vegetation of the forest and mown sites having a lower species density than the road bank site. However, there was a high correlation between the grass species of the vegetation and the buried,germinable seed in each of the three sites - the species which dominated the vegetation also dominated the biomass of buried germinable seed in each site. The mown and road bank sites had larger numbers and biomass of buried germinable grass seed than the natural forest site. There were no differences in the number of days to first germination and the number of days to 50% germination of the buried germinable seed between any of the sites. Exotic grass species were present in the seed banks of the forest, mown and road bank sites. Exotics were prevalent in the vegetation of the mown and road bank sites but not evident in the vegetation of the forest site. Exotic species with higher buried germinable seed numbers and similar germination rates to the native species are likely to have a competitive advantage over the native species. It appears that the mown and road bank sites, may net as reservoirs for the more competitive exotic grass species, enabling them to invade the seed banks of the forest areas.																	0067-1924						1994	42	4					371	382		10.1071/BT9940371							WOS:A1994PK75200001						
J	MCIVOR, JG; GARDENER, CJ				MCIVOR, JG; GARDENER, CJ			GERMINABLE SOIL SEED BANKS IN NATIVE PASTURES IN NORTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Germinable soil seed banks were determined in 20 native pasture communities of widely varying composition (dominated by native tussock grasses, Bothriochloa pertusa, or forbs) near Collinsville (20 degrees 34'S, 147 degrees 51'E). Samples of surface soil (0-10 cm) were taken during the late dry season, seeds were germinated in a shadehouse, and seedlings were identified and counted. Over all pastures there were seeds of 100 species in the seed banks, including 29 grasses (14 perennial), 11 legumes, 8 sedges, and 52 forbs. Total seed numbers varied among pastures from 210 to 9770/m(2). Forbs were the most numerous component, followed in order by sedges, perennial grasses, annual grasses, and legumes. Of the 790 seeds/m(2) of perennial grasses, the naturalised species B. pertusa contributed 620/m(2). Even though the native perennial grasses were prominent in these pastures, they had few seeds in the soil, especially when the pastures had been heavily grazed. To maintain these grasses in pastures, management should aim to prevent excessive mortality of the perennial plants as seedling regeneration could be limited by the small seed numbers available.

A simple corer design allows removal of intact samples from water depths up to 1-2 m, ensuring comparable sampling in a variety of wetland habitats. Sampling and experimental designs appropriate for answering questions about the germination of seeds from sediments under different water regimes in both the glasshouse and the field are presented. The adequacy of area sampled and of number of replications for assessment of species richness and abundance of seeds in the seed bank is considered, and a minimum number of five aggregate samples (each sample of eight cores has an area of 0.016 m2) is suggested for these wetlands. The variation between samples in this study is within the range reported for seed-bank studies in similar wetlands in North America.																	0067-1940						1994	45	4					483	493									WOS:A1994PC56600003						
J	BRITTON, DL; BROCK, MA				BRITTON, DL; BROCK, MA			SEASONAL GERMINATION FROM WETLAND SEED BANKS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seasonal germination from the seed banks of five wetlands that experience unpredictable fluctuations in water level was examined by wetting dried sediments at three-monthly intervals over a 14-month period. Germination trials were conducted both outdoors and in an unheated, naturally lit glasshouse. In each trial, sediments were maintained in a waterlogged condition for eight weeks, after which all germinating individuals were counted and identified. Although germination occurred in all seasons at all sites, both numbers of species and numbers of individuals germinating from the wetted sediments were significantly affected by season, both outdoors and in the glasshouse. In the outdoor trials, greatest numbers of individuals and species generally appeared in autumn, fewest in summer. Sensitivity to a combination of high maximum and high minimum temperatures may have evolved in wetland species of the area as a mechanism ensuring that germination is dramatically reduced in summer, when conditions for establishment of young seedlings may be particularly unfavourable.																	0067-1940						1994	45	8					1445	1457									WOS:A1994QM81400008						
J	REA, N; GANF, GG				REA, N; GANF, GG			THE ROLE OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND WATER REGIME IN SHAPING THE DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF CLONAL EMERGENT AQUATIC PLANTS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The reproductive characteristics of T. procerum in three lagoons in the Mediterranean south-east of South Australia were used to investigate the role of water regime in the often heterogeneous and patchy distribution of aquatic vegetation. A theoretical explanation for these patterns, based on sexual reproduction vis-a-vis seedling establishment, is proposed. Owing to the unpredictable nature of seed dispersal and the narrow range of suitable conditions for germination and establishment that result from fluctuating and variable water levels, establishment events are spatially and temporally dynamic. These features may be important for maintaining species distribution, species survival and habitat diversity. Population resilience through genetically heterogeneous stands is another outcome. The implications of sexual reproduction by clonal plants are discussed, as is the need to maintain the conditions that plants need to flower, germinate and become established. The unpredictable nature of establishment events makes them difficult to manage. Regulation and pondage/drainage may be having a profound effect on the survival of many aquatic plant species owing to their inability to regenerate under such conditions.																	0067-1940						1994	45	8					1469	1479									WOS:A1994QM81400010

It has become dominant, replacing much of the former vegetation in the Botany Wetlands, a series of shallow urban swamps and lakes near Sydney, Australia. Studies of L. peruviana were essential to the development of a management plan for the Botany Wetlands. Ecological studies were conducted in situ and supplemented by a series of germination and growth experiments in controlled environments. Flowering peaked in early autumn. Seed production for 1990-91 was similar to 450000 seeds m(-2) and there was also similar to 65000 seeds m(-2) in the soil seed bank and similar to 300000 seeds m(-2) in old fruits that remained on the stems over winter. The seeds are similar to 0.8 mm long, weigh similar to 0.05 mg, are hydrophobic, usually germinate while afloat, and are easily dispersed by water, machinery and birds. Viability of fresh seed was 99% (tetrazolium dye test), and similar to 20% of seeds were dormant. Dormancy appeared to break down within two years. Propagation and dispersal may also occur by means of stem pieces that produce new shoots. New plants from seed, seedlings or stem fragments may become established on strand lines or form floating islands that may eventually become stranded. Management needs to focus on control of the seedlings and soil seed bank.

The seeds had a primary dormancy which was overcome by cold-stratification. Seeds buried in the soil became germinable in early spring (February), and autumn-sown seeds germinated during a four-week period in late spring (May). Exhumed seeds germinated in both light and darkness and in situ germination occurred even at 15 cm depth in the soil. No persistent soil seed bank could be detected in populations of G. campestris, and very few experimentally buried seeds were viable after 21 months in the soil. Together, these results indicate that the species has a transient seed bank, in which case yearly seed production is important for maintaining populations and preventing local extinction.

Seed richness was relatively low (500/m2); in contrast, specific richness was high (56 species/m2). Anemochory (wind-borne), autochory (self-dispersion) and ornithochory (birds) were the dissemination types encountered most. Most of the seed buried in the soil belonged to species alien to the forest, coming from neighbouring or distant (sources) environments. A convergence between the soil seed bank floras of different communities could be noticed When a disturbance (fire or cutting) occurs, creating favourable conditions, seeds germinate producing numerous seedlings representing transitory stages.																	0006-3207						1994	69	1					107	114		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90333-6							WOS:A1994NM35200012

Data were collected on the time spent feeding by one group on various plant species, and also on the vegetation, phenology and regeneration in plots subjected to shifting cultivation. Data for eight months indicated that Phayre's leaf monkey fed primarily on young leaves and to a lesser extent on shoots and seeds. Young leaves formed a consistently high proportion of the diet in all months. Most of the 18 food plant species were exploited for young leaves, but only a few for other plant parts. Six species accounted for more than 65% of the diet in all eight months, and more than 75% over all months. Regeneration and accumulation of woody biomass in areas subjected to shifting cultivation were rapid as a result of germination and coppicing. Five of the six most used plant species dominated this regeneration. It is concluded that Phayre's leaf monkey will survive in secondary forests provided regeneration is allowed to continue for at least 9-10 years. The progressively shortening cycle for shifting cultivation, however, poses a threat, and the small patches of primary forest which remain are also disappearing due to shifting cultivation or degradation. Their role as seed banks will decrease, leading to further impoverishment of the secondary forests.																	0006-3207						1994	69	3					301	306									WOS:A1994NZ24400009						
J	SORRIE, BA				SORRIE, BA			COASTAL-PLAIN PONDS IN NEW-ENGLAND	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												New England's coastal plain ponds occupy areas of glacially deposited outwash, till, or former glacial lake beds. Generally, these ponds lie in gently sloping basins with no inlet or outlet and are intimately linked with the underlying groundwater or aquifer. Water levels rise and fall naturally with the seasons, depending on rainfall/evaporation cycles. There are hundreds of ponds, distributed in three main areas. New England's coastal plain ponds vary significantly in physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, but are united by several dominant features. (1) With rare exceptions they are permanent bodies of water and do not dry out annually as do southern US ponds. (2) They are highly acidic and nutrient-poor. (3) Their basins are sloping, creating concentric bands of vegetation as waters recede. (4) The dominant emergent, when present, is Juncus militaris, not Panicum hemitomon as in southern US ponds. (5) Dominant plants in the drawdown zone are graminoid and herbaceous species; woody plants are absent. Forty-one Atlantic coastal plain pond plant taxa are considered rare in one or more New England states, the great majority occurring only in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. One taxon is endemic to the region: Eupatorium leucolepis var. novae-angliae; five others are nearly so. Because they hold water during the summer, New England's coastal plain ponds are attractive to recreation and housing development. During 1970-1990 large-scale impacts resulted from these activities and from recreational vehicle use and water extraction, so that few pristine ponds are left.																	0006-3207						1994	68	3					225	233		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90410-3							WOS:A1994NF94100004

Among these threatened natural communities are non-alluvial systems such as pond cypress Taxodium ascendens savannas, karst ponds, coastal plain small depression ponds, longleaf pine Pinus palustris savannas, and pocosins. We estimate that more than a third of the rare plant species in the Southeast occur in these wetland communities. The threats to these isolated wetland communities are numerous, from local site specific threats including drainage and development to threats to the regional hydrology. In this paper we present an overview of the non-alluvial wetlands in the southern Atlantic and eastern Gulf coastal plain and focus on two of the most threatened non-alluvial wetland communities in the region, pond cypress savannas and karst ponds.																	0006-3207						1994	68	3					235	243		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90411-1							WOS:A1994NF94100005

Coastal plain species occur primarily in infertile areas and/or on shorelines exposed to wave wash or seasonal flooding. Experiments show that coastal plain species are restricted to such areas by the inability to compete with competitively superior species that occupy fertile, undisturbed areas. Coastal plain plants almost always co-occur with either isoetids or carnivorous species, two well-known stress-tolerant groups of plants, indicating that coastal plain species are also stress tolerators. The rarity of coastal plain species is a consequence of limited habitat with low competition intensity, so conservation strategies should emphasize the preservation of remaining habitat and the maintenance of existing levels of infertility, flooding and exposure.																	0006-3207						1994	68	3					247	252		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90412-X							WOS:A1994NF94100006						
J	SCHNEIDER, R				SCHNEIDER, R			THE ROLE OF HYDROLOGIC REGIME IN MAINTAINING RARE PLANT-COMMUNITIES OF NEW-YORK COASTAL-PLAIN PONDSHORES	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The influence of water level fluctuations on the regeneration of rare plant communities was examined for two pondshores in Long Island, New York. Regeneration from seeds and vegetative propagules in soil cores was the method used to quantify the species composition of the soil seed bank when subjected to different flooding regimes. Both ponds had seed banks with high diversity.and density within a sandy shoreline zone. The seed banks consisted of three guilds of species requiring different flooding conditions for regeneration. An analysis of historical water level patterns at each pond suggests that the high diversity communities are maintained by a relatively well-defined hydroperiod. Short-term drawdowns lasting one to three years followed by extended high water periods apparently results in an alternation in species composition of the aboveground vegetation. The guild structure of the plant community helps maintain the spatial coexistence of the various species in the soil seed bank while the fluctuating hydrologic conditions result in a temporal separation of the plant species aboveground.																	0006-3207						1994	68	3					253	260		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90413-8							WOS:A1994NF94100007

The emergent vegetation was successfully re-established by means of a drawdown. A comparable flooded marsh was studied to describe its seed bank and to find out if it was possible to make an accurate prediction of the vegetation developments after a drawdown based on the Van der Valk model on succession in wetlands. Two different zones could be distinguished in the lake. These differed mainly in the number of seeds found, not in the species composition of their seed banks. The short-term prediction that Typha latifolia would become dominant did not always match the actual pioneer vegetation that developed, several different communities developed from similar seed banks. The long-term prediction, that Phragmites australis would become dominant after four years of drawdown, was fulfilled.																	0006-3207						1994	67	1					1	11		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90002-7							WOS:A1994ML47600001

It draws on previous studies on the use by songbirds of SRC plantations and of similar coppice habitats in the UK and in Sweden. Studies of ground flora communities in willow coppice plantations in Sweden and on set-aside land in the UK are discussed Measurements of crop structure taken from existing SRC sites during the winter were used to assess the likely attractiveness of the crop to pheasants as winter cover. Structural similarities between SRC, traditional coppice woodland and withy beds, and the known high arthropod abundance associated with willows, suggests the crop will be used by a variety of songbird species, particularly migrant warblers. It is likely that the flora and vegetation of SRC will initially be dominated by farmland weed species from the seed bank and ruderal species characteristic of disturbed habitats. Colonisation by less common woodland species and those associated with traditional coppice habitats may occur. SRC can provide suitable cover for holding pheasants during the winter shooting season.

Thus, seeds of this species have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). A high percentage of the seeds lost their PD (afterripened) when kept at 12/12 hr daily thermoperiods of 30/15 and 35/20 degrees C for 12 weeks, a low percentage afterripened at 20/10 and 25/15 degrees C and none afterripened at 15/6 degrees C or at constant 5 degrees C. Seeds required 12 weeks at natural summer temperatures or 8 weeks at 35/ 20 degrees C to germinate to 50% or more after 15 days of incubation at 30/15 degrees C. Since high temperatures are the only dormancy-breaking treatment required for germination, seeds have nondeep simple MPD. Embryos do not grow until after PD is broken, and thus they can not grow in the field immediately following seed dispersal. After PD is broken in summer, embryo growth is prevented by high temperatures. Embryo growth, followed by germination, occurs when temperatures decrease to 25-30 degrees C (day) and 15-20 degrees C (night) in late August and early September. In September, seeds germinated to 59-100% in light and darkness at 15/6, 20/10, 25/15 and 30/15 degrees C, and up to 83% of buried seeds exposed to natural temperatures germinated in autumn. Although the species lacks the potential to form a large persistent seed bank, germination in a few of the seeds sown in a nonheated greenhouse in May 1986 was delayed until the autumns of 1987-1990.																	0040-9618					JAN-MAR	1994	121	1					40	46		10.2307/2996882							WOS:A1994ND67000004

Out of the six species of Vaccinium present in this vegetation, only V. angustifolium and V. boreale were recovered from 120 soil cores taken; V. uliginosum and V. vitis-idaea, two of the most common species on these heaths, were not represented in the seed bank at all, yet experimentally buried seeds from both these taxa will successfully germinate when exhumed after 6 years of burial. Indeed, 81% of the germinants were from taxa with dry fruits such as Kalmia, Luzula, Juncus, and Agrostis. Paucity of Vaccinium seed in the soil column may be due in part to fungal rot and avian predation.																	0008-4026					JAN	1994	72	1					52	58									WOS:A1994NB68300007						
J	MILBERG, P				MILBERG, P			GERMINATION ECOLOGY OF THE POLYCARPIC GRASSLAND PERENNIALS PRIMULA-VERIS AND TROLLIUS-EUROPAEUS	ECOGRAPHY												The seed germination behaviour of Primula veris and Trollius europaeus, both perennial, polycarpic grassland plants was compared. The species have similar-sized seeds that are dormant at dispersal. Seeds buried in soil and exhumed at regular intervals showed that for both species, primary seed dormancy was overcome by cold-stratification. Hence, their germination in the field should occur in spring, following dispersal, or later. Seeds of P. veris became dormant again in the late spring/early summer, and dormancy was broken again in the second winter. Seeds of T. europaeus did not exhibit such changes in dormancy. Seeds of P. veris did not germinate in darkness. This suggests that P. veris can accumulate a persistent seed bank because buried seeds are prevented from germinating. Trollius europaeus, on the other hand, germinated equally well in darkness and in light which suggests that seeds might germinate even when they are too deep in the soil for seedlings to emerge. Two lines of evidence confirm this difference in seed bank behaviour: (i) Primula veris was detected in the persistent seed bank of a grassland site, whereas T. europaeus was not.

J	BADGER, KS; UNGAR, IA				BADGER, KS; UNGAR, IA			SEED BANK DYNAMICS IN AN INLAND SALT-MARSH, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE HALOPHYTE HORDEUM-JUBATUM L	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Seed bank dynamics of the short-lived perennial halophyte Hordeum jubatum L. and the annual halophytes Atriplex triangularis Willd. and Salicornia europaea L. were examined in three zones of an inland saline marsh near Rittman, Ohio. The seed bank was assayed using a sequence of temperature treatments to satisfy the germination requirements of all species. Viable seeds of H. jubatum and other halophytes persisted in the soil seed bank after the normal spring germination season. Total seed bank ranged from 479,200 seeds/m2 to 85,925 seeds/m2. However, seeds of H. jubatum usually comprised less than 30% of the seeds in the total seed bank for the three zones of the marsh in which it occurred during the sampling period from February 1987 to November 1988. Atriplex triangularis also produced a persistent seed bank in each of the three zones. We concluded that H. jubatum is less dependent on a large seed bank for maintaining its population than are the annual halophytes because it is a short-lived perennial.																	1058-5893					JAN	1994	155	1					66	72		10.1086/297148							WOS:A1994ND29200008

Throughout the 26 years that I studied desert plants with Professor Evenari in the deserts of Israel and the Sinai Peninsula, he liked to summarize the seasonal field observations of seedling emergence with the words, ''this particular year is a very special year.'' What are the reasons for such species' diversity, and what are the survival strategies of desert annuals? Some species are common and others emerge only once in several years under unpredictable seasonal precipitation and massive seed consumption by ants. Escape dispersal strategies after maturation of the tiny, long-living seeds, and partial ''opportunistic'' germination strategies after only 10 mm of rain, are found in some common annuals such as Schismus arabicus and Spergularia diandra. Day length during seed maturation, and light and temperatures during seed wetting and germination, also affect their germinability. In S. diandra, nine types of seeds have been found (3 genotypes and 3 color phenotypes), which differ in coat structure, color, and germinability, and in Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum a position effect was found (3 groups of seeds in a capsule). The more opportunities for a small portion of seeds from the seed bank to germinate after several rainfalls, the greater the chances to germinate at suitable rain distribution. This enables these plants to develop and produce large numbers of seeds, even after a number of small rainfalls.																	0792-9978						1994	42	4					261	274		10.1080/07929978.1994.10676579							WOS:A1994QF90900001

The objectives of the study were to determine significant autecological characteristics, identify significant threats, and provide management recommendations for this species. This perennial plant is restricted to deep (> 1 m), relatively porous soils on south- and west-facing slopes throughout the area mapped as the Challis volcanics. In a two-year study, populations of Challis milkvetch decreased and showed low percent survival of seedlings and of non-reproductive and reproductive individuals. There were sufficient pollinators, and the plants set and dispersed viable seed. However, in the dry and unpredictable climate of east-central Idaho, establishment of Challis milkvetch seedlings is dependent on rapid growth of the taproot. Establishment of new Challis milkvetch plants and population size both changed dramatically over two consecutive years of below average precipitation. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as domestic livestock grazing, off-road vehicle use, mining, and herbicide spraying appear to be only minor threats to Challis milkvetch. Agencies should continue to monitor the species to determine population trends. Challis milkvetch habitat should be protected because it holds the seed bank for this and many other endemic species.																	0885-8608					JAN	1994	14	1					22	30									WOS:A1994MY36400004						
J	BURROWS, CJ				BURROWS, CJ			THE SEEDS ALWAYS KNOW BEST	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The New Zealand woody plant nora differs from those of temperate Northern Hemisphere regions by having: a very high proportion (70% cf. 17-47%) of tree species (but lower proportions of shrubs and vines) with fleshy fruit; a relatively low proportion of seeds with overwinter dormancy; and relatively few species that form longterm (i.e., 1 year or longer) seed banks. These differences are ascribed to the effects of: the phylogenetic history of the respective floras, with most tree species in New Zealand being closely related to tropical taxa; the evolution here, under isolation, of a small but effective group of seed-dispersing birds; and the selective influences of much more severe Quaternary climatic conditions in the north, affecting both the drying of fruit and seeds and seed dormancy properties. As a consequence, a New Zealand perspective on germination delay phenomena in seeds must differ, somewhat, from the Northern Hemisphere bias that is so evident in the plant physiological and ecological literature about seeds.																	0028-825X						1994	32	3					349	363									WOS:A1994PN14000008

Seedling recruitment, emergence fluxes, seedling survival, fecundity, initial and final seed banks and the annual rate of growth of the populations (lambda) with the two latter parameters were evaluated. Three pigweed emergence cohorts were evaluated. Seed production was only observed in first and second cohorts were evaluated. Seed production was higher density and greater number of seeds. Crop presence did not remarkably affect any the parameters considered. The lambda increased on average 53 % in absence of the crop and 59% in presence of the crop when no chemical control and cultivation were performed. When a cultivation was done, lambda increase oscilated between 9 and 20 % depending on the year. When herbicides were used, lambda shoved a population increase of 9 % for postemergence applications and 28 % for preemergence applications.																	0100-204X					JAN	1994	29	1					33	42									WOS:A1994MZ41100005

J	CHIN, HF				CHIN, HF			SEEDBANKS - CONSERVING THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The World's plant genetic resources of a quarter of a million species comprising timber, fruit trees, food crops, medicinal and aromatic plants, ornamentals and many others of unknown potential are an invaluable asset to mankind. The role and importance of plant genetic resources have been well recognized worldwide. The diverse plant population of crops and their wild relatives is constantly diminishing in number at an alarming rate due to forest destruction and genetic erosion. This loss in plant species can be attributed to increasing encroachment into forest reserves by the world's ever increasing population, rapid agricultural development and industrial progress. Our own survival depends on these natural resources. Greater efforts and sacrifices have to be made, even at high costs, to conserve these plant genetic resources for the future generations. These invaluable plant genetic resources include forest species dating back millions of years, as well as long discarded cultivars of crops. They can and should be conserved by leaving the trees in their natural habitat in the forest (in situ method) or by the use of various types of genebanks (ex situ method). Of all the methods of conservation, the seed bank is currently the most commonly used, being both economical and practical for conserving germplasm. Today, there are almost one thousand germplasm collections in 121 countries consisting of a total of 3.5 million seed accessions. Since 1974, with the establishment of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources, the number of seed banks has increased significantly. Seed banks of different sizes, capacity and complexity have been built, varying from the simple cold room to an ultra modern futuristic bank run by robots. Today, even an environmental friendly type under permafrost is in existence. The world's impending human population explosion demands higher yields from agriculture. In time to come, the number of new pests, diseases, as well as soil and atmospheric problems will rise. To combat and perhaps solve these problems, we need these genes conserved in seed banks. Genetic conservation together with modern biotechnology may be one of the key solutions for the survival of mankind. Therefore, seeds of the past and present have to be collected now and conserved for posterity before they disappear forever.																	0251-0952						1994	22	2					385	400									WOS:A1994PP35300021

The seed bank is the most important mechanism that ensures persistence of these species in self-regenerating pastures. Previous research has shown that up to 40% of seed may be lost during summer, when there is no living plant population; summer rainfall was known to be the most important Factor contributing to this loss. Imbibition of seed, followed by dehydration was thought to play a role and this process was investigated. In order to determine the effect of hydration-dehydration on seed viability, recently formed seed of T. balansae cv. Paradana and T. resupinatum line SA 12240 and cv. Kyambro and three-year old seed of Paradana, SA 14433, Maral and T. subterraneum cv. Junee was imbibed for 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 hours and then dehydrated; germination of this seed was tested. In recently formed seed, hydration-dehydration had no significant effect on seed viability during the first 16 hours of imbibition; seed viability declined with longer duration of imbibition. In old seed, there was an immediate reduction of viability; an increased period of imbibition up to 32 hours did not further decrease germination. The influence of storage on hydrated-dehydrated seed was investigated by storing seed of both age groups for 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 weeks at 54/19 degrees C. In both recent and old seed, storage after imbibition-dehydration resulted in a further decrease in seed viability and germination speed. It was concluded that hydration-dehydration followed by storage contributed to the deterioration of the seed supply in the seed bank over summer.

J	PIERCE, SM; MOLL, EJ				PIERCE, SM; MOLL, EJ			GERMINATION ECOLOGY OF 6 SHRUBS IN FIRE-PRONE CAPE FYNBOS	VEGETATIO												To explain the recruitment and coexistence of species which establish after fire, this study predicted that each species would have different germination cues as a component of different regeneration niches. Furthermore, for species subject to natural fire frequencies of 10-20 years, fire-related cues, seed dormancy, extended longevity and fire-related germination cues might be predicted. However, results indicated broadly similar germination requirements. Seeds subjected to two heat treatments and a charcoal extract failed to show significantly enhanced germination. Instead, highest germination successes were achieved under alternating diurnal temperatures which implied an indirect fire cue, viz. the removal of insulating vegetation. Leachate solution inhibited germination in two species suggesting allelopathic effects during inter-fire periods. Only two species showed dormancy and three species did not have extended longevity but showed declining germinability after three years. Finally, in order to determine the potential germination from a soil-stored seed bank, data analysis simulated a seed bank comprising three years' accumulation of seeds. In each species the proportion of germinable seeds varied each year over the three years. Also, the germinability in response to ageing varied for each year's seed production. This would explain the variation in densities of the six species after different fire events, and hence offers a better explanation for species' coexistence.																	0042-3106					JAN	1994	110	1					25	41									WOS:A1994MV60900003

Lag. ex Griffiths. A spatially-explicit gap dynamics simulation model was used to evaluate recovery patterns. The model simulates establishment, growth, and mortality of individual plants on an array of small plots through time at an annual time step. Each simulated disturbance consisted of a grid of plots of the same soil texture interconnected by processes associated with dispersal of B. gracilis seeds. Soil texture was incorporated into the model as effects on seed germination, seedling establishment, and subsequent growth of B. gracilis. Five soil texture classes and five disturbance sizes were simulated. Soil texture was more important to recovery of B. gracilis than either size of a disturbance or location of plots within a disturbance. Constraints on recruitment of seedlings had a greater effect on recovery than constraints associated with plant growth. Fastest recovery occurred on soils with the largest silt content, the variable that affects seedling establishment. Disturbances with slowest recovery were on soils with low silt contents, and either high or low water-holding capacity, the variable that affects plant growth. Biomass and recovery decreased as disturbance size increased, and as distance from a disturbed plot to the edge of the disturbance increased. In most cases, important interactions between soil texture and disturbance size on recovery were not found.																	0042-3106					JAN	1994	110	1					67	82									WOS:A1994MV60900006						
J	OHTSUKA, T; OHSAWA, M				OHTSUKA, T; OHSAWA, M			ACCUMULATION OF BURIED SEEDS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF RUDERAL THEROPHYTIC COMMUNITIES IN DISTURBED HABITAT, CENTRAL JAPAN	VEGETATIO												The establishment and maintenance mechanisms of pioneer communities were investigated in ruderal habitats under two disturbance regimes, frequent and infrequent cutting sites. In the infrequent cutting sites, large perennials dominated through the year and inhibited the invasion of annuals, and the perennial community succeeded to forest stage if the cutting was stopped. In the frequent cutting sites, therophytic communities of winter and summer annuals alternated by season. Fresh seeds of both winter and summer annuals are dormant, but they have different germination times and thus can share the same sites in different seasons. Wind-dispersed biennials and large perennials have nondormant seeds and easily invade the sites; however, they are unable to mature to reproductive phase due to recurrent cuttings. The therophytic species, which can complete their life-cycle in a period between cuttings, accumulate seeds in the soils and are maintained by these buried seeds (seed bank annuals) during recurrent disturbances. The seed bank is compensation for the dispersal inefficiency of seed bank annuals. After abandonment of the frequent cutting sites, the buried seeds of seed bank annuals germinate and become the first-year pioneers. Thus, seed bank annuals are not invasive colonizers but are the remnants of the ruderal weed communities before abandonment.				, 大塚俊之/V-6687-2019	, 大塚俊之/0000-0002-9032-7933												0042-3106					JAN	1994	110	1					83	96									WOS:A1994MV60900007

The role of seed bank and seed rain in the recolonization of disturbed sites along an aridity gradient	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												The composition of seed bank and seed rain have been studied in different undisturbed vegetation types along an aridity gradient from the Mediterranean to the desert. The recruitment of colonizing species which originated either from the seed bank or the seed rain have been estimated for experimentally created gaps. The species richness of seed bank and seed rain decreases with increasing aridity, while no clear pattern has been observed for the density. The similarity of seed bank and seed rain with the actual vegetation increases with aridity. The seed rain shows overall greater dissimilarity than the seed bank. The seed bank has been found to be the main seed source in recolonization of the gaps in the Mediterranean and in the desert. The relative importance of seed bank compared with seed rain increases towards the desert. The portion of annual species in the vegetation is proposed as the main explanation for the revealed pattern. The special traits and evolutionary strategies of annuals are discussed as likely reasons for the differences in seed bank and seed rain along the gradient.																	0340-269X					DEC 15	1993	23						561	580									WOS:000208428300030

J	BOBBINK, R; WILLEMS, JH				BOBBINK, R; WILLEMS, JH			RESTORATION MANAGEMENT OF ABANDONED CHALK GRASSLAND IN THE NETHERLANDS	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												After abandonment of chalk grassland in the Netherlands, Brachypodium pinnatum had become very dominant and this resulted in a dramatic decrease of plant diversity. Restoration of these abandoned sites is important, because of its former high diversity with many nationally endangered species. To restore the chalk grassland vegetation, the impact of the introduction of different experimental cutting regimes was investigated during three years. The thick litter layer and the dominance of Brachypodium was strongly reduced after introduction of all cutting regimes. In all cutting treatments forb phytomass increased considerably, especially in the twice-a-year cutting vegetation, where the forb phytomass became as high as that of Brachypodium. Phanerogamic species diversity was stimulated in all cutting regimes. Especially the number of short-lived forbs, with a persistent seed bank, increased markedly in the twice-a-year cutting treatment. It is concluded that cutting the vegetation twice is adequate to reduce the negative effects of the thick litter layer and the abundant growth of Brachypodium. It creates an appropriate starting point for more definite management, whether mowing or grazing. However, the restoration of a more complete species assortment strongly depends on the re-invasion possibilities of these species.																	0960-3115					DEC	1993	2	6					616	626		10.1007/BF00051962							WOS:A1993MN29000005						
J	DRAKE, DR				DRAKE, DR			GERMINATION REQUIREMENTS OF METROSIDEROS-POLYMORPHA, THE DOMINANT TREE OF HAWAIIAN LAVA FLOWS AND RAIN-FORESTS	BIOTROPICA												Experiments were performed to determine the effects of burial, light quality, and temperature on seed germination of Metrosideros polymorpha, the dominant tree of Hawaiian lava flows and rain forests. Fewer than 1 percent of seeds buried under 5 mm of sand were able to germinate and emerge, compared to 90 percent for seeds sown on the sand surface. Germination was greater under white, red, or far-red light (all greater-than-or-equal-to 62%) than in the dark (less-than-or-equal-to 10%). The light requirement was not overcome by a fluctuating thermoperiod (of 5-degrees/15-degrees-C or 15-degrees/25-degrees-C). Seeds germinated in all constant-temperature treatments (10-degrees to 34-degrees-C). Germination percent and rate (pace) were highest at 22-degrees-C and lowest at 34-degrees-C. There were intraspecific differences between seeds from pubescent and glabrous parents, with seeds from pubescent plants germinating in slightly higher numbers at high temperatures, and slightly faster in many treatments. The results suggest that M. polymorpha seeds are capable of germinating rapidly under a wide variety of environmental conditions, and are unlikely to form a persistent soil seed bank.																	0006-3606					DEC	1993	25	4					461	467		10.2307/2388869							WOS:A1993MQ92100009						
J	GUGERLI, F				GUGERLI, F			SEED BANK AS RESOURCE FOR RESTORING OF EXTENSIVELY MANAGED, SPECIES-RICH GRASSLAND	BOTANICA HELVETICA												In various parts of Switzerland efforts are aimed at reducing the intensity of grassland management in order to re-establish high floristic diversity. The aim of the present investigation was to study the soil seed bank of three meadows in Northern Switzerland as a potential resource for restoration of species-rich calcareous grassland. A large number of viable seeds was found in the soil samples (from 3544 to 8675 seeds/m2). There was no indication of a seed bank of species typical for limestone grassland other than those already growing in the vegetation. The ratio of species with persistent seed bank to those with transient seed bank as well as the total species number correspond to the diversity of the present vegetation. However, species with a seed bank of the permanent type, with the exception of seeds of arable weeds, appeared to be lacking. This suggests that for only a few years there is a chance of finding species typical for limestone grassland as viable seeds after the plants have disappeared from the vegetation. Therefore, the desired increase in floristic diversity needs to be achieved e.g. by sowing or by other active means of management.

The total soil surface area sampled was 9.4 m(2). Germination behaviour of seven dominant species in response to depth of burial and substrate was also studied in a greenhouse experiment. A total of 16 289 seedlings germinated, representing 62 native and naturalized vascular plant species and several unidentified grass species. Most seedlings emerged from the forest floor, and the number of germinants generally decreased with increasing sample depth. Drier ecosystems had the lowest number and density of germinants. Burial depth significantly affected germination of all species tested. Mineral soil was equal, or superior, to forest floor as a germination substrate for all species tested. Depth - substrate interactions for several species indicated that the pattern of influence of burial depth in relation to substrate varied with species. Caution is urged extrapolating greenhouse seed-bank studies to potential weed populations in the field. Establishment of species from the seed bank will be a function of the depth to which the soil is disturbed and the kind of disturbance (burning, scarification) imposed.																	0008-4026					DEC	1993	71	12					1574	1583		10.1139/b93-192							WOS:A1993MW81400006

Three dominant species with wind-dispersed seeds played a major role in the succession: an annual, Crassocephalum crepidioides, a biennial, Erigeron canadensis, and a perennial, Miscanthus sinensis. Pioneer herbs that have a seed-bank strategy, which are common in old field succession, were not found in the mountainous sites. The persistence of the annual or biennial dominants during the very early stages of secondary succession was different in the three topographical habitat types. In the ridge habitat, M. sinensis dominated from the first year stage, and C. crepidioides and E. canadensis were less prominent. Crassocephalum crepidioides and E. canadensis became dominant as one moved down the slope. In the valley habitat, C. crepidioides dominated in the first year stage, was succeeded by E. canadensis in the second year, and then M. sinensis gradually replaced it in later years. As all three wind-dispersed dominants simultaneously invaded in all the habitat types after clear-felling, the different successional patterns along the topographical gradient might have resulted from differences in the establishment ability and the growth rate of the three dominants depending on the three habitat types.				, 大塚俊之/V-6687-2019	, 大塚俊之/0000-0002-9032-7933												0912-3814					DEC	1993	8	3					329	340		10.1007/BF02347192							WOS:A1993MK76900008						
J	CRIST, TO; FRIESE, CF				CRIST, TO; FRIESE, CF			THE IMPACT OF FUNGI ON SOIL SEEDS - IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANTS AND GRANIVORES IN A SEMIARID SHRUB-STEPPE	ECOLOGY												Fungi are ubiquitous in soil and may affect seed survivorship directly by decomposition or pathogenesis, or indirectly through the effects of fungi on seed preference of granivores. We studied the role of fungi in the persistence of soil seeds in a shrub-steppe ecosystem using two experimental approaches. In the first, we examined survivorship of 900 seeds of five shrub-steppe species in nylon bags over a 10-mo period and determined viable seed losses to germination, decomposition, and pathogens. The proportion of seeds representing a viable seed bank decreased from 84.4% in the May pre-experimental conditions to 4.4% in March. Decomposition and attack by fungi were responsible for the greatest decrease from fall to winter (0% in August, 32.0% in November, 35.2% in March) while germination accounted for the greatest decrease from winter to spring (18.5% in August, 21.9% in November, 55.0% in March). Small seeds were more likely to be lost to decomposition and pathogens, whereas larger seeds had greater losses to germination. A subset of 80 experimental seeds was cultured for seed-infecting fungi. We found fungi in virtually all seeds; the most common fungal isolates were cosmopolitan soil fungi, such as species of Penicillium and Mucor. These species are known producers of extracellular enzymes and mycotoxins. Two sterile (nonfruiting) forms of fungi were also frequently isolated, as were two pathogenic species of Fusarium. In a second experiment we placed seeds in fungal cultures obtained from soil seeds and presented moldy seeds along with control seeds to a shrub-steppe granivore, the western harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis). Ants harvested control seeds at nearly twice the rate of moldy seeds, suggesting that they avoided seeds infected with fungi. In this way, fungi may indirectly affect seed mortality due to predation by granivores, in addition to the direct effects fungi can have on seed survivorship. We suggest that fungi may play an important role in soil seed dynamics, but one that is poorly understood.																	0012-9658					DEC	1993	74	8					2231	2239		10.2307/1939576							WOS:A1993MJ57500005

They frequently have a grassy understorey, which has a distinct species composition and abundance unlike adjacent open communities. Soil blocks were reciprocally transplanted in autumn (at seed stage) between oak understorey and open grassland. Changes in species composition and species population densities were monitored over the following two years. 2 Species composition of adult plants in the reciprocally transplanted soil blocks resembled the original 'donor' seed bank in the first spring after transplant, but in the second year it was not very different from the surrounding community in the 'receptor' habitat. 3 In the soil blocks transplanted from the open grassland to the oak understorey, overall abundance was severely reduced after two years, and light-exigent species like Lolium multiflorum, Bromus mollis and Hypochoeris glabra were eliminated. When understorey plots, which had low initial seed reserves, were reciprocally transplanted into the open grassland, they were readily colonized by the high seed producers Lolium multiflorum and Bromus mollis, which outcompeted shade-tolerant species like Montia perfoliata and Galium aparine. However, Stellaria media, with a persistent seed bank, still survived and reproduced after two years in the open grassland. 4 In a second experiment, soil blocks from both habitats were transplanted onto the top of an uniform soil base in large boxes in a fenced experimental site, and half of them were then subjected to artificial dense shade. Total plant density was severely reduced by shading, although Bromus diandrus, Carduus pycnocephalus and Stellaria media were the species least affected. 5 Half of the shaded and full-sun plots in the uniform soil were clipped periodically. Avena fatua dominated the full-sun, unclipped plots, while adult plant densities of Lolium multiflorum, Bromus mollis and B. diandrus increased with the clipping treatment. 6 Reduced radiation under evergreen oak canopy caused high seedling mortality of the transplanted open species and seems the main factor precluding their distribution in the oak woodland. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that artificial shading severely reduced the seedling density of open species. Reciprocally, strong interference by dominant tall grasses seems to limit the establishment of understorey species in the open grassland.

J	CAREY, PD; WATKINSON, AR				CAREY, PD; WATKINSON, AR			THE DISPERSAL AND FATES OF SEEDS OF THE WINTER ANNUAL GRASS VULPIA-CILIATA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Vulpia ciliata is a short winter annual grass that occurs primarily amongst open vegetation on sandy soils and shingle in southern and eastern England. In such habitats it is often found in disturbed areas alongside tracks and paths. Dispersal occurs as a result of wind or mechanical disturbance fracturing the diaspores from the spikelets on the infructescence. The aim of this study was to examine the dispersal and fates of the seeds of V. ciliata and compare them with those of the closely related V fasciculata. 2 In a population relatively undisturbed by people the mean dispersal distance of diaspores from infructescences of V ciliata sprayed with paint was 6 cm; the distribution of the dispersal distances was skewed to the right and leptokurtic. Diaspores were dispersed in all directions but the mean angle of dispersal was in the direction of the prevailing south westerly winds. The distance of dispersal from individual infructescences was positively correlated with the height of the infructescence. 3 A person walking through a population of plants resulted in the diaspores being dispersed three times further (19 cm) than where dispersal was primarily by wind. The diaspores were also moved disproportionately in the direction of the disturbance. 4 A transient seed bank occurs over the summer months but all of the seeds that are viable germinate in the year that they are produced; there is no bank of persistent seed. Mortality was high during the emergence of seedlings before the radicles had extended more than 2 mm. Establishment was higher if the seeds were buried and it is argued that the morphology of diaspores is as critical in promoting the establishment of seedlings as in promoting dispersal. 5 The dispersal and fates the seeds of V ciliata are compared with those of the closely related V. fasciculata which produces fewer but heavier seeds. The mean distance of dispersal for the two species in the absence of active disturbance was very similar, although for a given height of infructescence the diaspores of V. ciliata were dispersed less far then those of V. fasciculata. Both species possess only a transient seed bank which can be related to the open but seasonally predictable habitats in which they are found. The proportion of seeds and seedlings dying was however much greater in V ciliata. This greater mortality can be related to the higher seed production of this species in a persistent and relatively stable population. The establishment of the seedlings of both species is increased if the seeds are buried vertically.

POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF SOWN SPECIES IN DEVELOPING PASTURES	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS					Workshop on Tropical Pasture Establishment	JUN, 1992	BRIAN PASTURES RES STN, GAYNDAH, AUSTRALIA	MEAT RES CORP	BRIAN PASTURES RES STN			The persistence of introduced species in pastures depends on the survival of plants from the original sowing, and the recruitment of new plants to maintain or increase population size. Recruitment can be by vegetative expansion but in many species it is by seedlings. The population dynamics of 4 legume species (Stylosanthes hamata, S. scabra, Macroptilium atropurpureum and Cassia rotundifolia) are outlined, and the importance of seed production and soil seed banks for persistence of these species is highlighted. The effects of management (grazing, fertiliser, fire, pests and diseases) on survival, soil seed levels and recruitment are outlined, and examples are given of how these effects are reflected in changes in pasture composition. Some management guidelines based on the understanding derived from these demographic studies are presented. Most paddocks are not uniform, and the influence of variation across landscapes on the development and dynamics of pastures is also considered. Recruitment and mortality vary across landscapes with management and seasonal conditions. Examples are presented of success and failure in different parts of a paddock, and of temporary loss of a species at the quadrat level but survival at the paddock scale.

J	MCEVOY, PB; RUDD, NT				MCEVOY, PB; RUDD, NT			EFFECTS OF VEGETATION DISTURBANCES ON INSECT BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL OF TANSY RAGWORT, SENECIO-JACOBAEA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Our study had two major objectives: (1) to clarify the roles of buried seed and different types oflocalized disturbance in activating outbreaks of a pasture weed (tansy ragwort, Senecio jacobaea), and (2) to measure the effectiveness of two natural enemies (the cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae and a ragwort flea beetle, Longitarsus jacobaeae) in inhibiting weed population increase and spread. We conducted a 5-yr field experiment on the coast of Oregon using a randomized-block design with four blocks x three levels of disturbance (background vegetation was Tilled, Clipped, Unaltered) x two levels of cinnabar moth (Exposed, Protected) x two levels of flea beetle (Exposed, Protected) = 48 plots (each plot was 0.25 m(2)). Disturbance consistently increased ragwort abundance (measured as density of juveniles, adults, and their offspring; cover; and biomass); the effect was generally greater in Tilled compared to Clipped disturbance treatments. We also found striking differences in the contribution of each natural enemy to ragwort control. The flea beetle quickly reduced ragwort survival, and this led to a strong and rapid reduction in ragwort abundance. The cinnabar moth reduced ragwort fecundity, but this did not translate into reductions in ragwort cover (measured in 1986 and 1987) or biomass (measured annually from 1986 through 1990). These results establish that (1) ragwort populations were limited more by availability of microsites for germination and establishment than by availability of seed, (2) the ragwort flea beetle was the key factor regulating ragwort abundance, and (3) reduction in ragwort fecundity by the cinnabar moth had little effect on the dynamics of ragwort populations on local scales of space and time. These findings underscore the value of field experiments for investigating the dynamics of biological control systems, the manner in which they are regulated, and their response to perturbation. They further establish how colonization and invasion by ragwort depend on attributes of the disturbance and of natural enemy regimes.																	1051-0761					NOV	1993	3	4					682	698		10.2307/1942100							WOS:A1993MF07000028	27759300

During subsequent cultivation with rainfed rice all resprouting plants were registered in permanent plots (72 m2). The fields studied (one per forest) covered all combinations of forest type and soil usually cultivated on local farms. Forest plots (total 409 specics) and field plots (358 species) had 226 species in common. Most resprouting plants were woody. Though nine forests in the sample were secondary, 70% of resprouting plants belonged to primary forest species and with three exceptions, these species did not regenerate by seed. Experiments in one field inlcuded: different intensities of initial burning, weeding (none, once, twice) and length of the rice cultivation period (1, 2, 3 y). Resprouting plants were monitored in permanent plots (108 m2 ) during 3 y of cultivation and 2 y of fallow. More plants resprouted after a mild initial burning (5.8 plants m-2) than after a burn of normal intensity (1.4 plants m-2). Weeding and prolonged cultivation strongly reduced species diversity but plant densities were less affected because some climbers and trees were apparently stimulated and expanded. Fields abandoned after one rice harvest had, within six months, a closed forest canopy of pioneer trees emerging from the pre-existing seed bank and from the growth of resprouting trees. Prolonged cultivation (3 y) destroyed the pre-existing seed bank but affected sprouting plants less, these being the only component in the vegetation able to shade out weeds and forbs such as Chromolaena odorata.

There were more germinable seeds in the soil during the monsoon season. Regeneration was activated after canopy gap formation and thus a decline in the soil seed density in 1-year-old gaps was recorded. However, soil seed density increased with gap age. Differences were found between primary, late secondary and early secondary categories of species with respect to their soil seed bank. There were more seeds of primary species in the soil of natural gaps than in selection felled ones, while the seeds of early secondary shrubs and herbs were more in the soil of selection felled gaps than in natural gaps. The soil seed banks of the primary forest species, being transient, are not an important conservation tool for these species.																	0266-4674					NOV	1993	9		4				455	467		10.1017/S0266467400007525							WOS:A1993MM52300004

The three most abundant taxa were Pohlia nutans, Sphagnum spp. and Polytrichum commune/longisetum. Initially, the number of species from the diaspore bank in mineral soil, 9.9 species/sample, was higher than that in humus, 6.6. Four years after the disturbance took place, the reverse was found. Several species that are typical colonisers of disturbed soil were very common in the diaspore bank. By contrast, some of the most abundant forest floor species appeared to be absent. The diaspore bank of bryophytes appears to play a role similar to that of the seed bank in vascular plants: (1) it allows species to survive unfavourable periods (temporal dispersal); (2) it facilitates rapid colonisation after disturbance; (3) it influences the post-disturbance species composition and diversity. The results emphasise that the understanding of vegetation succession patterns is, to a large extent, dependent on quantitative data on the relative importance of spatial and temporal dispersal.																	1100-9233					NOV	1993	4	6					819	826		10.2307/3235620							WOS:A1993MM74700014						
J	BOYD, RS; BARBOUR, MG				BOYD, RS; BARBOUR, MG			REPLACEMENT OF CAKILE-EDENTULA BY C-MARITIMA IN THE STRAND HABITAT OF CALIFORNIA	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												We conducted field experiments on two naturalized species of searockets (Cakile: Brassicaceae) to discover why C. maritima has replaced C. edentula throughout most of coastal California but not in Oregon and Washington. Both species had a seed bank which persisted at least 2 yr in foredune sand. No significant interference between species was detected in foredune or open beach habitats. In the foredune, a manipulative experiment showed no influence of insect herbivory on survivorship, whereas rodent herbivory did have a significant impact (but this impact was similar for both Cakile species). Both species grew best in the open beach habitat, where reproductive output per plant of the two was similar. In the foredune, C. maritima had higher survivorship than C. edentula, with many more individuals surviving into a 2nd reproductive season resulting in at least an 18-fold difference in seed output in that habitat. We concluded that the advantage of C. maritima over C. edentula lay in its ability to better-tolerate foredune environmental conditions and survive into a 2nd or 3rd reproductive season. Species coexistence at more northerly latitudes is probably facilitated by a strictly annual habit forced upon both species by more severe winter conditions.																	0003-0031					OCT	1993	130	2					209	228		10.2307/2426122							WOS:A1993ME26400001

J	NEILL, C				NEILL, C			SEASONAL FLOODING, SOIL-SALINITY AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN NORTHERN PRAIRIE MARSHES	OECOLOGIA												Hydrologic regime is an important control of primary production in wetland ecosystems. I investigated the coupling of flooding, soil salinity and plant production in northern prairie marshes that experience shallow spring flooding. Field experiments compared whitetop (Scolochloa festucacea) marsh that was: (1) nonflooded, (2) flooded during spring with 25 cm water and (3) nonflooded but irrigated with 1 cm water.day-1. Pot culture experiments examined whitetop growth response to salinity treatments. The electrical conductivity of soil interstitial water (EC(e)) at 15 cm depth was 4 to 8 dS.m-1 lower in flooded marsh compared with nonflooded marsh during 2 years. Whitetop aboveground biomass in flooded marsh (937 g.m-2, year 1; 969 g.M-2, year 2) exceeded that of nonflooded marsh (117 g . M-2 year 1; 475 g.m-2, year 2). Irrigated plots had lower EC(e) and higher above ground biomass than nonflooded marsh. In pot culture, EC(e) of 4.3 dS.m-1 (3g.L-1 NaCl) reduced total whitetop biomass by 29 to 44% and EC(e) of 21.6 dS.m-1 (15 g.L-1 NaCl) reduced biomass by more than 75%. Large reductions of EC(e) and increases of whitetop growth with irrigation indicated that plants responded to changes in soil salinity and not other potential environmental changes caused by inundation. The results suggest that spring flooding controls whitetop production by decreasing soil salinity during spring and by buffering surface soils against large increases of soil salinity after mid-summer water level declines. This mechanism can explain higher marsh plant production under more reducing flooded soil conditions and may be an important link between intermittent flooding and primary production in other wetland ecosystems.																	0029-8549					OCT	1993	95	4					499	505		10.1007/BF00317434							WOS:A1993MB23600008	28313290

Benth. was developed for a millet cropping system in Mali. The potential of Smicronyx umbrinus Hustache as a biocontrol agent of S. hermonthica was investigated. The method showed that Sm. umbrinus, used as the sole control agent, would have to destroy approximately 95% of S. hermonthica seeds each year to reduce the emerged plant density by 50%. Such a high rate of seed destruction would be necessary because the S. hermonthica seed bank does not limit the parasite density in most situations. Crop rotation of 1 year of millet followed by 3 years of fallow or another crop reduces the emerged equilibrium density of S. hermonthica to 61% of that with no control, and destruction of an additional 22% of seeds by Sm. umbrinus would decrease this to 50%. Sm. umbrinus in conjunction with weeding docs not become effective until the seed bank is limiting at very high levels of weeding.																	0261-2194					SEP	1993	12	6					470	476		10.1016/0261-2194(93)90010-G							WOS:A1993LR67800010						
J	LEVEY, DJ; BYRNE, MM				LEVEY, DJ; BYRNE, MM			COMPLEX ANT PLANT INTERACTIONS - RAIN-FOREST ANTS AS SECONDARY DISPERSERS AND POSTDISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS	ECOLOGY												We describe the role of leaf-litter ants (Pheidole spp.) in the seed bank dynamics of several small-seeded shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest. These ants harvest seeds from frugivore feces and cache them in their nests in partially decomposed twigs. Most harvested seeds are eaten but some are placed in viable condition on refuse piles. From 24 to 38% of the colonies (depending on ant species) contain cached seeds and 25-32% have seeds on refuse piles. Experiments with captive colonies of Pheidole nebulosa and P. nigricula demonstrated that almost-equal-to 6% of harvested Miconia nervosa and M. centrodesma seeds are deposited on refuse piles. Because seeds generally retain viability longer than the nest twig remains intact, harvested seeds are not trapped inside twigs. Experimental plantings of 4-d-old Miconia nervosa seedlings on two types of substrate (ant refuse pile vs. topsoil) under two light levels (equivalent to small and large clearings) demonstrated that seedlings grew faster and survived better on refuse piles under light levels typical of small clearings. Light levels typical of large gaps are not necessarily advantageous for establishment of understory rain forest plants. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of a tropical soil seed bank and the complexity of plant-animal interactions that occur there. Ants are simultaneously antagonistic and mutualistic towards seeds, killing most but significantly benefiting some. This interaction is extremely common (Pheidole density > 300 individuals/m2) and likely influences plant recruitment patterns. Our results challenge the generalizations that small seeds are largely protected from predation because of their size, that post-dispersal seed harvesting is equivalent to seed predation, that competition among seedlings from a frugivore defecation is common, and that small seeds accumulate over long periods of time in the seed bank. We hypothesize that differential harvesting and treatment of seeds by ant species may be a mechanism underlying community-level patterns of regeneration in small-seeded plants. Also, the incidental benefits to uneaten seeds deposited on refuse piles provide additional evidence that myrmecochory evolved in plants that strengthened rare but consistent benefits of being harvested by ''granivorous'' ants.																	0012-9658					SEP	1993	74	6					1802	1812		10.2307/1939938							WOS:A1993LV24200020						
J	ZAMMIT, CA; ZEDLER, PH				ZAMMIT, CA; ZEDLER, PH			SIZE STRUCTURE AND SEED PRODUCTION IN EVEN-AGED POPULATIONS OF CEANOTHUS-GREGGII IN MIXED CHAPARRAL	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The obligate-seeding chaparral shrub Ceanothus greggii is killed by fire and so depends entirely on seeds for persistence. We report on a 5-year study of changes in population structure and seed production from even-aged cohorts in matched north and south-facing mixed chaparral last burned 6 (1977), 13 (1970), 32 (1951), 57 (1926) and 82 (1901) years before 1983. 2 The density and proportion of live C. greggii shrubs declined significantly over the age sequence. We estimate that C. greggii shrubs will die out locally in chaparral unburned for 85-155 years. Analysis of changes in skewness (g) in size distributions among even-aged cohorts did not reveal a consistent increase followed by a decrease with age, as predicted by theory. 3 Topographic aspect influenced shrub size, the rate of shrub growth and pattern of seed production: shrubs on north-facing slopes grew larger than equal-aged shrubs on south-facing slopes. Evidence from ecophysiological studies suggests that the availability of soil moisture contributes to population differences in C. greggii on north and south slopes. 4 Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that mean seed production per shrub over 5 years was significantly influenced by the interaction between shrub age and aspect, which was also the case in most survey years. However, there was no significant relationship between mean annual seed production and shrub age. Seed production did not decline with shrub age. Multiple linear regression indicated that shrub height was the major determinant of seed production. 5 C. greggii shrubs reached sexual maturity 6-8 years after fire and the rate of seed production with height was maximized within two decades of fire, which was also the period of greatest height growth. Seed set was positively correlated between years among smaller shrubs (high-high or low-low) and negatively correlated among larger individuals (high-low or vice versa), suggesting that plant size influences allocation between vegetative and reproductive effort. 6 This study of C. greggii extends our knowledge of the obligate-seeding life history in several directions. First we find no consistent relationship between shrub age and seed production, and therefore no evidence of a decline in individual fecundity with age (senescence). Secondly, shrub size is the primary determinant of seed production, and size variation in each even-aged population precludes any simple age-fecundity relationship. Thirdly, we interpret the early age of sexual maturity and the rapid rate at which plant height and seed production is maximized, coupled with sustained levels of seed set over 86 years since fire as a plausible outcome of selection by fires that have occurred with unpredictable frequency.																	0022-0477					SEP	1993	81	3					499	511		10.2307/2261528							WOS:A1993LW84300011

In the simulations we varied the frequency of demographically good and bad years and the autocorrelation between conditions in consecutive years to examine the impact of seed dormancy on population growth rate, extinction rate and time to extinction. The existence of a seed bank enhanced population growth rates under all environmental regimes except when good years were very frequent, but this enhancement was minimal. In addition, the presence of the seed bank decreased the likelihood of extinctions and increased the time to extinction. The time to extinction was longest when the environmental conditions were most unpredictable.																	0029-8549					SEP	1993	95	3					314	320		10.1007/BF00320982							WOS:A1993LY33400002	28314004					
J	WARR, SJ; THOMPSON, K; KENT, M				WARR, SJ; THOMPSON, K; KENT, M			SEED BANKS AS A NEGLECTED AREA OF BIOGEOGRAPHIC RESEARCH - A REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUES	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The article highlights a comparatively neglected area of biogeographical research - seed banks and the distribution of seeds in the soil. The article reviews some of the relevant literature on seed banks and the methods for their study. Attention is focused on aspects of seed banks of particular relevance to biogeographers, with detailed examples drawn from seed bank studies in both temperate and tropical environments. In the review of the seed bank literature, the topics covered include the seed banks of successional communities and the size of seed banks in different vegetation types. The species composition of seed banks in different plant communities is discussed, particularly the degree of correlation between the species composition of seed banks and associated ground flora. The relationships between seed persistence, depth of burial in the soil and soil properties, such as moisture and pH, are explored. Seed bank heterogeneity is examined and a number of studies which have attempted to describe and measure the spatial variability of seed banks are summarized. Ways of classifying seed banks in terms of seed bank strategies are explained. The role of seed banks in conservation is discussed, for example in restoration projects, where preferred species have been lost from the vegetation but survive in the seed bank. The relevance of seed banks for the conservation of rare species and in landscape management is considered. Lastly, the contribution of seed banks to the recovery of vegetation following disturbance in various plant communities is discussed. In the review of seed bank sampling techniques, the subjects considered include methods of sample collection, the sampling intensity required for reliable estimates of seed density, a consideration of the relative merits of random and systematic sample distribution, as well as the importance of the timing of sampling. Various methods for the estimation of seed numbers in samples are appraised; these either involve extraction of seeds from the soil, followed by seed identification or enumeration by germination and seedling identification. Problems of analysing seed bank data are considered and several useful techniques for data analysis are suggested. Finally, the article draws attention to areas of future seed bank research for biogeographers and plant ecologists.																	0309-1333					SEP	1993	17	3					329	347		10.1177/030913339301700303							WOS:A1993LZ21100003						
J	DIEMER, M; PROCK, S				DIEMER, M; PROCK, S			ESTIMATES OF ALPINE SEED BANK SIZE IN 2 CENTRAL-EUROPEAN AND ONE SCANDINAVIAN SUB-ARCTIC PLANT-COMMUNITIES	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Seed bank sizes of two alpine plant communities in the Central Alps with differing substrates and of one subarctic alpine site were estimated on the basis of the emergence of seedlings. Estimates of seed bank size to 5 cm depth were 1350 +/- 177 and 1521 +/- 236 seedlings m-2 for the Austrian alpine communities on silicaceous and calcareous substrates, respectively. Diaspores of 27 to 45% of all the species present in the communities germinated from a total of 50 soil samples. All seed bank taxa were present in the existing vegetation, as well. The overall relative frequency of established taxa in a given community is a weak predictor for the abundance in the seed bank. Seedling density also is not related to the extent of vegetative cover at the sampling location. Emergence of diaspores from the Swedish subarctic alpine site amounted to merely 37 +/- 19 seedlings m-2, suggesting that seed bank size is low or germination requirements of subarctic/alpine taxa are inherently different, compared to temperate alpine species.																	0004-0851					AUG	1993	25	3					194	200		10.2307/1551813							WOS:A1993LU32400005						
J	WILLIAMSLINERA, G				WILLIAMSLINERA, G			SOIL SEED BANKS IN 4 LOWER MONTANE FORESTS OF MEXICO	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks from four Mexican lower montane forests were studied. These forests are in the transition zone between neartic and Neotropical floristic regions. Soil seed bank characteristics were biased toward the dominant - temperate or tropical - phytogeographical affinity. The northern site (El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas) had the lowest seed density, 720 seeds m-2. The eastern (Rancho La Mesa, Veracruz), western (Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve, Jalisco) and southern (El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas) sites all had much higher seed densities (2291, 2901, and 2341 seeds m-2, respectively). Germinated tropical species seeds were more abundant than temperate species seeds at all four sites, and were higher for southern and intermediate sites when compared with the northern site. On the basis of family, El Cielo appears to be different. The tropical family Melastomataceae was absent from this northern site, whereas it represented >30% of total germinated seeds at the other three sites. Trees were the most abundant life form at the southern site but were particularly poorly represented in the eastern and northern sites. Herbs were very abundant in the eastern, western and northern sites but were poorly represented in the seed bank of the southern site. The four seed banks differ between themselves and resemble seed banks of neither temperate deciduous nor tropical forests. In some ways they are unique, at least with respect to floristic composition, seed density, and life form representation.

We studied post-burn Carpobrotus establishment in chaparral that lacked Carpobrotus plants before the fire and compared seedbank and field populations in adjacent burned and unburned stands. Carpobrotus seeds were abundant in deer scat and in the soil before burning. Burning did not enhance germination: many seeds were apparently killed by fire and seed bank cores taken after fire revealed no germinable seeds. Laboratory tests showed that temperatures over 105-degrees-C for five minutes killed Carpobrotus seeds. In a field experiment involving use of herbivore exclosures, we found that herbivory was an important source of mortality for seedlings in both burned and unburned chaparral. All seedlings, however, died outside of the burn regardless of the presence of cages. Establishment there is apparently limited by factors affecting plant physiology. In the burned area, seedlings that escaped herbivory grew very rapidly. Overall, it appears that herbivory limited seedling establishment in both burned and unburned sites but that the post-burn soil environment supported Carpobrotus growth in excess of herbivore use, thus promoting establishment.																	0029-8549					AUG	1993	95	1					14	21		10.1007/BF00649501							WOS:A1993LR54100003	28313306

The 0. crenata seed bank increased every year in the 20-cm depth arable layer until it reached approximately 4 million (M) seeds m-2. Seed viability ranged between 53% and 68%, approximately half of the seeds remaining dormant. About 3x10(-3)% of the seed bank became attached to the root system of the faba beans. Only 9% of the attached broomrapes developed and emerged from the soil, possibly reflecting high levels of intraspecific competition. Maximum broomrape seed production for a population of 53 emerged broomrapes per m2 was approximately 4 M seeds m-2. About 43% of the seeds produced were not incorporated into the soil, most probably as a result of their degradation, decomposition or dispersion.																	0043-1737					AUG	1993	33	4					319	327		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1993.tb01947.x							WOS:A1993LN87800005						
J	PANETTA, FD; RANDALL, RP				PANETTA, FD; RANDALL, RP			HERBICIDE PERFORMANCE AND THE CONTROL OF EMEX-AUSTRALIS IN AN ANNUAL PASTURE	WEED RESEARCH												Herbicides were applied annually for 3 years to a pasture population of Emex australis Steinh. Herbicide performance was highly variable. with significant effects on weed survival only in single seasons. In most cases, seed bank densities declined monotonically from an initial level of 1900 m-2. Seed banks decreased after seasons when E. australis contributed less than 25% to pasture dry matter. The annual decay rate of the seed bank was estimated to be 70%. Owing to the unreliability of the herbicides when applied at rates low enough to protect pasture legumes, the potential for tactical chemical control of E. australis is limited. Furthermore, it is argued that the potential for strategic chemical control is low, since the species can tolerate periods of population decline. E. australis could be managed more effectively by maintaining high densities of annual grasses and legumes, against which it is a poor competitor.																	0043-1737					AUG	1993	33	4					345	353		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1993.tb01950.x							WOS:A1993LN87800008						
J	LEE, PC				LEE, PC			THE EFFECT OF SEED DISPERSAL LIMITATIONS ON THE SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF A GAP SPECIES, SEASIDE GOLDENROD (SOLIDAGO-SEMPERVIRENS)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												This study examined the seed ecology of seaside goldenrod, Solidago sempervirens L., a gap species, on coastal dunes dominated by American beachgrass, Ammophila breviligulata. A test was done to determine whether lower densities of S. sempervirens on undisturbed primary dune grasslands were due to limited seed dispersal or barriers to seedling establishment. Seed rain was greater within blowouts arid transition areas than in immature and mature grasslands. Blowouts and transition areas produced prominent seed shadows and served as primary seed sources. Both seed shadow measurements and inflorescence removal experiments suggested that the majority of seeds fell to the ground within 10 m outside blowouts. Experiments involving the hand broadcasting of seeds increased densities of seedlings in undisturbed areas. Plots with hand-drilled seeds showed no differences in percent emergence between transition and undisturbed areas; however, both were significantly greater than blowouts. Persistent seed storage in the soil was probably negligible. Seed bank densities at 5 m depth did not accurately reflect temporal or spatial patterns of seed rain. Often very low densities or no seeds were found in collected samples within an area. Furthermore, emergence percentages of field-buried seeds showed a significant drop-off after a single year. Thus, this study concluded that lower densities of plants in undisturbed areas were, in part, due to lack of seed dispersal from blowouts.																	0008-4026					JUL	1993	71	7					978	984		10.1139/b93-111							WOS:A1993LW65900011						
J	POIANI, KA; JOHNSON, WC				POIANI, KA; JOHNSON, WC			POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE-CHANGE ON A SEMI-PERMANENT PRAIRIE WETLAND	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We assessed the potential effects of a greenhouse gas-induced global climate change on the hydrology and vegetation of a semi-permanent prairie wetland using a spatially-defined, rule-based simulation model. An 11-yr simulation was run using current versus enhanced greenhouse gas climates. Projections of climatic change were from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model. Simulations were also run using a range of temperature (+2 and +4-degrees-C) and precipitation change values (-20, -10, 0, +10, +20%) to determine the responsiveness of wetland vegetation and hydrology to a variety of climate scenarios. Maximum water depths were significantly less under the enhanced greenhouse gas scenario than under the current climate. The wetland dried in most years with increased temperature and changes in precipitation. Simulations also revealed a significant change in the vegetation, from a nearly balanced emergent cover to open water ratio to a completely closed basin with no open water areas. Simulations over a range of climate change scenarios showed that precipitation changes (particularly increases) had a greater impact on water levels and cover ratios when the temperature increase was moderate (+2-degrees-C). These potential changes in wetland hydrology and vegetation could result in a dramatic decline in the quality of habitat for breeding birds, particularly water-fowl. Continued research on climate and wetland modeling is needed.																	0165-0009					JUL	1993	24	3					213	232		10.1007/BF01091830							WOS:A1993LT29900004

The diaspore contains a food mass attractive to ants and, at sites where the ant Rhytidoponera sp B is common, thousands of diaspores accumulate on the nest mounds. Bagged plants set seed, showing that it is self-compatible. Population genetic variation was investigated at two levels: within and between sites, and within and between seed banks accumulated on the ant nests. Electrophoretic analysis of adult plants for 17 loci at 12 sites revealed nine polymorphic loci, but within sites only 6-18% of the loci were polymorphic. The values for mean gene diversity (He=0.042) and total genetic diversity, (H(T)=0.088) were lower than those recorded for most other plant species. The mean fixation index of 0.52 indicated a mixed mating system with about 70% selfing. Most of the genetic diversity was distributed within sites (Dst=0.008) and the mean value of 0.094 for G(ST) indicated low levels of genetic differentiation. Electrophoretic analysis of seeds from 12 ant mounds at two sites showed that genetic differentiation was three times greater between seed banks than between the sites. However, collectively the genetic diversity stored within ant mounds was similar to the total diversity within the sites. It appears that restricted ant-dispersal and moderate inbreeding may create a local population structure that is undetected when sampling at a larger scale. Since investigations of genetic patterns on a very local scale are just beginning, there is much to learn about the evolutionary and genetic consequences of different seed flow patterns.

All seed-bank seeds, seedlings, and adults of P. lanceolata within eight subunits in a larger population were mapped, subjected to starch gel electrophoresis, and allozyme analysis in 1988. Gel electrophoresis was also used to estimate the mating system in two years, 1986 and 1988. The spatial distributions of seeds, seedlings, and adults were highly coincident. Allele frequencies of the dormant seeds differed significantly from those of the adults for four of the five polymorphic loci. In addition, a comparison of the genotype frequencies of the three life-history stages indicated that the seed bank had an excess of homozygotes. Homozygosity, relative to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, decreased during the life cycle (for seed bank, seedlings, and adults respectively: F(it) = 0.19, 0.09, 0.01; F(is) = 0.14, 0.04, -0.12). Spatial genetic differentiation increased sixfold during the life cycle: (for seed bank, seedling and adults: F(st) = 0.02, 0.05, 0.12). The apparent selfing rate was 0.01 in 1986 and 0.09 in 1988. These selfing rates are not large enough to account for the elevated homozygosity of the seed bank. Inbreeding depression, overdominance for fitness, and a ''temporal Wahlund's effect'' are discussed as possible mechanisms that could generate high homozygosity in the seed bank, relative to later life-history stages. In Plantago lanceolata, the influence of the mating system and the ''genetic memory'' of the seed bank are obscured by the time plants reach the reproductive stage.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				JUN	1993	47	3					833	843		10.2307/2410187							WOS:A1993MA41600010	28567912					
J	HILLIGARDT, M				HILLIGARDT, M			STRATEGIES OF PERSISTANCE AND REPRODUCTION IN TRIFOLIUM-PALLESCENS SCHREB AND TRIFOLIUM-THALII VILL .2. STUDIES IN POPULATION BIOLOGY	FLORA												Population studies of two closely related alpine Trifolium species were made. The species prefer distinct habitats and reproduce only by seeds: Trifolium pallescens grows on alpine screes, often in morainic areas; Trifolium thalii is predominantly found in subalpine-alpine pastures. This contrast in habitat behaviour was compared with the behaviour of the species along their altitudinal distribution. Comparison of reproductive behaviour of the two species investigated shows distinct habitat-controlled differences: Trifolium thalii, a plant of more competitor-influenced habitats, has patterns of a K-strategist. Trifolium pallescens, in contrast, shows characteristics of an invasive pioneer species such as less developed vegetative structures, higher seed production, higher seed-bank reserves, smaller seeds and higher rates of seedling mortality (r-selected). The different strategies have decisive influence on the altitudinal distribution of the species. The upper altitudinal limit of distribution of the two species is not primarily attributed to smaller chances of seedling establishment, but to decreasing seed production with increasing altitude. For both species the lower altitudinal limit obviously is determined by habitat preferences: for Trifolium pallescens increasing seedling mortality, caused by increase parching of soils during the growing season with decreasing altitude, is the limiting factor. For Trifolium thalii the role of more competitive species, especially Trifolium repens, a plant of pasture communities of the lowlands, is discussed. Studies in reproduction behaviour and growth forms of alpine species supply basic data for the choice of suitable native species for the revegetation of alpine localities, depleted of vegetation by human influence. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the suitability of these species for high altitude revegetation. The importance of seed banks for revegetation is emphasized.																	0367-2530					JUN	1993	188	2					175	195									WOS:A1993LM01900002

The relationship of the seed bank to the vegetation of a freshwater marsh was studied along gradients of water depth and soil organic matter content. Characters examined included standing crop, seedling density, and species composition, distribution and richness. 2. The seed bank differed from the vegetation in that only nine of twenty-seven species were present in both, abundant seed-bank species were uncommon as adults, and adults showed different distributions along a gradient of soil organic matter content whereas their seeds were most abundant in soils with high organic matter. 3. The seed bank resembled the vegetation in that separate multivariate analyses of the communities revealed that variation in the species composition of each was significantly correlated with water depth and soil organic matter content. Further, species richness in both communities decreased with water depth and increased with soil organic matter content. Lastly, the standing crop of the vegetation and the number of seedlings both decreased with water depth and increased with soil organic matter. 4. Consideration of spatial patterns and environmental gradients revealed more similarities between vegetation and seed banks than were obtained by comparing species lists. The results suggest that artificial stimulation of seed bank germination for management purposes will not produce vegetation changes as large as those suggested by differences in species lists.

Seeds of Scirpus lacustris and Phragmites australis were germinated in early June, and twenty-four seedlings of each species were subsequently exposed to submerged conditions (eight seedlings at each of the water depths 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 m), in outdoor 500-l tanks in southern Sweden. Weight and shoot length of the plants were measured in September. 2. The Phragmites seedlings did not show any significant growth when submerged. The Scirpus seedlings, however, developed submerged leaves and exhibited considerable submerged growth. One Scirpus plant, in shallow water (0.2 m), had developed an aerial shoot by September. Shoot length of the remaining (submerged) Scirpus plants was positively related to plant weight within water depth treatments, and was higher, in relation to plant weight, in deeper water. Mean weight in September of the submerged Scirpus plants decreased with increased water depth. 3. In south Swedish lakes with a lowered water table, Scirpus often occupies large areas on the lakeward side of the reed belt, which is generally dominated by Phragmites. The differences between the two species, in performance of submerged seedlings, suggest that this zonation may be created through successful submerged seedling establishment of Scirpus on the lakeward side of Phragmites.

The submerged macrophyte communities were submitted to five different salinity levels (0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 g/l Cl-). In a companion paper (Grillas, van Wijck & Bonis 1993) three groups of species were distinguished on the basis of their biomass production over the salinity range 0 to 6 g/l Cl-: (1) glycophytes (non-salt-tolerant species), (2) salt-tolerant species and (3) halophytes. This part of the study describes the impact of salinity on the reproduction of the individual species during the two experiments. The species differ in their capacity to reproduce in the autumn; only Zannichellia pedunculata and Tolypella hispanica were able to produce fruits in that season. For all species reproduction was greater in spring and strongly correlated with biomass, except for Chara canescens. Differences in reproductive effort over the salinity range amplified the halophytic nature of Ruppia maritima and Chara canescens and the intolerance of Callitriche truncata and Chara contraria. For the other species, reproductive effort did not differ significantly over the salinity range. Regarding the effect of salinity on biomass and reproductive effort of individual species, there were large differences in the total weight of propagules produced at the community level and in the relative contribution of individual species. The resulting quantitative changes in the species composition of the seed bank could affect the structure of the communities by their effects on the establishment and survival of species populations.																	1100-9233					JUN	1993	4	4					461	468		10.2307/3236073							WOS:A1993LQ49100003

Percentage annual plant cover was significantly positively correlated to percentage similarity value between vegetation and seed bank.

J	FIRBANK, LG				FIRBANK, LG			SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY OF PLANT-POPULATIONS WITHIN A REGULARLY DISTURBED HABITAT	OECOLOGIA												The changing populations of weeds during 13 years of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment were analysed to investigate the extent of differences in short-term variability of cover between species. The data were from two sections of the experiment where winter wheat was grown continuously under herbicide treatment for 13 and 6 years respectively. Logistic regressions were fitted to the data. Equisetum arvense showed significant long-term increases on both sections; long-term trends were also detected in the longer data run for Agrostis stolonifera, Cirsium arvensa, Poa trivialis, Ranunculus arvensis and Vicia sativa, and for Medicago lupulina on the shorter data run. Variation around long-term trends was low in the case of Equisetum, and, in the longer data run, for Cirsium and Tussilago farfara, and high for Poa spp. and Vicia. Cover values on the two sections were positively correlated for Alopecurus myosuroides, Equisetum, Poa annua and Tripleurospermum inodorum. There was a weak correlation between C-S-R strategy and short-term variability; the more competitive species displayed less variability than the ruderal species. Furthermore, species regenerating from persistent seed banks were more variable in the short term than those regenerating from short-lived seed or bud banks. This can be explained by differences in response to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, those species with:persistent seed banks being typically more sensitive to annual fluctuations in the environment than those without.

Perennial shrubs like Suaeda fruticosa, Haloxylon recurvum, Cressa cretica and Salsola baryosma dominated the six communities studied. Communities also showed very low species diversity. The seed bank was represented by a large number of species as compared to the species present in the vegetation, indicating a poor relationship between seed bank and vegetation. S. fruticosa maintains a persistent seed bank thereby dominating the seed bank flora of almost all communities irrespective of the dominant species. All other perennial halophytic species studied showed a transient nature of the seed bank. Monthly seed bank data was collected for 2 halophytic species for 12 months. Presence of H. recurvum, S. fruticosa and C cretica was higher in the seed bank after seed dispersal and except for S. fruticosa seeds, the number of all other species declined substantially in the soil.

Siratro) and shrubby stylo (Stylosanthes scabra cv. Fitzroy) were monitored in 2 experiments over 9 years on 2 soil types in subcoastal, subtropical Queensland. Experiment 1 examined the effects of 2 stocking rates (0.8 and 1.2 steers/ha) and annual rates of P application, ranging from 0-15 kg/ha P, on Siratro. Experiment 2 compared the response of Siratro. and Fitzroy to a restricted range of P and S treatments. Phosphorus application increased the yield of both legumes, but had only a negligible effect on the survival of the original plants. However, P application to Siratro resulted in the soil seed bank of the treatment receiving 15 kg/ha P (P15) being some 5 times higher than in the treatment receiving no P (P0). This in turn led to more recruitment of Siratro in the P-fertilised plots and a 3-fold higher plant density in the P15 treatment compared with the PO treatment at the end of the experiment. However, the density of Siratro decreased with time as recruitment of new plants did not compensate for death of older plants. The lower than median rainfall may have adversely affected Siratro recruitment. There was very little effect of stocking rate or soil type (red earth or yellow podzolic) on Siratro persistence. Fitzroy density increased with time whereas Siratro density declined. This is attributed to the higher seed set of Fitzroy which lead to reserves of soil seed being more than 100 times those of Siratro after 9 years and to the successful recruitment of stylo plants from seedling strikes. Appreciable quantities of viable seed of Fitzroy were excreted in cattle dung.																	0049-4763					JUN	1993	27	2					65	74									WOS:A1993PA74300001

Many species of ants are attracted to frugivore defecations and remove seeds and/or pulp. Pheidole species selectively remove seeds, fungus-growing species (tribe Attini) remove both pulp and seeds. Seeds of many Melastomataceae have an appendage, which we hypothesized is an elaiosome. Indeed, preference trials demonstrated that two species of Pheidole selected seeds with the appendage over seeds of the same species in which the appendage had been removed. However, we found that these ants did not take the appendage when it was offered by itself. We conclude that the appendage is not an elaiosome. In further trials, different ant species preferentially selected different seed species. These ants consumed some seeds and deposited others unharmed in refuse piles. We conclude that because the composition of leaf-litter ant communities is highly variable between neighboring square meter plots, and the probability of seed predation depends upon the species of ant, the over-all effect of ants on seed shadows and seed banks is spatially unpredictable.																	0042-3106					JUN	1993	108						363	374									WOS:A1993LR39700030

Over 3 100 seedlings/m2 emerged from the greenhouse soil cores; the seed bank was dominated by Juncus species. Few vegetative sprouts emerged. Vegetated microsites produced significantly more emergents than did bare soils, but even bare soils contained abundant seeds. Overall site cover was low and few seedlings occurred on the site. Discrepancies between aboveground and belowground abundance were common. Phyllodoce empetriformis and Luetkea pectinata were abundant in the vegetation and produced many seeds but were poorly represented in the seed bank and as seedlings on the site. Other species were abundant in the seed bank, but rare in the vegetation. Our results indicate that despite the abundance of seeds in bare soil, colonization is likely to be extremely slow.																	0008-4026					MAY	1993	71	5					712	717		10.1139/b93-082							WOS:A1993LN55800008						
J	POIANI, KA; JOHNSON, WC				POIANI, KA; JOHNSON, WC			A SPATIAL SIMULATION-MODEL OF HYDROLOGY AND VEGETATION DYNAMICS IN SEMI-PERMANENT PRAIRIE WETLANDS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The objective of this study was to construct a spatial simulation model of the vegetation dynamics in semi-permanent prairie wetlands. A hydrologic submodel estimated water levels based on precipitation, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration. A vegetation submodel calculated the amount and distribution of emergent cover and open water using a geographic information system. The response of vegetation to water-level changes was based on seed bank composition, seedling recruitment and establishment, and plant survivorship. The model was developed and tested using data from the Cottonwood Lake study site in North Dakota. Data from semi-permanent wetland P1 were used to calibrate the model. Data from a second wetland, P4, were used to evaluate model performance. Simulation results were compared with actual water data from 1979 through 1989. Test results showed that differences between calculated and observed water levels were within 10 cm 75% of the time. Open water over the past decade ranged from 0 to 7% in wetland P4 and from 0 to 8% in submodel simulations. Several model parameters including evapotranspiration and timing of seedling germination could be improved with more complex techniques or relatively minor adjustments. Despite these differences the model adequately represented vegetation dynamics of prairie wetlands and can be used to examine wetland response to natural or human-induced climate change.																	1051-0761					MAY	1993	3	2					279	293		10.2307/1941831							WOS:A1993LG19900013	27759322

The results obtained demonstrate the existence of a dense seed-bank, both in terms of the number of seeds and their biomass, which represented about 10 % (5 % for angiosperms and > 20 % for Charophyta) of the total plant biomass, which ensures the maintenance of the annual submerged macrophyte populations of the seasonally inundated Donana marsh. Seed bank and established vegetation were coupled, as reflected in the existence of significant correlations between their structure and abundance. This coupling was lacking for Charophyta, whose oospores are widespread and abundant across the marsh, even at locations where they are absent, or rare, in the established vegetation. These differences between the seed bank of annual angiosperms and Charophyta appear to reflect, in part, structural differences between angiosperm seeds and Charophyta oospores, with important ecological consequences. An important aspect of these differences is the allocation of Charophyta reproductive effort to many small propagules lacking embryo storage, compared to those of angiosperms, which ensures their efficient dispersal and numerical abundance in the seed bank.

Species richness of the seed bank remained high throughout the annual vegetation cycle, with 61 species in October, 65 species in December, and 54 species in March. The seasonal dynamics of seed bank composition was homogeneous within fields. Parallel seasonal patterns were observed in fields of different successional ages. Seven temporal patterns and four spatial patterns of germination were identified. The seasonal strategies were rather evenly distributed between the fields of different successional ages. The high variety of germinative strategies provides a buffer against the unpredictability of rainfall.																	0030-1299					MAY	1993	67	1					114	128		10.2307/3545102							WOS:A1993KZ77900014						
J	BOWERS, MA				BOWERS, MA			INFLUENCE OF HERBIVOROUS MAMMALS ON AN OLD-FIELD PLANT COMMUNITY - YEARS 1-4 AFTER DISTURBANCE	OIKOS												Plant community composition and change was studied in the presence and absence of different mammalian herbivores over the first four years after a disturbance that returned the field to the seed bank/colonizing stage. Four types of exclosures allowed the differential control of herbivore accessibility: ''control'' plots allowed access to all mammals (i.e., deer, woodchucks, rabbits, and small rodents); ''total exclosure'' plots excluded all mammals; ''large-gate'' plots excluded deer but allowed access to woodchucks, rabbits and small rodents; and ''small-gate'' plots allowed access to only small rodents. Results indicated that plant species richness and diversity/evenness were greater in small- and large-gate exclosures relative to controls or total exclosures. Total cover was less in control plots than in the three types of exclosures. Tests showed the abundance/occurrence of ca. one-half of the plant species varied among the four treatments: some species decreased with increasing herbivore accessibility. others increased, and some reached highest abundance under intermediate levels of herbivore access (i.e., in small or large gate plots). Treatment differences were more pronounced later in the study, and in parts of the field where herbivory was most intense. There was a tendency for Aster pilosus to dominate total exclosure plots and for Celastrus scandens to dominate controls. These results suggest that plant associations experiencing either high or low intensities of herbivory have lower diversities (in terms of both species richness and equitabilities), and different dynamics than plant associations subjected to intermediate levels of herbivory. The main effect of herbivory appears to be in altering competitive hierarchies among the plant community rather than by directly causing plant mortality.																	0030-1299					MAY	1993	67	1					129	141		10.2307/3545103							WOS:A1993KZ77900015						
J	POSCHLOD, P; JACKEL, AK				POSCHLOD, P; JACKEL, AK			THE DYNAMICS OF THE GENERATIVE DIASPORE BANK OF CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND PLANTS .1. SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF DIASPORE RAIN AND DIASPORE BANK IN 2 CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND SITES OF THE SUEBIAN-ALB	FLORA												The seasonal dynamics of diaspore rain (seed rain) and diaspore bank in the soil (seed bank) in two different calcareous grassland sites on the Suebian Alb (South Germany) was investigated. The first site, the ''Dachswiesle'', is mowed once a year in August, the vegetation is a Mesobrometum. The second site, ''Leimberg'', was grazed until quite recently. The vegetation is a Gentiano-Koelerietum. The composition of diaspore rain and diaspore bank represents almost exclusively the actual vegetation on these sites. The number of diaspores present in the soil at both sites in spring was 6000 to 7000/m2. The seasonal dynamics of diaspore rain and bank in the soil and the distribution of the diaspores in upper and lower soil layers allowed die classification of species in the following groups (Fig. 3, Tab. 5): Type 1a: Species with dispersal during the vegetation period; diaspores without innate dormancy and only in the upper soil layer during the vegetation period; persistence: transient (< 1 year); e.g. Briza media, Bromus erectus (Fig. 4). Type 1b: Species with dispersal during vegetation period, diaspores with innate dormancy (broken line; drawn line; e.g.: Polygala amarella, P. comosa a.o.); species with dissemination at the end of the vegetation period or in winter, diaspores without or with innate dormancy (dotted line; e.g.: Carlina vulgaris, Cirsium acaule, Fig. 6; Pimpinella saxifraga, Fig. 7); only in the upper soil layer from the beginning of dispersal until spring; persistence: transient (< 1 year). Type 2a: Species with dispersal during the vegetation period, diaspores without innate dormancy and with few exceptions only in the upper soil layer during the whole year with a maximum in the vegetation period, persistence: transient (1 to 2 years); e.g.: Scabiosa columbaria (Fig. 9). Type 2b: Species with dispersal during the vegetation period, diaspores with innate dormancy (broken line; drawn line; e.g.: Euphrasia rostkoviana); species with dispersal at the end of the vegetation period or in winter, diaspores with or without innate dormancy (dotted line; e.g.: Asperula cynanchica; Fig. 11); with few exceptions only in the upper soil layer during the whole year with a maximum from the beginning of dissemination until spring; persistence: transient (1 to 2 years). Type 3a: Like 2a, but dormancy of diaspores can be enforced by unfavourable environmental factors; high numbers of diaspores in the upper bottom layers compared to the number in lower soil layers; maximum in the upper soil layers during vegetation period; persistence: persistent (some years to some decades); e.g.: Lotus corniculatus (Fig. 12), Ranunculus bulbosus. Type 3b: Like 2b, but dormancy of diaspores can be enforced by unfavourable environmental factors; high numbers of diaspores in the upper soil layers compared to the number in lower soil layers; maximum in the upper bottom layers from the beginning of dispersal until spring; persistence: persistent (some years to some decades); e.g.: Hippocrepis comosa, Plantago media (Fig. 13). Type 4: Species with dissemination during vegetation period or until spring, diaspores with or without innate dormancy, dormancy can be enforced or induced by unfavourable environmental factors; high numbers of diaspores in the lower soil layers with no or hardly any recognizable maximum in the_upper soil layer; persistence: persistent (some decades); e.g.: Carex flacca (Fig. 14, 15), Linum catharticum (Fig. 16), Potentilla neumanniana (Fig. 17). The comparison of populations of the same species on both sites show no great differences in the persistence of the diaspore bank. There are only differences in the timing of the maximum of diaspores in the upper bottom layer during the year, depending on the seasonal dynamics of diaspore rain (Fig. 4, 5, 8, 9, Tab. 4, 5).

J	MCDONALD, AW				MCDONALD, AW			THE ROLE OF SEEDBANK AND SOWN SEEDS IN THE RESTORATION OF AN ENGLISH FLOOD-MEADOW	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												In 1985 an opportunity arose to make use of an area (referred to as Somerford Mead) which had recently been used for intensive grass or cereal production but which originally had been a permanent hay-meadow. Situated on circum- neutral alluvial soils over limestone gravel, it is in close proximity to the River Thames and to species-rich flood meadows, including Oxey Mead (Fig. 1). This paper describes the early stages of an experiment to recreate a 'typical' flood-meadow community using seed harvested from Oxey Mead. Before sowing the seed, soil samples were taken and seedling emergence suggested that little of the original flood-meadow seed bank survived. Although Oxey Mead was known to contain at least 57 species, germination of samples of the sown seed in the glasshouse was confined to 12 species. All except Bromus commutatus and Trisetum flavescens and an additional nine Oxey Mead species were recorded in the field, together with 24 arable weed/ruderal species. Soil-nutrient contents (N, P and K) were high; so the restoration of this flood-meadow using only management techniques (hay cutting at the end of June and aftermath grazing) and the local seed bank would take a longtime. The use of a Alopecurus pratensis-Sanguisorba officinalis seed mixture was justified by the accelerated succession on Somerford Mead towards the parent community.																	1100-9233					APR	1993	4	3					395	400		10.2307/3235598							WOS:A1993LB33300012						
J	DELANGE, JH; BOUCHER, C				DELANGE, JH; BOUCHER, C			AUTECOLOGICAL STUDIES ON AUDOUINIA-CAPITATA (BRUNIACEAE) .4. SEED PRODUCTION, SEED BANKS AND SEEDLING RECRUITMENT	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Audouinia capitata (L.f.) Brongn. has an average annual production of 98 seeds per plant, determined f rom a study on approximately 800 of the 1200 plants in 25 known populations. Most of the buried seeds occurred within a radius of 2 m from the parent, in the top 20 mm of soil. Following exposure to plant-derived smoke, 13% of the fresh seeds and more than 80% of the oldest seeds germinated. Thirty-nine percent of the germinated seeds were unable to emerge from a mere 5 mm soil depth under optimal laboratory conditions. Seventeen to 31 months after a burn, 148 seedlings were recorded in seven populations containing 332 plants, from an estimated total annual production of approximately 40 000 seeds. The natural occurrence of small numbers of seedlings is only partially explained by factors investigated in this study. Seed set in at least 14 of the populations, having less than approximately 10 mature plants each, is probably too low to sustain future population expansions or even to maintain present levels.																	0254-6299					APR	1993	59	2					145	155									WOS:A1993LE89700005						
J	DELANGE, JH; THOMPSON, GR; SWART, CR				DELANGE, JH; THOMPSON, GR; SWART, CR			AUTECOLOGICAL STUDIES ON AUDOUINIA-CAPITATA (BRUNIACEAE) .7. NUTRITIONAL ASPECTS IN THE MATURE SEED	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Lipids and proteins are the major storage compounds present in the starchless endosperm of dormant A. capitata seed. Calcium oxalate crystals are present in protein bodies of the epidermal endosperm, and in the pericarp cells. The globoid inclusions of protein bodies are a major source of P, K, Cl and Mg and the epidermal endosperm crystals, a major source for Ca. No crystalloids are found in the protein bodies. The seeds store N and P. They also contain substantial concentrations of Cu, Zn and Mn. Lower amounts of these elements are present in the pericarp. Nutrients in the pericarp of the indehiscent fruit are probably utilized by the developing seedling. The high N, P and lipid content in the seed, and also the distribution pattern of calcium oxalate crystals in the seed and pericarp, seem to be beneficial evolutionary adaptations. Lipids in seeds from the soil seed bank differ quantitatively from those in fresh seeds. Low densities of protein bodies are found in many seeds resulting in deficiencies of proteins and mineral elements. This may partially explain high incidence of pre-emergent seedling mortality contributing to the rarity of the species.																	0254-6299					APR	1993	59	2					178	187									WOS:A1993LE89700008

J	HARRISON, PG				HARRISON, PG			VARIATIONS IN DEMOGRAPHY OF ZOSTERA-MARINA AND Z-NOLTII ON AN INTERTIDAL GRADIENT	AQUATIC BOTANY												The dynamics of the seeds, seedlings and mature shoots were studied for two seagrass species at seven elevations on an intertidal site in the southwestern Netherlands from the autumn to the following summer. The numbers of viable and dead seeds in the sediment seed bank, emergence from the seed bank, and seedling survival and growth were documented. Zostera noltii Hornem. grew as a perennial, regenerating from overwintering rhizomes. Shoot densities declined rapidly in the autumn to minima (late March) of 18 per 0.25 m2 at the highest elevation, to < 1 at the lowest elevation. Buried seeds had a peak density of 44 per 0.25 m2, averaged over the site. During winter and spring the seeds became rarer at the lower elevations, but more abundant nearshore. Zostera noltii seeds were viable, but did not germinate in situ; their fate is unknown. Zostera marina L. grew as an annual, the last shoots disappearing in February-March just as the buried seeds showed a burst of germination. About 80% of buried seeds in the early winter disappeared before February; half of the loss was due to autonomous death. About 50% of the viable seeds germinated, but only 13% of the seedlings successfully established. Established genets, representing about 1% of the autumn seed bank, produced vegetative and flowering branch shoots rapidly in the early summer. Seedling mortality was not density-dependent, but was higher at lower elevations. After about 3 months few genets died until the autumn. A small bank of viable Z. marina seeds remained by the summer, about 5% of the annual seed input.																	0304-3770					MAR	1993	45	1					63	77		10.1016/0304-3770(93)90053-Y							WOS:A1993KU18000006

Samples (12 x 12 cm) were taken from plots that had received sulphuric acid and (or) nitric acid irrigation of pH 3 for 5 years and from irrigated control plots. The average seedling density per plot calculated from seedbank samples was 912/m2, varying from 191 to 5240. All the main aboveground taxa were present in the emerging seedlings with Betula sp. and Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum being dominant. Other common seed-bank species included Vaccinium uliginosum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Festuca ovina. Acid treatment did not have any significant impact on the composition of the seed bank or on germinative capacity in general. These findings indicate the existence of a viable soil seed bank in northern subarctic forests and the persistence of viability in spite of moderate acid deposition.																	0008-4026					MAR	1993	71	3					379	384		10.1139/b93-042							WOS:A1993LC50400003						
J	CHAMBERS, JC				CHAMBERS, JC			SEED AND VEGETATION DYNAMICS IN AN ALPINE HERB FIELD - EFFECTS OF DISTURBANCE TYPE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Relationships among the aboveground vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank were examined on a late seral herb field characterized by pocket gopher disturbance and on an early seral gravel borrow that had been severely disturbed 35 years ago on the Beartooth Plateau, Montana. Aboveground vegetation cover was assessed by species in twelve 5-M2 plots. Seed rain was sampled during the 1988, 1989, and 1990 growing seasons with pitfall traps, and the soil seed bank was sampled in fall 1989, spring 1990, and fall 1990. The seed rain (filled seeds) on the borrow area ranged from 7730 to 14 009 seeds/m2 and was higher than that found on other alpine sites; that on the Geum turf ranged from 3375 to 6179 seeds/m2 and was similar to that for other alpine sites. Although highly variable among dates on the borrow area, the seed banks were similar to those of comparable alpine sites. Seed bank density ranged from 1980 to 6003 seeds/M2 on the borrow area and from 3202 to 4647 seeds/m2 on the Geum turf area. The Geum turf area had higher vegetation cover than the borrow area (87 vs. 25%) and higher numbers of species in the aboveground vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank. Relationships among the aboveground vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank were largely determined by the disturbance characteristics of the different sites and the life-history strategies of the dominant species. Medium-lived species, primarily grasses, with high production of small and compact seeds had colonized the borrow area. Despite establishment of other species, 35 years after disturbance the medium-lived species still dominated the aboveground vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank. Species abundances in the three different components were all highly correlated. In contrast, on the Geum turf area there were no correlations among the aboveground vegetation, seed rain, or seed bank. Long-lived forbs that produced low numbers of relatively large seeds dominated the aboveground vegetation and persisted on the area primarily in the vegetative state. The same medium-lived species that dominated the borrow area had the highest abundance in the seed rain on the Geum turf area and appeared to persist by colonizing small-scale disturbances caused by gopher burrowing. Short-lived species with small, long-lived seeds existed on the site primarily through a highly persistent seed bank. The relationships among the aboveground vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank on the Geum turf and borrow areas are compared with those observed for more temperate systems following disturbance.																	0008-4026					MAR	1993	71	3					471	485		10.1139/b93-052							WOS:A1993LC50400013

Laboratory and field screening of five lines each of six forage legumes ( Vicia narbonensis L., V. sativa L., V. villosa ssp. dasycarpa (Ten.) Cavill., Lathyrus sativus L., L. ochrus (L.) D.C., and L. cicera L.) for resistance to the parasitic weed Orobanche crenata Forsk. revealed high interspecific and intraspecific variation. Lathyrus ochrus lines were free of emerged O. crenata shoots while those of L. sativus and L. cicera were highly susceptible to the parasite. Intraspecific variation in reaction to O. crenata was high within V narbonensis and V sativa, with several lines being free of Orobanche parasitism whereas others were highly susceptible. Lines with high resistance to Orobanche can reduce the build-up of a seed bank of the parasite in areas where mainly food legumes are grown and can be of value for developing integrated Orobanche control systems. The laboratory screening, which is faster and cheaper, reliably predicted the field performance and hence retesting in the field can be restricted to those lines found resistant in the laboratory.																	0378-4290					MAR	1993	32	3-4					277	285		10.1016/0378-4290(93)90037-N							WOS:A1993KK76000008

The seedling-emergence technique was used to determine species composition in 2 environmental moisture regimes (drawdown and submerged). The Gleasonian model of van der Valk was used to predict field vegetation from floristic composition of the seed bank in each playa lake. Based on life-history characteristics of species found in the seed-bank, we predicted the composition of playa vegetation during May, June, and August for 2 years under 3 moisture regimes (dry, moist, flooded). Twenty-six of the 39 species found in the seed-bank were annuals that were able to exploit the rapidly changing moisture regime of playas. Although, seedling densities differed among playas, the model adequately predicted the composition of vegetation in the playas. As environmental variability increased (more annual wet-dry fluctuations), the model became less reliable. To improve the model for playas, we suggest inclusion of frequency, depth, and longevity of flooding in the model.																	0277-5212					MAR	1993	13	1					32	40		10.1007/BF03160863							WOS:A1993KU85200005

To determine the mechanisms by which individual species respond to fire, regrowth of vegetation was monitored for 3 years after fire at a burned site, and at a nearby site that had not been burned. At both sites, experimental treatments simulated various physical aspects of fire, including clipping of stems, removal of leaf litter, and application of fertilizer. Both fire and clipping were followed by multiple resprouting and enhanced growth of the dominant shrub, Gaylussacia baccata, suggesting that sprout growth is controlled by correlative inhibition of adventitious buds. By contrast, neither fertilizer nor litter removal had a significant impact on G. baccata. Other species were only observed at very low numbers, and appeared to act independently of either fire or experimental treatments. Recruitment from seed was not observed in any treatment at either site, despite reports of a large soil seed bank. Thus, compositional stability is maintained through a large reserve of dormant buds on the dominant species, and through a lack of opportunities for associate species. This stability is precarious, however, depending strongly on fire frequency and intensity.																	0002-9122					FEB	1993	80	2					119	126		10.2307/2445029							WOS:A1993KM63500001

The techniques are applied to the data collected by H. A. Roberts and his colleagues. The main result of this analysis is that seed banks do not in general decay according to a negative exponential pattern and that a wide range of recruitment patterns occur. We explore the effects of unobserved mortality on age-specific recruitment. We also demonstrate the difficulty of interpreting age-specific patterns of recruitment in terms of the behavior of individual seeds. This difficulty is a result of unobserved seed mortality and between-seed variability, either of which can qualitatively change the shape of the recruitment curve. A simple model of the recruitment process is presented, and it is demonstrated that density dependence can generate spurious patterns of age-specific recruitment.																	0003-0147					FEB	1993	141	2					233	262		10.1086/285471							WOS:A1993KL89000004	19426080

In one experiment, tussocks were reciprocally transplanted between the bladed and undisturbed sites, and, in a second experiment, progeny from the seed rain and soil seed bank in undisturbed tundra were compared. Measurements made 3, 4, and 5 yr after transplanting showed that the two populations were genetically distinct in some morphological characters (leaf length and rate of flowering) and in ecological response to site variation (leaf length and relative growth rate). In the greenhouse experiment, plants from the seed bank differed from those in the seed rain immediately following germination, although these differences were not persistent. In combination with other studies of cottongrass tundra at Eagle Creek, these results suggest that E. vaginatum seedlings emerging from the deeply buried seed bank may represent early-successional genotypes that numerically dominate this seed bank, but as adults are reduced in numbers as succession proceeds toward a closed vegetation.																	0004-0851					FEB	1993	25	1					45	49		10.2307/1551479							WOS:A1993KP18400007						
J	HEYLAND, KU; KAUL, HP				HEYLAND, KU; KAUL, HP			A MODEL OF WEED POPULATION-DYNAMICS USED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF OPTIMAL WEED-CONTROL STRATEGIES WITH REGARD TO CROP MANAGEMENT OF WINTER-WHEAT AND SUGAR-BEET	BODENKULTUR												The aim of this study is the quantitative estimation of the influence of crop management factors (herbicide application, nitrogen fertilization, crop density) on weed population dynamics in a rotation with sugar beet and winter wheat. The parameters of a deterministic difference equation model are estimated. After verification of the model simulation experiments are conducted to optimize the crop management strategies with regard to minimum herbicide input. The data base for parameter estimation and model verification are results of a long time field experiment (since 1983) with corresponding management systems for all crops within the rotation. Specific data were taken in 1987 to 1989, thus testing the management systems on different weed densities that had been evolved until then. This was completed with a two year experiment in winter wheat testing reduced herbicide doses. The results could be summarized: 1. Herbicides show different influences in reducing weed populations depending on date and dose of application as well as weather conditions of the specific year. 2. Weed emergence rate depends on herbicides, fertilization and crop density, while the development rate is only influenced by the date and dose of herbicide application. Finally the seed production per weed plant can hardly be changed by the checked crop management. 3. A simple model of population dynamics explains quite well the weed abundance over years for the tested range of management systems and initial low weed densities. 4. Among the tested management systems only early post emergence herbicide application guarantees substantial low weed seed banks, while one year without spraying herbicides leads to a dramatic population increase. 5. In using simulation experiments a new weed control strategy is developed that, in contrast to economic thresholds, is based on every year spraying of reduced herbicide doses. 6. Crop management factors, e. g. fertilization and crop density, could favourably be used to support weed suppression of less effective herbicide applications in integrated crop management systems.

J	KREMER, RJ				KREMER, RJ			MANAGEMENT OF WEED SEED BANKS WITH MICROORGANISMS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Successful weed management in agroecosystems centers on manipulating the weed seed bank in soil, the source of annual weed infestations. Despite advances in above-ground weed control and decreases in the production of new seeds, weed infestations continue to be generated from a small portion of the seed bank that persists as a result of dormancy and resistance to decay. Depletion of the persistent seeds using soil-applied chemicals to stimulate germination has received much attention while the search for microorganisms selective for seed decay has been largely overlooked. This paper provides an overview of the effects of microorganisms on weed seed viability relative to seed bank depletion, and how this information can be applied to weed management. Limited studies indicate that microorganisms associated with weed seeds can contribute to seed bank depletion through attraction to seeds by chemotaxis, rapid colonization of the spermosphere and production of enzymes and/or phytotoxins to kill seeds prior to germination. It is recognized, however, that the best opportunity for success will be through integration of selected microorganisms or microbial products with other approaches including germination stimulation, application of low rates of herbicides, manipulation of the soil environment (e.g., solarization), and biological control agents for effectively eliminating dormant, persistent seeds from soil. To achieve success, more in-depth research on microbial factors affecting weed seed banks is required.																	1051-0761					FEB	1993	3	1					42	52		10.2307/1941791							WOS:A1993LN26300013	27759226

The germination behaviour of annual pasture species was studied by subjecting two collections of seeds taken from plants and soil-seed banks to two phytotron-simulated weather patterns: early and late autumn rains. Species from these pastures were arranged along a gradient of sensitivity to temperature on the arrival of the first persistent rain. This sensitivity was manifested in both the total germination success of the species and the germination time profile. The different germination patterns of the species can provide competitive advantages depending on the autumn weather conditions.

Five crop densities were sown to obtain crop stands of different competitive ability. Halving the highest recommended dose decreased the control efficacy by 5-15 percentage units, but still provided a good weed control. Further reduction of the dose resulted in high variation in efficacy. The level of weed suppression was mainly determined by the competitiveness of the crop, environmental conditions and weed spectrum with differential sensitivity of species to the herbicides. No changes in the weed infestation were detected after continuous use of low herbicide doses for 3 years. The seed bank of weeds in soil was higher after a wheat-dominated rotation than after a barley-dominated rotation.																	0789-600X						1993	2			2			C1	C9									WOS:A1993MQ07400005

Shoots emerge above the soil surface in early spring, and seeds mature in early July. By the time shoots senesce in early July, a small perennating bud has formed at the top of the root, ca. 5 cm below the soil surface. This bud grew at 5 and 15/6, but not at 30/15 C. Under natural conditions, bud growth began in early October, and buds were 5 cm long by mid-March. Seeds sown in a nontemperature-controlled greenhouse in July germinated the following spring; only two seeds germinated the 2nd yr. Seeds had underdeveloped linear embryos that grew from 0.3-2.3 mm in length before germination. Cold stratification was the only requirement for full embryo growth and for breaking of seed dormancy. Thus, the seeds have morphophysiological dormancy. Flowering in most plants was delayed until the 4th or later yr after germination. The species appears to have little potential to form a persistent seed bank, and plants do not flower until they are several years old. Therefore, survival of P. americana at a site may require long-term protection.																	0003-0031					JAN	1993	129	1					75	86		10.2307/2426437							WOS:A1993KF51400009

The treatments were applied in the spring and the seedlings counted 3 months later. Very few seedlings emerged in undisturbed grassland vegetation. which indicates the importance of gaps for seed regeneration. The seed rain (replacement with seed-free soil) contributed very little to the seedling flora. The great majority of seedlings emerging after top soil removal were recruited from the soil seed bank. However, despite a species-rich seed bank, few species emerged after disturbance and the seedlings contributed little to the revegetation.

In 1967, the first summer after abandonment, permanent sample plots were set up to study the succession of the vegetation; these were inspected every fifth year. In autumn 1988 and 1989, soil samples were taken for seed germination. The composition of the seed bank is here correlated with the successional vegetation cover. The average size of the seed bank was 50 000 viable seeds m-2 to a depth of 25 cm. The most abundant taxa were Gnaphalium uliginosum (L.) Opiz, Juncus spp., Hypericum spp., Sagina procumbens L. and Veronica serpyllifolia L., representing species common in the early stages of succession. Seeds of 17 species were found to have remained viable for 5-21 years. Analysis of the vertical structure of the seed bank is shown to be a useful means of evaluating which seeds arrived before and which after the abandonment of the fields.																	0003-3847						1993	30	2					139	152									WOS:A1993LV30300005

Prompt germination seems to be the most common behavior, although there are many cases where germination is delayed by a hard coat or endogenous or enforced dormancy mechanisms. Some gap colonizers show sophisticated light or temperature regulated dormancy.

L. Johnson and A. nana (Sieb. ex Spreng.) L. Johnson are presented in relation to fire. A. distyla is single-stemmed and fire-sensitive; A. nana resprouts multiple stems from a lignotuber following fire. Vegetative above-ground plant growth correlates with seed bank size in A. distyla better than in A. nana. There is approximately 10 times the canopy-stored seed in A. nana 8 years after fire than in A. distyla 9 years after fire. The critical period to initial seed set in A. distyla is between about 7 and 9 years. In A. nana, this period is typically longer but appears to depend on the age of the seed-producing genets. The age structure of the seed banks in both species remains more or less constant in time, with most seed being young. Seed viability declines in A. distyla from an initial 60% to less than 10% within about 12 years after seed set. A similar pattern appears likely for A. nana, although initial seed viability is about 40%. Attrition in seed viability is attributed to seed predation by insects, fungal attack and seed senescence. The dynamics of seed production and survivorship appear to be similar to those in serotinous proteaceous species studied to date.																	0067-1924						1993	41	1					1	9		10.1071/BT9930001							WOS:A1993KX37800001						
J	MARTIN, RJ; FELTON, WL				MARTIN, RJ; FELTON, WL			EFFECT OF CROP-ROTATION, TILLAGE PRACTICE, AND HERBICIDES ON THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF WILD OATS IN WHEAT	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												The effects of crop rotation, tillage practice, and herbicide use on the population dynamics of wild oats (Avena fatua and A. sterilis ssp. ludoviciana) were studied in a field experiment in northern New South Wales. In the third and fourth years of a continuous wheat rotation, cultivated fallow using tines increased wild oat density and reduced grain yield compared with a no-tillage fallow. Tillage did not affect the vertical distribution of wild oat seeds in the soil, and about 80% of wild oat seeds were in the top 5 cm of soil in both tillage treatments. The seed reservoir at the end of the experiment was smaller under a no-tillage fallow regime. The half-life of wild oat seeds in the soil was about 6 months, and rotation of wheat with sorghum was the most effective means of reducing the wild oat seed reservoir. Rotational strategies for weed control are also likely to be effective in delaying or minimising the development of herbicide resistance, particularly where the average seed bank life time, as shown for wild oats in this study, is short. Annual use of either tri-allate or flamprop-methyl in 4 successive wheat crops did not prevent a massive build-up of wild oat seed. The poor performance of herbicides was partly attributed to below-average rainfall in autumn and early winter in 1985 and 1986. However, wild oats are well adapted to continuous cropping with wheat, where recruitment of 3-6% of the soil seed reservoir maintained the population despite the use of selective herbicides. The results of this experiment indicate that a continuous wheat rotation using herbicides to control wild oats is likely to be much less effective in reducing the wild oat seed reservoir.																	0816-1089						1993	33	2					159	165		10.1071/EA9930159							WOS:A1993LF98800006						
J	STURGESS, P; ATKINSON, D				STURGESS, P; ATKINSON, D			THE CLEAR-FELLING OF SAND-DUNE PLANTATIONS - SOIL AND VEGETATIONAL PROCESSES IN HABITAT RESTORATION	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Sand-dune pine plantations often have little conservation value. This paper examines vegetation and soil changes following clear-felling, and management strategies for the restoration of near-natural sand-dune habitats. A common response to clear-felling is the rapid establishment of a weed community characterised in Britain by Senecio spp. and Chamerion angustifolium, which is associated with vigorous growth and high initial levels of available nutrients. This community may gradually be invaded and replaced by typical dune species; however, in older plantations with more litter the ruderal flora is often replaced by a bryophyte and lichen community, and a tendency towards pine Pinus regeneration and invasion by Betula spp. is observed. C. angustifolium, which is capable of efficient nutrient cycling, and Carex arenaria persisted as local dominants on these deep litter layers. This was associated with a phase of nutrient immobilisation. Needle-litter modifies the sand-dune soil by retaining nutrients and soil moisture. It inhibits germination from the sand-dune seed-bank and contains a seed-bank of ruderal species. Litter removal can accelerate the change to a near-natural sand-dune habitat. Although it may not be possible to restore the original dune flora following clear-felling a dime plantation, it may be feasible to create one which is very similar, or even to create a vegetation type not previously present at the site but still with greater value for conservation than a pine plantation.

SEED PRODUCTION AND SEED BANK DYNAMICS OF ERYSIMUM-CAPITATUM SSP ANGUSTATUM AND OENOTHERA-DELTOIDES SSP HOWELLII	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Herein we extend a related study of Erysimum capitatum ssp. angustatum (= ECA) and Oenothera deltoides ssp. howellii (= ODH), two highly endangered plants, by examining seed production and seed bank dynamics at Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge in central California (USA). ECA and ODH were found to produce large numbers of seeds at the refuge, comparing favorably with closely related but non-endangered taxa. Extrinsic limits on seed production, such as the availability of effective pollinators, were found to be important rather than intrinsic (i.e. genetic) limits. More than half of the ovules initiated by ODH during the two-year study period failed to become seeds. These ovules were contained in ovaries that failed to develop because effective pollinators (e.g. hawkmoths) were not available to carry pollen between flowers of different individuals in this outcrossing taxon. Management of the ODH population, therefore, will require special efforts to protect local populations of effective pollinators in order to minimize the pollination limitation in the future. Pollination could also limit seed production in ECA, but only when the plant population was small and competition for pollinators from other species intense. Pre-dispersal insect predation was also more important when the ECA population was small. Management of the ECA population to maximize seed production, therefore, requires increasing population size by maximizing germination, seedling establishment, and growth in years of poor rainfall. Controlling competition from introduced annual grasses particularly for moisture, is most important in this regard The seed banks of ECA and ODH were large compared to the number of established plants, and exhibited typical seasonal patterns of depletion and replenishment. A minimum residual bank of viable ECA seeds remained during the entire year, suggesting there was overlap of generations and a buffer against catastrophic events that affect established plants. ODH, however, had a smaller residual bank and was, therefore, less well-buffered against the erosion of genetic variation and catastrophic events that affect the adult population. The long-term status and dynamics of the ECA and ODH seed banks will depend on management that reduces the seed density of introduced annual grasses in the refuge seed bank.

The germinable soil seed bank in a basalt paddock with a large population of this daisy largely consisted of exotic and annual species. The peak germination for native species was in winter and early spring, while exotics dominated from late spring to autumn. The peak germination of H. albicans occurred soon after a similar peak of an exotic rosette herb, Hypochoeris radicata. An experiment with different mixtures of these two species demonstrated that H. radicata had a depressive effect on the growth of H. albicans while the reverse was not apparent. As both species colonize bare ground, a managed reduction in Hypochoeris density is likely to favour the rare native.

J	BELL, DT; PLUMMER, JA; TAYLOR, SK				BELL, DT; PLUMMER, JA; TAYLOR, SK			SEED-GERMINATION ECOLOGY IN SOUTHWESTERN WESTERN-AUSTRALIA	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Germination responses of species from the native plant communities of south-western Western Australia can be related to syndromes of life history, fire response, and seed storage, and also to factors related to environmental stress. The Mediterranean-type climate of the region with periodic drought and recurrent fires affects the production of viable seeds in plants of limited stature and rooting depth. Fire response ephemerals and species cued to flower by fire tend to produce viable, readily germinable seeds, but there are instances where seed production is aborted in these predominantly herbaceous life forms. Clonal, rhizomatous species often produce mainly inviable seeds. Production of viable seeds in woody species of these highly diverse communities may also be restricted by limitations to cross pollination. Obligate post-fire seeding species tend to produce a greater proportion of viable seeds than species which are capable of resprouting following fire. Serotinous species, whether post-fire re-seeders or post-fire resprouting species, produce mainly viable seeds, which germinate readily once freed from protective fruits. Species of the legume families and a few others of the soil seed bank produce innately dormant seeds which can be germinated following heat shock treatments which simulate the effects of fire. Heat shock in these species appears mainly as a mechanism to crack the hard seed coats, but the effect of heat to denature seed coat inhibitors has not been eliminated. Western Australian species do not seem to break dormancy when exposed to leachates from burned wood as has been observed in comparable habitats in California and South Africa, but further research is advised. Germination in many native south-western Australian species is cued by temperatures that correspond to the winter rainfall period. There are also indications that an after-ripening period of warm, dry storage increases percentage of germinable seeds. Stimulation of germination by hormones is almost unresearched in Western Australia, but germination percentages have been increased in a small number of species of horticultural potential. Stimulation of germination by soil nutrient concentrations is almost unresearched in Western Australia, except for the inhibitory effect of excess sodium chloride levels in Eucalyptus and Melaleuca. These species only germinate when osmotic effects are reduced to lower levels as would occur when winter rains dilute soil salts. Application of research on seed germination has already enhanced the establishment of seedlings in the restoration of mine sites and is becoming important in aspects of the breeding and selection of native plants for the cut flower, bedding plant and essential oil industries.

Seeds buried in soil in a nontemperature-controlled greenhouse in May 1989 germinated to 14-64% in light and to 7-51% in darkness at simulated autumn (15/6, 20/10-degrees-C) temperatures in October 1989. During autumn 1989, about 2 5 and 50% of the P. ranunculacea and N. aphylla seeds, respectively, germinated while buried in soil in the greenhouse. Seeds of P. ranunculacea exhibited an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle during the next 24 months of burial, with only a few buried seeds germinating in the autumn of 1990, while those of N. aphylla that afterripened during the summer of 1990 germinated in the soil that autumn and did not re-enter dormancy. Thus, seed banks in the latter species are attributed to lack of afterripening and not to the ability of nondormant seeds to re-enter dormancy. Seeds sown on soil in the greenhouse in May 1989 germinated in the autumns of 1989-1991. Since seeds only germinated in autumn, the species are obligate winter annuals. Both species form persistent seed banks. Some seeds that germinated in soil samples from N. aphylla population sites were at least 2 years old, while some in two sets of samples from a P. ranunculacea site were 3 years old.																	0040-9618					JAN-MAR	1993	120	1					29	37		10.2307/2996660							WOS:A1993KV63400004

An understanding of seed persistence in the soil is important to vegetation management and weed control, but experimental collection of seed bank data is tedious and expensive. We report a rapid, simple method for predicting seed persistence in the soil. The method is tested on a range of British, mostly herbaceous, species. 2. Diaspore (seed or fruit) weight is plotted against variance of the three linear dimensions of the diaspore. All diaspores within an area of the graph defined by a maximum weight and variance are persistent in the soil. The critical weight is the same for fruits and seeds, but the critical variance of diaspore dimensions appears slightly higher for fruits. The great majority of diaspores outside this region are short lived, and the relatively few ambiguous cases can be resolved by reference to habitat. 3. The generality of the suspected underlying mechanism suggests that the method can also be applied to floras outside north-west Europe.																	0269-8463						1993	7	2					236	241		10.2307/2389893							WOS:A1993KY58100014						
J	LONSDALE, WM				LONSDALE, WM			LOSSES FROM THE SEED BANK OF MIMOSA-PIGRA - SOIL-MICROORGANISMS VS TEMPERATURE-FLUCTUATIONS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Field and laboratory experiments were set up to investigate the relative contributions of the soil microflora and soil temperature fluctuations to the loss of dormant seeds from the seed bank of Mimosa pigra, an invasive tropical shrub. The field experiment was carried out during the dry season in two regions of northern Australia with differing soils subject to seasonal inundation, one a heavy black cracking clay, the other solodic. 2. The distinction is drawn between causes of seed bank depletion - the external environmental factors resulting in losses of seed - and the processes of depletion death or germination - through which the various causes operate. 3. Overall, 66 and 59%, respectively, of seeds remained viable in the two regions after the 7 months of the dry season had elapsed. The causes of loss were diurnal temperature fluctuations of up to 50 degrees C and soil micro-organisms. Both caused germination and death of seeds in the seed bank, germination stimulated by temperature fluctuations being the more important. 4. Fungicide reduced the overall loss of seeds significantly in both regions, but only by 10-16%. The results do not support the contention that many seeds are lost from the soil through the depredations of pathogens. However, it is possible that the most important impact of pathogens is on germinating, not dormant, seeds.

Results from seed-fall collection baskets placed in two untreated sites revealed new deposition of 180 seeds/m(2) and 143 2 seeds/m(2), respectively, which corroborated the results from Sediment core data. Cut rosette fragments, produced by the cuffing operation, were compared to undisturbed whole plants for vigor and seed production.

J	BRAHIM, K; SMITH, SE				BRAHIM, K; SMITH, SE			ANNUAL MEDIC ESTABLISHMENT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR STAND PERSISTENCE IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Few perennial legumes have been successfully introduced into western North American rangelands receiving less than 250 mm annual precipitation. Winter annual legumes in the genus Medicago (medics) are native to arid sites in North Africa and the Middle East and have been successfully introduced into arid and semiarid rangelands. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of establishing medics in areas of the southwestern U.S. receiving between 100 and 200 mm winter precipitation (November-May). Five medic accessions from 4 species (M. laciniata (L.) Miller, M. littoralis Rhode ex Loix. Delong., M. polymorpha L., M. truncatula Gaertn.) that could avoid drought were identified in a preliminary screening nursery in 1987-88. These accessions established and produced seed in 1989-90 in a field plot at Tucson, Ariz., with 125 mm winter precipitation. Less than 5% of all seed produced by these accessions germinated following summer precipitation. Plant re-establishment in the winter 1990-91 (181 mm precipitation) from pods produced in 1989-90 was observed for only 1 accession (M. truncatula 'Cyprus'). New plant re-establishment and seed production was observed in 1990-91 for all 5 accessions from seed produced in 1989-90 with supplemental irrigation (300 mm) in addition to precipitation. Failure to observe comparable establishment from seed produced without irrigation was attributed to the scarcity of germinable (permeable) seeds in the soil seed bank. Rapid maturing medics that exhibit breakdown of hardseededness by autumn appear to be well adapted to southern Arizona sites receiving as little as 110 mm winter precipitation. If such introductions are to be successful, initial seeding rates in excess of 115 pure live seeds/m2 may be necessary to develop a large soil seed bank.																	0022-409X					JAN	1993	46	1					21	25		10.2307/4002442							WOS:A1993KG49800003

Species diversity was greater in sites near the tidal channel (18+/-2 per 20 x 20 cm sample) than from the high marsh (6.6+/-0.7). Densities ranged from 1620 in the stream channel to 51,750 m-2 in a shrub forest site. Only 30 species occurred in the field as seedlings. Study of the depth distribution of germinable seeds and spring depletion due to germination documented three seed bank strategies. Seed dispersal, tolerance to anaerobic soil conditions, and germination requirements, coupled with seedling tolerances, vary with species and help explain vegetation distribution patterns. Superimposed on these are year to year fluctuations in seed bank, seedling populations, and vegetation composition. Hydrological regime influences many factors that have an impact on life history stages.																	0097-3157						1993	144						267	281									WOS:A1993KW27400008

A large shift was found in the compositional mix of 26 species of C3's and 17 species of C4's grown from a native soil seed bank in a competitive mode along a CO2 gradient that approximated the CO2 increase of the past 150 years and before. The biomass of C3's increased from near zero to 50 % of the total while that of the C4's was reduced 25 % as CO2 levels approached current ambient. The proposition that acclimation to rising CO2 will largely negate the fertilization effect of higher CO2 levels on C3's is not supported. No signs of photosynthetic acclimation were evident for Avena sativa, Prosopis glandulosa, and Schizachyrium scoparium plants grown in subambient CO2. The effects of changing CO2 levels on vegetation since the last glaciation are thought to have been at least as great, if not greater, than those which should be expected for a doubling of current CO2 levels. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 200 ppm are thought to have been instrumental in the rise of the C4 grasslands of North America and other extensive C4 grasslands and savannas of the world. Dramatic invasion of these areas by woody C3 species are accompanying the historical increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration now in progress.																	0042-3106					JAN	1993	104						157	170		10.1007/BF00048151							WOS:A1993KM79000013

J	JIMENEZ, HE; ARMESTO, JJ				JIMENEZ, HE; ARMESTO, JJ			IMPORTANCE OF THE SOIL SEED BANK OF DISTURBED SITES IN CHILEAN MATORRAL IN EARLY SECONDARY SUCCESSION	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The dynamics of the seed bank may provide clues to the process of recovery of the vegetation of disturbed sites. The role of the seed bank may be more important in areas with a seasonal climate than in areas where seedling recruitment is not limited to one season. We studied the seed bank and the seed rain in three sites of the Chilean mediterranean-climate region (33-degrees 48'S) which differed in the degree of anthropic disturbance: a closed-canopy, second-growth forest; an open matorral; and an old-field. Additionally, we tested the germination of seeds from the soil and from the current-year seed crop. The seed bank varied considerably between the two years of study, although no change in the vegetation could be observed. Seed density and species richness were lower in 1989 than in 1988. The seed bank of the second-growth forest changed less between years, while the old-field showed the largest change. The highest seed rain occurred under shrub patches in the open matorral, while few seeds fell in the spaces between shrub clumps or in the old-field. In the forest, seed rain was low and correlated with species cover. Germination was low (0 - 15%) in tests using either soil samples or fresh seeds. These results indicate that matorral succession is a very slow process, limited mainly by low germination and low arrival of propagules to open areas. Most woody species have animal-disseminated fleshy propagules. The presence of established shrubs which may serve as perches or refuges for animals increases species richness in the seed rain and the seed bank.																	1100-9233					DEC	1992	3	5					579	586		10.2307/3235824							WOS:A1992KA46600002						
J	RICOGRAY, V; GARCIAFRANCO, JG				RICOGRAY, V; GARCIAFRANCO, JG			VEGETATION AND SOIL SEED BANK OF SUCCESSIONAL STAGES IN TROPICAL LOWLAND DECIDUOUS FOREST	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												We studied vegetation structure and soil seed bank composition in different successional stages of secondary lowland tropical deciduous forest in Yucatan, Mexico. The series of study sites includes: slashed (S), slashed-and-burned (SB), and regenerating for 1, 6, 10, 15, 30, 40 and 100 yr. Species richness (S = 42-65), evenness (E = 0.32-0.38), and diversity (H' = 1.2-1.6) do not vary much as the forest grows older. 20 species of shrubs and trees were present in at least six of the seven regrowth years studied; 10 of these account for more than 50 % of the total density values per regrowth year. These species dominate the vegetation due to their capacity to withstand repeated fire and felling. One third of the individuals sampled had regenerated from coppiced shoots. Species composition little resembles that in earlier accounts. The area is now largely covered by young regrowth stages (1-20 yr). Species constituting the original woody structure of the mature forest are rare or absent due to the lack of seed sources and failure of dispersal (which is due to limited dispersal capacities), lack of dispersal agents, or long distances. Herbs were the most important life form in the soil seed banks; only one tree species was found. The number of viable seeds varied between sampled areas: 70/m2 in the 40 yr-old, to 1 815/m2 in the slashed-and-burned (SB). The vegetation of S- and SB-areas was the same, but the number of viable seeds germinating in SB was twice the number in S; the number of species in the seed bank is the same for both areas. We speculate that fire modifies species dominance early in succession, allowing seeds of some species to germinate in great numbers.

J	KILIAN, D; COWLING, RM				KILIAN, D; COWLING, RM			COMPARATIVE SEED BIOLOGY AND COEXISTENCE OF 2 FYNBOS SHRUB SPECIES	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Fire-prone fynbos communities include numerous species which are difficult to distinguish in terms of conventional niche axes since they are morphologically similar and share the same broad life-history traits. These species compete for space after each fire and lottery theory predicts that those with dissimilar per capita regeneration would not co-exist in the long-term. We studied seed production, soil seed bank dynamics, germination and post-fire seedling establishment and mortality of two obligate reseeding, morphologically similar shrubs which co-occur in dune fynbos throughout the southwestern Cape. Passerina paleacea produced 30 x more plump seeds and maintained soil seed banks between 1.5 x (pre-dispersal) and 2.6 x (post-dispersal) times larger than Phylica ericoides. Seeds of both species showed a high degree of dormancy although germination was stimulated by direct fire-related cues for Phylica only. Approximately 4 x more Passerina seedlings than Phylica seedlings were counted at the end of the winter germination period after a mild autumn fire. However, seedling mortality in the first five months of the dry summer was more than twice as high for Passerina than for Phylica. We suggest that the long-term co-existence of these two species does not result from similar post-fire regeneration success but rather from population instabilities arising from differential regeneration in relation to fire regime. The results predict that hot fires followed by dry summers would favour Phylica over Passerina as the former has fire-stimulated germination and greater drought tolerance; cool fires followed by moist summers would favour Passerina.																	1100-9233					DEC	1992	3	5					637	646		10.2307/3235831							WOS:A1992KA46600009						
J	SHUMWAY, SW; BERTNESS, MD				SHUMWAY, SW; BERTNESS, MD			SALT STRESS LIMITATION OF SEEDLING RECRUITMENT IN A SALT-MARSH PLANT COMMUNITY	OECOLOGIA												Seedling recruitment in salt marsh plant communities is generally precluded in dense vegetation by competition from adults, but is also relatively rare in disturbance-generated bare space. We examined the constraints on seedling recruitment in New England salt marsh bare patches. Under typical bare patch conditions seed germination is severely limited by high substrate salinities. We examined the germination requirements of common high marsh plants and found that except for one notably patch-dependent fugitive species, the germination of high marsh plants is strongly inhibited by the high soil salinities routinely encountered in natural bare patches. Watering high marsh soil in the greenhouse to alleviate salt stress resulted in the emergence of up to 600 seedlings/225 cm2. The vast majority of this seed bank consisted of Juncus gerardi, the only common high marsh plant with high seed set. We tested the hypothesis that salt stress limits seedling contributions to marsh patch secondary succession in the field. Watering bare patches with fresh water partially alleviated patch soil salinities and dramatically increased both the emergence and survival of seedlings. Our results show that seedling recruitment by high marsh perennial turfs is limited by high soil salinities and that consequently their population dynamics are determined primarily by clonal growth processes. In contrast, populations of patch-dependent fugitive marsh plants which cannot colonize vegetatively are likely governed by spatially and temporally unpredictable windows of low salinities in bare patches.																	0029-8549					DEC	1992	92	4					490	497		10.1007/BF00317840							WOS:A1992KH02400005	28313219

Results showed that at the community level, the process of seedling recruitment is highly stochastic. The distribution of seeds in the seed-bank is locally clumped at a very small scale and a similar pattern was found for seedling recruitment. This means that at least part of the spatial distribution of seedlings can be explained by the fine-grained differences in the abundance of seeds. At the same time, the processes affecting spatial pattern of seedling recruitment at the community level are constrained by intra-community heterogeneity. Physiognomically different patches occurring within the community showed significant differences in both number and species composition of seedlings.																	0030-1299					DEC	1992	65	3					433	442		10.2307/3545560							WOS:A1992KB34700011

Five crop densities were sown to obtain crop stands of different competitive ability. Halving the highest recommended dose decreased the control efficacy by 5-15 percentage units, but still provided a good weed control. Further reduction of the dose resulted in high variation in efficacy. The level of weed suppression was mainly determined by the competitiveness of the crop, environmental conditions and weed spectrum with differential sensitivity of species to the herbicides. No changes in the weed infestation were detected after continuous use of low herbicide doses for 3 years. The seed bank of weeds in soil was higher after a wheat-dominated rotation than after a barley-dominated rotation.																	0043-1737					DEC	1992	32	6					483	491		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1992.tb01909.x							WOS:A1992KC97900006

Successful seed-set and production depends on a favourable soil moisture supply for a minimum period after anthesis starts in spring. The present studies evaluated the scope for increasing the probability of satisfactory soil water supply over this critical period in the southwestern Australian cereal belt by modifying the pattern of water use (ET) during the season. In the first trial, in 1987, weighing lysimeters were used to monitor ET which was partitioned into soil evaporation under canopy (E(SC)) and transpiration (T), in a first year pasture (Medicago polymorpha) on soils of contrasting texture. On the fine textured soil rapid early growth promoted water-use and prematurely depleted stored soil water, compared to a coarse textured soil on which slower early growth was associated with more stored water later in the season. However, poor adaptation by M. polymorpha on the light textured soil led to 51 % of ET being lost to E(SC), compared to 39% on the fine textured soil, and this prevented the pasture from exploiting the better water supply. As a result, water-use efficiency was significantly higher on the fine (8.2 kg ha-1 mm-1) than on the coarse (5.6 kg ha-1 mm-1) textured soil. In the second trial, in 1989, growth and pattern of ET by regenerated pasture was evaluated on a fine textured soil in response to three management treatments: (1) Control, (2) Mowed and (3) Grazed. Mowing and Grazing both reduced early water use, and this was translated into greater dry matter production in the mowed treatment in the last 4 weeks of the season. However, there was no difference in dry matter produced over the full post-anthesis period in the Control and Mowed, and this was attributed to the early start to the growing season (2-3 weeks), which meant that anthesis was also earlier than usual. In a season opening at the normal time, it is expected that the post-anthesis period would have been shorter and later and that dry matter, and seed yields would probably have benefited from the additional water stored and the resulting delay of senescence at the end of the season. It was concluded that there was scope for manipulating water-use, by measures such as grazing or mowing, to benefit seed yields on heavy textured soils, but that on light textured soils further evaluation was warranted using a better adapted pasture species.

J	BOYD, RS; SERAFINI, LL				BOYD, RS; SERAFINI, LL			REPRODUCTIVE ATTRITION IN THE RARE CHAPARRAL SHRUB FREMONTODENDRON-DECUMBENS LLOYD (STERCULIACEAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We examined reproductive attrition in Fremontodendron decumbens to characterize sexual reproduction in this rare California shrub. Reproductive individuals produced an average of 2,900 flower buds in a season, with no significant difference in bud production between two seasons. Because of intense insect predation, < 2% of initiated flower buds became mature fruits. A threefold decrease in predation of flower buds between seasons resulted in an increase in seed output the second season, indicating that seed production was partially predator-limited. Most seeds (97.8%) were dormant due to an impermeable seed coat. Breaking of the coat, mechanically or by heat, allowed high levels of germination. Chamise charate and ash added to the potting medium resulted in the highest level of germination and emergence. Rodents were more important than birds as seed predators, destroying 90% of seeds under parent shrub canopies within 8-10 months. Seeds already integrated into the seed bank were comparatively safe from predation, relative to newly added seeds. If predation was prevented, seeds were long-lived under field conditions (>80% survived after 5.75 years). Most seedlings produced in unburned chaparral by planting heat-treated seeds in openings between shrubs were destroyed by predators (rodents and insects). All seedlings that escaped predation died during the summer drought. We concluded that sexual reproduction was limited by (in order of importance): 1) lack of fire, 2) predehiscence predation by insects, and 3) postdehiscence predation by rodents. Size distributions from two populations revealed that, despite the apparent absence of sexual reproduction in unburned chaparral, two unburned sites contained a large proportion of individuals in small size classes. Excavation of several small individuals demonstrated they were sprouts from the roots of nearby larger shrubs. Because asexual reproduction by rootsprouting circumvents the high attrition of sexual reproductive effort on unburned sites, rootsprouting may be a significant reproductive strategy of some `sprouter' species in chaparral.																	0002-9122					NOV	1992	79	11					1264	1272		10.2307/2445054							WOS:A1992JY42900009						
J	LESICA, P				LESICA, P			AUTECOLOGY OF THE ENDANGERED PLANT HOWELLIA-AQUATILIS - IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND RESERVE DESIGN	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Howellia aquatilis is an annual aquatic plant of ephemeral ponds. It is considered extirpated or endangered throughout its range in the United States Pacific Northwest. I studied populations in the Swan Valley of Montana to determine life history traits and ecological attributes in order to influence planning decisions on lands managed for multiple use. Germination trials demonstrated that seeds of H. aquatilis require an aerobic environment and cool temperatures to germinate. Germination was highest with daily alternating temperatures and total darkness, and was unaffected by different light regime and aeration pretreatment conditions of 50- and 100-d durations. Natural seed banks were largest immediately following seed dispersal and pond drawdown, but were reduced 82-90% by the following spring. Seeds remaining in the seed bank showed reduced germinability and vigor. Aquarium experiments indicate that growth of H. aquatilis is best in the peat substrate in which it occurs naturally, and is reduced by 45% in a more fine-textured organic soil and by 85% in a mineral soil. Multiple regression analyses of 12 environmental variables from 23 H. aquatilis ponds and comparisons between ponds with and without H. aquatilis suggest that pond depth, amount of dissolved solids in pond water, depth and composition of pond substrate, and degree of human-caused disturbance have significant effects on the abundance of H. aquatilis in the Swan Valley. Taken together, these results suggest that Howellia aquatilis is rare because it can persist in only a small subset of wetlands-freshwater ephemeral ponds with a shallow, coarse-textured organic surface horizon. Thus, H. aquatilis will be sensitive to disturbances that alter pond water quality or substrate composition. Lack of a persistent seed bank makes H. aquatilis prone to large fluctuations in population size due to environmental fluctuations. Both habitat specificity and large variations in population size are often associated with a high risk of extinction. Howellia aquatilis can only persist during periods of climatic fluctuation as a metapopulation in an area that contains large numbers of appropriate ponds of various depths. Consequently, long-term protection of this rare species will require habitat protection in large wetland complexes throughout its range.																	1051-0761					NOV	1992	2	4					411	421		10.2307/1941876							WOS:A1992JV60500009	27759271

In the first year pasture availability and plant numbers were monitored along transects, and in the following three years the effects of sowing four Mediterranean annual legumes (three cultivars of subterranean clover and a local ecotype of Medicago rigidula) and top-dressing with superphosphate were studied. The results indicated that natural grasslands were dominated by annual grasses (Aegilops, Hordeum, Bromus, Lolium and Poa). Legume density was low, which resulted in poor legume productivity, especially in winter. Exotic legumes only resulted in a slight improvement in pasture productivity even when phosphate fertilizer was added. However, partial protection from grazing (for one or two months in late winter and spring) more than doubled the number of legume seeds in the seed bank compared with full protection and open grazing. The build up of seeds in the soil is an essential step towards the improvement of productivity in these degraded pastures, which form a large part of the land surface in Lebanon and on which small ruminant production largely depends.																	0014-4797					OCT	1992	28	4					461	471		10.1017/S0014479700020172							WOS:A1992KE03100010

Soil collected from two sites contained persistent seed banks. Seeds in the soil samples, and those sown on the soil surface, germinated in an unheated greenhouse in the autumns of 1988 to 1991. Buried seeds exhibited an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle; they were dormant in spring and nondormant in autumn. High temperatures (25/15,30/15, 35/20-degrees-C) are required for seeds to come out of dormancy, and low temperatures (5, 15/6, 20/10-degrees-C) induce nondormant seeds into secondary dormancy. Thus, seeds germinate only in autumn, and the species behaves as a strict winter annual. The strict winter annual life cycle and the ability to form a persistent seed bank help L. lescurii to survive in floodplain fields on the middle and lower Cumberland River and its tributaries.																	0885-8608					OCT	1992	12	4					184	190									WOS:A1992JW78100002

In an unheated greenhouse, the germination peak for seeds sown in June 1986 occurred during the period February 11-18, 1987, when mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures were 8.1 and -1.0-degrees-C, respectively. Buried seeds that overwintered in the unheated greenhouse were nondormant when they were exhumed on February 1; 96-100% germinated in a daily light/dark (12/12 h) thermoperiod of 15/6-degrees-C. There was 99 and 94% germination success after 18 weeks on moist soil at 1 and 5-degrees-C, respectively, whereas seeds on sand germinated to 17 and 3%, respectively. Seeds cold stratified in darkness at 1-degrees-C for 16 weeks on soil germinated to a maximum of 48% in light (at 20/10-degrees-C) and to 60% in darkness (at 15/6-degrees-C), while none of those stratified on sand germinated in light or darkness. In the unheated greenhouse, 21-88 seedlings/m2 appeared in soil samples collected from population sites after the first germination season following dispersal, while no seeds germinated in samples collected after two germination seasons. Although seeds in the soil samples germinated only the first spring after collection, seeds sown on soil in the nonheated greenhouse germinated the following four springs. In the field, plants from seeds in the seed bank died when allowed to compete with established rosettes, but 3% survived and set seeds when rosettes were removed.																	0885-8608					OCT	1992	12	4					191	197									WOS:A1992JW78100003

In each forest habitat, half of the transplanted seedlings were protected from vertebrates by means of wire cages, and survival was monitored over 16 months. The main objective was to estimate the extent to which independent variables (forest, habitat, protection from vertebrates, and species) contribute to explaining survival differences among the seedlings. Significant differences existed in the mortality among species, whether caged or uncaged. Seedlings unprotected from vertebrates suffered greater mortality (i.e. averaged over all species and forests, mortality > 75%), compared to the caged seedlings (mortality < 40%). Seedling of most species survived better in forest gaps, though the effects varied significantly among the six species. Survival of caged seedlings in Curtain Fig was significantly greater than in Lamins Hill, a pattern attributed to the partial deciduousness of the Curtain Fig forest. Because only few of the uncaged seedlings survived to 16 months, we focussed on the caged seedlings to examine the role of light at the forest habitats on survival. Relationship between seedling mortality and increasing light availability vary significantly among the six species. However across species, seedling mortality decreased linearly as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) rose from 0.48 to 2.0%, after which an asymptote was reached and further increase in light (up to 8% PAR) did not influence survival significantly. Overall, temporal, species and the various environmental variables and their interactions explained about 60% of the variations in the seedling mortality data, with protection and species differences making the greatest contributions.

This study investigated the impacts of harvesting on seed bank size and seed set of Protea susannae Phill., P. obtusifolia Beuk ex Meisn., Leucadendron coniferum (L.) Meisn. and L. meridianum I. Williams. Harvesting of inflorescences or cones by the stem-cutting method reduced the following season's infructescence (called 'cones') production in all species except P. susannae. Remaining current year cones of the harvested Protea spp. had greater insect predation levels, and unaltered or lower seed set, than those of unharvested plants. The seed set findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that seed numbers are nutrient-limited, since inflorescence harvesting represents a sink removal, and increased nutrients remaining in the plant would be available for increased seed set. Since repeated annual harvesting of 70% of current year inflorescences or fruit was estimated to result in severe seed bank depletion, it is suggested that lower levels of harvesting (not more than 50% of current inflorescences or cones) be performed in alternate years.																	0254-6299					OCT	1992	58	5					337	342		10.1016/S0254-6299(16)30819-5							WOS:A1992JU57400006

Schwant., Rhinephyllum macradenium (L. Bol.) Schwant. and Drosanthemum montaguense L. Bol. was studied at the Tierberg Karoo Research Centre in the Prince Albert district of the southern Karoo. Variation in capsule and seed numbers was recorded over three sampling periods representing different seed production events. In addition, the soil seed bank was investigated, as well as capsule opening rates and seed germination behaviour. Generally, there was a decline in capsule and seed numbers with time, suggesting that the canopy-stored seed bank is limited to the current year's seed production. Large soil seed banks did not appear to be characteristic of the species studied. Our estimates of seed production were larger than estimates of other researchers, possibly due to time of data collection. Our findings are related to the community structure and dynamics of the vegetation on the study site.

Data were collected from 45 sites and two sampling depths (0-20 cm and 21-40 cm). Soil seed content was highly variable, ranging from 1660 to 53 371 seeds m-2, with an average value of 10391 seeds m-2 and a median of 5500 seeds m-2. Seed stock was lower than 2000 seeds m-2 in 6.6% of the sites and over 10000 in 26.6%. Six species were found in more than 50% of the sites, representing 27.7% of the total stock: Anagallis arvensis L., Chenopodium album L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv., Amaranthus spp., Polygonum persicaria L. + P. lapathifolium L. Overall, 63 species were recorded, the species number per site ranging from 4 to 25, with a median value of 11. Therophytes accounted for 90.6% of the species and 94.3% of individuals. Of the species, 39.8% were assignable to the summer, 21.9% to the spring, 8.1% to the winter and 5.3% to the autumn germinating group, and 24.9% were non-seasonal. Simpson's dominance index for PF ranged from 0.11 to 0.525, with an average value of 0.21 and a median of 0.195. The Shannon-diversity index had a range of 1.15-2.43, with an average value of 1.93 and a median of 1.91. In some cases (13.3%) compensation phenomena are evident, sustained by different species from site to site. These results form the basis of a discussion on the effectiveness and the limits of management strategies designed to reduce soil seed stock.																	0043-1737					OCT	1992	32	5					407	418		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1992.tb01902.x							WOS:A1992JT06800010

The composition of the weed flora in 'jhum' and terrace fields was similar, however, the population density was generally higher in the former. Weed seedlings appeared at three different times during both autumn and summer cropping seasons, giving rise to three distinct cohorts. The overall pattern of weed seedling emergence differed among cohorts and from species to species. The effect of cropping season on mortality patterns of seedling cohorts was not significant. For all weed species early cohorts showed high mortality during the 45 days after emergence, but in the third cohort mortality rate was almost constant throughout life. During the cropping period, seedling recruitment rate (K) and fecundity rate (F) were higher in terrace than in 'jhum', but the survivorship (P) was greater in the latter. High annual rate of increase in weed seeds (lambda) in soil and low seedling recruitment rate appear to be the main causes of larger weed-seed populations in 'jhum' fields compared with the terraces. The larger soil seed bank in 'jhum' than in terrace eventually contributed to a larger weed population in the former.																	0167-8809					SEP	1992	41	3-4					285	295		10.1016/0167-8809(92)90116-S							WOS:A1992JM90000005

Banksia spp. have been introduced only recently to fynbos regions. The invasive potential of Banksia ericifolia (Proteaceae) was investigated by comparing its recruitment potential with that of an indigenous proteaceous shrub, Leucadendron laureolum. Both species are overstorey shrubs that are killed by fire and rely on canopy-stored seeds (serotiny) for recruitment. Eight year old B. ericifolia shrubs produced an average of 16 500 seeds per plant, which is thirty times more than the average of 570 seeds produced by 10 year old L. laureolum shrubs. The seed bank of B. ericifolia was not only larger than that of L. laureolum (1098 vs 525 viable seeds m-2 projected canopy cover), but also considerably larger than that described for the species in its native environment (200-330 seeds m-2 in a 9 year old stand north of Sydney). Leucadendron laureoleum released most of its seed a few days after the cones were burnt, whereas seed release in B. ericifolia was spread over 12 weeks. The seeds of B. ericifolia had lower wingloading and fall rates than L. laureolum and were dispersed over greater distances. The relative seedling growth rates of the two species were very similar (0.03 g per day), but below-ground biomass was greater and proteoid roots were more developed in B. ericifolia seedlings than in L. laureolum after 100 days. Four year old B. ericifolia plants growing in the field had attained over twice the height of indigenous proteoids and accumulated up to 10 times the fresh biomass of L. xanthoconus, a species which is ecologically similar to L. laureolum. The Bioclimatic Prediction System (BIOCLIM) Was used to create a bioclimatic profile of B. ericifolia and identify climatically suitable areas in the Cape Province. Results show that its potential distribution covers most fynbos areas in the southwestern Cape. It is concluded that B. ericifolia has the potential to be highly invasive in fynbos.

These species belonged to three different ecological classes: (i) upper marsh species (Carex atherodes, Scolochloa festucacea, and Phragmites australis) that occupy sections of the water-depth gradient that are only seasonally flooded in the Delta Marsh; (ii) lower marsh species (Typha glauca and Scirpus lacutris spp. glaucus) that occupy permanently flooded areas; and (iii) drawdown species (Scirpus lacustris spp. validus and Scirpus maritimus) that become established temporarily during drawdowns. Upper marsh species could not adjust their shoot length if they were growing in water deeper than 20 cm. Lower marsh species were able to do this in water up to 70 cm deep. All three types survived for 1 or 2 years in water too deep for long-term persistence. Scirpus species survived as tubers in areas with water too deep for them to grow. The distributions of the seven species in the experiments overlapped considerably, and all species cooccurred at water depths to 70 cm after 2 years of flooding. The predicted distribution in the four dominant species along a water-depth gradient were consistent with their actual distributions in the Delta Marsh, but their predicted distributions overlapped much more than is the case in the field.																	0008-4026					SEP	1992	70	9					1860	1867		10.1139/b92-230							WOS:A1992JV97900019

The desert fringe with (a) high variability of rain (60-70% of annual mean), (b) low quantities of rain (50-100 mmyr-1), and (c) prevailing precipitation type rain rather than fog, proved most conducive to serotiny. Serotinous plants were most common in habitats where run-off accumulated, such as foothills of mountains, pans and channels, and on plains. Temporal and spatial variation of water availability, as well as intense rains and run-off, both inducing seed dispersal by water, might explain the abundance of serotinous plants at the desert fringe.																	0305-0270					SEP	1992	19	5					563	572		10.2307/2845775							WOS:A1992KL47300010

The dispersal is autochorous, anemochorous and epizoochorous independent of the life-cycle (annuals, perennials). Dispersal distances were estimated experimentally. Anemochorous species with a plume-like spikelet such as Chloris virgata and Enneapogon cenchroides have a low rate of descent (< 1 m s-1) and a low Reynold number (100-110). Nevertheless they can only be transported up to 13 m from the originating infructescence at a wind velocity of 10 m s-1. Therefore, the majority of the disseminules remained near the parent plant. By analysing the seed pool under the canopy of trees of Dichrostachys cinerea epizoochorous species such as Tragus berteronianus were dominant at the cattle resting sites under trees. The results are discussed in relation to the three seed dispersal hypotheses and the model of selective interaction of dispersal, dormancy, and seed site as adaptions to variable environments.

J	MCKNIGHT, SK				MCKNIGHT, SK			TRANSPLANTED SEED BANK RESPONSE TO DRAWDOWN TIME IN A CREATED WETLAND IN EAST TEXAS	WETLANDS												Sediment was transplanted from a 13-yr-old created wetland on a nonacid mine in east Texas into a constructed experimental basin to examine seed bank response to 4 drawdown regimes. The experimental basin was flooded following sediment transplantation in February, and surface water was later removed in April, June, and August. The success of the transplanted seed bank in vegetating the experimental wetland was assessed by measuring species richness, seedling density, and above-ground biomass. April drawdown produced the greatest species richness (29), stem density (1851.0 stems m-2), and above-ground biomass (769.3 g m-2), followed by the unflooded water regime. June and August drawdowns produced less emergent vegetation than the other treatments, but 3 submergent species were produced prior to drawdowns. Results indicate that use of transplanted species-rich wetland soil subjected to early spring drawdown is a very effective technique for establishing wetland vegetation on disturbed sites in east Texas. In addition, re-establishment of vegetation in the donor wetland was assessed by comparing percent cover in disturbed plots to undisturbed plots. Disturbed plots achieved 66.0 percent cover after 10 months following soil removal compared to 96.3 percent cover in undisturbed plots. Disturbed plots were dominated by vegetatively reproducing species and contained very few annuals. Excavating relatively few widely-spaced narrow strips of soil from the donor wetland caused only slight decreases in vegetative cover during the subsequent growing season.																	0277-5212					SEP	1992	12	2					79	90		10.1007/BF03160589							WOS:A1992JN10800003						
J	BROWN, D				BROWN, D			ESTIMATING THE COMPOSITION OF A FOREST SEED BANK - A COMPARISON OF THE SEED EXTRACTION AND SEEDLING EMERGENCE METHODS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The composition of a forest seed bank was estimated using two methods: (i) seed extraction, i.e., the physical separation of the seeds from the soil via flotation in a salt solution, and (ii) seedling emergence, i.e., the germination of seedlings from soil samples incubated under greenhouse conditions for 5 months. The extraction method predicted a density of 12 500 seeds.m-2, while the emergence method detected 3800 emergents.m-2. There was considerable disparity in species composition derived from the two methods. The extraction method identified 102 different taxa, with 22 species making up 99% of the seeds and 5.6 +/- 0.2 species per sample. In contrast, the emergence technique identified fewer species (60) but had more species per sample (7.6 +/- 0.2). Eleven species made up 99% of the emergents. Verbascum thapsus represented 34% of the seedlings in the emergence study but only 1% of the extracted seeds. Members of the Polygonaceae represented 19% of the extracted seeds but less than 1% of the seedling emergents. No tree or shrub species were found with the emergence method, although they represented 8% of the extracted seeds. There was a poor correlation between the estimates of species number, seed density, and diversity obtained from the two methods. The seed extraction method had considerably higher variability for these parameters. It is apparent from this study that the seedling emergence and seed extraction methodologies do not produce similar estimates of the seed bank composition. The differences are such that comparisons should not be drawn between studies using the different methods. Careful considerations should be given to both the objectives of the seed bank study and the relevant literature prior to the selection of an appropriate method.																	0008-4026					AUG	1992	70	8					1603	1612		10.1139/b92-202							WOS:A1992JT71300013

Effects of daylength (8 h vs. 16 h) and temperature (range 32/17-degrees-C-17/12-degrees-C) on growth and flowering were examined under controlled conditions. E. geniculata has a quantitative short-day flowering response, e.g. short days advanced flowering by c. 3 weeks compared to long days. Growth and flowering were strongly inhibited by temperatures lower than 22/17-degrees-C. Seedlings have a strong potential for regeneration after injury to the apical bud, due to the production of numerous hypocotyledonary adventitious buds. Temporal changes in seed dormancy were examined in five different populations infesting cotton fields. Only two populations had primary dormancy after seed dispersal, and this disappeared completely after c. 10 months of dry storage. Seed viability of dry stored seeds was relatively short, e.g. less than 5% of the seeds germinated after 14 or 40 months in the least or most dormant populations, respectively. Patterns of germination and seedling emergence in the field were determined mainly by water availability and periods of low temperature. No cyclic changes in dormancy were found in buried seeds. It is proposed that, in E. geniculata, the absence of prolonged seed dormancy, short seed longevity and relatively small seed output will result in a limited transient seed-bank.																	0043-1737					AUG	1992	32	4					317	328		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1992.tb01892.x							WOS:A1992JJ99500009						
J	LEDIG, FT; KITZMILLER, JH				LEDIG, FT; KITZMILLER, JH			GENETIC STRATEGIES FOR REFORESTATION IN THE FACE OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												If global warming materializes as projected, natural or artificial regeneration of forests with local seed sources will become increasingly difficult. However, global warming is far from a certainty and predictions of its magnitude and timing vary at least twofold. In the face of such uncertainty, reforestation strategies should emphasize conservation, diversification, and broader deployment of species, seed sources, and families. Planting programs may have to deploy non-local seed sources, imported from further south or from lower elevations, which necessitates a system for conserving native gene pools in seed banks or clone banks. Planting a diverse array of species or seed sources is a hedge against the uncertainty inherent in current projections of warming. Most tree improvement programs already stress genetic diversity and deployment of multi-progeny mixes, but may better prepare for climate change by testing selections in an even wider set of environments than is now the case.																	0378-1127					JUL 15	1992	50	1-2					153	169									WOS:A1992JG91100011

Total seed densities (2252 to 4409 seeds/m2) did not differ among grazing treatments, but did vary seasonally. Species composition varied among treatments. Heavy continuous grazing had a high proportion of early-seral, annual-dicot taxa, whereas the ungrazed treatment had a high proportion of late-seral, perennial-monocot taxa. Seeds of late-successional midgrass species (e.g., Bouteloua curtipendula, Eriochloa sericea) were not stored in the soil of any treatment and appeared to be transient. Many other species appeared to maintain persistent seed banks, including seeds of the current mid-successional dominant shortgrass, Hilaria belangeri. Similarity of composition between germinable seeds in the soil and existing plant communities was low. Soil seed bank is a primary control of secondary succession in these grasslands, and absence of late-successional species in the seed bank impairs the rate of succession.																	0003-0031					JUL	1992	128	1					11	21		10.2307/2426408							WOS:A1992JE30400002

Germination response during and after chill was correlated with collection site climate. Seeds from sites with colder winters had longer chill requirements and were slower to germinate in continuous chill than seeds from sites with warmer winters. Seeds from variable-winter sites tended to have a large fraction not responsive to chill. Such site-specific responses may function to time germination appropriately and also to provide for between-year seed carry-over in this short-lived perennial species. Field retrieval studies supported these conclusions.																	0040-9618					JUL-SEP	1992	119	3					268	279		10.2307/2996758							WOS:A1992JQ81100003

The results tested by t-test showed non-significant differences in both cases. Two transects from the balk to the neighbouring field were examined for evaluating the influence of a balk seed rain into the field. Eight soil samples were taken at distances of 5 m from each transect. A presupposition of the decrease of species diversity and seed numbers in the soil from the balk to the field was not verified. The balk probably is not an important donor of weed seeds but can serve as a source of higher species diversity.

J	FAENSENTHIEBES, A				FAENSENTHIEBES, A			THE ECOLOGY OF MELILOTUS-ALBA L .3. THE LIFE-CYCLE	FLORA												The relative importance of the biennial life cycle of Melilotus alba for its distribution is investigated in the light of its typical habitats. Therefore the exact development in the life-course and its dependence on climatic factors is described. The stages of germination and flowering have been examined in detail. The experimental results show a broad ecological amplitude in the conditions for germination: the latter is hindered only by a continuously decreasing time-dependent seed dormancy. This dormancy leads to an important soil seed bank. Flowering is independent of the biomass of a single plant, and starts in each case in the second year. This flowering leads to the death of the plant. This behaviour is strictly biennial and is different to the behaviour of other, 'biennials' which often are growing on the same sites as Melilotus, but which do not start flowering until they have reached a certain minimum weight. The connection of this life-cycle with a certain ecophysiological adaptation in the characteristic of gas-exchange makes it possible for Melilotus to compete successfully with perennial species on those sites where their productivity is low because of temporary drought.																	0367-2530					JUL	1992	186	5-6					377	391									WOS:A1992JE14900006						
J	FUJITA, H				FUJITA, H			HARDSEEDEDNESS DEVELOPMENT OF LOTONONIS-BAINESII AND ITS BREAKDOWN	JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY												Hardseededness development and its breakdown of Lotononis bainesii grown with Digitaria decumbens, at Mt. Cotton, southeast Queensland in Australia, were investigated. Strong hierarchical development of hardseededness took place within the next 6 days following the apparent cessation of embryo development, where germination and hardseededness of collected seeds were negatively correlated with each other with time. The further hardseededness development in standing plants was observed and this inherent attribute of hardseededness development was considered as one of the constraints for the plant replacement through the seedling recruitment, since the natural release of germination was found not reliable even with a high density of soil seed bank. The controlled fire contributed hardseededness breakdown but also killed the associated grass and a considerable proportion of soil seed reserves, depending on the intensity of the fire and the soil seed distribution, which affect replacement of plants.																	0021-3551					JUL	1992	26	1					41	47									WOS:A1992JU54800007

Over 60% of all weed seed in the top 19 cm of soil were found in the top 1 cm in no-tillage at both sites. As depth increased, concentration of weed seed declined logarithmically in notillage. In chisel plowing, over 30% of seed were in the top 1 cm and seed concentration decreased linearly with depth. Moldboard plowing had uniform distribution of weed seed in the top 19 cm of soil. Preemergence metolachlor plus atrazine decreased weed seed population by 50% compared with no treatment over all tillage systems. One year of the herbicide treatment plus handweeding to assure weed-free conditions did not reduce seed numbers in chisel plowing or moldboard plowing compared to herbicide alone. Seed numbers with no-tillage and weed-free conditions decreased by 40% relative to herbicide alone. Common lambsquarters germination was 40% greater in moldboard plowing and chisel plowing compared with no-tillage. Germination was highest in seed taken from 9 to 19 cm deep in moldboard plowing and from 0 to 9 cm deep in chisel plowing.																	0043-1745					JUL-SEP	1992	40	3					429	433		10.1017/S0043174500051869							WOS:A1992JQ66600015

Perennial halophytic shrubs dominated vegetation and the buried seed bank. Existing vegetation and seed bank flora showed a marked similarity. The seed densities of Cressa cretica, Salsola baryosma and Haloxylon recurvum varied with growing season, showing the transient nature of seed bank.

Seed persistence was quantified by creating experimental seed banks in the field with seeds of known age. Survival and fecundities of adult plant stages were determined in quadrats of naturally occurring individuals in the field population. Bootstrapping was applied to the resulting data set to estimate means and 95% confidence intervals for population growth rate, stable age distributions, reproductive values, and elasticities. Analyses were performed to determine the extent of variation in these demographic parameters between two consecutive years and between three transects within each year. The results indicate that the presence of a seed bank, even of short duration, was critical to the demography of this population. The population was expanding rapidly in the 1st yr of the study (growth rate 1.80), but was declining during the 2nd yr (0.4 1). While the seed bank was demographically important in some transects during the good year (Year 1), the demographic effects of the seed bank were seen most significantly in the poor year (Year 2). The results of this study indicate the need for including age-structured seed banks in demographic analyses and the potential importance of seeds in age-structured seed banks in the shaping of plant life histories.																	0012-9658					JUN	1992	73	3					1082	1093		10.2307/1940182							WOS:A1992HU76700032

Randomness of the spatial distribution of genotypes was tested at four isozyme loci in adult plants and fertilizing pollen by spatial autocorrelation statistics. At the inland site, significant aggregation of an identical allele was observed at two loci each in 1988 and 1989 for adult plants. At these loci, aggregation of an allele was observed also for pollen cloud. The aggregation, however, was not stable; the loci which showed significant aggregation differed in two successive seasons. These observations can be interpreted either by limited but moderate pollen dispersal or the great variation in fertility among the adult plants. The latter accidentally causes aggregation of identical alleles. At the beach site, the seed bank was disturbed by tractors for fishing work, and this led to a random distribution of alleles.																	0021-504X					JUN	1992	67	3					209	216		10.1266/jjg.67.209							WOS:A1992JT69400003						
J	SKOGLUND, J				SKOGLUND, J			THE ROLE OF SEED BANKS IN VEGETATION DYNAMICS AND RESTORATION OF DRY TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												This paper reviews studies on seed banks in tropical dry vegetation and, for comparison, some wet tropical and dry subtropical vegetation. A first general conclusion is that tropical seed banks are smaller than those in temperature ecosystems. Many studies are devoted to only one species, among which are several Acacia species, both tropical and subtropical, some of which reach densities in the seed bank of up to 10 000 seeds/m2. The lesser importance of the seed bank strategy in tropical species may be related to higher risks of seed loss through higher mortality (fire, predation, pathogens etc.), or to intermittent germination occasions in relation to ephemeral favourable conditions (e.g. rains during the dry season). Regarding vegetation dynamics, the importance of seed banks and regeneration from seeds is most pronounced in larger forest gaps. Examples are discussed of rapid succession to forest of savannas after protection from fire, which is partly due to regeneration from the seed bank. The significance of seed banks in vegetation restoration projects is outlined and the need for additional sowing of seeds of important species underlined.																	1100-9233					JUN	1992	3	3					357	360		10.2307/3235760							WOS:A1992JF60400008

Canada. Introduced weedy species. such as Tanacetum vulgare L., bad up to a 10-fold greater emergence at high temperature (30-degrees-C for 18 h with light. 15-degrees-C for 6 h in the dark) than at low temperature (20/10-degrees-C). Seedling emergence of native weedy species, such as Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv., was 1.5-3 times greater at low temperature. Other native weedy species. such as Rubus idaeus L., emerged only from samples at low temperature. Emergence of native non-weedy species was greatest at high temperature, even though mature plants of species such as Ranunculus hyperboreus Rottb. and Carex eburnea Boott are normally found in cool and moist habitats. Of those species expected to persist in warm and dry habitats. only introduced weedy species showed consistent and significantly greater seedling emergence at high temperature. It is hypothesized, therefore. that the abundance of introduced weedy species would increase in disturbed or sparsely vegetated zones around water bodies as these zones become dry and warm with climate change.

J	SCHIFFMAN, PM; JOHNSON, WC				SCHIFFMAN, PM; JOHNSON, WC			SPARSE BURIED SEED BANK IN A SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN OAK FOREST - IMPLICATIONS FOR SUCCESSION	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Samples of leaf litter, humus and surface soil were collected from sites on six steep NE-facing slopes to determine the density and species composition of the buried seed bank on Brush Mountain (Jefferson National Forest, Montgomery Co., Va.) and its potential contribution to postdisturbance forest regeneration. An average of only 0.43 seeds/m2 was found at the sites, with significantly more seeds occurring in the humus layer than either the leaf litter or soil. Seeds of forest herbs were more common than those of forest trees, forest shrubs or even ruderals. There were also differences in seed density and species composition among sites. These results were unexpected, and probably due to the cumulative long-term effects of a variety of factors including: (1) the lack of past cultivation; (2) past low-intensity ground fires; (3) the scarcity of nearby sources of ruderal and early-successional seeds, and (4) the inherently short longevities of seeds of forest species. The sparse seed bank, particularly the virtual absence of seeds of early successional species, indicates that succession should be strongly dependent upon vegetative reproduction and postdisturbance seed dispersal.																	0003-0031					APR	1992	127	2					258	267		10.2307/2426532							WOS:A1992HP07900006						
J	ERIKSSON, O				ERIKSSON, O			EVOLUTION OF SEED DISPERSAL AND RECRUITMENT IN CLONAL PLANTS	OIKOS												Previous studies have shown that seedling recruitment occurs sporadically in the population dynamics of many clonal plant species, and that a low rate of seed recruitment is associated with high seed dispersal ability. The aim of the present study was to examine these features of clonal plant life histories from an evolutionary point of view. No significant relationships were detected between recruitment pattern, seed size, seed dispersal, and possession of seed bank. However, a tendency was found that species characterized by a persistent seed bank, lack of seed dispersal traits, or repeated seedling recruitment, possess smaller seeds than do other clonal species. Distributions of fruit and life form characters in 35 genera of clonal plants indicated that traits affecting seed dispersal generally are evolutionarily ancestral in relation to the clonal growth form possessed by extant species. This sequence was found in 32 genera whereas the opposite sequence was found in 3 genera. Thus, seed dispersal features have not evolved as a result of recruitment difficulties in the vicinity of adult plants possessing the extant clonal life form. It is suggested that clonal propagation may have been augmented in lineages where long distance seed dispersal predominates, in order to make genet fitness less dependent on local dispersal by seed. A low rate of seedling recruitment within patches of adult plants is the expected outcome of this scenario. Finally. some aspects of how long term environmental changes may affect seedling recruitment in clonal plants are briefly discussed.																	0030-1299					APR	1992	63	3					439	448		10.2307/3544970							WOS:A1992HU36500013

The area was divided into three zones, one of which was dominated by a vine (Ipomoea sp.). Soil samples (10.1 cm. diam. x 12 cm deep) from each zone were placed in the greenhouse at two light intensities: total and at 50 %. Field plots (1 m2) were also established at each of the zones and analyzed a year later. Samples and plots were dominated by herbaceous species with few trees and a very low correlation with the actual vegetation. At 50 % light intensity, less than 11 % of the total individuals were present. The site with Ipomoea sp. showed a strong reduction in the number of individuals: 30 to 84 % less when compared with the other zones. The progressive elimination of Ipomoea (by opening small clearings and planting native tree species) would promote vegetation development and increase diversity.																	0034-7744					APR	1992	40	1					7	10									WOS:A1992JD63400002

Five agricultural plots were selected and the seed banks analysed. A simulation study of the relationship between the relative accuracy and the size of the compound sample (number of soil cores) showed (1) that the hypothesis of normality of the distribution of the species means was true for only about 30% of the sets when the compound sample size was 30 and for about 75% of the sets when the size was 150, (2) that the relative accuracy was dependent partly on the size of the compound sample and partly on the mean number of seeds per soil core, and (3) that there was an exponential relationship between relative accuracy and the mean number of seeds per soil core for the various experimental plots.

In one study, after 72 mo, 0 to 96% germinable achenes remained in packets buried 5 cm deep, and a mean above 99% after dry storage. In another study, total live (germinable plus viable) achenes declined from 100% at harvest to 77.6% after 24 mo of burial. Germinable pappus-bearing achenes remaining in packets increased with depth of burial. After 12 mo of burial, maximum survival of achenes occurred at depths of 5 cm or more. The density of yellow starthistle achenes and seedlings in a natural soil seed bank declined, when achene rain was prevented, to 3.9 and 1.1% of initial density, respectively, after 36 mo. Decline was attributed primarily to seedling emergence and achene death. Achene density in the upper 2.5 cm of soil appeared to be a good predictor of seedling emergence after autumn rains.																	0043-1745					APR-JUN	1992	40	2					190	194									WOS:A1992JC08300005

The effects of gap size, soil surface conditions and competition from advance regeneration were assessed. Recruitment during the first two years was less than 100 seedlings m-2, or less than 5% of the estimated seed bank in the top 5 cm of the soil prior to disturbance. Overall, germination was not obviously affected by gap size, but was increased markedly, by soil exposure or disturbance. The diversity of the colonizing vegetation at the end of two years appeared to be negatively related to gap size. Seedling mortality was less both at larger gap size and in the absence of competition from advance regeneration, whereas the opposite appeared true for seedling growth. The results indicate that gap size is unlikely to influence the composition of colonizing vegetation by controlling seed germination, but an effect operating through differential mortality cannot be discounted.																	0962-8436					MAR 30	1992	335	1275					357	366		10.1098/rstb.1992.0027							WOS:A1992HN46100004

LOBELIA-INFLATA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Lobelia inflata L. is a weedy species that may be abundant in disturbed forest sites. Temperature and light requirements for germination were determined at 12-h daily thermoperiods of 15:6, 20:10, 25:15, 30:15, and 35:20-degrees-C for seeds exhumed after 0-28 months (September 1987 to February 1990) of burial in soil at near-natural temperatures. At maturity in autumn 1987, 2 - 15% of the seeds germinated after 15 days incubation at the five thermoperiods in light but 0% germinated in darkness. By January 1988, 68- 100% of the seeds germinated in light at all thermoperiods except 15:6-degrees-C. Germination at 20:10, 25:15, and 30:15-degrees-C did not decrease to below 60% during the remainder of the study, and germination at 35:20-degrees-C was less than 60% only four times. Germination at 15:6-degrees-C was erratic with peaks in spring 1988, and in spring to early summer and autumn 1989. Regardless of the season in which seeds were exhumed, they did not germinate in darkness. In a laboratory study, stratification at 5-degrees-C broke dormancy but did not substitute for the light requirement. Seeds of L. inflata have the potential to form long-lived seed banks and buried seeds can germinate at any time during the growing season if exposed to light.																	0008-4026					MAR	1992	70	3					589	592		10.1139/b92-075							WOS:A1992HX31400017

In this study seed was harvested from six native and four seeded populations during two consecutive years. In laboratory germination trials at constant 15 C, considerable between-lot variation in primary dormancy and light requirement was observed. Four weeks of moist chilling (1 C) induced secondary dormancy was reversed by one week of dark incubation at 30 C. This warm incubation treatment also reduced the light requirement of unchilled, after-ripened seed. Fluctuations in dormancy and light requirement of buried seeds have been linked to seasonal changes in soil temperature. Penstemon palmeri germination responses to temperature appear to be similar to those of facultative winter annuals.																	0017-3614					MAR	1992	52	1					53	58									WOS:A1992HV84100007						
J	BERTILLER, MB				BERTILLER, MB			SEASONAL-VARIATION IN THE SEED BANK OF A PATAGONIAN GRASSLAND IN RELATION TO GRAZING AND TOPOGRAPHY	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The germinable seed bank of Festuca spp., Carex patagonica, and other annuals and perennials in a semiarid Patagonian grassland was analyzed every three months. The effects of grazing, topography and microsites with respect to established grass tussocks on the germinable-seed bank were also analyzed. The total germinable-seed bank was larger in summer after seed rain. At this time of the year most of the seeds were from annuals and perennial dicots. Seeds of the dominant Festuca spp. were the main components of the graminoid seed bank, which was homogeneously distributed in patches of bare soil. In spring, i.e. some months after the seed rain, the germinable-seed bank of most of the species was greatly reduced, while the seed bank of Carex patogonica did not change significantly. At this time of the year, the graminoid seed bank was heterogeneously distributed in space, with the seeds accumulating in wind-protected microsites. In the grazing treatments, the seed bank of the perennial grasses was reduced proportionally to the decrease of the plant cover. On the other hand, the germinable-seed bank of C. patagonica increased with the grazing treatments, in relation to the increase of vegetation cover. Topographical position had two types of effect on the seed bank of perennial grasses. One was the increase of the germinable-seed bank, after the seed rain, on the relatively warmer northeast facing slopes, which was related to a higher seed rain in these places. The other was an increased seed loss on slopes. The different seed-bank strategies observed in this grassland are compared and discussed in relation to strategies described for other grasslands.																	1100-9233					FEB	1992	3	1					47	54		10.2307/3235997							WOS:A1992HM83300007

This initial idea forms the basis for a variety of mathematical models, but has not been tested empirically. This study is a field investigation of lottery establishment for plants with a seed bank, using Canonical Correspondence Analysis to compare the compositions of the vegetation and the seed bank according to different hypotheses on the mechanisms of establishment. This method was used for a data set from old fields from southern France. The weighted lottery (i.e. a random draw from the seed pool, weighted by the frequencies of each species) appeared as the best suited hypothesis to explain the high degree of similarity between the vegetation and the seed bank and the relative spatial distributions of the species. Several mechanisms are probably interacting, depending on the life histories of the species. Modelling and experimental approaches are needed to further test the hypothesis of lottery recruitment.																	1100-9233					FEB	1992	3	1					91	100		10.2307/3236002							WOS:A1992HM83300012

For every location and species of crop and weed, a mean/variance pair was calculated. The relationship between these two parameters was significantly influenced by crop and, to a lesser extent, by site, but not by species of weed. The goodness of fit of the negative binomial distribution to the samples was assessed. Its k exponent was estimated on the basis of the observed variance/mean regression. A good fit was found for weed populations with fewer than 10 plants m-2. The applicability of a sequential sampling procedure based on the negative binomial distribution to a weed control strategy that uses a threshold density is discussed.

An alternative method is applied here for the submerged plant communities of the seasonally-flooded oligohaline marshes of the Camargue. It consists of collecting undisturbed sediment samples with their contained intact seed bank, and submitting them to different salinities. The study of total biomass and of the biomass of the more frequent species was carried out using parametric tests. The precision of the results depended on the frequency of the species in the replicates. When the frequency was low, non-parametric statistics were necessary. The method seems to be particularly suitable for the study of communities of annual species in aquatic environments.																	0018-8158					JAN 17	1992	228	1					29	36		10.1007/BF00006473							WOS:A1992HE11300004

The number of seedlings established per parent in 1986 (0 to 3 years after fire) ranged from 0.09 on a dune crest to 3.92 on a dune slope and 3.28 in the swale. Seedling survival level between 1986 and 1990 was negatively correlated with relative elevation of sites so that by 1990 number of seedlings per parent was greatest in the swale (1.94) and zero on the dune crests. Non-sprouting congeners showed good recruitment at all sites, although species identity of the non-sprouters varied across the topographic gradient. Survival of seedlings of B. attenuata, and congeneric species, in experimentally sown plots over the first summer was much lower at the crest than at either the swale or slope sites. Soil water availability over summer was greatest in the swale and least at the crest, where both XPP and SC were already low by early summer. The similarity of patterns for both seedling survival and water availability over summer indicates that summer drought stress plays a major role in determining the relative importance of seedling recruitment along topographic gradients at Mt Adams following fire. It is suggested that this topographic effect provides an analog to temporal variations in conditions for recruitment following fire; recruitment of new individuals on dune crests will be restricted to the rare coincidence of fire and above average rainfall in the following years. Population maintenance on dune crests here, and coexistence with non-sprouter congeners, is primarily due to the high adult survival rate which enables the population to survive long periods which are unfavourable for recruitment (the storage effect sensu WARNER & CHESSON, 1985).

The treatments, continuous grazing, yearly mowing and control (without grazing or mowing), all with and without yearly fertilizer application, were applied to plots on two soil types. Fertilized control plots had the fewest species in both vegetation and seed bank while the most were found in the unfertilized grazed and mowed plots. Despite large losses of species from the vegetation in some treatments, few of the species lost were found in the seed bank. Of the 48 taxa identified from the seed bank, only Alchemilla sp., Hypericum maculatum, Luzula sp., Saxifraga granulata, Urtica dioica and Veronica sp. had large persistent seed banks and most species seemed to have short-lived seeds. Hence, it is unlikely that the seed bank in this grassland is of value for the restoration of species-rich vegetation.

Quantitative insight into the behavior of the crop-weed system is needed to develop weed management systems. Recently, eco-physiological simulation models for crop-weed competition were introduced. These models simulate growth and production of species in mixtures, based on physiological processes in plants and their response to the environment. Such models help improve insight into the crop-weed system and can be used to develop simple predictive models for practical application. Several simple regression models for early prediction of yield loss by weeds have been developed. Recently, an approach has been developed in which the relative leaf cover of the weeds shortly after crop emergence is directly related to final yield loss. This approach has high potential as a predictive tool in weed control advisory systems. For strategic weed management activities, quantitative insight into the dynamics of weed populations is required However, many processes, such as seed bank dynamics, are not yet adequately understood to allow accurate prediction of future weed populations. The use of systems approaches to bridge the gap between weed science research and practical weed management is discussed.

Multiple regression, principal component, and cluster analyses were used to relate 14 attributes of the medics to persistence in the seed bank of grazed pasture growing in rotation with wheat. Principal component analysis distinguished between the attributes of the species. For example, M. rigidula had short petioles, high frost tolerance, many seeds per pod, and large leaves and seeds; while M. polymorpha had long petioles, low frost tolerance, few seeds per pod, and small seeds and leaves. M. noeana produced many flowers per raceme, small pods and seeds, long peduncles, and was hard-seeded and late flowering; while M. aculeata produced few flowers per raceme, large pods and seeds, short peduncles, and was soft-seeded and early flowering. M. truncatula and M. rotata were intermediate. Long peduncles and high levels of hardseededness were the attributes most closely associated with persistence of the medics in grazed pasture. It was concluded that (1) long peduncles place the flowers above the canopy in spring where they are in full sun light, and (2) hardseededness levels of up to 90% protect seeds against germination in the cereal year. The results also suggest that small leaves and short internodes and petioles protect young plants against over-grazing in winter, and small pods and seeds are less likely than large pods and seeds to be selected and digested by grazing sheep in summer.																	0004-9409	1836-5795					1992	43	7					1559	1570		10.1071/AR9921559							WOS:A1992JR39500009						
J	COCKS, PS				COCKS, PS			CHANGES IN THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE SEED BANK OF MEDIC PASTURES GROWN IN ROTATION WITH WHEAT IN NORTH SYRIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												A mixture of 84 accessions of 12 medic (Medicago) species were sown in two successive years into a two-course pasture/wheat rotation in north Syria. Changes in the size and botanical composition of the seed bank were monitored for two cycles of the rotation. At the end of the first year the seed bank consisted of 550 kg ha-1 (sowing 1) and 330 kg ha-1 (sawing 2) of medic seed. Subsequent grazing reduced these seed banks to 225 kg ha-1 and 255 kg ha-1 respectively. and germination in the following wheat crop further reduced it to 205 kg ha-1 and 150 kg ha-1. The seed banks reached 700 kg ha-1 and 790 kg ha-1 respectively, during the second pasture phase of the rotation. The seedling density of medics in the regenerating pasture was 750 m-2 (sowing 1) and 1120 m-2 (sowing 2). Medics comprised about 95% of the pasture by mid-spring in both phases, the remaining 5% being wheat and broad-leaved weeds. The productivity of regenerating pasture was 5 t ha-1 (sowing 1) and 8 t ha-1 (sowing 2). Only three medic species, M. rotata, M. noeana, and M. rigidula, increased as a proportion of the seedbank. The increase was greatest in the first year, though M. noeana and M. rigidula increased further in the next two years. M. littoralis and M. turbinata, initially unsuccessful, became more successful later, while M. scutellata and M. constricta continued to decline throughout the experiment. There were also appreciable differences in the seed bank of individual accessions of several species. The results are discussed in terms of (a) the grazing strategies required in pasture/wheat rotations, and (b) the use of mixtures to select medics suitable for such rotations.																	0004-9409	1836-5795					1992	43	7					1571	1581		10.1071/AR9921571							WOS:A1992JR39500010						
J	COCKS, PS				COCKS, PS			EVOLUTION IN SOWN POPULATIONS OF SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM L) IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The seed banks of three pastures at Kingscote, Parndana and Waterloo, S.A., were sampled to determine the frequency of divergent genotypes in subterranean clover, and the direction of natural selection. The seeds were grown in nursery rows at Adelaide, and the resulting plants classified into one of the commercial cultivars, or as divergent genotypes. The divergent genotypes from one locality, Kingscote, were described in terms of 17 variables, and compared with strains collected from southern Australia and the Mediterranean basin. At each locality there was more genetic diversity than had been sown, both in terms of additional cultivars and the presence of divergent genotypes. The percentage of divergent genotypes appeared to be proportional to the age of the pasture, and was greatest at Kingscote, where it reached 67% of the population. The Kingscote genotypes were genetically related to Mt Barker and Dwalganup, only five out of 283 genotypes having leaf markings that differed from both cultivars. The 17 variables fell between the values recorded for Mt Barker and Dwalganup, and there was evidence of directional selection. For example, formononetin content was less, and genistein more than would be expected in the absence of natural selection. Mean flowering time was about equal to that of Seaton Park, and closer to Mt Barker than to Dwalganup. Flowering time was related to elevation above the lowest point in the paddock, the latest genotypes tending to inhabit sites at the foots of slopes, and the earliest genotypes sites on the tops. Seed and burr weight were slightly larger than expected. Hybridization was the most important, but not the sole source of genetic divergence at Kingscote, whereas contamination was the main source at Waterloo. It is likely that only a minority of the divergent genotypes was generated by mutation. The Australian subterranean clovers were as diverse as those from the Mediterranean. Those from Kingscote were also diverse, but, on the whole, had longer peduncles, shorter internodes and were taller than strains from other parts of Australia and from the Mediterranean basin.																	0004-9409						1992	43	7					1583	1595		10.1071/AR9921583							WOS:A1992JR39500011

J	KJELLSSON, G				KJELLSSON, G			SEED BANKS IN DANISH DECIDUOUS FORESTS - SPECIES COMPOSITION, SEED INFLUX AND DISTRIBUTION PATTERN IN SOIL	ECOGRAPHY												Samples of soil from six forest stands of different age and composition were collected, and the seedlings emerging during germination experiments were recorded. To seed bank densities varied between 2230 and 15,630 seeds m-2. The seed bank size was positively correlated with the yearly seed influx, which constituted from 400 to 2720 seeds m-2. Juncus effusus dominated the seed banks with generally 2000 to 3300 seeds m-2, to exceptionally 10820 seeds m-2. Seeds of Rubus idaeus, Betula pubescens and Carex spp. were also abundant in the soil. Similar numbers of species were present in the seed banks and vegetation, but only 7-48% were species in common. Anemochorous species were more frequent in soil than above-ground, while zoochorous species were rare in soil but abundant in the vegetation. A measure of the occurrence of seeds in relation to soil depth was designed. Seeds of species with short-term survival in soil (e.g. Anemone nemorosa, Epilobium angustifolium, Oxalis acetosella and Stellaria holostea) were confined to the top soil, while many well known long-term survivors (e.g. Carex pilulifera, Poa annua, Rubus idaeus and Stellaria media) were found predominantly deep in the soil. The horizontal distribution of seeds of herbaceous species forming short-term seed banks was largely random, while seeds of herbs capable of long-term survival in soil were significantly aggregated. Except for one old and species-poor site, the dormant flora indicated generally high levels of disturbance in the past.																	0906-7590					JAN-MAR	1992	15	1					86	100		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00012.x							WOS:A1992HX62000012

This study investigates the seed bank and the establishment of a perennial grass, Bromus pictus, around shrubs and in the scattered-tussock patches, with special attention to root competition. About 20 times more seeds of B. pictus were found in the soil of the dense grass zone around shrubs than in the scattered-tussock patches. B. pictus seeds were placed in both types of patches, either with the natural level of below-ground competition present, or experimentally reduced by a fine mesh. Seedling survival and growth were reduced by root competition. Where root competition was experimentally reduced, the aerial protection afforded by the shrub increased the growth of seedlings. We conclude that root competition between adult plants and seedlings is mainly for soil water, and is greater near shrubs than in the scattered-tussock patches. Root competition from established plants is greater than the aerial protection afforded by shrubs, in the area close to shrubs.

Field and laboratory tests explored the response of Sorghum halepense seeds to fluctuations in soil temperature, and whether that response serves as a mechanism for sensing depth and regulating seed germination. 2. Seedling production in the field was severely curtailed when seeds were planted at increasing soil depths. Soil-temperature fluctuations were strongly dependent on depth. When soil columns containing seeds were incubated at alternating temperatures of 20 and 30-degrees-C, however, seed germination did not diminish with increasing depth, and an evaluation of how soil-surface shading affects the perception of depth by the seeds indicated that soil cover reduced germination of only those seeds in the upper strata of the profile. 3. These results demonstrate that sensitivity to amplitudes ot temperature fluctuations in soil is a major component of the mechanism that enables S. halepense seeds to detect soil depth, but that mechanism may also include other environmental factors associated with depth. 4. In cases where after-ripening had apparently aged the seed population, the depth-detection mechanism failed, and the rate of germination was similar for seeds at different layers within the first 15 cm of the- profile. This failure to regulate germination by detecting depth was related to a lower sensitivity to fluctuations in soil temperature. The existence and loss of this mechanism has possible ecological implications.																	0269-8463						1992	6	4					460	468		10.2307/2389284							WOS:A1992JG77600012

Promotion of seed germination in the laboratory can be obtained by mechanical scarification and thermal pretreatment, while light seems to be totally ineffective. A seed ecology syndrome for Cistaceae is postulated, featuring small seed size, hardcoatedness (primary dormancy), short-distance dispersal, long-term persistence in soil seed banks, fire- or heat-induced seed ''softening'', an opportunistic strategy of germination (germination at a wide range of temperature and light conditions), and a slow germination rate of ''softened'' seeds. This syndrome is suggested to endow Cistaceae, a principally Mediterranean family, with a considerable ecological advantage in the summer-dry and fire-prone Mediterranean climatic conditions.

J	OCONNOR, TG; PICKETT, GA				OCONNOR, TG; PICKETT, GA			THE INFLUENCE OF GRAZING ON SEED PRODUCTION AND SEED BANKS OF SOME AFRICAN SAVANNA GRASSLANDS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Species composition, population structure and the seed banks of the perennial grasses Aristida bipartita, Bothriochloa insculpta, Heteropogon contortus, Themeda triandra and Urochloa mosambicensis, were described for nine sites in mesic savanna grasslands (seed banks for five) on a similar soil type ranging in grazing history from sustained heavy grazing (> 20 years) to light grazing. The influence of two seasons of grazing on the seed production and the seed bank of Themeda, Setaria incrassata, Heteropogon, Aristida, Bothriochloa and Digitaria eriantha, was estimated at two other sites. 2. Compositional variation reflected grazing history. Lightly grazed sites were characterized by the longer-lived, palatable perennials Themeda, Bothriochloa, Heteropogon and Digitaria, and heavily grazed sites by the shorter-lived perennials Urochloa, Sporobolus nitens, Chloris virgata, the unpalatable Aristida, and some forb species. Grass tuft size declined with increasing grazing pressure. Sustained heavy grazing reduced or eliminated Themeda, Bothriochloa and Heteropogon from the seed bank, but increased the abundance of Aristida and Urochloa spp. 3. Rainfall influenced the seasonal pattern of seed production, which decreased with intra-seasonal drought. The number of seeds produced m-2 of tuft basal area varied from 21 000 for Setaria to 1.9 million for Aristida. Annual seed production m-2 of ground with light grazing was less-than-or-equal-to 400 for Themeda, for Heteropogon, 1300-4000 for Setaria, > 10 000 for Aristida, and 300 for Bothriochloa. 4. Seed viability varied from zero for Digitaria to 68% for Setaria, and varied within a season for Themeda (24-49%) and Setaria (26-68%). The seeds of all species tested possessed a period of innate dormancy of < 1 year. 5. Seven to ten grass and six to seven forb species were found in the seed banks at two sites. Perennial grasses constituted 85-95% of the seed bank, with > 90% of all seeds occurring in the top 2 cm of soil. Seed density differed markedly between sites and grazing treatments. 6. A simple model of the seed bank dynamics of the perennial grasses showed that because their seeds germinate readily and have a limited survival when in secondary dormancy, the seed bank size is determined primarily by the abundance of the species in the vegetation. Thus, the seed banks of Themeda and Heteropogon, which produce small numbers of seeds, can easily be eliminated by sustained grazing. This was also indicated by the distribution of these two species along the gradient of grazing history.																	0021-8901						1992	29	1					247	260		10.2307/2404367							WOS:A1992HP52400028						
J	BURGMAN, MA; LAMONT, BB				BURGMAN, MA; LAMONT, BB			A STOCHASTIC-MODEL FOR THE VIABILITY OF BANKSIA-CUNEATA POPULATIONS - ENVIRONMENTAL, DEMOGRAPHIC AND GENETIC-EFFECTS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The dynamics and life history of a population of Banksia cuneata are described in relation to natural variation in rainfall and the frequency of prescribed (controlled) fires and wildfires. 2. These factors are combined in a stochastic population model for the population that includes demographic, environmental and genetic factors. The purpose of the model is to evaluate the effects of different management options on the expected population size and on the risks of population decline and extinction. 3. Management options to maximize population size and to minimize risks of extinction are different. A moderate frequency of prescribed fires (at intervals of 15-25 years) is predicted to result in increases in the mean population size. However, it also results in risks of extinction of the population of about 50%, because seedlings that establish after a fire are highly susceptible to drought. The risks of extinction are minimized if the frequency of fires is kept as low as possible. However, this leads to a substantial decline in the size of the population. 4. If, over the next 50 years, there is a reduction in average annual rainfall in the region, the chances of persistence of the populations are low, even in the absence of prescribed fires. The only way to ensure a reasonable chance of persistence for the populations is to intervene by watering seedlings whenever there is severe drought following a fire. 5. These results are exploratory because the model is based on scant data. The most important need is to estimate better the relationship between rainfall and the number of seedlings recruited into the population per adult.

Changes in the seed bank, seedling emergence and plant density of the most common grass species, and all legume species, were monitored in a grassland in north Syria from October 1986 to May 1989. 2. The seed bank was greatest in May-June, following pasture maturity, then declined to its minimum in March-April. Losses of seeds during summer were mainly due to sheep grazing, while losses in winter and spring were mainly due to germination, although some seeds were eaten by soil fauna and some seeds died. The seed bank, particularly of the small-seeded species (Trifolium tomentosum and T. campestre) was greater under the high stocking rate than under the low stocking rate. 3. There was little seed carry-over of grasses from season to season (Avena spp. 5%, Heteranthelium piliferum 1%, Bromus spp. 0%), but seed carry-over was greater in legumes (Trifolium stellatum 27%, T. campestre 35%, and T. tomentosum 38%). Most seedlings emerged in the autumn, but emergence continued throughout the growing season. Plant density within each year reached a peak in January, declining as spring approached. 4.

J	MEYER, SE; KITCHEN, SG				MEYER, SE; KITCHEN, SG			CYCLIC SEED DORMANCY IN THE SHORT-LIVED PERENNIAL PENSTEMON-PALMERI	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Penstemon palmeri is a short-lived perennial herb that occupies early-successional habitats at mid altitude in the semi-arid south-western United States. Laboratory germination experiments with seeds from nine populations showed that most seeds were non-dormant at autumn temperatures (15-degrees-C), but a majority required light for germination. Moist chilling at winter temperatures (1-degrees-C) for 4 weeks induced secondary dormancy in about half the seeds, whilst moist incubation at superoptimal summer temperatures (30-degrees-C) for 2 weeks removed most primary and chilling-induced secondary dormancy, prevented the induction of dormancy by chilling, and reduced the proportion of light-requiring seeds. The effect of 1-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C treatments persisted or were increased through drying. 2. A 2-year field retrieval experiment with seeds from three populations showed that dormancy induction during winter and release from dormancy during summer functioned as predicted from laboratory experiments to confine germination to periods during autumn or early spring and to permit year-to-year persistence of the seed bank. 3. Cyclic dormancy patterns demonstrated for Penstemon palmeri are similar to those described for facultative winter annual weeds. However, because chilling causes the seed population to diverge into Spring-germinable and spring-dormant fractions, its seed bank can persist from year to year without burial. 4. There were no clear habitat-correlated differences in germination patterns among populations, and populations from contrasting habitats showed similar and appropriate field responses. This suggests that Penstemon palmeri is a generalist in terms of germination pattern																	0022-0477						1992	80	1					115	122		10.2307/2261068							WOS:A1992HY00900011						
J	HOULE, G				HOULE, G			THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF ABIES-BALSAMEA, ACER-SACCHARUM AND BETULA-ALLEGHANIENSIS IN THE TANTARE ECOLOGICAL RESERVE, QUEBEC	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. The contribution of seed rain to the seed bank and to the seedling cohort was evaluated for three species, Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis, in a deciduous forest near Quebec, Canada. Through experimental manipulations, seed-bank turnover time and rate of seed incorporation into the soil were estimated for these tree species. The forest floor was also modified in small quadrats to simulate various natural microsites; seedling emergence and early survival, and microsite characteristics were then monitored. 2. All Abies and Acer seedlings, and most Betula seedlings, originated from the previous year's seed rain. Abies and Acer were characterized by a winter-transient seed bank, but Betula maintained a persistent reserve of seeds in the soil. Turnover time of the Betula seed bank was c. 2 years in humus, but < 1 year in litter. Viability of Betula seeds placed under the litter on the forest floor declined from an initial value of 67% to 42% after 8 months, 3% after 20 months and 0% after 32 months. Acer seeds did not loose any viability during winter storage under natural conditions and they all germinated within a year, even when placed under the leaf litter. 3. Betula seedlings established preferentially on litter-free surfaces such as experimentally created mounds and pits, and this independently of the position of these microsites either in gaps (<200 m2) or under the intact canopy. First-season survival was slightly higher on mounds than in pits, and this was related to higher soil moisture, organic matter and temperature, conditions which favour seedling root development.																	0022-0477						1992	80	4					611	623		10.2307/2260853							WOS:A1992KF83700002

Regeneration of Calluna vulgaris following normal heath fires is from surviving stem bases or, where survival is poor, from a seed bank. Severe fires causing ignition of surface organic horizons kill stem bases and cause a serious depletion of the seed bank, most of which (up to 10(6) seeds m-2) lies in the litter and upper 2-3 cm of soil or organic material. Germinable seeds were detected in appreciable numbers down to 6 cm beneath the boundary of the F/O soil horizons in soil cores from mature heath vegetation on a blanket peat and peaty stagnopodzol. However, severe fires in which more than 10 cm of peat is ignited will destroy all of the viable seed bank. 2. At the site studied, the seed-rain density for Calluna was approximately inversely proportional to the dispersal distance; regression equations predicted an annual seed rain of only c. 25 seeds m-2 at 10 m from source plants. Small numbers of wind-dispersed flowers retaining some seeds may be important in long-distance dispersal. 3. The crustose lichens Lecidea granulosa and L. uliginosa and several species of algae form a near-ubiquitous film over the surface of exposed organic soil following severe moorland fires. This creates a crust overlying unconsolidated sub-surface peat. The lichen-alga film significantly reduced germination of Calluna seeds by about 40%. 4. No evidence was found to link poor germination or growth to low pH, low nutrient levels or soil toxicity. Fertilizer experiments show that addition of potassium increases the root:shoot ratio of Calluna seedlings while nitrogen increases shoot growth at the expense of root development. It is suggested that the seedling root:shoot ratio may be important in establishment and in surviving the effects of needle ice formation, surface instability and desiccation. 5. Transplant experiments and observations on naturally occurring seedlings show that summer desiccation of seedlings, winter browning, surface instability due to needle ice formation, and trampling by sheep are all major factors preventing seedling establishment. The relative importance of these factors varies from site to site.																	0022-0477	1365-2745					1992	80	4					737	752		10.2307/2260863							WOS:A1992KF83700012

Waterfowl use of the Great Lakes has declined dramatically from presettlement times; the obvious cause is human encroachment on coastal wetlands and destruction of river delta and embayed wetland complexes. Loss of wetland habitats from diking and filling above the average water level constitutes a permanent habitat loss, especially during high water cycles. The greatest number of species and individuals use 15 concentration areas during the spring and fall migratory periods when use by diving ducks, sea and stiff tailed ducks, and swans and geese predominates. Lesser numbers of species use the coastal wetlands for breeding. Large concentrations of dabbling ducks, primarily mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American black ducks (A. rubripes), and mergansers (Mergus spp.) are found on ice-free areas during winter. Wetland habitats have become more favorable, due to human modifications, to dabbling duck species found in the prairie habitats of North America. Mallards have become the most numerous species breeding in coastal wetlands along with a concomitant decline in black ducks, which may be a consequence of introgression. Habitat modifications, degradation, and loss have great potential to affect existing waterfowl populations negatively and to point the way toward future research.																	0380-1330						1992	18	4					673	699		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71329-X							WOS:A1992KJ74600013

Measurements of the natural vertical distribution of seeds in the soil under an old pasture showed 4000-18000 viable seeds/m2 were present, with > 99% of the seeds in the top 25 mm. Germination from the soil bank took place in autumn and spring in two distinct flushes. Germination of fresh seed in vitro occurred under a 16 h photoperiod at constant temperatures ranging from 18 to 25-degrees-C, but not in continuous darkness. Germination was stimulated in darkness by a temperature fluctuation of 20/10-degrees-C, suggesting a mechanism for pasture gap detection. The viability of seeds after 6 years' burial at depths of 0, 25, 50, 150, and 250 mm, was 0.1, 5, 17, 22, and 24%, respectively. Annual depletion rates of the seed bank, in the absence of seed input, were 38, 61, 66, 68, and 77% under conditions of annual mowing of the sward, repeated glyphosate application, and 1, 2, and 6 cultivations/year, respectively. These data were used in a simple model to estimate the number of years that seeding must be prevented to achieve set re-infestation potentials.

J	WILLIAMS, PA				WILLIAMS, PA			ECOLOGY OF THE ENDANGERED HERB SCUTELLARIA-NOVAE-ZELANDIAE	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Scutellaria novae-zelandiae is a small herb restricted to the Nelson/ Marlborough region. Aspects of its ecology were studied to assist in the management of wild populations. An absolute estimate of abundance is not possible as individual Scutellaria plants are indistinguishable and it grows in small patches up to 20 m2. There are probably between 50 and 100 such patches in podocarp-beech forest below 200 m a.s.l. on freely drained alluvium and colluvium. The vigour of Scutellaria patches as estimated from changes in shoot frequency and seed production varies widely depending on site conditions. It cannot tolerate competition from ferns, herbs, weeds, and shrub growth which occurs once the ground surface stabilises. Patches of Scutellaria have a marked seasonal variation in mean height, reaching a peak of approximately 12-15 cm during flowering (November-December), and then declining. Fresh Scutellaria seeds take several weeks to germinate and many enter the soil seed bank. Seedlings rarely appeared in bare ground plots at the field sites, but many emerged rapidly from topsoil samples placed in a glasshouse, along with abundant seedlings of vigorous adventive weeds. Scutellaria patches expand mainly by vegetative means. Scutellaria has been reduced in abundance by grazing at some sites, yet at others it has probably benefitted from grazing through the removal of competition from other plants, including adventive weeds. The implications of the results for the conservation of Scutellaria are mentioned.																	0110-6465						1992	16	2					127	135									WOS:A1992LR59000009

Open-beach plants were usually killed by fall storms. Some foredune plants (5.3%) survived into a second reproductive season, producing 85% of mature fruits in the foredune. Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner) removed 95% of fruits matured by foredune plants. Sand burial of fruits increased their chances of escaping predation. Burial was 52-fold more likely for fruits on open-beach plants compared with foredune plants, resulting in lower seed predation on the open beach. Germination from P. maniculatus caches produced 63% of foredune plants, but they represented only 0.002% of all removed seeds. Cache plants had lowered survival relative to noncache plants, so that seed dispersal by P. maniculatus did not benefit C. maritima. Both foredune and open-beach populations were likely to decline if transition patterns among age-classes and fruit production rates observed in 1983 and 1984 remained constant. Because of high fruit production by overwintering plants, foredune plants produced more fruits than needed to maintain plant numbers, but predation by P. maniculatus reduced seed survival to less than 20% of the replacement rate for that habitat.																	0008-4026					DEC	1991	69	12					2620	2630		10.1139/b91-327							WOS:A1991HF67700006

Four aspects related to this hypothesis are examined here, namely (1) origin and morphology of the structures forming banks; (2) their specific compositions; (3) environmental conditions that allow their survival in a state of suspended growth, and conditions that trigger reinitiation of growth; and (4) losses from the banks by diverse causes. Although the structures at which growth suspension occurs are of very different morphologies, and probably are also different in their capacities of temporal displacement, both types of banks are regulated by similar environmental factors and subjected to similar types of constraints. Some important differences between the 2 banks are likely to stem from the lesser longevity of the algal microscopic stages, which would limit the duration of banks of microscopic forms.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC	1991	79	1-2					185	194		10.3354/meps079185							WOS:A1991HF03400016

The study was conducted to identify optimum temperature for germination of relatively new clover species to the U.S. Southeast to improve stand establishment. High temperature germination was also examined to estimate summer germination which usually results in seedling mortality and a decrease of the soil seed-bank. Seed of 10 cultivars of T. alexandrinum L., T. brachycalycinum Katzn. and Morley, T. hirtum All., T. subterraneum L., and T. yanninicum Katzn. and Morley were subjected to alternating 12 h day/12 h night temperatures of 15/5, 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 and 35/25-degrees-C. Germination counts were made at 3, 6, 9, and 12 d to determine percent germination and germination rate index (GRI). Germination was > 80% for all entries at the three lowest temperature treatments except 'Larisa' subclover at 25/15-degrees-C. At 30/20-degrees-C, germination of 'Bigbee' berseem and T. brachycalycinum subclovers decreased to 54 to 66%, while the other species decreased to < 35%. The 35/25-degrees-C treatment suppressed germination to < 25%. The optimum temperature for GRI was 25/15 followed by 20/10, 15/5, 30/20, and 35/25-degrees-C. The optimum germination temperature of 25/15-degrees-C occurs in October along the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast. September plantings (30/20-degrees-C) in this area should be limited to T. alexandrinum and T. brachycalycinum species. Cultivars that germinate at summer temperatures of 35/25-degrees-C or higher should be avoided unless they have a high hard-seed content.																	0002-1962					NOV-DEC	1991	83	6					1000	1004		10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300060015x							WOS:A1991GT93600014

We present evidence of the success of biological control of Senecio jacobaea (ragwort) in western Oregon following introduction of three natural enemies. First, observations from a single site showed that ragwort declined to < 1% of its former abundance and has been replaced by a plant community composed predominantly of introduced perennial grasses. Second, a perturbation experiment showed that introduced insects, within one ragwort generation, can depress the density, biomass, and reproduction of ragwort to < 1% of populations protected from natural enemies. Third, a 12-yr survey of 42 ragwort populations showed that strong and persistent depression of ragwort recurred at many sites and at different times. Three features of this case history may be useful in the development of ecological theory as an explanation and guide for biological control: (1) the impact of the natural enemies depends on the distribution of individual sizes and ages in the ragwort population; (2) the long-term dynamics of ragwort may be influenced by the presence of a large persistent seed bank which is invulnerable to the natural enemies; and (3) the success of biological control of ragwort in western Oregon appears to be independent of variation in environmental conditions. Combining local, short-term experiments and regional long-term observations is a powerful method for demonstrating successful biological control.																	1051-0761					NOV	1991	1	4					430	442		10.2307/1941900							WOS:A1991GQ18900005	27755672

Species richness, species diversity, and density of seed banks generally decreased with successional age. Also, percentages of both annuals and biennials (including short-lived perennials) in the seed bank flora and in seed density generally decreased. In contrast, perennial herbs increased and woody plants were absent in the youngest two stands and present in the older stands where they exhibited no significant differences. These trends are related to successional changes in the proportions of life-history types in the vegetation that are associated with decreases in seed production and longevity and increases in susceptibility to seed predation.																	0040-9618					OCT-DEC	1991	118	4					377	384		10.2307/2997089							WOS:A1991GX00200002

POST-DISTURBANCE VEGETATION	BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB												Revegetation of 1.5 x 1.5 m plots disturbed by severing roots and rhizomes and turning the topsoil was examined during the first growing season for a chronosequence of five stands. The objective was to compare the disturbance responses of communities of different successional stages. Species richness of post-disturbance vegetation was highest in the 50-year, savanna-like old field, but otherwise was generally lower in later successional stages. Species diversity was largely constant, but was low when one or two species dominated by reproducing vegetatively. Cover was high in the disturbed plots in old fields and low in forests. In general, both annuals and biennials (including short-lived perennials) were lower and woody plants higher as percentages of the flora and in relative cover in later successional stages. Perennial herbs were most important in the two mid-seral old fields. Floristic comparisons with the undisturbed vegetation and seed banks indicate that the seed bank was important in revegetation following disturbance in early-successional stages, as it determines the number and abundance of annuals and biennials. In contrast, remnants of the undisturbed vegetation persisting in the disturbed plots were more important in mid- and late-successional stages through vegetative reproduction of perenniai herbs and woody plants.

INTRA-STAND AND INTER-STAND COMPARISONS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR SUCCESSION MECHANISMS	BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB												Vegetation, seed banks, and post-disturbance vegetation were compared for a chronosequence of five stands in order to interpret succession mechanisms. With increasing stand age, the species composition of vegetation, seed banks, and post-disturbance vegetation generally diverged. Also, vegetation was more similar with post-disturbance vegetation than with seed banks in the forest stages. These findings are related to changes in the proportions of life-history types during succession, which, as noted in other studies, are accompanied by decreases in seed production and viability and increases in vegetative reproduction. No successional stage had a seed bank or post-disturbance vegetation with most of the common species from the undisturbed vegetation of all stages. This and reanalysis of other studies on similar seres document that the "initial floristic composition" model of succession cannot account for all major stages of a successional sequence. Rather, the seeds and vegetative propagules present in old-field communities may be capable of regenerating stages from the pioneer through the age of the community disturbed but not older stages, and forests cannot regenerate a series of old-field stages but are capable of directly regenerating themselves through vegetative reproduction.																	0040-9618					OCT-DEC	1991	118	4					392	398		10.2307/2997091							WOS:A1991GX00200004

We examined how diaspore morphology and soil particle size affect diaspore incorporation into soil in a disturbed alpine ecosystem on the Beartooth Plateau, Montana, USA. Diaspores of alpine species with varying morphology were sown over soils of five different particle sizes and later collected from three depths. Regardless of diaspore morphology, the total number of diaspores trapped increased with increasing particle size until a threshold soil particle size was reached above which no more diaspores were trapped. At small particle sizes (0.5-1.0 and 1.0-2.0 mm) small diaspores and diaspores with adhesive seed coats were trapped, but most large diaspores moved horizontally across the surface and were not trapped. The majority of those diaspores trapped were at the 0-1 cm depth at small particle sizes. At large particle sizes (2.0-4.0, 4.0-8.0, and 8.0-16.0 mm) high numbers of large diaspores were trapped, and more diaspores moved vertically through the soil column. In small particle size soils small diaspores reached greater depths than large diaspores. Diaspores with adhesive seed coats responded more like large diaspores in terms of vertical movement. Diaspore length and eccentricity (length/width) were highly correlated with entrapment at small particle sizes and appeared to have the greatest effect on horizontal movement. Mass and width were significantly correlated with numbers of diaspores trapped in large particle sizes and were influencing vertical movement. Models based on the Weibull probability distribution were used to describe diaspore "survival" on the soil surface and to describe vertical movement in the soil column. This study indicates that on exposed soils in windy environments diaspore morphology and soil particle size greatly affect the spatial distribution of diaspores in seed banks. For diaspores of a given species, the optimal soil type traps a high number of diaspores but precludes significant downward movement.																	0012-9658					OCT	1991	72	5					1668	1677		10.2307/1940966							WOS:A1991GK82300014

Pot and field experiments were conducted to study the relationships between Orobanche seed densities in the soil and parasitism on, and yield of, faba bean. The number of emerged parasite shoots was positively correlated with the Orobance seed density, both in the pot (r = 0.70, P < 0.01) and field (r = 0.93' P < 0.01) studies. As percentages of seed in the soil, emerged Orobanche shoots decreased as seed density of Orobanche increased; it was 1.82% with 5 seeds/kg soil and 0.16% with 932 seeds/kg soil in the field. Faba bean seed yield was negatively correlated with Orobanche seed density (r = -0.50, P < 0.01 in pots and r = -0.72, P < 0.01 in field study). In pots, a range of densities from 0 to 31,250 Orobanche seeds/kg soil was artificially created; no reduction in seed yield occurred with less than 312 seeds/kg soil. The sharpest decreases in yield occurred as the density increased from 1562 to 15,625 seeds/kg soil. At a density of 31,250 seeds/kg soil there was no seed yield. In the field much lower seed densities were able to cause yield reduction. At an Orobanche density of 932 seeds/kg soil, the yield dropped to zero. Highest numbers of parasite shoots/m2 in the field were 229 at an Orobanche seed density of 932/kg soil, resulting in a total loss of seed yield.																	0066-1759					SEP	1991	65	3-4					229	238									WOS:A1991GM77900006

(eelgrass) in the SW Netherlands were investigated in the laboratory. Both physiological dormancy (a requirement for reduced salinity for germination) and physical dormancy (imposed by the seed coat) existed in recently shed seeds. Physiological seed dormancy was partly released in the seed bank by early winter, but physical dormancy lasted longer. By March seeds germinated quickly in the dark in full-strength seawater without artificial weakening of the seed coat. Viable seeds were released with coats that ranged from green (easily ruptured by the embryo) to brown (not easily ruptured); this variation may account for the occasional seedlings that appear during winter. No significant effects of temperature or light on germination were detected. A reexamination of the literature suggests that the observed variation in timing of germination in eelgrass populations may be a result of hitherto overlooked aspects of dormancy.																	0008-4026					SEP	1991	69	9					1972	1976		10.1139/b91-247							WOS:A1991GP55200011

The species is very rare and restricted to a narrow range of distribution. Growth, phenology, seed output, and predation by the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus F. (Bruchidae-Coleoptera) of a naturally growing population were monitored. Growth and phenology are highly seasonal and correlated with precipitation and temperature. Up to 48.4% of the population is in the juvenile stages, which experience high mortality. Seed predation is extraordinarily heavy. An average of 94.4% of seeds in different stages of maturity are consumed or damaged by C. maculatus. Habitat change and biotic factors within populations including seed predation are threatening the species' existence in the wild. The following are some possible measures for conservation of E. armitagei: (1) small-scale habitat conservation (sanctuary), (2) establishment of new populations by artificial means, (3) establishment of a gene (seed) bank, (4) encouraging botanical gardens to conserve the species, and (5) field application of selective insecticides to control the seed predators but not to destroy beneficial insects.																	0888-8892					SEP	1991	5	3					317	324		10.1111/j.1523-1739.1991.tb00143.x							WOS:A1991GC70200009

ESTABLISHMENT OF A TIME TRANSECT	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) In cold environments, such as Arctic tundra, buried seeds can potentially persist in the soil for centuries or millennia. The possibility of obtaining time-stratified seed populations from Alaskan tundra was investigated in two ways. First, a deep layer of organic soil was sampled from a vertical profile through accumulating peat in Eriophorum-tussock tundra. Secondly, an organic soil buried by the slow, downslope erosional deposition of mineral soil (solifluction) was sampled; the progression of samples taken upslope under the deposit represented progressively older buried soils. (2) Both buried organic soils contained viable seeds, as determined with a germination assay. In Eriophorum-tussock tundra, only seeds of Carex bigelowii were found at depth. Dating by accelerator mass spectrometry of seed coats removed from these seeds showed that they were essentially modern. Several species germinated from the solifluction-buried organic soil, with viable seeds of Luzula parviflora and Carex bigelowii being found in the greatest numbers and persisting for the longest time. Dating of seed coats showed that these seeds persisted for at least 197 +/- 80 years, although viable seeds were also found associated with wood fragments 295 +/- 75 years old. (3) The buried seed profile under the solifluction lobe represents a 'time transect' two or three centuries long. Because seed coats were dated without killing the emerging seedling, this time transect can be used to make direct ecological genetic comparisons of past and present individuals from a single population.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				SEP	1991	79	3					617	625		10.2307/2260657							WOS:A1991HH66100004

PHENOTYPIC AND GENETIC-DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUNG AND OLD SUBPOPULATIONS OF LUZULA-PARVIFLORA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) Genetic change over time in a population of Luzula parviflora was investigated by germinating seeds from a seed bank that was time-stratified beneath a solifluction lobe at Eagle Creek, Alaska. The oldest subpopulation was inferred to be approximately 150 years old. (2) Seven censuses were conducted to compare morphological and growth traits between young (recently buried) and old subpopulations as well as between the young subpopulation and the active seed bank. (3) When plants which germinated directly from the seed bank were grown in a common environment, subpopulations differed for nearly all variables measured. Young subpopulation plants were initially smaller than plants from other subpopulations, but because of significantly higher growth rates, many of the differences in size were not significant by the final census. (4) Differences which may have been due to maternal/environmental effects were minimized by clonally replicating all genotypes from young and old buried subpopulations. Each genotype was subjected to three nutrient levels. For morphological traits that differed, the young subpopulation tended to be larger than either the plants from the active seed bank or the old subpopulation. In the same comparisons, growth rates of plants from the young subpopulation tended to be less. In addition, there was a tendency (P < 0.10) for the young subpopulation to respond differently to nutrient treatments. (5) Persistent phenotypic differences in both the common and multiple-environment experiments demonstrate genetic differences between different-aged subpopulations of L. parviflora. These differences may be the result of selection or drift acting over approximately 150 years.																	0022-0477					SEP	1991	79	3					627	643		10.2307/2260658							WOS:A1991HH66100005

PHENOTYPIC AND GENETIC-DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUNG AND OLD SEED POPULATIONS OF CAREX-BIGELOWII	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) Three approaches were used to determine if phenotypic and genetic variation existed among seed subpopulations of different ages within an Arctic seed bank: (i) morphology and growth rate of seedlings were compared under a common environment; (ii) morphology, growth rates and ecological response to temperature-controlled environments and density were compared using vegetative offspring (ramets); (iii) relative competitive responses of ramets were compared under multiple environments. (2) Phenotypic differences in leaf length and number of leaves were demonstrated among the subpopulations. Seedlings of the young subpopulation initially had longer leaves, but this difference was lost within 4 weeks indicating that the difference was probably of maternal or historical origin. The young subpopulation consistently maintained a greater number of leaves across environments and through time, however. These differences indicate that genetic change occurred in the population under natural conditions within c. 200 years. (3) Consistent differences in response to environment and density were also found. The old subpopulation did not show as great a response to increasing temperature as the young subpopulation. Also, biomass of the old subpopulation was unaffected by an increase in density, whereas the young subpopulation showed less growth at increased density. The origin of these differences are probably due to evolutionary change within the extant, seed-producing population rather than genetic change occurring within the seed bank. Differential response to density was not reflected in a difference in relative competitive ability.																	0022-0477					SEP	1991	79	3					645	662		10.2307/2260659							WOS:A1991HH66100006

A comparison of methods of estimating seed banks by counting seeds vs. counting germinants showed neither method to be superior; a knowledge of other life-history characteristics, such as seed input and germination cues, was essential in evaluating results. (2) Instead of the large seed banks typical of shrubs from fire-prone vegetation, dune fynbos shrubs had relatively small seed banks: the highest mean seed density recorded was 825 +/- 1187 seed m-2 (mean +/- 1S.D., n = 50). Shrub and community seed banks showed no significant increments over 3 years. After a fire, seed banks were depleted by more than half. (3) Removal of seeds by ants and rodents from the soil surface was relatively rapid. Almost all seed had been removed from open depots by the sixth day of cafeteria experiments. Removal rates by ants of elaiosome-bearing (myrmecochorous) seeds was not significantly different from non-myrmecochorous species; neither were the intact seeds of a myrmecochorous species removed faster than the seeds from which the elaiosome had been removed. The results indicate that seeds are removed by ants as much for granivory as for myrmecochory. (4) Seed burials showed that seed bank losses due to decay and germination varied widely amongst species and with seed age, with losses ranging from 12% to 93%. (5) There were large differences in seed-bank sizes between the six species which could be attributed to their life-history attributes such as seed production, dispersal mode and germination requirements. The myrmecochorous species with relatively large and poorly dispersed seeds, small to moderate seed production and seed-bank sizes, and germination and seedling establishment cued to post-fire conditions, were most vulnerable to local extinction.																	0022-0477					SEP	1991	79	3					731	747		10.2307/2260664							WOS:A1991HH66100011						
J	YEATON, RI; BOND, WJ				YEATON, RI; BOND, WJ			COMPETITION BETWEEN 2 SHRUB SPECIES - DISPERSAL DIFFERENCES AND FIRE PROMOTE COEXISTENCE	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Coexistence mechanisms of two co-occurring species of Proteaceae, Protea lepidocarpodendron and Leucospermum conocarpodendron, were studied. Both are tall, arborescent shrubs forming the overstory of the fynbos communities in which they occur. Seeds of L. conocarpodendron are dispersed by ants while those of P. lepidocarpodendron are dispersed by wind. The seedlings compete for space made available after periodic fires. Seedlings of the ant-dispersed species are scarce under the skeletons of the wind-dispersed species after a fire but relatively common in open sites. In contrast, seedlings of the wind-dispersed species are densest under their own skeletons and rare in open sites. Seedlings of the ant-dispersed species are outgrown by their wind-dispersed competitors and suffer reduced fecundity and increased mortality when they co-occur. The adult survival of the ant-dispersed species in light fires is also reduced when it establishes under or next to the wind-dispersed species. A Markovian model of the system suggests that ant dispersal of Leucospermum seed reduces the rate of competitive exclusion by Protea but is not sufficient to explain the persistence of the former in this system. To persist, Leucospermum requires open space, which is made available either by adult survival in light fires which set back its Protea competitor or by survival as seed banks through burns that destroy the seed banks of Protea.

J	TITUS, JE; HOOVER, DT				TITUS, JE; HOOVER, DT			TOWARD PREDICTING REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SUBMERSED FRESH-WATER ANGIOSPERMS	AQUATIC BOTANY												Reproduction is central to changes in distribution and abundance patterns of submersed freshwater macrophytes. In this paper we seek to identify potential 'bottlenecks' limiting sexual or vegetative reproduction or its predictability for these plants. To this end we consider the regulation of seed production, seed fate, vegetative propagule production, and vegetative propagule fate in turn, both in general terms and for the perennial Vallisneria americana Michx. in particular. Plant biomass appears to be an important determinant of the incidence of flowering for greenhouse-grown Vallisneria americana: 88% of 425 plants either failed to flower if below a threshold dry weight of 0.75 g, or flowered if above it. The number of flowers (in females) or inflorescences (in males), however, was only moderately well correlated with Vallisneria biomass, and the flowering 'threshold rule' weakened considerably in the field. Closer examination of the dependence of seed output on plant biomass and pollination intensity, and of the importance of seed or fruit abortion is needed for submersed species. Our ignorance of seed fate is exemplified by the paucity of quantitative studies on dispersal distances and seed deposition patterns, on seed banks, and on features of seed microenvironments pertinent to germination, although the sensitivity of seed dormancy and germination to a variety of environmental conditions has been tested in the laboratory for many species. Further, losses of seeds and seedlings as a result of unfavorable environments, sediment disturbance, flotation, pathogens, and herbivores are generally not well characterized. Overall, the principal limiting step for sexual reproduction may in some cases be lack of floral induction, and in others, ineffective pollination, but dispersal away from the local population, failure of seeds to germinate, and the challenges of seedling establishment cannot be ruled out. Plant size is well correlated with vegetative propagule production for both greenhouse and field Vallisneria populations. As with seed germination, the germination of vegetative propagules has been relatively well studied in the laboratory, but important regulators of germination and establishment in the field warrant further study. We suggest that more investigations at two interfaces of physiological ecology and demography may be particularly fruitful. Regarding propagule production, experimental focus on allocation patterns which 'translate' accumulated resources into seeds or vegetative propagules should prove rewarding. Regarding propagule fate, post-dispersal mortality of seeds and vegetative propagules may be rooted in physiological tolerance limits, but could also be attributable to pathogen or herbivore attack.																	0304-3770					AUG	1991	41	1-3					111	136		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90041-3							WOS:A1991GD57300006						
J	WEISNER, SEB				WEISNER, SEB			WITHIN-LAKE PATTERNS IN DEPTH PENETRATION OF EMERGENT VEGETATION	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Within-lake relations of wave exposure (WE), and substratum softness (cone penetration depth; CPD) and organic content (loss on ignition; LOI), to water depth penetration of the emergent vegetation (DPE) was investigated in seven eutrophic lakes in southern Sweden, ranging in area from 1 to 46 km2. 2. There was a positive relationship between WE and DPE within lakes. This relationship, however, only occurred for sites with relatively soft substrata, for which CPD and LOI were negatively related to both WE and DPE. 3. Analysis of aerial photographs revealed that expansion of the emergent vegetation towards open water, or recession from open water, was not related to wave exposure or water depth, except in one lake where expansion mainly occurred at high exposures. 4. For relatively static vegetation on soft substrata, regressions with CPD0.5 explained 62-88% of the within-lake variation of DPE. These regressions did not differ among lakes. Expanding and recessing vegetation were significantly dislocated towards shallower and deeper water, respectively, than predicted from the regression models for static vegetation. 5. Phragmites australis dominated at the lakeward edge of the emergent vegetation, followed in frequency by Typha angustifolia. More broad-leaved species were generally restricted to shallow water and very soft substrata. 6. The results suggest that changes in the distribution of emergent vegetation in moderately wave exposed eutrophic lakes can be predicted largely from substratum character and water depth.

Several hypotheses, based on ecological differences in the thistles, their life cycles and changes in the soil/seed environment may explain the changing species incidence in the field, and it is postulated that, within a restricted group of competing thistle species, it may be more meaningful to interpret these ecological differences in terms of 'tolerance of unfavourable conditions' than in terms of 'optimal requirements'. Alternative strategies for the control of thistles, including pasture competition, grazing management, the utilization of high soil fertility, and chemicals, are also assessed. It is reemphasized that the aim of any long-term programme to control thistles, with or without the release of biological agents, should be the establishment and/or maintenance of a vigorous perennial pasture. The relative importance of different thistle species in Australian pastures and the ecology and dynamics of soil seed banks are identified as important areas for future thistle research.																	0043-1737					AUG	1991	31	4					189	201		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1991.tb01758.x							WOS:A1991FZ80000004						
J	HOULE, G; PAYETTE, S				HOULE, G; PAYETTE, S			SEED DYNAMICS OF ABIES-BALSAMEA AND ACER-SACCHARUM IN A DECIDUOUS FOREST OF NORTHEASTERN NORTH-AMERICA	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We studied the seed dynamics of Abies balsamea and Acer saccharum in a sugar maple-yellow birch forest of Quebec, Canada. Seed rain was censused every week from spring to autumn in 1988 and 1989. The soil seed bank was sampled four times during the 1988 growing season. Abies seed rain varied significantly between 1988 and 1989. A total of 92.5 +/- 7.0 seeds m-2 (mean +/- 1 SE) were produced in 1988; 1989 seed production was null. Seed viability in 1988 averaged 31.5%. Dispersal during the winter period accounted for ca. 22% of the annual seed crop. The spatial dispersion pattern of the seed rain was contagious for the autumn period, but was not significantly different from random for the winter period. There was only a weak relationship in the spatial distribution of the seed rain between the autumn and winter periods. Abies did not maintain a persistent seed bank on the site; viable seeds were present on the soil only after seed dispersal had started. Postdispersal seed mortality was relatively high, ca. 70%. Acer seed rain started soon after the flowering period, but consisted at that time only of aborted, underdeveloped samaras. Viable seeds were disseminated from September through early winter. Dispersal during the autumn accounted for ca. 98% of the annual seed crop. There were significant differences between seed rain abundance of 1988 and that of 1989 (118.1 +/- 9.5 samaras m-2 and 158.9 +/- 16.3 samaras m-2 in 1988 and in 1989, respectively). Seed viability also varied significantly between the 2 years, i.e., 19% in 1988 and 5% in 1989. For both 1988 and 1989, samaras were contagiously dispersed over the site. There was a significant positive relationship between the spatial distribution of the seed rain in 1988 and that in 1989. Seed rain abundance was high mainly in the proximity of mature Acer trees. As for Abies, Acer did not maintain a persistent seed bank in the soil; viable seeds were present only in the autumn seed bank sampling, after seed fall had started. Postdispersal seed mortality was relatively low, i.e., 20%. Abies and Acer are quite similar in their regenerative traits, and these contrast sharply with those of Betula alleghaniensis, a regular member of this forest community. Differences in regenerative traits may contribute to the coexistence of these tree species considering the gap regime of the system studied.																	0002-9122					JUL	1991	78	7					895	905		10.2307/2445168							WOS:A1991FX43200003

ECOLOGICAL LIFE-CYCLE	BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB												Solidago shortii T. & G. is a hemicryptophyte perennial that reproduces by sexual and vegetative means. Flower bud formation begins in June, and anthesis occurs from early August to mid-October. Seeds ripen in October and November, are dispersed until March, and germinate from late February to April. A persistent seed bank is not formed. Twenty-two percent of 1344 first-year juveniles marked in the field in May 1989 were alive in mid-September 1990. Although plants can flower in their first year in cultivation, it takes more than 2 years for them to reach reproductive maturity in the field. Buds formed belowground at the base of current-year shoots in summer produce rhizomes and aerial stems, which emerge in autumn or in early spring. Elongation of aerial stems begins in early spring and continues until June or July (nonflowering stems) or late August (flowering stems). The life cycle characteristics of S. shortii are similar to those of some weedy and/or geographically widespread members of the genus.																	0040-9618					JUL-SEP	1991	118	3					281	287		10.2307/2996642							WOS:A1991GH46400004						
J	STAVER, C				STAVER, C			THE ROLE OF WEEDS IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AMAZONIAN BUSH FALLOW AGRICULTURE	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Three effects of herbaceous weeds on the productivity of a bush fallow system cropped with maize, cassava and plantain were identified in four experiments carried out in Central Amazonian Peru. First, early weed control is needed to minimize crop yield reductions. Weeds reduce plantain raceme weight and days to flowering, but not cassava yield, if weeding is done early. Second, fallows must be long enough to reduce weed seed banks to levels tolerable to farmers. While fallows of between two and five years eliminate herbaceous weed biomass present at the beginning of the fallow, weed seed banks decline linearly through ten years of tree cover. Third, with successive clean-weedings to reduce weed competition, tree and shrub numbers and their proportion of total non-crop biomass decline, while the amount and proportion of herbaceous weeds increase. Tree and shrub regeneration is reduced by longer cropping periods, more frequent weedings, greater crop cover, and shorter fallow periods.																	0014-4797					JUL	1991	27	3					287	304		10.1017/S0014479700019013							WOS:A1991GE39500007

J	OCONNOR, TG				OCONNOR, TG			LOCAL EXTINCTION IN PERENNIAL GRASSLANDS - A LIFE-HISTORY APPROACH	AMERICAN NATURALIST												A common element of many perennial grasslands, defined as an extinction-prone perennial grass, is a palatable obligate seed reproducer, producing low numbers of larger diaspores that are poorly dispersed. Such a species can become locally extinct on a regional or landscape scale in grasslands that experience both a variable rainfall, in which drought is characteristic, and sustained heavy grazing. The changes in the temporal and spatial patterns of grazing in human-influenced systems has created the possibility of local extinction. Catastrophic mortality of established populations occurs as a consequence of droughts in combination with sustained grazing, which eventually leads to the elimination of the population. Elimination of the established population is more likely to occur in semiarid than moist areas because of the greater frequency and duration of droughts. The maintenance or reestablishment of the population depends on successful recruitment, but seedling mortality is high because of intraseasonal drought and trampling. The seed bank of an extinction-prone species is rapidly eliminated if the input of seed is curtailed. These species do not form persistent seed banks because the seeds have a limited (2-3 yr) intrinsic capacity for survival when in a state of induced or enforced dormancy. Innate dormancy lasts for only a few months. Therefore, the size of the seed bank is determined primarily by the annual input of seed. But even under favorable rainfall and light grazing. 100% of seed produced can be lost to predation. Seed production can fail from drought and from the direct consumption of inflorescences. An extinction-prone species is self-dispersed and therefore poorly dispersed. The rate and scale of incidental animal dispersal are unlikely to assist in the maintenance or reestablishment of a population because of the low probability of seedling survival. The decline of an extinction-prone species under heavy grazing is compounded by the concomitant competitive influences of invasive species and unpalatable species, which both benefit from heavy grazing. Irreversible changes in the physicochemical environment may also result in local extinction, but these processes are not mutually exclusive. The autogenic model of secondary succession is inadequate for these grasslands if the present concept of local extinction is upheld.																	0003-0147					JUN	1991	137	6					753	773		10.1086/285192							WOS:A1991GB40000003

The mean water depth was lowest just before the onset of monsoon, highest immediately after it, and then declined slowly over the winter and spring. The mean cover of P. distichum was also lowest just prior to the onset of the monsoon (e.g. 19% in June 1984), increased after the monsoon (e.g. 35% in October 1985) and did not reach its maximum until late winter (e.g. 49% in March 1985). There was relatively little change in the species composition of the vegetation over an annual cycle. Because of the poor monsoon in 1986, water depths were much lower during the post-monsoonal period than normal. The cover of P. distichum was also reduced during this period and fell to only 2% by March 1987. The seed banks of areas dominated by Paspalum and four other emergent species contained a total of 55 species and between 1100 and 3100 seeds m-2. Seeds of P. distichum were found in all vegetation types. Paspalum-dominated areas grazed by geese had a seed bank that contained 44 species and a mean of about 1000 seeds m-2. Only goose droppings collected in November contained viable seeds, of which 90% were Paspalum seeds. Paspalum litter (6 cm or more) reduced recruitment from the seed bank by about 80% and the number of species recruited by about 50%. Only 12 species (total seedling density < 1 seedling m-2) became established in openings created in the grass mat by geese during a summer drawdown. In an area where Paspalum was removed with bulldozers, the post-monsoonal vegetation was dominated by submersed and floating-leaved species. Paspalum was initially present at very low cover (0.1%) and increased to 4.6% in the next 9 months.

(2) Free grazing and controlled grazing compared with no grazing strongly affected seed output but had no effect on the survival of juveniles and vegetative adults. Vegetative plants provide an important population reserve of dormant buds. (3) Grazing diminished fecundity by reducing plant resources; this effect was greater when grazing was unrestricted. Under controlled grazing, the reduction in fecundity was correlated with an increase in the survival of individuals, relative to free grazing and no grazing. (4) The population dynamics of A. vulneraria are more dependant on reproductive characteristics than on factors influencing survival.																	0022-0477					JUN	1991	79	2					275	284		10.2307/2260712							WOS:A1991GX79600001

Three scales were examined hierarchically: sampling units within plots of 0.25 m2 for the vegetation and of 0.05 m2 for the seed bank, 100 m2 plots within fields, and fields of 1000 m2. In spite of the strong spatial variation among sampling units, species richness and composition of both seed bank and vegetation showed hierarchically structured patterns of heterogeneity, while each oldfield was a homogeneous entity. These spatial patterns tended to be partially masked when the data were aggregated at the scale of the plot. Such results stress the use of a nested sampling design for studying variation in species richness and taxonomic composition in both vegetation and seed bank. This design, in combination with CCA, also showed that the vegetation showed a coarser grain than the seed bank, probably in relation to seed clumping.																	1100-9233					JUN	1991	2	3					367	376		10.2307/3235929							WOS:A1991GB68300012

Seed banks were determined from counts of germinants from 50 soil cores from each type. Aboveground estimates of plant species cover in 10 1-m2 plots were used in determining vegetation/seed bank similarities. There was no evidence for seed bank densities to be markedly higher in the most frequently disturbed community (grassland - 4273 seeds/m2) than the least disturbed community (thicket - 3417 seeds/m2). Highest similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation composition in terms of species and growth form/life-span classes was recorded for grassland (CC = 50%). Lowest similarity (CC = 13%) was found in the less frequently disturbed thicket where no seeds of climax trees were recorded in the seed bank. A fynbos community on a north-facing (warm, dry) slope had intermediate-sized seed banks (1683 seeds/m2) with intermediate vegetation/seed bank similarity (CC = 46%). However, on the south-facing slope, which has a large post-fire ephemeral herb component, seed banks were larger (4518 seeds/m2) but less similar to above-ground vegetation (CC = 39%). Ordination (DCA) of vegetation data from the four communities was different from an ordination of their seed bank data. Fynbos shrub species were absent from seed banks of both grassland and thicket, even though secondary succession proceeds from grassland, through fynbos to thicket. Their seed banks appear less persistent than those of European heath or Californian chaparral shrubs.																	1100-9233					JUN	1991	2	3					403	412		10.2307/3235933							WOS:A1991GB68300016

Similar patterns were evident where estimates of annual viable seed inputs to the soil were compared with measured non-dormant soil-stored seed reserves. The latter increased up to 10-fold in soils after fire. In serotinous Protea repens, correction of measured fire-induced seed input for an observed 72.5% reduction in seed viability in cones during fire resulted in an estimated viable seed input similar to this specie's recorded post-fire seedling population density. Data suggest that dormant seed reserves do not accumulate in fynbos soils between fires. This may explain localized species population extinctions and sensitivity of fynbos to disturbance.																	0254-6299					JUN	1991	57	3					131	142		10.1016/S0254-6299(16)30951-6							WOS:A1991FU53900001

J	HOLZNER, VW				HOLZNER, VW			WEED-TYPES - A CLASSIFICATION OF RUDERALS AND SEGETALS USING COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL-ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA .2. THE DOMINANT PERENNIALS	BODENKULTUR												The polycarpic perennials with a tendency to form pure stands were classified according to the principles used in part one of this paper (HOLZNER 1991). Four types have been determined: O. Strong vegetative reproduction by underground tillers with high regenerative capacity means special adaption to frequent soil disturbance, an environmental factor difficult to bear by perennials. The focus of reproduction is on the vegetative side. Generative reproduction plays a subordinal part. P. High seed production and efficient dispersal over long distances brings only sporadically available stands within the reach of the species. They are afterwards occupied by the means of a subterranean tiller-phalanx. Q. Intermediate type between O and R. R. High seed production, dispersal by animals (and man), a seed bank, protective devices against browsing, and high nutrient requirements point to a niche of sites where the vegetation is regularly disturbed by animals.																	0006-5471					MAY	1991	42	2					135	146									WOS:A1991FP25400004

Forty new vascular plant species became established. The five most abundant new species had abundant seed sources in the vicinity of the experimental area and were species with effective seed dispersal and (or) a persistent seed bank. Many of the new species, however, dispersed long distances to colonize the experimental area. Wind was the dominant dispersal mechanism among the species that established early, whereas most of the species that established during the later part of the study period had no obvious adaptation for wind or animal dispersal. Two new species with rapid vegetative spread and tall stature, Rubus idaeus L. and Epilobium angustifolium L., dominated the field layer at the end of the study period. Of the original field layer species, Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull decreased, while the other two dwarf shrubs, Vaccinium myrtillus L. and Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., remained largely constant. The bottom layer as a whole decreased. All reindeer lichens (Cladina spp.) disappeared, and the dominant moss, Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., decreased markedly. Some new litter-growing moss species became established.																	0045-5067					MAY	1991	21	5					733	738		10.1139/x91-104							WOS:A1991FM12600029						
J	KEELEY, JE				KEELEY, JE			SEED-GERMINATION AND LIFE-HISTORY SYNDROMES IN THE CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Syndromes are life history responses that are correlated to environmental regimes and are shared by a group of species (Stebbins, 1974). In the California chaparral there are two syndromes contrasted by the timing of seedling recruitment relative to wildfires. One syndrome, here called the fire-recruiter or refractory seed syndrome, includes species (both resprouting and non-resprouting) which share the feature that the timing of seedling establishment is specialized to the first rainy season after fire. Included are woody, suffrutescent and annual life forms but no geophytes have this syndrome. These species are linked by the characteristic that their seeds have a dormancy which is readily broken by environmental stimuli such as intense heat shock or chemicals leached from charred wood. Such seeds are referred to as "refractory" and dormancy, in some cases, is due to seed coat impermeability (such seeds are commonly called hardseeded), but in other cases the mechanism is unknown. Seeds of some may require cold stratification and/or light in addition to fire related stimuli. In the absence of fire related cues, a portion or all of a species' seed pool remains dormant. Most have locally dispersed seeds that persist in the soil seed bank until the site burns. Dispersal of propagules is largely during spring and summer which facilitates the avoidance of flowering and fruiting during the summer and fall drought. Within a life form (e.g., shrub, suffrutescent, etc.), the seeds of these species have less mass than those of species with non-refractory seeds and this possibly reflects the environmental favorableness of the postfire environment for seedling establishment. Regardless of when fire occurs, germination is normally delayed until late winter or early spring. In the absence of fire, or other disturbance, opportunities for population expansion are largely lacking for species with this syndrome. The other syndrome, here called the fire-resister or non-refractory seed syndrome, includes species that are resilient to frequent fires (mostly by vegetative resprouting), but require fire-free periods for recruiting new seedlings. Included are shrubs, subshrubs, suffrutescents, lianas, geophytes and annuals. All are linked by the characteristic that their seeds germinate in the absence of cues related to wildfires. In many cases no form of seed dormancy is present and the seeds germinate soon after dispersal; consequently these species do not accumulate a persistent seed bank. Germination and seedling establishment is independent of fire and thus opportunities for population expansion are also independent of fire. The demographic pattern of seedling recruitment varies with the life form. For shrubs, seedling recruitment may be restricted to sites free of fire for periods of a hundred years or more. Recruitment appears to require relatively mesic conditions and this may account for the patchy distribution of these species within the matrix of relatively arid sites. Finding such sites has selected for propagules specialized for wind or animal dispersal; the majority are bird dispersed. These shrub species all disperse fruits in fall and winter and this may have been selected to take advantage of migratory birds as well as to time dispersal to the winter rains typical of the mediterranean-climate. Germination typically occurs within several weeks of the first fall or winter rains. Maturation of flowers and fruits during the summer and fall drought may account for the distribution of these species on more mesic sites. Seed mass of these species is large and this may have been selected to provide an advantage to seedlings establishing under the canopy of this dense shrub community.																	0006-8101					APR-JUN	1991	57	2					81	116		10.1007/BF02858766							WOS:A1991FT22500001						
J	MILBERG, P				MILBERG, P			FERN SPORES IN A GRASSLAND SOIL	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Large numbers of fern spores germinated in soil samples from a grassland trail. The trail was established in central Sweden 35 years ago to study the effect of different treatments on grassland vegetation. The density of prothallia varied between 57 000 and 170 000 m-2 in the different treatments. There were no ferns in the treatment plots, and none of the three fern species identified from the spore bank were found in the surrounding area. This suggests that the large spore bank has accumulated over a long period of time and that fern spores are capable of remaining viable in the soil for several years. A large spore bank can enhance the chance for intergametophytic crossing in fern species.

J	KALISZ, S				KALISZ, S			EXPERIMENTAL-DETERMINATION OF SEED BANK AGE STRUCTURE IN THE WINTER ANNUAL COLLINSIA-VERNA	ECOLOGY												Data on survival in and emergence from soil seed banks are scarce for natural plant populations. In this paper I present a new experimental method for quantifying soil seed bank dynamics in the field and data derived from this method describing the age structure of the seed bank for the winter annual Collinsia verna. The roles of spatial and temporal variation in seed bank formation were investigated using a replicated design arrayed along three transects in the study site. Emergence from and persistence in the seed bank were monitored for 3 yr using experimental seed banks containing seeds of the same age arrayed along each of the three transects. In addition, replicate estimates of survivorship and fecundity of naturally emerging plants were monitored in quadrats arrayed along each of the three transects. The conditional probability of persisting in the seed bank for 1 yr ranged from 14 to 45% and differed significantly among the transects. Significant differences in the probabilities of emerging (or persisting) produced seed banks of varying age structure among the transects and years. A life table analysis of the vegetative plants indicated significant differences between years in their survivorship curves. In addition, seedlings derived from seeds 1 yr old or older germinated significantly later than the general seed population. Age-structured seed banks are expected to alter the population dynamics and demographic projections of plant populations.																	0012-9658					APR	1991	72	2					575	585		10.2307/2937197							WOS:A1991FE24800015						
J	HOULE, G				HOULE, G			REGENERATIVE TRAITS OF TREE SPECIES IN A DECIDUOUS FOREST OF NORTHEASTERN NORTH-AMERICA	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												I studied the seed rain, seedling bank, newly emerged seedlings, and seed bank of tree species in a deciduous forest of northeastern North America (Quebec, Canada). The main objective was to determine to what extent the three species present on the site differed in some of their regenerative traits. All the species present on the quadrats as mature trees contributed to the annual seed rain, although seed rain was strongly dominated by yellow birch and sugar maple. The seedling bank was mostly composed of red maple and sugar maple, but inputs from the 1988 cohort were mostly red maple and yellow birch seedlings. Seedling mortality was high in general (from 60% to 100%), but sugar maple had the lowest mortality of the tree species present. Two species maintained a seed bank on the study site: yellow birch and american basswood. Some species not present on the quadrats, but having populations nearby, disseminated seeds onto the quadrats (i.e. white ash and grey birch). Other species, not present on the quadrats as mature individuals, had seeds in the seed bank although they did not participate in the seed rain, did not maintain a seedling bank, and did not establish seedlings in 1988 (i.e. pin-cherry and Rubus spp.). Red maple, sugar maple, and yellow birch showed contagion in the dispersion pattern of their seeds in the seed rain (and the seed bank for yellow birch), and of their seedlings in the seedling bank and the 1988 cohort. Seedlings of american beech and american basswood of the seedling bank and the 1988 cohort were randomly dispersed over the quadrats, although their seeds in the seed rain had a contagious dispersion pattern. It has often been proposed in the literature that regenerative traits come only in "compatible assemblages" and that, consequently, species may be grouped according to their strategy of regeneration: e.g. species that maintain a seed bank vs those with a seedling bank; species with either a seed or a seedling bank vs those with the ability to sprout. In the community studied, it appears that regenerative traits do not come in neatly packaged exclusive assemblages, although the species do seem to possess different combinations of regenerative traits. However, yearly variations in seed production, seed germination, and seedling survival may render difficult the identification of strategies of regeneration.																	0105-9327					APR-JUN	1991	14	2					142	151									WOS:A1991FH82300010

A pristine shoreline which supports globally and nationally significant Atlantic coastal plain species averaged 8500 seeds/m2. Seeds were most abundant high on the shore and where standing crop was greatest. Rare species, which made up 22% of the standing crop and litter of the adult vegetation, comprised only 4% of the seed bank. Common rushes such as Juncus canadensis and J. filiformis, were not well represented in the adult vegetation (5% of the standing crop and litter) but were abundant in the seed bank (52% of all seeds). Seed densities were on average, much lower on an intensely disturbed shoreline (1000 seeds/m2), where heavy all-terrain vehicle traffic had destroyed the adult vegetation. These results suggest that intense disturbances will destroy both existing vegetation and the seed bank and moderate disturbances will alter community composition so that common rushes will replace already endangered Atlantic coastal plain species.																	1100-9233					APR	1991	2	2					181	188		10.2307/3235950							WOS:A1991FQ52200006						
J	LLORET, F; ZEDLER, PH				LLORET, F; ZEDLER, PH			RECRUITMENT PATTERN OF RHUS-INTEGRIFOLIA POPULATIONS IN PERIODS BETWEEN FIRE IN CHAPARRAL	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Population structure, fruit production and dispersal, and recruitment of Rhus integrifolia, a gynodioecious sclerophyllous shrub living in coastal chaparral, were studied in two localities in southern California last burned 60 and 90 years ago. Though hermaphroditic plants produce some fruits, only the male-sterile plants bore significant numbers. Among the sample plants, one individual accounted for 50% of the crop measured. Terrestrial animals, through the loss of some seeds taken for consumption, play a decisive role in the seed dispersal, promoting the establishment of seedlings outside the parent's canopy. Birds have not been demonstrated to contribute to long distance dispersal, but they are responsible for dropping 25% of the fruits collected below the R. integrifolia canopies, 36% of which were completely destroyed. Allelopathic effects were not observed in laboratory assays, and germination is probably not influenced by the species beneath which seeds have been deposited. This pattern can explain the non-aggregated distribution of individuals observed in the studied populations. We conclude that establishment of new individuals has been continuous at both localities and that the populations of R. integrifolia are increasing in these long unburned stands. This may be indicative of a successional trend in unburned chaparral and coastal scrub toward a sclerophyllous woodland.

J	OCONNOR, TG				OCONNOR, TG			PATCH COLONIZATION IN A SAVANNA GRASSLAND	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Patches (1 m diameter) were cleared in a heavily grazed and a lightly grazed savanna in South Africa; half of them were covered once with grass litter. The greatest colonisation over three years occurred on heavily grazed patches with litter, the least on open, lightly grazed patches. Annual rainfall affected colonisation rate. Basal cover was lower on patches than in the surrounding vegetation. Patch composition was weakly affected by treatment, and was partly related to the composition of adjacent vegetation, but the proportional representation of species on patches differed from the surrounding vegetation. The stoloniferous Digitaria eriantha and the obligate seed reproducers Aristida bipartita and Heteropogon contortus were major components of patch communities but were uncommon in the surrounding vegetation and in the seed bank. Setaria incrassata and Themeda triandra were the predominant components of the surrounding vegetation and of the seed bank, but Setaria established very poorly and Themeda established well only on heavily grazed patches with litter. The pattern of seedling establishment was the same as that of colonisation. Most seedlings emerged at the beginning of the wet season, with ca. 50% mortality soon thereafter. The colonising species can be partly predicted from the availability of propagules (vegetative or seed), emergence and establishment success, and subsequent growth.																	1100-9233					APR	1991	2	2					245	254		10.2307/3235957							WOS:A1991FQ52200013

In this paper integrodifference equation models are formulated for annual plant populations without a seed bank; these models differ in the stage of the life cycle at which intraspecific competition acts to reduce vital rates. The models exhibit a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaotic spatial and temporal behavior. The behavior of the models when modal dispersal distances are at the origin is compared with their behavior when these distances are displaced away from the origin. The models are capable of predicting stable, cyclical, and chaotic asymptotic behavior. They also predict that the variance of dispersal distances is an important indicator of the colonizing ability of a species.																	0025-5564	1879-3134				APR	1991	104	1					135	157		10.1016/0025-5564(91)90034-G							WOS:A1991FD11400009	1804452

The same herbicide was applied across tillage treatments within each year and an untreated permanent grass sod was sampled for comparison. Seed numbers to a 15-cm depth were highest in the no-tillage treatment in the Crosby silt loam (77 800 m-2) and Wooster silt loam (8400 m-2) soils and in the grass sod (7400 m-2) in a Hoytville silty clay loam soil. Lowest seed numbers were found in conventional-tillage plots in the Wooster soil (400 m-2) and in minimum-tillage plots in the Crosby (2200 m-2) and Hoytville (400 m-2) soils. Concentration of seeds decreased with depth but the effect of tillage on seed depth was not consistent among soil types. Number of weed species was highest in permanent grass sod (10 to 18) and decreased as soil disturbance increased; weed populations were lowest in conventional tillage in the Hoytville soil. Common lambsquarters, pigweeds, and fall panicum were the most commonly found seeds in all soils. Diversity indices indicated that increased soil disturbance resulted in a decrease in species diversity. Weed populations the summer following soil sampling included common lambsquarters, pigweeds, fall panicum, and several species not detected in the seed bank.																	0043-1745					APR-JUN	1991	39	2					186	194		10.1017/S0043174500071459							WOS:A1991FY47400010

The stand at the study site consisted of groups of even-aged, fire-sensitive plants, suggesting recruitment is usually dependent on recurrent fire. Following a 4-yr juvenile period, annual fruit set increased exponentially, yielding 11,700 two-seeded follicles per plant over the subsequent 19 yr. Two major constraints restricted the number of seeds available for the next generation: low fruit set relative to flower production (1.5%) and decay of canopy-held follicles after 10 yr. There was no predation of reproductive parts and only minor abortion, senescence, and prefire release of seeds. Most of the 17,100 viable canopy-stored seeds in the 23-yr-old cohort were released within 24 h of a hot autumn fire, whereas wet/dry cycles were required following milder fires. Less than 5% of seeds germinated and only 0.1% of these survived the first summer drought. Seedlings transplanted to moister sites and/or watered regularly over summer were much larger and more likely to survive to the next winter than the controls. We conclude that population numbers are not limited by the size and dynamics of the canopy seed bank but by the weather pattern following fire-induced seed release.

J	FENSTER, CB				FENSTER, CB			GENE FLOW IN CHAMAECRISTA-FASCICULATA (LEGUMINOSAE) .2. GENE ESTABLISHMENT	EVOLUTION												The role of gene establishment in gene flow was investigated in a population of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata by determining the effect of interparent distance on progeny fitness throughout the entire life history. A decelerating gain in progeny fitness with increasing interparent distance was observed. Selfed progeny suffered a 2-fold fitness disadvantage compared to progeny derived from mating events between individuals in the same neighborhood. Progeny derived from within neighborhood crosses had lower fitness than progeny from crosses between neighborhoods. Coupling the effect of interparent distance on gene establishment with information on gene dispersal resulted in a considerable increase in estimated gene flow. However, gene flow was still limited, as the average neighborhood area corresponded to a circle with radius of approximately 3.0 m. Yearly fluctuations in population size and variation in reproductive output lowered the estimate of N(e) below the census estimate to approximately 100 individuals. The role of a seed bank in increasing the estimate of N(e) was found to be insignificant. It is likely that genetic drift plays a major role in determining the distribution of genetic variation in this population.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				MAR	1991	45	2					410	422		10.2307/2409674							WOS:A1991FL11400015	28567871					
J	ALVAREZBUYLLA, ER; GARCIABARRIOS, R				ALVAREZBUYLLA, ER; GARCIABARRIOS, R			SEED AND FOREST DYNAMICS - A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND AN EXAMPLE FROM THE NEOTROPICS	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Models that combine seed demography and forest dynamics to predict seed densities in forest patches of different disturbance ages are proposed. Two models are derived from a generalized Lefkovitch model with immigration. The first model assumes constant seed rain; the second one considers seed rain as a function of the forest mosaic configuration that changes according to a Markov-chain process. This theoretical framework was used to analyze data for the pioneer tree Cecropia obtusifolia at Los Tuxtlas rain forest. Our first model suggests that despite low soil-seed survival rates, high seed densities in all patch types in a forest mosaic may be explained by the abundant seed rain typical of pioneer species. We found that an abundant seed rain to all patches enables the regeneration of this species despite high seed predation and pathogen attack rates in the soil. Analysis of the second model suggests that increased gap formation in sites 2-35 yr since disturbance seems to alter seed availability of pioneers and patch dynamics less than an equal increase in gap formation in mature patches (> 35 yr since disturbed). Extensive deforestation that alters seed-rain regimes will prevent regeneration of secondary species such as C. obtusifolia that have fast seed-bank turnover rates. A comparison with previous works calls for more quantitative studies on the input and loss dynamics of soil seeds in different patches for particular tropical species.

Weak summer-annuals of cool areas and acid soils. E. Tiny summer-annuals on soils that are very wet after winter. F. Weak summer-annuals requiring warm summers. G. Strong (competitive) summer-annuals requiring high soil-temperatures for germination and warm summers. H. Winter-annual segetals ripening their seeds in summer. I. Specialists with crop mimicry, seeds distributed as impurities of grain. J. Small, modest winter-/summer-annuals. K. Larger species, very flexible regarding life-span and the relationship vegetative/reproductive phase - both depending on the germination time. L. Modest winter-annuals (rarely summer-annual) with seed dispersal over long distances. M. Modest "biennials", requiring light for germination, with seed-bank of very long life (dispersal in time). N. "Biennials" prefering better soils, germinating without light, seed dispersal in space, practically no seed bank; protective features and agents against big herbivores. The strategy, (theoretical) niche and the site properties of all these types are described, the question of the origin (primary site) discussed and some examples are given for each type.

We determined the relative resilience of forest- and open-grown populations of the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Caprifoliaceae) growing in northern Kentucky. Resilience was assessed by imposing a clipping regime (once each year from 1986 to 1989) during which shrub resprouting abilities were measured. Habitat-specific population regeneration from seeds in the seed bank was also measured. Forest-grown L. maackii shrubs were less resilient than open-grown shrubs when stressed by repeated clipping, due presumably to exhaustion of stored reserves in shrub bases. This suggests that forests are secondary habitats for L. maackii. However, resprouting potential and seed production in forests appear sufficient to regenerate populations after most common disturbances. The ability to modify sprouting patterns while maintaining resprouting ability and some seed production over a wide range of habitats is an important adaptation of this invasive shrub. Management suggestions for shrub eradication are provided.																	1051-0761					FEB	1991	1	1					104	109		10.2307/1941852							WOS:A1991FP61700011	27755678

In the younger plants, canopy seed storage was highest in B. coccinea. However, 21-year-old B. coccinea stored an order of magnitude fewer seeds than the other species and no more than young B. coccinea. Seed storage per year increased exponentially with plant age in B. speciosa and R baxteri, whereas a quadratic function, peaking at 16 years, best described seed storage in B. coccinea. Degree of serotiny was lowest in B. coccinea. Seed abortion did not vary between age cohorts but was highest in B. coccinea. Granivory ranged from 18 to 42% and was highest in the older plants and in B. baxteri. Cockatoos removed about 20% of cones in B. baxteri and B. coccinea and 10% in B. speciosa. Experimental cone removal accelerated follicle opening, especially in B. coccinea, irrespective of whether cones were placed on the ground (simulating cockatoo removal) or reattached to the plant (simulating plant death). Half the 21-year-old B. coccinea were dead and the remainder were considered senescent, as most branches showed dieback and cone fertility had fallen to 8%. Death of the other species was negligible, with cone fertility rising to a mean of 45% (B. speciosa) and 66% (B. baxteri). Interfire establishment was significant only in B. coccinea.

J	CLARK, SG; MCDONALD, RM; STREET, HC				CLARK, SG; MCDONALD, RM; STREET, HC			LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE OF SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM) CULTIVARS IN SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												The long-term persistence of 6 subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) cultivars was determined by sampling seed from 2 experiments at Hamilton and Beeac in south-western Victoria, 8 or 12 years after sowing. For most of this period the plots were managed as part of the surrounding pasture and were closely grazed by sheep. Herbage yield measurements were made and seed was collected from each plot and grown in a glasshouse, in order to identify the cultivar(s) present. Cultivars used were Yarloop, Trikkala, Larisa and Meteora (spp. yanninicum), and Mount Barker and Woogenellup (spp. subterranean). At both sites, plots sown to Trikkala and Larisa had the greatest seed banks and experienced the lowest level of invasion by other cultivars or ecotypes. Mount Barker and Yarloop appeared to have persisted at low levels; their plots were moderately invaded. Plots sown to the unsuccessful Woogenellup were heavily invaded and contained only a small seed bank of Woogenellup seed. Eight to 12 years after sowing, plots at Hamilton and Beeac that were sown to Larisa produced 3-15 times as much clover dry matter in spring as plots sown to Mount Barker. At Hamilton, the plots sown to Trikkala produced 3 times as much clover in winter as those sown to Mount Barker. This study indicates that Trikkala and Larisa offer clear advantages over the older cultivars, Mount Barker and Woogenellup, for the high rainfall areas of western Victoria, by demonstrating their persistence and long-term productivity when subjected to normal sheep-grazing practice.																	0816-1089						1991	31	5					625	629		10.1071/EA9910625							WOS:A1991GW89700006

As a consequence, germplasm conservation techniques have become accessible to protect the third world's germplasm diversity. Several approaches are used for germplasm conservation and utilization. The evaluation and use of these techniques has to be focussed with one important objective; to preserve with as much integrity as possible, the genetic variability of the selected species. Questions have risen about the best way to preserve genetic diversity of the humid tropics, since it is being recognized that these conditions hold much of the world's gene pool of plants. Seed banks are considered the best system for orthodox seed storage. For many tropical species that cannot support dehydration, tissue culture and cryoconservation are the best alternative. Important considerations regarding the adaptation of modern techniques to tropical species have to be carefully analyzed. Quantitative studies of genetic indices of somaclonal variation, or types or mutant plants can be observed. Consideration of plant germplasm as a base for genetic improvement has come a long way, but much remains to be done, particularly, with the plant diversity that exists in the tropics. All efforts to conserve and use genetic resources will contribute to the benefit of future human generations.																	0734-9750						1991	9	2					197	215		10.1016/0734-9750(91)90004-F							WOS:A1991GB10400004	14548737

J	BROWN, JS; VENABLE, DL				BROWN, JS; VENABLE, DL			LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION OF SEED-BANK ANNUALS IN RESPONSE TO SEED PREDATION	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												We present a model of life history evolution for seed-bank annuals in temporally varying environments in which both the seed bank and the distribution of fecundity across year types evolve in response to seed predation. The fecundity distribution refers to the expected reproductive success of germinating seeds across a range of different year types. We assume that it is a function of traits pertaining to growth and survival under different environmental circumstances. Such traits are assumed to result in a trade-off between reproduction in favourable and less favourable years. The model is used to explore how seed predation selects for changes in the seed bank and fecundity distribution and how changes in each of these further select for changes in the other. The direction of selection is contingent upon: whether or not a seed bank exists; whether predation has a greater effect on fresh or buried seed; whether the predation rate differs in different year types, and if so, if it is positively or negatively density-dependent; whether or not predation rate is sensitive to individual variation in seed yield, and if so, whether and how such dependency varies in different kinds of year. Under a variety of predation regimes, seed predators select for a temporal clumping of reproduction; i.e. a specialisation on a favourable subset of year types. This effect usually requires negatively density-dependent seed predation of the sort created by predator satiation. In fact, the classic scenario favouring masting in perennials creates the strongest such effect in our model. Yet unlike the masting of perennial plants, this effect is favoured in a seed-bank annual. It can even occur in a strict annual without a seed bank, and it can occur in a seed-bank annual even if seed predation is density-independent.

J	PONS, TL				PONS, TL			INDUCTION OF DARK DORMANCY IN SEEDS - ITS IMPORTANCE FOR THE SEED BANK IN THE SOIL	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Exposure to light breaks dormancy in seeds of many species. Dark dormancy prevents germination of seeds in the soil, which could otherwise be fatal. However, seeds may not be dark dormant upon dispersal, or exposure to stimulatory doses of light before burial may still cause the seeds to germinate in the soil. The induction of dark dormancy when germination was inhibited during incubation in polyethylene glycol has been investigated in three species. The process was faster at high than at low temperatures. In Origanum vulgare L. dark dormancy was re-established rather slowly. Disappearance of phytochrome in the far-red absorbing form (Pfr) and re-establishment of phytochrome control, from which the seeds had escaped, were involved. Induction of dark dormancy was much faster in Plantago major L., due to a reduction in responsiveness to light, absence of escape from phytochrome control and a high threshold level of Pfr for breaking dormancy. Not all seeds of O. vulgare and P. lanceolata L. were initially dark dormant; a light requirement was induced in the former, but not in c 25% of the seeds of the latter species. The importance of these findings for the formation of a seed bank in the soil is discussed.																	0269-8463						1991	5	5					669	675		10.2307/2389487							WOS:A1991GL11000013

J	LYBECKER, DW; SCHWEIZER, EE; KING, RP				LYBECKER, DW; SCHWEIZER, EE; KING, RP			WEED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IN CORN BASED ON BIOECONOMIC MODELING	WEED SCIENCE												A fixed (conventional) weed management strategy in corn was compared to three other strategies (two mixed and one flexible) in terms of weed control, grain yield, gross margin (gross income minus herbicide treatment costs), and herbicide use under furrow irrigation for four consecutive years. The fixed strategy prespecified preplanting, preemergence, postemergence, and layby herbicides. The flexible strategy herbicide treatments were specified by a computer bioeconomic model. Model decisions were based on weed seed in soil before planting, weed densities after corn emergence, herbicide costs, expected corn grain yield and selling price, and other parameters. The two mixed strategies were a combination of fixed and flexible strategies and designated either specified soil-applied herbicides (mixed/soil), or no soil-applied herbicide (mixed/no soil); post-emergence treatments were determined by the model. Average corn grain yield was 10 280 kg ha-1 and gross income was 920 $ ha-1 and neither differed among strategies. Total weed density and gross margin were significantly higher for the mixed/no soil and flexible strategies compared to the mixed/soil and fixed strategies. Total weed density averaged 28 720, 28 100, 10 910, and 680 plants ha-1 for the mixed/no soil, flexible, mixed/soil, and fixed strategies, respectively. Annual gross margins for the four strategies averaged 885, 875, 845, and 810 $ ha-1, respectively. Herbicide use over the 4-yr period for these four strategies averaged 3.8, 5.3, 20.5, and 26.9 kg ha-1, respectively, and each value differed from the other. Thus, weeds can be managed in corn, gross margins increased, and herbicide use decreased by employing a bioeconomic weed-corn model to make weed management decisions.																	0043-1745					JAN-MAR	1991	39	1					124	129		10.1017/S0043174500057982							WOS:A1991FD61200022						
J	MLADENOFF, DJ				MLADENOFF, DJ			THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SOIL SEED BANK AND UNDERSTORY VEGETATION IN OLD-GROWTH NORTHERN HARDWOOD HEMLOCK TREEFALL GAPS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												In mature northern hardwood forests, small treefall gaps constitute an important mode of compositional and structural change within the long return time of larger catastrophic disturbances. The soil seed bank and patterns in vegetation layers are described in this disturbance regime context. In these small treefall gaps, herbaceous and woody vegetation species present are similar to those of forest understory plots, differing primarily in abundance. Seed bank communities are compositionally more similar among gaps than forest understory plots, but vegetation similarity is equal among forest plots and among gaps. Seed bank-vegetation similarity is greater among forest plots than in gaps. Seed bank strategies differ among the plant species characteristic of the differing forest layers. Dominant canopy tree species (Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis, Betula alleghaniensis) are not an important component of the seed bank. Bird-dispersed shrub and herbaceous species and ant-dispersed herbs are important in the seed bank, especially in gaps. In particular, based on gap seed bank response, it appears that understory shrub abundance and pattern within the forest change with the time since large-scale disturbance, in accordance with species adaptations to the size and increase in number of small treefalls in the mature forest. These species patterns may relate to the patchy nature of resource availability that develops, especially that of nitrogen, which is controlled by the canopy species-gap mosaic.																	0008-4026					DEC	1990	68	12					2714	2721		10.1139/b90-344							WOS:A1990ET25100027

To assess the possible impact of these reductions on lowland tropical rain-forests, we exposed seedlings of three species of the family Moraceae to various combinations of day and night conditions under reduced light. The species represent three stages in tropical rain-forest succession: Cecropia obtusifolia is an early-successional pioneer, Trichospermum mexicanum is a mid-successional tree, and Brosimum alicastrum is a late-successional tree of mature-phase forests. All plants exposed to 10-degrees-C day temperature dropped all their leaves. Plants exposed to 13-degrees-C had very low photosynthetic rates. Plants exposed to 21-degrees-C differed in their photosynthetic response. The Crecropia had the highest rate of photosynthesis which did not differ from that at 30-degrees-C. The Trichospermum had a lower photosynthetic rate than the Cecropia, and the Brosimum had extremely low rates of photosynthesis. All species had different conductances at 21-degrees. The Cecropia had a significantly higher conductance at this temperature than it did at 30-degrees-C, resulting in a decline in water-use efficiency. This decline in water-use efficiency may severely affect the Cecropia in the event of cool periods occurring during the dry season. The severe decline in photosynthesis at 13-degrees-C suggests that this temperature is below the tolerance level of the Neotropical Moraceae. Because seeds of the primary forest species germinate soon after they are dispersed, we suggest that seedlings of the late-successional species would shed their leaves, many would probably die, and the species may become extinct locally. In contrast, because of their higher tolerance to cold temperatures as seen in this study, and their presence in the seed-bank, the pioneer species could become widely spread after a 'nuclear winter', and might not be quickly replaced by the late-successional species as would occur in the normal forest succession.

(2) Seeds after-ripen at high diurnally fluctuating temperatures (25/15-degrees-C, 30/15-degrees-C and 35/20-degrees-C) but not at low-constant or fluctuating temperatures (5-degrees-C, 15/6-degrees-C and 20/10-degrees-C); thus, the breaking of physiological dormancy occurs in the field during summer. Gibberellic acid promotes after-ripening. (3) Light is required for embryo growth, but it is ineffective while seeds are physiologically dormant. Thus, embryo growth and germination occur in autumn, after seeds are no longer physiologically dormant. However, if seeds are exposed to light for two or more days in summer, after the breakage of dormancy has started, they will germinate in darkness at normal autumn temperatures. (4) October habitat temperatures (c. 20/10-degrees-C) induce dormancy, and consequently no germination occurs in spring. Thus, the species behaves as a strict winter annual, germinating only in autumn. (5) Buried seeds exhibit an annual dormancy-non-dormancy cycle. Seeds become non-dormant during summer and re-enter dormancy in autumn. This is the first species in which it clearly has been demonstrated that seeds with MPD can go into and out of dormancy annually. (6) Embryos did not grow while seeds were buried for thirty-two months. A light requirement for embryo growth ensures that buried seeds do not germinate in autumn while they are non-dormant. This is one reason why seeds can form persistent seed banks. (7) Seeds have a type of MPD that has not been described before, and we suggest that it be called 'non-deep simple MPD.' This is the eighth type of MPD so far described for seeds.																	0022-0477					DEC	1990	78	4					993	1004		10.2307/2260948							WOS:A1990FD41600009						
J	GROSS, KL				GROSS, KL			A COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR ESTIMATING SEED NUMBERS IN THE SOIL	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) Seed-bank species composition and seed density were determined in an annually ploughed field at the Kellogg Biological Station in south-western Michigan, U.S.A. using three different methods: direct germination, germination following cold-stratification, and washing using a modified elutriation system. A fourth method, flotation on a salt-density gradient was abandoned after preliminary trials showed it was inefficient and inaccurate. (2) Twenty soil cores (2.5 cm in diameter, 15 cm deep) were taken from each of twenty-five sampling points in the field. Cores were divided into three depth intervals (0-2 cm, 2-5 cm and 5-15 cm) and five cores from each quarter of a sampling quadrat were combined and randomly assigned to one of the four methods for estimating the seed bank. (3) A total of fifty species was detected in the seed bank of this community. Overall, more species were detected with cold-stratification (forty-two species) than with direct germination (thirty-seven) or elutriation (thirty-five). Plots of species-sampling-area curves showed that fifteen to twenty sampling locations were sufficient to determine the number of species present in the seed bank with any of these methods. (4) Seed-density estimates were significantly higher in the elutriated samples. This was due primarily to the inclusion of inviable seeds in the counts from the elutriated samples. (5) There were significant differences in seed viability among species recovered in the elutriated samples. Both Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Chenopodium album, seeds of which were common in the samples, had low viability (25% and 3%, respectively). (6) Germination methods (particularly when more than one pre-treatment method is used) provide a more complete listing of species present in the soil seed bank of a community than elutriation. However, elutriation methods may be more useful for documenting variation in seed distributions on a large spatial scale or in quantifying the distribution of species with unique, easily identifiable seeds. Elutriation seems particularly well-suited for quantifying the distribution of plants that are considered weeds in agricultural systems, because many of these species have seeds that are easily identified and retain viability when dried.																	0022-0477					DEC	1990	78	4					1079	1093		10.2307/2260953							WOS:A1990FD41600014

Since then inside the reservation zone of the national park the development of the blown-over forests takes place without any direct influence of man. Outside the reservation zone the windfall areas were cleared, but not reforested. In 1988, a set of permanent sample plots was installed, and a first documentation of the vegetation on both cleared and uncleared areas took place. The following results can be reported five years after the storm: 1. Ground vegetation of the uncleared windfall areas normally differs little from that of the previous Calamagrostio-Piceetum, regarding both quality and quantity of species composition. 2. In contrast, vegetation of the cleared windfall areas represents the vegetation which develops after logging ("Schlagflur"), here the plant community "Rubetum idaei". This vegetation type is represented on the uncleared areas only in small patches: the throughs created by the uprooted trees. 3. Uncleared windfall areas are covered by large numbers of young spruce (Picea abies) and some of birch (Betula ssp.). Most of the spruce trees were already present in the understory of the previous forest when the windfall happened. On the cleared areas young spruce trees occur only in small numbers. The reason may be destruction of the spruce regeneration during the clearing procedure. Birch, on the other hand, is common especially on the cleared windfall areas. 4. Five years after the windfall, the developing tree cover on the uncleared areas already shows the renewal of a spruce stand which will, depending on the density of previous understory trees, be very variable in density. In contrast, a pioneer forest is developing on the cleared areas. 5. Therefore, vegetation development of cleared and uncleared windfall areas follows different traits: succession, a replacement of different plant communities on the cleared areas, but restitution of the previous tree cover and little change of the ground vegetation on uncleared areas. 6. During logging procedures, disturbance of ground vegetation as well as of soils takes place nearly everywhere: the soil seed bank becomes active, and species possessing flying diaspores may invade, both initiating the succession. This is not true for blown-over forest stands which are not influenced by man (with the exception of small patches where the trees were uprooted).																	0015-8003					NOV	1990	109	5					309	326		10.1007/BF02741645							WOS:A1990EP38900006						
J	BALL, DA; MILLER, SD				BALL, DA; MILLER, SD			WEED SEED POPULATION RESPONSE TO TILLAGE AND HERBICIDE USE IN 3 IRRIGATED CROPPING SEQUENCES	WEED SCIENCE												Research was conducted to evaluate the effects of primary tillage (moldboard plowing and chisel plowing), secondary tillage (row cultivation), and herbicides on weed species changes in the soil seed bank in three irrigated row cropping sequences over a 3-yr period. The cropping sequences consisted of continuous corn for 3 yr (CN), continuous pinto beans for 3 yr (PB), and sugarbeets for 2 yr followed by corn in the third year (SB). A comparison between moldboard and chisel plowing indicated that weed seed were more prevalent near the soil surface after chisel plowing. The density of certain annual weed seed over the 3-yr period increased more rapidly in the seed bank after chisel plowing compared to moldboard plowing. Species exhibiting the most pronounced increase included hairy nightshade and stinkgrass in the PB cropping sequence and redroot pigweed and common lambsquarters in the SB sequence. Conversely, kochia seed density in the SB sequence decreased more rapidly in chisel-plowed plots. Row cultivation generally reduced seed bank densities of most species compared to uncultivated plots. Herbicide use in each cropping sequence produced a shift in the weed seed bank in favor of species less susceptible to applied herbicides. In particular, seed of hairy nightshade became prevalent in the PB cropping sequence, and seed of kochia, redroot pigweed, and common lambsquarters became prevalent in the SB sequence.																	0043-1745					NOV	1990	38	6					511	517		10.1017/S0043174500051390							WOS:A1990EN88400011

Treatments applied to the soil surface included KNO3 (400 kg ha-1) in midwinter, ethephon (11 kg ha-1) in late spring, and a soil cover (polyethylene sheet for 2 wk) in late spring. Seeds were recovered within 1 yr after treatment, examined for in situ germination, and tested for viability. The 3-yr averages for viable seeds remaining by October in the year after treatment with KNO3 or soil cover, either alone or in combination, did not differ from nontreated checks and averaged 47% of the original population. Viable seeds remaining in soil treated with ethephon either alone or combined with KNO3 were reduced to 21% of the beginning population. The most effective treatments were ethephon either combined with a soil cover or with a soil cover plus KNO3 which reduced the viable seeds to an average of 8% of the original. Ethephon plus a soil cover has the potential to reduce greatly redroot pigweed seed populations in the field.																	0890-037X					OCT-DEC	1990	4	4					808	813									WOS:A1990EY83300020

Overwinter survival of caryopses enclosed in the palea and lemma and buried 1 cm below the soil or litter surface averaged 78% of those initially viable. Summer mortality was high, with only 5.5% of ungerminated fruits still viable by autumn. The major losses from the seed bank of this species were, in order of importance, germination, summer embryo mortality, and winter embryo mortality. There were significant differences in fruit survival, germination, and success of seedling establishment in the two most important microhabitats for seedlings, Poa colensoi turf, and litter/bryophyte mat.																	0028-825X						1990	28	4					471	474		10.1080/0028825X.1990.10412331							WOS:A1990EZ61500007

Advance regeneration and seed banking of woody plants in Ohio pine plantations: Implications for landscape change	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Silviculturally-managed pine plantations within southern Ohio are chronically disturbed patches of introduced vegetation distinct from the surrounding matrix of hardwood forest. To determine the successional pathways by which such pine stands might blend back into the hardwood forest matrix under different types of silvicultural management, we determined the current status of hardwood regeneration under 24 pine stands. Stands of Pinus virginiana (Virginia pine) had the highest density of hardwood seedlings and saplings (20,560 stems ha(-1)) whereas P. strobus (white pine) stands averaged only 7090 hardwood stems ha(-1); P. resinosa (red pine) stands were intermediate. The most abundant hardwood seedling and sapling species under pine canopies were Acer rubrum and Cornus florida. DCA ordination of the seedling + sapling assemblages clustered most of the P. resinosa and P, strobus stands in the center of the ordination along with a group of species which are common in second-growth forests of the area. P. virginiana stands, in contrast, were scattered throughout the ordination space. Most of the woody species common in second-growth forests of the region were also common in the pine understory. Multiple regression indicated that large plantations with deeper litter, higher soil pH and lower total hardwood density had the greatest abundance of mesic-site species in the understory. This relationship did not hold for P. resinosa stands, however, due to more frequent and intense silvicultural intervention. The seed bank was not an important source of woody seedlings to the understory assemblage under intact pine plantations. The vegetation of 1-4 yr old clear-cut sites was dominated by wind and bird dispersed species which were generally absent from the understory of intact plantations. We conclude these chronically disturbed planted patches will revert to matrix vegetation faster if the disturbance is allowed to end in a gradual manner through stand senescence than if it is abruptly ended by clear-cutting.																	0921-2973					MAY	1989	2	3					139	150		10.1007/BF00126014							WOS:000207943900002

The role of fluctuating temperatures in the germination and establishment of Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. Regulation of germination under leaf canopies	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1 The regulation of germination of Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. under plant canopies, and its relation with temperature fluctuation requirements of these seeds, were studied. 2 Seed germination was depressed under closed leaf canopies and both seedling emergence and soil thermal amplitude were strongly related to canopy height. 3 A similar effect was observed when seed banks were subjected to increasing artificial shading. Heating the soil under dense canopies resulted in the same germination flux as observed in bare soil. 4 Germination responses to different alternating temperature regimes under controlled conditions were in agreement with the results of field experiments where soil temperature was modified either by shading or heating. 5 These results demonstrate that the alternating temperature requirements for germination of S. halepense seeds have a role in regulating seed germination under leaf canopies. Some ecological implications of this mechanism are discussed.																	0269-8463						1988	2	3					311	318		10.2307/2389403							WOS:000208584400006
