J	Fowler, SP; Larson, KC				Fowler, SP; Larson, KC			Seed germination and seedling, recruitment of Japanese honeysuckle in a Central Arkansas natural area	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Nonindigenous plant species are an increasingly common problem in natural areas and effective management of invasive plants depends in part on accurate information about the life history of the invading species. The negative impact of Lonicera japonica, Japanese honeysuckle, on native plant communities is well known, as is this species capacity for prolific vegetative spreading by trailing stems. Surprisingly, despite being known for impressive floral displays, the capacity of L. japonica for establishment by seed is not known. We found that natural seedling recruitment rate in a L. japonica invaded state park in central Arkansas was only 0.002 seedlings per m(2) germinating and surviving one year. Results from experimental seed sowings indicated that germination of L. japonica seeds was patchy, but not significantly different in a shady forest interior and a sunnier forest edge, or impacted by predation or ground cover. Overall, 13.8% of the 2400 seeds sowed germinated from early spring to summer during the first year; no seeds germinated from the experimental plots the following spring, indicating no evidence of a seed bank in our study. Of the seeds that germinated, 14.4% survived one year in the forest interior, while no seedlings survived one year at the forest edge.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				FEB	2004	24	1					49	53									WOS:000189318300007						
J	Urretavizcaya, MF; Defosse, GE				Urretavizcaya, MF; Defosse, GE			Soil seed bank of Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Pic. Serm. et Bizarri related to different degrees of fire disturbance in two sites of southern Patagonia, Argentina	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Pic. Serm. and Bizarri, called locally "cypress" is among the most important native tree species that compose the temperate Subantarctic forests of Patagonia in Argentina. Cypress grows in either humid, mesic or dry sites, being fire the most important natural disturbance affecting these forests. Regeneration of cypress in burned areas is very slow, and may depend on a series of environmental and biotic factors, among which the availability of seeds could be extremely important. In this study, the dynamics of cypress soil seed bank was determined in two sites of its southern distribution area (Trevelin, 43degrees12'S, 71degrees31'W, and El Bolson 41degrees59'S, 71degrees33'W), and for three levels of fire disturbance (treatments): undisturbed (UN); partially burned (PB) and completely burned (CB). For about two growing seasons and at tri-monthly intervals, soil seed bank was measured by both direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, seeds were visually classified in apparently viable seeds (AVS) and apparently non-viable seeds (ANVS). The indirect method implied germination of seeds in a germination chamber after being stored to mimic natural conditions and break dormancy. For both study sites and all dates, the UN treatment showed significantly higher (P-*** < 0.001) seed numbers than the other two (PB and CB). Before the autumn seed rain, all seeds were classified as ANVS and did not germinate. After that seed rain, a high proportion of seeds appeared to be AVS in both sites, showing a similar trend for all treatments, although in dissimilar numbers (UN > PB > CB). The number of AVS steadily diminished during winter and spring, to practically disappear at the beginning of the summer, coinciding with the results obtained with the germination method. This behaviour confirms that cypress has a transient type of soil seed bank, and that the size of this soil seed bank is greatly influenced by the degree of fire disturbance. The amount of AVS that reached the soil at any particular site, however, might also be conditioned by several insects that parasite seeds before the seed rain. The transient soil seed bank and the low seed density found in PB and CB areas appears as important constraints for cypress regeneration. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Czarnecka, J				Czarnecka, J			Microspatial structure of the seed bank of xerothermic grassland - Intracommunity differentiation	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The study analyses the quantity and spatial structure of the seed bank of the xerothermic grassland located in the Biala Gora near Tomaszow Lubelski (Central Roztocze Region). The seed stock of the bank was compared with the vegetation found in two different patches of the examined grassland. The number of seeds per square meter was estimated at 5328 and 5355, depending on the patch. The seed bank's spatial organisation is clustered. The most important factors determining this spatial distribution are: remaining of the seeds in close vicinity of parent plants, and the "group" dispersal of the seeds and fruits.																	0001-6977	2083-9480					2004	73	2					155	164									WOS:000222254500009						
J	Arroyo, MTK; Cavieres, LA; Humana, AM				Arroyo, MTK; Cavieres, LA; Humana, AM			Experimental evidence of potential for persistent seed bank formation at a subantarctic alpine site in Tierra del Fuego, Chile	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												Seed burial experiments were conducted for 15 alpine species derived from 15 genera and 12 plant families from a subantarctic location on Cerro Rinon, Tierra del Fuego, 54degreesS, Chile. Batches of seed buried at 5 cm depth at 550 m elevation in February 1996 were exhumed after 335, 363, and 755 days, and their status and viability determined. Thirteen species (87%), one marginally (Acaena magellanica, Anemone multifida, Azorella lycopodioides, Bolax gummifera, Calceolaria biflora, Caltha appendiculata, Draba magellanica, Empetrum rubrum, Gentianella magellanica, Gunnera magellanica, Luzula alopecurus, Oremomyrrhis hookeri (marginal), Pernettya pumila), were judged as having potential to form a persistent soil seed bank, while two (Senecio magellanicus, Berberis buxifolia) only showed evidence of a transient seed bank. Seed viability in residual intact seeds was high and showed little tendency to diminish over the two-year experimental period, indicating optimal conditions for seed survival in the alpine soil. Fits of the number of remaining viable seeds at each exhumation date to the negative exponential model gave maximum seed longevity estimates of 1623 days in Draba magellanica, 2779 days in Empetrum rubrum, 3026 days in Gunnera magellanica, 777 days in Oreomyrrhis hookeri, and 5983 days in Pernettya pumila. Estimated seed longevities for some species at the subantarctic alpine site are among the highest reported for alpine species to date.

J	Tierney, DA				Tierney, DA			Towards an understanding of population change for the long-lived resprouting tree Angophora inopina (Myrtaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In fire-prone habitats some long-lived tree species appear resilient to fire. However, fire frequency may affect recruitment patterns. This study investigates the reproductive features of the long-lived tree species Angophora inopina Hill in recognised priority conservation areas with a high fire frequency. Plants exhibit high survival rates when burnt and respond to fire events with high rates of growth, flowering and seed set. Aged capsules on plants contain few seeds but released seeds germinate readily, suggesting high viability, low dormancy and limited seed storage in aerial or soil seed banks. Population modelling indicates that the species will be resilient to low recruitment levels in the short term. However, over the long term, population structure is significant in determining the ability of the population to respond to recruitment cues. Thus, understanding and monitoring population structural change is a priority for this species.

J	Bell, DM; Clarke, PJ				Bell, DM; Clarke, PJ			Seed-bank dynamics of Eleocharis: can spatial and temporal variability explain habitat segregation?	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Four Eleocharis species exhibit habitat partitioning in both extant vegetation and in the soil seed bank of upland temporary wetlands on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. Explanations for this partitioning were sought in seed-bank dynamics at three shore levels in two wetlands. Habitat partitioning ( zonation) was explained in part by seedling recruitment but not by either persistence of seeds in the soil or by dormancy patterns. All four species recruited at wetland edges but only the deepwater species, Eleocharis sphacelata, recruited in deeper water. Viability of buried seeds was consistently high and species had very low decay rates and half-lives greater than 50 years. Two types of dormancy patterns with burial were shown. Most seeds of Eleocharis sphacelata and E. pusilla were non-dormant after a 3-month burial, whereas for E. acuta and E. dietrichiana seed germination percentages gradually increased over a number of years. These two dormancy patterns may contribute to coexistence, since coexistence is enhanced by a long-lived resistant phase in the life history of species and by temporal variability in germination. There were also spatial inconsistencies in patterns of dormant fractions. Burial in the deeper zones of the marsh-like Billybung Lagoon had an inhibitory effect both on germinability and on germination rates of E. acuta and E. dietrichiana seeds. All but E. acuta showed some degree of seasonal dormancy, but this pattern was also not consistent in space. Explanations for zonation should concentrate on other life-history phases, such as dispersal and seedling survival.

J	Ekeleme, F; Chikoye, D; Akobundu, IO				Ekeleme, F; Chikoye, D; Akobundu, IO			Changes in size and composition of weed communities during planted and natural fallows	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The use of trees and herbaceous cover crops for weed management in smallholder farms is a promising alternative to the unsustainable traditional shifting cultivation system. The reported experiment was conducted from 1993 to 1996 in fallow plots established in 1989 to rehabilitate a degraded Alfisol after 10 years of continuous cultivation of maize/cassava. Treatments consisted of four plots each of woody legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. leptocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, and Senna siamea), and a herbaceous legume cover crop (Pueraria phaseoloides). Two controls (natural bush fallow and continuous maize/cassava) were included. Each treatment was cleared and cultivated in 1993 and 1995 (after 4 and 6 year fallow). Cultivation was repeated in 1994 for plots cleared in 1993 and in 1996 for subplots cleared in 1995. In all the years, weed density and dry weight was lower in planted fallows than in the controls. Per capita weed population growth rate decreased in all the fallow treatments most notably in A. auriculiformis and S. siamea fallow. All fallow species except A. auriculiformis would require more than 6 years of fallow to prevent growth of the weed population over the long term. The weed seed bank was 75% lower in A. auriculiformis and P. phaseoloides fallow than the control plots. Canonical correspondence and redundancy analysis indicated differences in species composition between treatments in the aboveground weed flora and in the weed seed bank. Cynodon dactylon and Digitaria horizontalis dominated continuously cultivated maize/cassava plots. Chromolaena odorata occurred more in natural bush fallow. In contrast, annual broadleaf weeds dominated the planted fallow treatments.																	1439-1791	1618-0089					2004	5	1					25	33		10.1078/1439-1791-00186							WOS:000220195400004						
J	Volis, S; Mendlinger, S; Ward, D				Volis, S; Mendlinger, S; Ward, D			Demography and role of the seed bank in Mediterranean and desert populations of wild barley	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												We compared the demography of two populations of wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, that occupy environments of different aridity (desert and Mediterranean) and represent distinct parts of the species' distribution (periphery and core) in Israel. Our demographic study included a survey of survival and fecundity of adults in quadrate plots marked at two sites in natural vegetation (one site per population), and the creation of experimental seed banks examined over three years. We measured variability in population growth rate and investigated the role of the seed bank in the demography of two populations. The latter employed construction of two-stage, three age-class transition matrices and usage of elasticity analysis. At both sites, population dynamics appear to be transient with high fluctuations of population growth rate due to variability in annual rainfall and, most likely, intra- and inter-specific density dependence. The importance of the seed bank differed among two populations. Seed dormancy had almost no demographic effect on the Mediterranean population, while it was of paramount importance in the desert population. The two populations also differed in seed and seedling survival and per adult fecundity, presumably due to the difference between two sites in (i) relative impact of seed predation, (ii) effects of density dependence on population demography, and (iii) lower vigor of seeds of desert vs. Mediterranean origin. Our study highlights the importance of life history adaptations that may evolve under specific selective forces in different parts of a species' range, which, in certain circumstances, may be critical for the persistence of a species.

J	Tracy, BF; Renne, IJ; Gerrish, J; Sanderson, MA				Tracy, BF; Renne, IJ; Gerrish, J; Sanderson, MA			Effects of plant diversity on invasion of weed species in experimental pasture communities	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Studies have shown that weed invasion into grasslands may be suppressed if the resident plant community is sufficiently diverse. The objective of this study was to determine whether increased forage plant diversity in grazed pasture communities might be associated with reduced weed abundance both in the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank. Data were collected from a pasture experiment established in 1994 in Missouri, USA. The experiment consisted of 15 m x 15 m plots sown with Festuca arundinacea Schreb. or Bromus inermis Leysser as a base species in mixtures of 1, 2, 3, 6, or 8 forage species. The plots were grazed by cattle during each growing season from 1998 to 2002. Aboveground plant species composition in each plot was measured using a point step method. Soil cores were collected in 1999 and 2002, and the species composition of germinable weed seeds in plots were evaluated by identifying seedlings as they germinated over an 8-week period. Species diversity was measured using several indices: species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), and forage species evenness (J). Aboveground weed abundance in plots was unrelated to forage species richness (S), but weed abundance declined as the evenness (J) of resident forage species increased in mixtures. The species composition of mixtures may have affected weed abundance. Weeds both in the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation were less abundant in mixtures that contained F. arundinacea compared with mixtures that contained B. inermis. Although variables like forage plant productivity may also suppress weed abundance in pastures, our resuits suggest that maintaining an evenly distributed mixture of forage species may help suppress weeds as well.

J	Devlaeminck, R; Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M				Devlaeminck, R; Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M			The effect of sampling period on results of seedling germination experiments in cropland and forests	BELGIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Because the germination of seeds shows a strong seasonal periodicity it can be expected that timing of seed bank sampling has a significant effect on the number and composition of emerging seedlings. To determine the influence of time of sampling on seedling emergence, we compared the composition and characteristics of seed bank samples collected during March and September. We sampled two extreme habitats in terms of dynamics (ancient deciduous forest and intensive arable field). Spring samples produced markedly more seedlings indicating the importance of a chilling period for germination of the majority of species. This was especially noticed for trample and pioneer species while less stringent for forest and shrub species. Presumably, seed size explains why these species germinate in spring, as seedlings of small-seeded species cannot rely on reserve compounds when germinating under suboptimal conditions. In the studied ecosystems, spring sampling proved to be most appropriate for the majority of species. Repeated sampling, however, increases the probability of finding species with different germination requirements.

Although several studies have investigated the conversion of coniferous stands outside of their biogeographical area and on unsuitable sites, none focused specifically on alluvial areas. We surveyed 208 riverine stands, distributed homogeneously throughout the Grand-duche de Luxembourg (western-central Europe) for the abundance of woody forest species (trees, saplings, seedlings and shrubs). The influence of both the canopy nature (Norway spruce or deciduous) and the biogeographical region (Oesling or Gutland) on the understorey regeneration were tested. The mean species richness was 10.5 woody plants per stand. Correspondence analyses showed that canopy tree regeneration was not different between the two forest types. Following an analysis of variance, we found that functional species group distribution (regarding mode of dispersal, type of seed bank and establishment strategy) was more determined by the biogeographical variable than by the canopy variable. Most woody species were significantly more abundant in deciduous forests and in the Gutland area. Only Rubus idaeus, Sambucus racemosa and Sorbus aucuparia were strongly associated with Norway spruce stands or the Oesling region. The differences between deciduous forests and coniferous stands are mainly due to shrub abundance and not to the canopy tree regeneration. In conclusion, Norway spruce plantations act as nurseries for late-successional riverine species like Fraxinus excelsior, Acer pseudoplatanus and Quercus robur.

J	Kellogg, CH; Bridgham, SD				Kellogg, CH; Bridgham, SD			Disturbance, herbivory, and propagule dispersal control dominance of an invasive grass	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Despite the dramatic changes invasive plants cause to ecosystems and communities, factors that control dominance of invasive species after establishment in a community are poorly understood. Most active management relies on catastrophic disturbances of invasive-dominated communities to increase richness and diversity of plant communities. This study examines the importance of propagule dispersal and deer herbivory on continued dominance of Phalaris arundinacea after a non-catastrophic, short-term disturbance to monotypic stands of this invasive grass. The disturbance caused no change in R arundinacea cover among treatments during any year of the study and, thus, simulates disturbance intensity more likely to be encountered in unmanaged settings. Despite the small disturbance, the combinations of disturbance + seeding and disturbance + seeding + deer exclusion caused greater species richness than controls even three years after disturbance. Increased invasion of P. arundinacea stands caused few effects on the dominant, as R arundinacea biomass was unaffected after the first year. Selective herbivory by deer of species other than R arundinacea increased the effects of disturbance and seeding, and aided in continued dominance of the grass. The tolerance of R arundinacea for direct anthropogenic effects, including poor water quality and hydroperiod fluctuations, and indirect effects, such as increased herbivory by historically high deer populations, indicates the complexity of determining persistence of invasive species.

Samples were collected from edge to edge along transects perpendicular to the river during the wet (December, 1990) and dry (August, 1991) seasons. The number of seeds found in the seed bank samples was greater in the dry season than in the wet season indicating that there was important variation in the seed stocks in these two periods. The similarity values between the seed bank and the community composition were low.

J	Kemp, JF; Lacroix, CR				Kemp, JF; Lacroix, CR			Estimation of seed bank and seed viability of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence Aster, Symphyotrichum laurentianum, (Fernald) Nesom	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The Gulf of St. Lawrence Aster, Symphyotrichum laurentianum, is a member of the family Asteraceae and is listed as "threatened" by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada). This rare and vulnerable halophyte grows in only a few locations in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands, Quebec. As an annual, S. laurentianum relies exclusively on its seeds to survive to the next generation. The goal of this study was to estimate the quantity of viable S. laurentianum seeds in the persistent and transient seed banks at selected sites in Prince Edward Island. Overall, the number of seeds in the transient and persistent seed banks is low. The greatest concentration of seeds was found near the surface of the soil. In addition, only a small proportion of those seeds tested positive for viability based on Tetrazolium staining. Of the seeds in the persistent and transient seed banks combined, 53% were viable whereas only 2% of the seeds in the persistent seed bank were viable. Population surveys were also completed at the five known sites (both extinct and extant) in Prince Edward Island National Park. All sites showed signs of decline based on population estimates dating back to 1993. The Covehead Pond site showed the greatest decline: from 250-300 individuals in 1993 to only 10 individuals in 2002. The population at Dune Slack also showed a dramatic decrease from approximately 65 000 in 1999, to 2 200 individuals in 2002. Monitoring of this plant and the development of a management plan for the species are critical to its survival.																	0008-3550					JAN-MAR	2004	118	1					105	110		10.22621/cfn.v118i1.890							WOS:000226325800012

The Seed Bank itself is essentially composed of a geographic resource office equipped with all technical local maps, GPS and GIS facilities; a desiccation chamber equipped with sorption driers in conjunction with a cooling system, an air-lock and a monitoring system, a seed cleaning and testing lab, incubators and two deep freezers that serve as a cold store.																	0779-2387		90-72619-60-9				2004	29						101	114									WOS:000225160800014

Seeds are the most useful living material for a long-term conservation due to their small size and their viability. The seed bank of the Conservatoire concentrates upon threatened species worldwide, and so is one of the most important places for the conservation of endangered plants. Examples of results are given, such as the successful reintroduction of Normannia triphylla in Madeira.																	0779-2387		90-72619-60-9				2004	29						119	120									WOS:000225160800016

In 2002, the Botanical Garden of Ljubljana took a dry meadow on lease. The meadow, covering a surface of 2 ha, lies in the close vicinity of Ljubljana. It has not, for the last 40 years, been subjected to any intensive treatment. The very first sample inventorying of plant species in the course of 2001 revealed the presence of a large number of species; of these quite a number appear in the Slovenian Red Data List of Pteridophytes and Spermatophytes. In the course of the regular monitoring in 2002 the number of determined species increased to 120. The meadow is quite rich in wild orchids, which makes it all the more valuable. It is in the initial stage of overgrowing. A late one-time mowing once a year is expected to contribute to its conservation. The goal of taking the garden on lease and exposing it to proper management is to contribute to an active conservation of this type of habitats and their biodiversity.																	0779-2387		90-72619-60-9				2004	29						131	134									WOS:000225160800018

The differences between the distribution of endangered plants in the underground vegetation (soil seed bank) and actual vegetation cover are shown and discussed in the light of information from "Red data books". Ephemeral species like Coleanthus subtilis and Elatine hexandra have not been reported for decades in the vegetation cover. Herbarium material encouraged the idea to compare old herbarium material of today highly endangered or extinct species with seeds from soil samples collected in similar localities.																	0779-2387		90-72619-60-9				2004	29						135	139									WOS:000225160800019

A second sub-population has been cultivated in Berlin for nearly two decades. Therefore, a research and conservation programme has been initiated to measure genetic variation and fitness parameters of plants from both subpopulations in order to (1) confirm the authentic origin of the material from Berlin, (2) to evaluate the taxonomic status of C. macrorrhiza, and (3) to detect genetic markers distinguishing the gene pools of both subpopulations for future breeding programs. In parallel, phenotypic characters and fitness parameters have been measured to test for significant differences between subpopulations. The aim is to establish a large population sampling for ex situ cultivation, to build up an ex situ seed bank, and to start a re-introduction experiment.																	0779-2387		90-72619-60-9				2004	29						157	164									WOS:000225160800023						
J	Holzel, N; Otte, A				Holzel, N; Otte, A			Ecological significance of seed germination characteristics in flood-meadow species	FLORA												In climate chamber and outdoor experiments we analysed germination traits of 42 vascular plant species typical of flood-meadows of the alliance Cnidion. In Central Europe such flood-meadows and their highly endangered character species are confined to large lowland river corridors with a dry and warm climate. Due to the prevailing ecological conditions, particularly the extremely high variability in soil moisture potential, it was hypothesised that flood-meadow species exhibit specific strategies in terms of germination phenology, temperature requirements and primary dormancy to avoid constraints on seedling recruitment imposed by flooding, drought and competition from established vegetation. Furthermore, we expected that germination characteristics could be a key for the causal understanding of range size, confinement to large river corridors, recent rarification processes, seed bank persistence and establishment success in restoration projects. PCA ordination of germination traits reflected a continuous gradient of increasing primary dormancy levels ranging from species with a high capacity for fast and almost complete germination over a wide range of temperatures to those with high and narrow temperature requirements and/or a delayed and asynchronous emergence. Many of the studied species germinated only at relatively high temperature in the year of shedding, but the primary conditional dormancy disappeared in most cases after a period of cold wet stratification. Requirements for chilling and/or high germination temperature were revealed to be the most common strategies for avoidance of harmful autumn and winter germination. The majority of the studied species tends to exploit particularly favourable regeneration niches in early spring. Surprisingly, many species with large long-term persistent soil seed banks exhibited relatively low dormancy levels in light; this was correlated with small seed size and a consequent higher probability of burial. We found no relationship between germination characteristics and river corridor confinement or Central European range size. However, there was a significant trend in endangered species towards higher temperature requirements and delayed, asynchronous germination. This is presumably disadvantageous under the environmental conditions of subcontinental flood-meadows.

J	Amiaud, B; Touzard, B				Amiaud, B; Touzard, B			The relationships between soil seed bank, aboveground vegetation and disturbances in old embanked marshlands of Western France	FLORA												The study deals with the influence of land use and abandonment on species composition of vegetation and seed bank in grasslands and oldfields. We wanted to explore: (1) How the seed bank changes when agricultural practices cease? In convergence with proposals in the literature, we addressed in particular the following two questions that have been proposed by Symonides (1986), Pickett & McDonnell (1989) and Roberts & Vankat (1991) for seed bank characteristics under secondary succession: (i) Does species richness and species diversity in the soil seed bank decrease during succession? (ii) Does the density of buried seed decline during succession? (2) What is the role played by seed bank in the recolonisation of plots disturbed by experimental disturbances ? We studied species composition of vegetation and seed bank in an experiment with grassland and oldfield plots in old embanked marshlands (called "Marais Poitevin"). In these wetlands, artificial disturbances (mowing) and natural disturbances (cattle, roebucks, coypus, voles) are very frequent. In order to mimic disturbances, experimental disturbances were generated in spring after the end of the winter flooding and emerged seedlings counted three months later. Data about the seed bank, the undisturbed vegetation and seedlings emerging in disturbed quadrats were sampled. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) of the undisturbed quadrats, disturbed quadrats and seed bank samples showed significant differences of species composition. Similarity between seed bank and undisturbed aboveground vegetation was low and not very different between grassland and oldfield. Very few seedlings emerged in the undisturbed vegetation both in grassland and oldfield, which potentially indicates the importance of gaps for seed bank expression. In Marais Poitevin, the seed bank contributed very little to the seedling flora, and vegetative regrowth clearly predominated recolonisation after disturbances. In the seed bank, few species lost after succession from grassland to oldfield vegetation were still present as seeds in the soil, but in most cases species lost were not recorded in the seed bank. The results have shown that species richness and species diversity in the seed bank decrease during succession. On the other hand, the density of buried seeds did not decrease significantly from grassland to oldfield.

J	de Groot, WJ; Wein, R				de Groot, WJ; Wein, R			Effects of fire severity and season of burn on Betula glandulosa growth dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Betula glandulosa survives over a wide range of North American fire regimes by resprouting from the rhizome. Over-winter root carbohydrate reserves are important to sprout production and growth in the following spring. Nursery and field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of seasonal clipping and fire severity (lethal heat applied to different soil depths) on B. glandulosa sprouting and growth, and seasonal burning and clipping on over-winter root carbohydrate storage. Low fire severity increased sprout numbers, and low fire severity in spring caused a large increase in height growth and above-ground biomass production over a 2-year period. Mortality rates increased sharply with higher levels of fire severity. Over-winter total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations in roots were significantly higher in plants burned immediately after leaf-flush than in mid-summer burned plants. None of the other seasonal burning or clipping treatments significantly influenced over-winter root TNC. Post-disturbance sprout growth reflected over-winter root TNC levels. B. glandulosa survives a wide range of fire frequencies by growing in plant communities that are most likely to burn in spring or autumn, and seldom burn in summer. This provides the greatest opportunity for maximum over-winter TNC storage. As well, high soil moisture after snowmelt ensures spring fires are almost always of low severity, which promotes increased sprout production, height growth and above-ground biomass.																	1049-8001						2004	13	3					287	295		10.1071/WF03048							WOS:000225166000004						
J	Sternberg, M; Yu, SL; Bar, P				Sternberg, M; Yu, SL; Bar, P			Soil seed banks, habitat heterogeneity, and regeneration strategies in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												This study investigated the effects of microhabitat characteristics on soil seed bank structure, regeneration strategies, and plant composition in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune in Israel. Three different microhabitats were selected: (a) open patches between shrubs, (b) shrub understorey, and (c) open, disturbed patches in pedestrian trails. In each microhabitat two types of sampling plots were established: (a) seedling removal and (b) control (seedlings not removed). Emerging seedlings in each microhabitat were identified, counted, and removed every two weeks. In the controls, the vegetation was sampled only once at the peak of the herbaceous growing season. At the end of the growing season in plots where seedlings were removed, the upper soil was collected and sieved before seeds set. Viable non-germinated seeds were identified and counted. An estimation of persistent seed banks was obtained for each plot. Species composition, species richness, species diversity, and aboveground biomass by species were estimated. Germination fractions among species and plant functional groups were measured. Microhabitats differed in soil seed bank density, germination characteristics, above-ground biomass production, and species composition. The open patches between shrubs generally had the highest densities of seeds, seedlings, and mature individual herbaceous plants. Important density differences between total seedlings removed and mature vegetation may indicate strong plant mortality in all microhabitats. Annual and perennial grasses, composites, annual crucifers, and annual forbs produced transient seed banks, while legumes, umbelifers, and perennial forbs had persistent seed banks. Disturbance by public trampling in trails led to low seed and plant densities in this microhabitat. No effects of facilitation of shrubs on the annual vegetation were noted in shub understorey. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong impact on vegetation structure and regeneration strategies.																	0792-9978	2223-8980					2004	52	3					213	221		10.1560/HWL0-7CBQ-1DD0-YU0U							WOS:000225785400005

Microcosms were set up using dry sediments from three freshwater temporary ponds (Cavallo Bianco, Aria Rossa and Vallone della Forbice) of the island of Lampedusa (Sicily) and kept at different temperatures and photoperiods. Hatching time was modulated by different environmental factors. initial anoxia, induced by the decomposition of the sediment's organic matter, delayed hatching in the microcosm set up with sediments from Vallone della Forbice which has a high organic matter content. Temperature and photoperiod in isolation did not seem to affect hatching significantly, while their interaction did. The coexistence of two female morphotypes with different reproductive modes could not be explained by a differential response to temperature and photoperiod. Coexistence was probably due to disturbance events, such as drying up of ephemeral pools. Some resting eggs (in different percentages in different microcosms) hatched only after a second hydration (after microcosms dried up). Hatching phenology is discussed in relation to genetic differences in egg responsiveness to hatching stimuli and to a bet-hedging strategy in a year-to-year highly variable environment such as the ephemeral ponds of Lampedusa.

J	Carpinelli, MF; Sheley, RL; Maxwell, BD				Carpinelli, MF; Sheley, RL; Maxwell, BD			Revegetating weed-infested rangeland with niche-differentiated desirable species	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												The goal of this study was to determine the potential to revegetate weed-infested rangeland by maximizing niche occupation and resource capture by desirable species. We hypothesized that as desirable species richness increases, weed establishment and growth decrease, provided that the desirable species differ in niche. Three desirable species with differing spatial and temporal growth patterns, [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn., var. Hycrest (crested wheatgrass), Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski, var. Rush (intermediate wheatgrass), and Medicago sativa L., var. Arrow (alfalfa)], and 1 weed [Centaurea maculosa Lam. (spotted knapweed)], were grown in a multiple replacement series. All species were sown simultaneously in spring 1996, simulating revegetation of a site containing spotted knapweed seeds in the seed bank because of prior infestation. Desirable species richness varied among plots, while the total number of desirable seeds sown per plot was held constant. Although the desirable species were shown to differ in niche, desirable species richness or mixture did not affect soil water depletion or spotted knapweed recruitment in 1996 or 1997. These results suggest that revegetation of weed-infested rangeland must also include active control of weeds emerging from the soil seed bank. Only then can other strategies, such as maximizing niche occupation by desirable species, be expected to provide long-term success.																	0022-409X					JAN	2004	57	1					97	105		10.2307/4003960							WOS:000188322300012						
J	Darwin, AT; Ladd, D; Galdins, R; Contreras, TA; Fahrig, L				Darwin, AT; Ladd, D; Galdins, R; Contreras, TA; Fahrig, L			Response of forest understory vegetation to a major ice storm	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												In January of 1998, Ottawa, Ontario was hit with a major ice storm. Detailed pre-storm vegetation data had been collected in 1997 in 164 forest interior sampling plots across a 3 000 km(2) region. These data included information on shrubs/saplings, woody seeds and seedlings, herbaceous seeds and ground cover, and canopy cover. For the four growing seasons following the ice storm (1998-2001), we resampled the same 164 plots. In addition, in 1998 we estimated an ice storm damage index for each plot, and the volume of downed coarse woody debris due to the ice storm in each plot. The objectives of this paper were to examine changes in shrubs/saplings and ground vegetation in response to ice storm damage over the four-year period following the storm. Contrary to our initial expectations, we found that woody seedlings showed a large decrease in density immediately following the storm (1998). Woody seedling density recovered to pre-storm levels by 2001. We hypothesize that the decrease in woody seedling density resulted from reduced seedling germination due to lower light availability on the forest floor, which resulted from the large amount of woody debris created by the storm. We also found that shrub/sapling counts showed a large increase in 1999, most likely due to increased light to the understory, due to opening of the upper canopy. Herbaceous cover increased from 1998 to 2000, but returned to pre-storm levels the following year (2001). The between-plot variation in these understory changes was positively correlated to plot damage from the ice storm, indicating that they resulted from the storm. Overall, it appears that the forest understory plant Structure is rapidly returning to pre-ice storm conditions.

J	Miller, AL; Duncan, RP				Miller, AL; Duncan, RP			The impact of exotic weed competition on a rare New Zealand outcrop herb, Pachycladon cheesemanii (Brassicaceae)	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Nearly one quarter of New Zealand's unique vascular plant flora is threatened, and weed invasion is implicated in the decline of more than half of these threatened species. However, there is little experimental evidence showing that invasive weeds have a direct impact on threatened native plants. This study experimentally tested the hypothesis that competition with invasive weeds threatens the rare outcrop plant Pachycladon cheesemanii (Brassicaceae). Pachycladon cheesemanii is a threatened South Island, New Zealand endemic with a distribution nearly confined to rock outcrops. It has disappeared from historical record sites throughout its range. The effects of weed competition and habitat on P. cheesemanii establishment, growth and survival were investigated by sowing seed into replicated plots subject to three treatments: weed removal, soil disturbed and unweeded control, in three habitat types: forested and open rock outcrops and open tussock grassland. The experiments were carried out at three locations: Mt Somers (Canterbury), Wye Creek and Diamond Lake (Otago). Within weedy rock outcrop habitat, weed removal significantly increased the rate of P. cheesemanii germination, and appeared to increase seedling growth rates, implying that weeds can negatively impact populations. Relative to rock outcrop habitat, P. cheesemanii germination was very low in adjacent open grassland habitat regardless of weeding treatment. Demographic monitoring Of four natural populations of P. cheesemanii revealed that seed production is highly variable among populations and may be limited by browse and mechanical damage to inflorescences. Pachycladon cheesemanii does produce a persistent seed bank but most seed is found close to parent populations. Our results suggest that competition with invading weeds threatens current P. cheesemanii populations, that plant establishment can be enhanced by weed removal, and that considerable potential exists for artificially expanding populations by sowing seed into appropriate weed-free habitat.

The distribution of Glaucium flavum in the Oslo Fjord region is much more restricted now than before. Out of the formerly recorded 35 populations, only eight populations were present in 1998, all in the outer parts of the fjord. The species is a short-lived iteroparous perennial in Norway. This growth habit gives high reproductive output from fertile individuals. G. flavum is self-compatible and can easily reproduce even in small populations. The ability to disperse long distances on water is limited. The observed seed bank will therefore enhance survival. No variation in isoenzymes was observed neither within nor among the G. flavum populations in the Oslo Fjord region. The species should be considered Endangered in Norway, according to the criteria given by IUCN.																	0107-055X	1756-1051					2004	24	4					433	444									WOS:000244298200014						
J	Forbis, TA; Larmore, J; Addis, E				Forbis, TA; Larmore, J; Addis, E			Temporal patterns in seedling establishment on pocket gopher disturbances	OECOLOGIA												Disturbances often facilitate seedling establishment, and can change the species composition of a community by increasing recruitment of disturbance-adapted species. To understand the effects of pocket gopher disturbances on alpine seedling dynamics, we examined the gopher disturbances' effects on seedling emergence and survival on gopher disturbances 0 to 5 years old. In contrast to results from most other ecosystems, these recently created gopher mounds had lower seedling emergence and survival rates than undisturbed areas. A lack of correlation between species' abundances on gopher mounds and undisturbed sites in one of the two communities studied suggested that a suite of disturbance-adapted species recruited onto the mounds. To explain low seedling emergence on recent gopher mounds, we quantified gopher mound seed banks and studied recruitment in a site with mounds that ranged from 0 to >20 years old. Seed numbers in first-year gopher mound soils were extremely low relative to undisturbed soils, and this pattern was mirrored in seedling establishment patterns over the long term. Gopher disturbance depressed seedling emergence density for the first 5 years. Subsequently, emergence density increased until at least 20 years following the disturbance. Emergence on disturbances more than 20 years old was higher than on undisturbed sites. Therefore, gopher disturbances probably facilitate seedling establishment in alpine dry and moist meadow; however, this process takes place over decades.				de Queiroz, Tara/AAG-1467-2019													0029-8549					JAN	2004	138	1					112	121		10.1007/s00442-003-1404-3							WOS:000186978400014	14557865

The diet of both species is comprised mainly of various fruit species (65.9% and 66.6%) with animal prey making up a minor proportion (24.1% and 21.2%). Both species are considered dietary generalists and opportunists. In Los Tuxtlas, their diets are remarkably similar. The two species occur with equal frequency in the two types of studied vegetation and disperse seeds of several species of plant pioneers. These seeds are of great importance in the formation of seed banks that permit the development of secondary vegetation and, in the long run, the regeneration of the rainforest.

J	Schafer, M; Kotanen, PM				Schafer, M; Kotanen, PM			Impacts of naturally-occurring soil fungi on seeds of meadow plants	PLANT ECOLOGY												Although soil fungi may represent an ecologically important cause of mortality of buried seeds, few studies have provided direct evidence of the pathogenicity of fungi colonizing seeds in natural habitats. In response, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the impacts of soil fungi from a range of habitats on seeds of meadow plants. We compared the survival of seeds of four grasses in five habitats, and isolated fungi from these seeds. We then tested the pathogenicity of selected isolates against two standard sets of plant species: the original four grasses and a broad range of old field species. We found that the soil community contained a large variety of seed-colonizing fungi. Some, but not all, examples of these fungi caused seed mortality; others may be harmless commensals. Some of these isolates negatively affected a broad range of plant species, but others had a more restricted host range; as a result, pathogenicity varied depending upon the particular plant-fungus combination. Few between-habitat differences in seed survival were detected. Our results demonstrate that fungal seed pathogens are common, ubiquitous, and potentially lethal, but that their effects depend on the particular combination of fungus and plant species considered.

J	Mahaney, WM; Wardrop, DH; Brooks, RP				Mahaney, WM; Wardrop, DH; Brooks, RP			Impacts of sedimentation and nitrogen enrichment on wetland plant community development	PLANT ECOLOGY												Many factors influence which plant species are found in a particular wetland. The species pool is composed of the species present in the seed bank and species able to disperse into the wetland, and many abiotic and biotic factors interact to influence a species performance and abundance in the plant community. Anthropogenic activities produce specific stressors on wetland systems that alter these abiotic and biotic interactions, potentially altering species composition. We simulated three common wetland hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclasses in a greenhouse to examine the effects of two stressors-sedimentation and nitrogen (N) enrichment-on the performance of 8 species grown in artificial communities. Species establishment, height, biomass, and foliar N and P concentrations were measured to explore species responses to stressors and competition, as well as the potential impacts of changes in species composition on ecosystem processes. Species were affected differently by sedimentation and N enrichment, and there were differences in overall community sensitivity to stressors between wetland subclasses. Sedimentation generally reduced seedling establishment, while N enrichment produced variable effects on height and biomass. Interspecific competition had little effect on establishment but significantly reduced most species biomass. Sedimentation generally lowered community biomass, diversity, and richness, while enrichment increased community biomass. Establishment, biomass, and foliar nutrient concentrations significantly differed between many species, suggesting that shifts in species composition may impact ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Phalaris arundinacea, an aggressive clonal graminoid, universally dominated all wetland subclasses. This dominance across a range of environmental conditions (sedimentation, fertility, and hydrology) has important implications for both restoration and predicting the impacts of human activities on species composition. Our results suggest that, in regions where R arundinacea is common, restoration projects that establish communities from seeds and human activities that cause vegetation removal are likely to become dominated by P. arundinacea.																	1385-0237						2004	175	2					227	243									WOS:000226444100007						
J	Holzel, N; Otte, A				Holzel, N; Otte, A			Inter-annual variation in the soil seed bank of flood-meadows over two years with different flooding patterns	PLANT ECOLOGY												Persistent soil seed banks are presumed to play a significant role in bridging and exploiting the effects of major flood disturbances in riparian systems. However, presently there is little empirical data on the correlation between flooding and seed bank dynamics. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of inter-annual flooding variation on soil seed bank dynamics in flood-meadows. We analysed seed bank composition at 46 plots along the northern Upper Rhine River, Germany, after two periods with contrasting flooding conditions (1996-1997: low and rare flooding; 1998-1999 high and very frequent flooding). Between both sampling occasions the total number of seedlings emerging from the seed bank decreased by 50% and average species-richness per sample by 30%, irrespective of the sampling depth. Similar decline occurred in mesophytes and wetland species as well as over different functional groups, with the exception of legumes. Considerable compositional changes in the seed bank were also indicated by shifts in DCA ordination and by the comparison of similarity matrices from both years with the Mantel test. The Mantel test also confirmed that compositional changes were more pronounced in the seed bank than in aboveground vegetation. There was poor correlation between the decline in total seed densities and species in the soil seed bank and environmental variables such as flooding duration and ecological groupings such as floodplain compartment and seed bank community types. Further distinct patterns of decline and persistence were evident only at the species level. While 21 species displayed a significant decline, only two species increased. Annual arable weeds and perennial ruderals with high temperature or nutrient requirements to break dark dormancy were amongst the most significantly declining species. In contrast, there was no decline in typical winter annuals and certain perennials that preferably germinate in autumn and fall into dormancy at the beginning of the warm period. Generally, differences in germination requirements and dormancy cycles of species gave the best explanation for the patterns of decline and persistence after intense flooding. Given these findings, the heavy depletion of the persistent soil seed bank we observed is most likely attributed to a post-flood germination flush due to very favourable recruitment conditions prevailing during the draw-down period after early summer flooding in 1999. The results of our study suggest that persistent soil seed banks are of outstanding importance to bridge and exploit the highly variable hydrological conditions that are typical of flood-meadows. Thus, they play a significant role in maintaining the floristic diversity of this habitat type over time and space.

The primary ecological attributes studied were the canopy seed bank (onset of cone production, percentage and persistence of serotinous cones), seed and cone morphology, sprouting and bark thickness. Four ecological groups were separated Using multivariate cluster analysis and their life-history characteristics are discussed. Serotiny and early flowering in Pinus halepensis and P pinaster reflect their evader strategy in relation to fire as this character is advantageous to survive frequent crown fires and to attain successful post-fire recruitment. Late flowering and absence of serotinous cones in P nigra, P. sylvestris and P. uncinata indicate that their natural forest did not evolve under frequent crown fires. P canariensis and P pinea appeared in two single groups because of their sprouting capability and their seed size respectively. Intraspecific variation in P. pinaster was also analysed using the same criteria and high variability was found in its life history traits. A group of P. pinaster populations showed high levels of serotiny and thin bark as a possible adaptation to frequent stand-replacing crown fires. In contrast. a group of non- or weakly-serotinous populations seems to have evolved under a low-intensity fire regime where the best fitness corresponds to thick-barked individuals capable of surviving ground fires. Intermediate strategies were also evident in this species and were discussed in relation to the effect of different fire regimes caused by the understorey vegetation.

J	Ne'eman, G; Goubitz, S; Nathan, R				Ne'eman, G; Goubitz, S; Nathan, R			Reproductive traits of Pinus halepensis in the light of fire - a critical review	PLANT ECOLOGY					2nd International Conference on Mediterranean Pines	SEP 08-13, 2002	Chania, GREECE	Univ Athens, Hellen Minist Agr, Mediterranean Agron Inst Chania				Fire is known to be a major factor in shaping plants and vegetation worldwide. Many plant traits have been described as adaptations for surviving fire, or regenerating after it. However, many of the traits are also advantageous for overcoming other disturbances. The fact that fire in the Mediterranean Basin has been almost exclusively of anthropogenic origin. and thus is of short duration in an evolutionary time scale, cast doubt on the possibility that fire can act as a selective force in the Mediterranean Basin. Our aim here is to review the ecological advantages of Pinus halepensis traits and their possibility to be selected by fire. The non-self pruning of cones and branches, and the high resin content increase the probability of canopy fires and consequent death of P halepensis trees. Postfire regeneration of P. halepensis depends totally upon its canopy-stored seed bank. The seedlings grow quickly and they first reproduce at an early age. Young reproductive trees function first as females with a high percentage of serotinous cones. Thus, young P. halepensis trees allocate many resources to seed production, reducing their 'immaturity risk' in a case of an early successive fire. The proportion of serotinous cones is higher in post-fire naturally regenerating stands than in unburned stands, and seeds from serotinous cones germinate better under simulated post-fire conditions. The extremely high pH of the ash-bed under the burned canopies creates the post-fire regeneration niche of P. halepensis exactly under their parent trees. All these traits are advantageous for post-fire regeneration, but Could they also be selected during the time scale of anthropogenic fires in the Mediterranean Basin? Pinus halepensis is a relatively short living tree with almost no recruitment under forest canopy. The longest estimated fire-return interval and generation length are about 125 years. The earliest solid evidence for the first hominid-controlled fire in the Mediterranean basin is 780,000 years ago, and thus the estimated number of post-fire generations is 6240. We suggest that such a number of generations is sufficient for the selection and radiation of fire adaptive traits in P halepensis.

The pre-burning stands consisted of two storeys; the overstorey of the dominant tree species P. halepensis and the understorey of evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs. The wildfire took place in June 1994. Three months after the fire two experimental plots of 0.75 ha each were established on a northeastern and a southwestern facing slope. In each experimental plot different restoration treatments were applied by using P. halepensis reproductive material. The treatments were the following: (i) planting of paper-pot seedlings, (ii) planting of bare-root seedlings. (iii) seeding in patches, (iv) seeding in strips, (v) seeding in strips and lines. The results of these treatments were compared to the control (no treatment applied). The results showed that all applied restoration works accelerated the rate of regeneration, while the best results were obtained by the method of planting paper-pot seedlings.

J	Boydak, M				Boydak, M			Silvicultural characteristics and natural regeneration of Pinus brutia Ten. - a review	PLANT ECOLOGY					2nd International Conference on Mediterranean Pines	SEP 08-13, 2002	Chania, GREECE	Univ Athens, Hellen Minist Agr, Mediterranean Agron Inst Chania				Pinus brutia Ten. is a characteristic species of the eastern Mediterranean. P. brutia and P. halepensis Mill. are distinct species: but P eldarica, P stankewiczii and P pityusa are subspecies of P. brutia. Fire is the major disturbance in P brutia forests, and several adaptations generally contribute to post-fire regeneration of P. brutia: however, P. brutia can also naturally regenerate without fire. Flowering occurs between March and May. Seed distribution Occurs throughout the year, with maximum dispersal in August and the great majority of seeds dispersing within the period July-December. P. brutia retains some closed cones and so establishes a natural canopy seed bank. Seed germination occurs in the rainy season with two frequency peaks: the major one in spring and a minor one in autumn. P. brutia seedlings develop rapidly-growing tap roots. Shelterwood, clearcutting and strip clearcut methods can successfully be applied to P. brutia forests, depending on local conditions. Density of P. brutia seedlings was greater and seedlings were more vigorous when the natural regeneration methods were combined with prescribed fire. Clearcutting methods combined with laying cone bearing branches on the surface of the soil and additional seeding increases regeneration success. Ground litter of 2-4 cm creates a medium that reduces evapotranspiration, delays growth of competing vegetation, and increases seedling survival. Successful regeneration must be established by the end of first vegetation period.																	1385-0237						2004	171	1-2					153	163		10.1023/B:VEGE.0000029373.54545.d2							WOS:000221505500013

The theoretical basis supporting pine utilisation was its stress-tolerant and pioneer features, and their attributed role of facilitating the development of late-successional hardwoods in the long-term. In the present work, the use of pines and hardwoods in forest restoration is discussed in the frame of the current disturbance regime and social demands for Mediterranean forests. Large pine plantations have recently disappeared because of their sensitivity to fire (e.g., Pinus nigra) or because of the short fire-intervals (e.g., Pinus halepensis). Combined pine and oak plantations are proposed for degraded land restoration on the basis of the complementary features of both groups of species. Seeding and containerised seedling plantation, soil amendments and plantation techniques to reduce transplant shock are evaluated for reforestation under water-stressing conditions, on the basis of several experiments performed in eastern Spain. Both P. halepensis and Quercus ilex are tested.

The results of human activity and its impact on the pine forests is a problem that began in the past, when wood and pine ecosystems were not valued, and whose repercussions are still felt today; notably in changes in fire regime, in grazing/browsing intensity, in harvesting, in land use, in plantation activity, in expansion of forest/urban interface, and in secondary urban settlements. Conservation, in this sense, means the maintenance of and the restoration or improvement of the abiotic and biotic features, which form the habitat of a species, as well as controlling activities, which may indirectly result in the deterioration of such habitats. Conservation, therefore, ranges from the conservation of genetic resources in several forms (seed banks, seed forests, conservation in situ of relic populations), to the elimination of human induced disturbances, to the planning of new activities, to the application of proper silvicultural tending and the pursuance of international Conventions, Regulations and Resolutions. The aim of this paper is to emphasise the main legislative tools, which are represented by the array of Conventions, Directives, Regulations and Resolutions concerning the environment and the ecological networks (NATURA 2000, EMERALD, EUNIS).

J	Czarnecka, J				Czarnecka, J			Seed longevity and recruitment of seedlings in xerothermic grassland	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The aim of the study was to check which of the xerothermic grassland species create persistent seed bank and what type of germination characteristics they exhibit. The following features of diaspores and the seed bank were taken into consideration: 1) relation between the annual seed production and the seed bank; 2) keeping the germination ability longer than one year, despite the soil samples being kept in the conditions promoting germination; 3) presence in the deeper layers of soil; 4) permanent abundance in soil, also between seed germination and seed shedding time. Carex flacca Schreb., C. tratissilvanica Schur, Linum flavum L., Origanum vulgare L. and Scabiosa ochroleuca L. create persistent seed bank, Senecio macrophyllus M. Bleb., Aster amellus L. and Brachypodium pinnatum (L.) Beauv. have the transient type of the bank. Germination time for the grassland species is spring and additionally in a few cases, early autumn when the most favourable temperature and moisture conditions prevail in the studied plant community. Taking into consideration the changes in the percentage of germinating seeds during the year we can distinguish three types of annual dormancy cycle: Linum flavum pattern - germination occurs exclusively in spring; Salvia verticillata L. pattern - the germination peak in spring; yet, the seedlings are detected during the rest of the season; Senecio macrophyllus pattern - the species with two germination peak: one in spring. the other in autumn.																	1505-2249						2004	52	4					505	521									WOS:000225739200011

Comparison of records from four periods (before 1900, 1901-1945, 1946-1970, 1971-2001) revealed that the total number of localities has not decreased, but the occurrence changed considerably both in terms of the localities and regions where the species is found. Abundant populations were observed on exposed shores of water reservoirs. It has colonized the Trebon Basin, S Bohemia, over the last few decades. Effect of water regime, light/darkness regime and temperature on germination and dormancy was studied. A. gramineum is adapted to germinate in water and in the dark; germination occurs in late spring, i.e. a period of high temperature. The high variation in the germination response to particular environmental factors may be accounted for the irregular occurrence of A. gramineum at certain localities. Best conditions for seed production are shallow water and recently exposed shores of water reservoirs, where plants can grow and set seed within one growing season. The ability to survive in a vegetative stage is more important in deep water, but seed banks in the mud at the bottom of reservoirs is the only way the species can persist when adult plants die.

No fertilizers or herbicides were applied. Few weeds or annuals were present during this period. Only two plants, i.e. Agrostis capillaris and Festuca rubra, dominated during the 12 years. At two spatial scales (0.04 and 0.4 m(2)) a dramatic increase in species richness was recorded during the first two years. However, no further trend in species richness occurred after the sixth year of succession. Successional changes were directed and continuous. The rate of succession depended on the distance from the neighbouring meadow. Vegetation at the margins of the transect developed more slowly and diverged from the middle during the succession.																	0032-7786						2004	76	4					361	369									WOS:000224778400005

RANGELAND JOURNAL												In the Simpson Desert of western Queensland fire is being used increasingly by pastoralists to manipulate hard spinifex (Triodia basedowii) pastures. In this study I investigated the short-term (20 month) effects of cattle grazing on hummock grasslands regenerating after fire in the Simpson Desert. Dung counts were used to determine if cattle grazed preferentially in areas regenerating after fire. Cattle exclosures and vegetation surveys were used to determine if grazing by cattle affected the structure and species composition of vegetation regenerating after fire. Cattle grazed preferentially in areas regenerating after fire. Cattle grazing reduced the cover, height, vertical density and species richness of regrowth vegetation. Grazing reduced the cover of Ptilotus polystachyus and reduced the proportion of Eragrostis eriopodia individuals bearing flowers and seed. Grazing visibly disrupted microbiotic soil crusts. It is recommended, as a precaution until additional data is available, that areas regenerating after fire be rested from grazing during the first post-fire wet season. Resting during this period will assist the establishment of vegetation cover and provide opportunities for grasses to set seed.

In the first experiment, seedbanks were measured at four sites, and in the second, the variation in seedbanks during the year was measured at one site. In each experiment the size and composition of the seedbanks were determined by germinating the seeds in soil samples. In the first experiment, total seed numbers ranged from approximately 6000 to 12,000 per m(2). There were no significant differences between sites for total seeds or for seeds of any species group except legumes which comprised only a small portion of the seedbanks. There were significant differences between patch types for total seeds and for the following species groups, medium tussock grasses, short tussock grasses, stoloniferous grasses, legumes and forbs but not large tussock grasses and sedges. Total seed numbers, and those of medium tussock grasses, stoloniferous grasses and forbs were highest in the lawn patches and lowest in the short sward patches. Legumes had higher numbers in the tall grassland patches than in other patch types. In the second experiment, there were large differences between total seed numbers at the different sample dates (January, May, September and November). Numbers were highest in January and then declined throughout the year. This pattern was largely a reflection of the changes in numbers of forb seeds, the species group with the most seeds. There were no significant differences between patch types for total seeds but there were for medium tussock grasses, stoloniferous grasses, sedges and forbs. There was no relationship between the composition of the pasture sward and the composition of the seedbank for any of the three patch types. Twenty-eight species were allocated to persistent and transient seedbank types; all seedbank types occurred in all three patch types. The major species in the seedbanks were sedges (Cyperus gracilis, C sesquiflorus), forbs (Gamochaeta spp., Paronychia brasiliana, Daucus glochidiatus) and Eragrostis spp.				McIvor, John G/G-5573-2010													1036-9872						2004	26	1					72	87		10.1071/RJ04005							WOS:000222148400005

Recent inventory showed that environmental weeds made up about 10% of the natural flora of the Mekong Delta. Of those alien plants, mimosa, Mimosa pigra L., is among the most serious. This paper provides a synopsis of mimosa invasion on wetlands of the Mekong Delta, and discusses its distribution, habitat preference, morphology, phenology, seed bank, proliferation and current efforts to control mimosa in two wetland national parks, Tram Chim (Dong Thap Province) and U Minh Thuong (Kien Giang Province). The first record of mimosa in the Mekong Delta was collected in 1979 in Moc Hoa District, Long An Province. The weed is now found in all 12 provinces of the Mekong Delta, mostly in the freshwater region influenced by floodwater from the Mekong River. A map of mimosa infestation areas in the Mekong Delta is provided, together with discussions on habitat preference and measurements of plant biological characteristics. The invasion by mimosa has been monitored in the two national parks since 1999. At U Minh Thuong, the invasion of mimosa was detected early, and the eradication was completed with little cost, using manual removal methods. At Tram Chim, however, the infestation has increased beyond easy management. Since 2000, the infestation area in Tram Chim has doubled every year. Maps of mimosa in Tram Chim 2000-2002 are presented. Experiences with mimosa in Tram Chim and U Minh Thuong demonstrate that awareness and early intervention are key factors of a successful weed-management program, particularly in the context of developing countries where there is often a lack of funding and expertise for comprehensive weed control practices.																			0-643-06946-1				2004							45	51									WOS:000231874800008

The species is mainly confined to the central and north-western provinces of Sri Lanka. The plant has colonised along the river banks of the Mahaweli River, which is the main supplier of irrigation water to the agriculture-dominant dry zone of the country. Use of river sand for construction work was identified as a major method of seed dispersal, apart from seeds being transported with river water flow. GPS technology is currently being used for monitoring the extent of spread of this species. Mimosa seeds were 100% viable after four years of storage at room temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C) and also at 8 degrees C. The onset of flowers was first observed at 12-14 weeks after planting. The initial growth of the weed was slow, but the height increased at a rate of 2.4-2.6 cm day(-1) during the first 8-12 weeks. From 12 weeks, the stem dry weight of mimosa increased at a more rapid rate than the root dry weight. The relative growth rate (RGR) increased until onset of flowers and then decreased. The soil seed-bank density within the canopy diameter of the naturally grown mimosa plants varied from 2,336 to 46,410 seeds m(-2). Glyphosate at the dosage of 1.44 kg active ingredient ha(-1) effectively controlled mimosa seedlings less than six months old, when applied three times repeatedly at four-month intervals on the same set of seedlings. Mimosa seeds did not germinate in the resence of one-month old Panicitin maximum Jacq. at a population density of 16 plants m(-2). Awareness programs conducted for the communities in the infested areas have resulted in several community participatory activities to eradicate small patches of mimosa from the Central Province.																			0-643-06946-1				2004							85	90									WOS:000231874800015

Integrated control programs have been effective in reducing the above-ground cover of mimosa but little is known about its effect on the soil seed-bank. The viability of mimosa soil seed banks following integrated control was investigated in two floodplains in the Top End of northern Australia in relation to time since control and vegetation type. Mimosa seed banks under all vegetation types were considerably lower (by at least 50%) than under stands of mimosa. Most of this reduction occurred within the first year of control, although seed stores still remained in the soil three years after initial control. There were few consistent differences in the density of mimosa seed banks between vegetation types. The results also indicated considerably lower seed counts under mimosa compared to previous studies. The lower seed count under mimosa may be attributed to the effectiveness of current biological-control programs. Integrated control therefore appears to be reducing viable mimosa seed. Nevertheless, significant numbers of seeds remain in the seed bank, highlighting the importance of follow-up control and sound land-management practices (avoiding overgrazing and maintaining suitable vegetation cover) in order for competitive species to suppress mimosa re-establishment.

This program, initiated in 2000, is called "Seeds of Success." It is an offshoot of the international "Millennium Seed Bank" project. The goal of the Millennium Seed Bank project is to collect seed from 10 percent of the world's dryland flora and place it in long-term storage. For the BLM, this was an opportunity to evaluate additional native pant materials for restoration projects and to place seed in long-term storage for conservation. Collection targets included native species: of known forage or browse value, widespread regional endemics, wild relatives of cultivated or economically important species, species with significance to Tribes, monotypic species, relatives of rare species, relatives of normative invasive species, species of known pollinator importance, and flagship species such as State flowers and trees. RBG, Kew, and the BLM developed a seed collecting protocol at the population level. In 2002, the first collecting season, BLM gathered seed from 375 taxa in 11 States. Seed is currently in long-term storage at RBG, Kew, and the USDA National Seed Storage Laboratory in Fort Collins, CO.																							2004	31						100	108									WOS:000222498800019						
J	Kalmbacher, RS				Kalmbacher, RS			Germinable seed in the soil seed bank of five bahiagrass-legume pastures	SOIL AND CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF FLORIDA PROCEEDINGS												Soil in five bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum FIugge)-legume pastures in central Florida was sampled for germinable seed prior to summer rains in February 2002. Three pastures contained 1, 5, or 10-yr-old stands of Aeschynomene evenia C. Wright (evenia). A fourth pasture contained 15-yr-old A. americana L. (americana), and the fifth contained 8-yr-old Desmodium heterocarpon (L) DC (carpon). Seedlings of all plants were identified, counted, and removed from flats in a glasshouse as they emerged in 5 cycles of wetting and drying over a 20-mo period. Averaged over all pastures, there was a total 9538 germinable seed m(-2) representing 48 species plus the combined Cyperaceae and Juncaceae, which constituted the largest entity with an average 6653 seed (-2). Bahiagrass ranked 3rd in density of germinable seed with an average 566 seed m(-2) (equivalent of 17.2 kg seed ha(-1)), 98 % of which germinated in Cycle 1. Evenia seed ranked 5th in density with 52, 553, and 335 seed m(-2) in 1, 5, and 10-yr-old stands, respectively (2.8, 29.7, and 18 kg seed ha(-1)). Density of americana (rank 13) and carpon (rank 6) averaged 124 and 857 seed M-2, respectively (6.7 and 11.2 kg seed ha(-1)). Of the total americana seed, 68 and 21 % germinated in Cycles 1 and 2. Germination of evenia and carpon seed was 25 and 39 %, respectively, in Cycle 1, but it reached a peak in Cycle 2 with 47 and 57 %, respectively. Seeds of common weeds were present in all pasture soils, but did not constitute a major portion of the seed bank. These data demonstrate the importance of management to build seed reserves of forage plants. The presence of weed seed indicates the need for good management to maintain strong stands of desirable forages capable of suppressing weeds.																	0096-4522						2004	63						30	36									WOS:000226859000004						
J	Milton, SJ				Milton, SJ			Grasses as invasive alien plants in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Grasses are important, but often overlooked, elements of the South African alien flora. Current information shows that 15% of the grass genera and 12% of grass species in southern Africa are naturalized aliens. Many of these species are invasive in other parts of the world, where they are reducing the biodiversity of indigenous communities, changing ecosystem processes, retarding ecosystem restoration and reducing profits from ranching and arable agriculture. Their spread has been facilitated by domestic livestock, disturbance, long-distance transport and nitrogen addition to soils. Control is complicated by abundant seed production, persistent seed banks, positive response to disturbance, a dearth of biocontrol research and, in some cases, by herbicide resistance. This review of the impacts of alien grasses in other parts of the world suggests that alien grasses will become increasingly prevalent in South Africa, and that more research, aimed at identifying appropriate management responses, would be justified.

J	Hawksworth, DL				Hawksworth, DL			Fungal diversity and its implications for genetic resource collections	STUDIES IN MYCOLOGY												The extent of fungal diversity is reviewed, with respect to revised estimates of the numbers of plant species, and recent data on the extent of novelty in tropical forests, unexplored habitats, and numbers of orphaned, cryptic, and collected but yet undescribed species. Collections of fungal cultures are considered to be better referred to as "genetic resource collections" rather than "culture collections" to mesh with current terminology in other groups of organisms. The extent of holdings relative to the numbers of known and estimated species are reviewed and compared with those of vascular plants in botanic gardens and seed banks. The role of collections in supporting fungal genomics and molecular biology, and as a source of vouchers to vindicate published work in all aspects of mycology, is highlighted. Information is presented on the extent to which collections worldwide document and conserve the Earth's fungal genetic resource. Finally, the special role and responsibilities of CBS, as the major centre for the conservation of fungal genetic resources worldwide, is emphasized.																	0166-0616	1872-9797					2004		50	1		SI		9	17									WOS:000228300300003

Merr.] production in the U.S. has risen to more than 60,000 ha in less than 10 yr. This presentation reviews current organic soybean research being conducted in Iowa and elsewhere throughout the U.S. It examines challenges that producers must deal with and shares our perspectives on this increasing trend. Critical challenges associated with organic soybean production include weed control, crop rotation, bean leaf beetles (Ceratoma trifurcata) - primarily as vectors for the seed-staining bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) and other seed-staining fungi such as Cercospora kikuchii and Fusarium - and the near-by use of genetically modified (GM) soybean cultivars. An economic evaluation based on three years of research at the Neely-Kinyon Long-Term Agroecological Research site near Greenfield, IA revealed that food-grade organic soybean could return $1160 to 1250 ha(-1) compared to $235 for conventional soybean grown in a 2-yr rotation with corn (Zea mays L.). Weed control challenges are site-specific, being closely associated with the weed seed bank populations and crop management strategies used prior to converting to organic crop production. The amount of stained soybean seed is variable generally increasing from NE to SW Iowa because of warmer winter temperatures. At the Neely-Kinyon site, staining ranged from 12 to 22% and 7.5 to 10% while yields averaged 2.4 to 2.8 and 3.5 to 3.8 Mg ha(-1), in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Stained soybean seed is currently rejected for food-grade markets (e.g. tofu), but increasing demand for organic meat and a small premium for organic feed-grade soybean has encouraged producers to continue growing the crop. The primary concern that organic producers have regarding GM crops is the increased risk of their crop failing a GM test when sold because of pollen drift or other contamination sources. Despite the many challenges, increasing consumer demand for certified organic soybean certainly warrants more aggressive and participatory research around the world.																			85-7033-004-9				2004							319	327									WOS:000221525400041						
J	Tamado, T; Milberg, P				Tamado, T; Milberg, P			Control of parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) in grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in the smallholder farming system in eastern Ethiopia	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Parthenium is a competitive weed spreading in tropical countries. Field experiments were conducted to compare the effect of hand hoeing, growing a smother crop, and applying a herbicide (2,4-D) on parthenium growth and on yield of grain sorghum in smallholder farming systems in eastern Ethiopia. Hand hoeing twice and a smother crop (cowpea) in combination with hand hoeing once consistently suppressed parthenium at the experimental sites. Application of 2,4-D provided inconsistent control of parthenium, possibly because of reemergence from the soil seed bank after control. Growing cowpea as the smother crop suppressed parthenium, but sorghum grain and stalk yields were reduced even when the smother crop was combined with hoeing. Hand hoeing twice, 4 and 8 wk after emergence of sorghum, consistently resulted in better yields than application of 2,4-D and growing smother crop. It is possible that hoeing, apart from controlling the weed, also created better soil conditions for rain water infiltration.

J	Anderson, RL				Anderson, RL			Sequencing crops to minimize selection pressure for weeds in the central Great Plains	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Dryland rotations are changing in the semiarid Great Plains because of no-till systems. Producers now rotate summer annual crops such as corn with winter wheat and fallow, which can disrupt weed population growth because of diverse life cycles among crops. This study estimated changes in weed populations as affected by rotation design, with the goal of suggesting crop sequences that lower weed community density. We used an empirical life-cycle simulation based on demographics of jointed goatgrass and green foxtail to compare various rotations consisting of winter wheat, corn, proso millet, and fallow across a 12-yr period. The simulation indicated that designing rotations to include a 2-yr interval when seed production of either jointed goatgrass or green foxtail is prevented will drastically reduce weed populations. Arranging four different crops in sequences of two cool-season crops, followed by two warm-season crops was the most beneficial for weed management. Fallow, if used, serves in either life-cycle category. However, if the same crop is grown 2 yr in a row, such as winter wheat, the benefit of rotation design on weed density is reduced considerably. Impact of rotation design on weed density was enhanced by improving crop competitiveness with cultural practices. Rotations with balanced life-cycle intervals not only reduce weed density but enable producers to use alternative weed management strategies, improve effectiveness of herbicides used, and minimize herbicide resistance.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2004	18	1					157	164		10.1614/WT-03-090R							WOS:000220684800025						
J	Anderson, RL				Anderson, RL			Impact of subsurface tillage on weed dynamics in the Central Great Plains	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Maintaining crop residues on the soil surface has changed cropping practices in the Central Great Plains. Where previously winter wheat-fallow was the prevalent rotation, producers now grow warm-season crops in sequence with winter wheat and fallow. Controlling weeds during fallow with herbicides eliminates the need for tillage, thus conserving more crop residues. However, producers are considering subsurface tillage as an option to manage herbicide-resistant weeds. We reviewed the impact of subsurface tillage with the sweep plow on weed dynamics and crop growth compared with no-till systems. Cropping systems studies show that rotations can be designed to reduce weed community density severalfold; tillage lessens this rotational effect by burying weed seeds and prolonging their survival in soil. Crop residues on the soil surface reduce weed seedling establishment in no-till systems, but tillage eliminates this effect. Crops also yield less after tillage compared with no-till in this semiarid climate. Tillage may help in managing herbicide resistance, but it also may increase weed density as well as reduce crop yield.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2004	18	1					186	192		10.1614/WT-03-095R1							WOS:000220684800029

Four studies were carried out in the northwest of England, in the field and under controlled conditions, during the period 2002 to 2003. Six plant species, which are important to newts as an egg-laying substrate, showed significant germination suppression up to 83% under Australian swamp stonecrop. However, there was no significant effect of Australian swamp stonecrop on pond seed banks, and no significant loss of plant species was observed in ponds invaded by the weed. Smooth newt eggs hatched at a later developmental stage when laid on Australian swamp stonecrop compared with those laid on the native substrate watercress, generally considered to be a preferred species. No significant differences in developmental stage at hatching could be detected between substrates in the great crested newt, a protected species.																	0890-037X						2004	18			S			1349	1352		10.1614/0890-037X(2004)018[1349:CHIUPE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000226528100036						
J	Hinz, HL; Schwarzlaender, M				Hinz, HL; Schwarzlaender, M			Comparing invasive plants from their native and exotic range: What can we learn for biological Control?	WEED TECHNOLOGY					Conference on Invasive Plants in Natural and Managed Systems	NOV, 2003	Ft Lauderdale, FL					This article reviews and summarizes data sets that attempt to compare performance, population dynamics, and herbivory of invasive plant species. Specifically, we review results from studies comparing (1) individual and population parameters of plant invaders in their native and exotic range, (2) herbivore pressure and natural enemy guilds associated with plant invaders in their native and exotic range, and (3) performance and defense levels of native and exotic populations of the invasive under standardized conditions and the performance of selected herbivores. We found a total of 39 published and 2 unpublished studies, investigating 40 plant species. The majority of studies within the first category showed that invaders form larger populations, grow denser, have higher reproductive output, larger seed banks, and higher regeneration rates in the exotic compared with the native range. In contrast, plant vigor was not always greater, presumably because of increased intraspecific competition. Nearly all studies within the second category showed that herbivory (percentage of attack, species number and load) was reduced and, if investigated, that the herbivore community shifted from specialists to generalists and from endophagous to exophagous species in the exotic compared with the native range. Under standardized conditions (category 3), an equal number of studies found increased vigor or no significant differences between plants from the exotic and native range. In a few cases, plants from the exotic range grew less vigorous. Specialist herbivores generally preferred or developed better on plants from exotic compared with native populations, which were also better defended. Studies comparing plant invaders at field sites in their native and exotic range or under standardized conditions can help identify factors facilitating successful invasions, which in turn can improve the selection and efficiency of biological control agents and the development of integrated management strategies. We therefore suggest to include comparative studies more frequently in biological control programs and to extend them to include manipulative experiments and comparisons of control agents.																	0890-037X						2004	18			S			1533	1541		10.1614/0890-037X(2004)018[1533:CIPFTN]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000226528100075

Immediately after harvest in July stubble tillage was performed at 8 cm, and followed by ploughing at 20 cm in October shortly before seeding the following winter wheat. 15 up to 25 % of all seeds emerged in autumn before primary tillage. Some cultivars significantly differed in building up a soil seed bank that reached up to 11 % of the whole seed losses, with most seeds occurring in a soil layer from 10 to 20 cm depth. Simultaneously performed laboratory experiments on secondary dormancy resulted in the same ranking within the cultivars as seeds were found in the soil seed bank. A maximum number of 0.2 volunteers m(-2) flowered in June 2003 depending on the amount of the soil seed bank of each cultivar. Outcrossing and gene dispersal in space was unlikely since the flowering period on adjacent rape crops had already finished that time. According to the results of this study selecting and growing suitable oilseed rape genotypes offers a perspective to reduce the number and disadvantages of volunteers in following crops.

J	Decocq, G; Hermy, M				Decocq, G; Hermy, M			Are there herbaceous dryads in temperate deciduous forests?	ACTA BOTANICA GALLICA												The concept of dryad (i.e. sedentary, structural, supportive species of mature forests) proposed by Van Steenis (1956) is extended to herbaceous plant species within the framework of temperate deciduous forests. A trait syndrome is derived for several forest herb species with similar dynamic behaviour into the silvigenesis. Three guilds are distinguished mainly according to the plant adaptations to photic stress : 1) shade-avoiders which are vernal geophytes, 2) shade-tolerants which are evergreen or wintergreen herbs or ferns, and 3) shade-adapted which are non-chlorophylian geophytes. Herbaceous species of these guilds are found to share many features such as a K-strategy, a long life span, a long juvenile period, a late sexual maturity, a low production of seeds, heavy barochoreous or myrmecochoreous diaspores, a lack of persisting seed banks and a capacity for vegetative multiplication and clonality.

J	Schafer, M; Kotanen, PM				Schafer, M; Kotanen, PM			The influence of soil moisture on losses of buried seeds to fungi	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Although soil fungi are likely to be a major cause of mortality for buried seeds, few ecological studies have examined the role these pathogens play in natural systems. In particular, few studies have investigated whether losses of seeds to soil fungi are habitat-dependent. We used fungicide treatments to investigate whether losses of buried seeds of four grasses (Bromus inermis, Danthonia spicata, Glyceria striata, and Poa pratensis) to soil fungi differed among meadows differing in soil moisture. We also applied water to some treatments, to determine whether this increased losses of seeds to fungi. For all four grasses, fungicide additions improved one or more measures of seed viability, though this effect was small. For Danthonia and Glyceria, fungicide was less likely to improve viability in dry meadows than in wet and/or mesic meadows. Adding water reduced some measures of viability of seeds of Danthonia and Poa in dry meadows, but fungicide partly counteracted these negative effects, suggesting that adding water reduced performance by increasing fungal attack. These results indicate that fungi represent a hazard for buried seeds of these species, particularly in wetter soils, and potentially may contribute to the reduction of populations of vulnerable species in wetter sites.

J	van den Berg, LJL; Vergeer, P; Roelofs, JGM				van den Berg, LJL; Vergeer, P; Roelofs, JGM			Heathland restoration in The Netherlands: Effects of turf cutting depth on germination of Arnica montana	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE					Conference on Restoration Ecology	AUG 25-31, 2002	Budapest, HUNGARY					Germination experiments were conducted in a heathland after turf cutting and in a climate chamber to investigate the effects of turf cutting depth, aluminium toxicity and aluminium detoxification by humic acids and base cations on the germination and establishment of Arnica montana. Turfs were cut at three different depths, creating a gradient from organic to mineral soils. Germination and establishment of A. montana were negatively correlated with turf cutting depth. The removal of organic matter resulted in a major decrease in organic fraction of the soil and its nutrients. It also resulted in a considerable decrease in moisture content and humic acids. Additional liming after turf cutting increased germination and establishment in all plots and at all depths. Germination experiments under controlled conditions in a climate chamber revealed a significantly higher germination at low aluminium/calcium (Al:Ca) ratios. High Al:Ca ratios resulted in poor germination, suggesting Al toxicity. Addition of humic acids increased germination, even at high Al:Ca ratios, suggesting immobilization of Al by humic acids. It is concluded that turf cutting can have a marked effect on the success of heathland restoration. It results in the intended removal of the eutrophic layer but also in the unintentional removal of much of the buffering mechanisms and/or Al immobilizing compounds. Additional buffering and/or less deep turf cutting may be necessary to allow germination and establishment of rare herbaceous species such as A. montana.

J	Holzel, N; Otte, N				Holzel, N; Otte, N			Restoration of a species-rich flood meadow by topsoil removal and diaspore transfer with plant material	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE					Conference on Restoration Ecology	AUG 25-31, 2002	Budapest, HUNGARY					In previous studies, limited dispersal was revealed to be the main obstacle to restoration of species-rich flood-meadows along the northern Upper Rhine in Germany. To overcome dispersal limitation we transferred freshly mown plant material from species-rich sources to a restoration site on a former arable field. Before plant material application, topsoil was removed to accelerate nutrient impoverishment and create favourable conditions for seedling recruitment. Topsoil removal led to a drastic reduction in organic matter and essential mineral nutrients to the level of target communities (P) or even below (N, K). At a removal depth of 30 cm content of the soil seed bank that comprised exclusively of annual arable weeds, ruderals and some common grassland species, declined by 60 - 80%, while at a removal depth of 50 cm the seed bank was almost completely eliminated. With few exceptions, all species recorded in source plant material were found established at the restoration site. However, the overall correlation between seed content in plant material and establishment success was not very high. Vegetation development at the restoration site was characterized by a rapid decline in arable weeds and ruderals, while resident grassland species and species transferred with plant material increased rapidly from the third year onwards. After four years as many as 102 species were established that could be exclusively attributed to plant material transfer, among them many rare and highly endangered plants. Establishment of species from plant material was most successful in regularly flooded plots, due to the suppression of competitors as well as the creation of favourable moisture conditions for seedling emergence. Diaspore transfer with plant material proved to be an extremely successful method in restoring species-rich grassland. However, high quality of plant material and suitable site conditions with low competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential prerequisites.

There was very uneven grazing intensity inside the locality, and grazing preference changed during the season: cattle grazed most of the time in productive but species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards, but changed to a species-rich Violion caninae stand in the middle of the summer. A species-rich Carex rostrata community was only grazed at the end of the season. Species-poor swards dominated by Nardus stricta and Carex brizoides were mainly used as resting areas. Both grazing and excluding from grazing had a negative effect on species diversity of the Deschampsia cespitosa swards. The soil seed bank contained only few species that are characteristic of mountain grassland communities, and seed dispersal of the target species by cattle dung was also found to be very limited. Thus both grazing and exclusion from grazing are probably of limited value for the restoration of species-rich grasslands from species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards in this case.

The vegetation was sampled at different elevations of a sand dune which became partly invaded by the tree Robinia pseudo-acacia ca. 10 yr ago. Pre-abandonment vegetation records were used as historic references. Though composition of the non-invaded grassland only changed moderately, dominance of tall grasses (Elymus hispidus, Poa angustifolia) increased significantly at the cost of annuals and low stature perennials. In the stand invaded by Robinia most grassland species were lost and replaced by nitrophytes. Vertical position influenced species abundance, but affected the composition only moderately. Fine-scale zonation of the vegetation also changed with time. Species richness of the above-ground vegetation and the seed density of soil samples at the lower elevation were slightly greater than at the higher sites. Seed banks of sensitive grassland specialists (e.g. Pulsatilla pratensis subsp. hungarica) disappeared during grass encroachment. Following extinction from above-ground vegetation, restoration must rely on dispersal from adjacent areas. In contrast, several annuals and perennials, which survived this degradation stage in the above-ground vegetation, possessed seed banks. Many of these species became extinct from the vegetation during the Robinia invasion but left viable persistent seeds. This fact is promising for restoration of the Potentillo-Festucetum sandy pasture. Competitive weedy species and sprouting Robinia can, however, limit seedling establishment.

We studied the vegetation and seed bank composition at six species-rich and six species-poor ditch banks, where agri-environment schemes are running to maintain and enhance ditch bank plant diversity. We show that the number of species in the seed bank was low, regardless of the number of species in the established vegetation. Moreover, the seed bank was always dissimilar to the established vegetation. Target species for nature conservation were occasionally present in the seed bank at both species-poor and species-rich sites, but rarely so if the species was absent from the established vegetation. We conclude that the potential use of the seed bank for restoration of ditch banks is minimal. At present, plant species richness seems to be largely controlled by germination opportunities; high biomass and competition appear to hamper germination at species-poor sites. We recommend continued nutrient reduction at such sites. Soil disturbance measures and deliberate sowing should also be considered.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				DEC	2003	6	2					179	188		10.1658/1402-2001(2003)006[0179:RODBPS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000220133300010

We tested the response of the diaspore bank using univariate and multivariate analysis of variance. The two approaches were complementary and together improved the interpretation of these results. There were considerable differences in the diaspore banks of the two sites and among the experimental locations within sites. Within each experiment there were differences in species composition, with species that were (1) common to both diaspore bank and vegetation, (2) restricted to the diaspore bank and (3) restricted to the vegetation. There is a possibility of increasing the biodiversity of the developing vegetation if some of the species present in the diaspore bank can be germinated. This was especially true for ferns where four species were found in the spore bank which were not present in the vegetation. There were few significant effects of management treatment on the diaspore bank as the experiments had been in progress for only 3 to 5 yr, but a few species had different densities in the different treatments (Betula pubescens, Juncus effusus and some bryophytes). The greatest correlation between vegetation and diaspore bank was found at the top hierarchical level (entire dataset) and this progressively reduced with scale. We interpret this as a landscape/species pool effect: as the scale of the, study reduces the correlation between diaspore bank and vegetation also reduces, at least over the time scale of our study. The relevance of these results for restoration ecology is discussed briefly.

J	Vecrin, MP; Muller, S				Vecrin, MP; Muller, S			Top-soil translocation as a technique in the re-creation of species-rich meadows	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE					Conference on Restoration Ecology	AUG 25-31, 2002	Budapest, HUNGARY					In France, most civil engineering and excavation projects are at present accompanied by compensatory measures with the aim of preserving biodiversity. In order to avoid the destruction of a habitat of high conservation interest in NE France, harbouring two legally protected plant species, an experiment of soil translocation was conducted on an area of I ha. The donor site was an extensively managed mesophilic meadow and the receiving site was a neighbouring arable land. The vegetation of the translocated meadow was described 8 and 17 months after soil translocation, and compared (1) with vegetation resulting from more classical restoration techniques tested on the arable land (natural regeneration and seed mixture sowing) and (2) with the soil seed bank and vegetation previously present on the donor site. Results showed that the soil translocation technique permitted the development of many meadow species, including two legally protected species, and few ruderal species despite a large area of bare ground. This technique seems effective in terms of number and abundance of meadow species compared to natural regeneration and commercial seed sowing. In the case of the two classical methods, species richness was lower and only widespread species were present. Topsoil translocation provides a good compensatory method to avoid habitat and species destruction. However, the study should be continued, with the aim of assessing the longer term development and stabilization of the vegetation of the translocated meadow.																	1402-2001					DEC	2003	6	2					271	278		10.1658/1402-2001(2003)006[0271:TTAATI]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000220133300020						
J	Capers, RS				Capers, RS			Macrophyte colonization in a freshwater tidal wetland (Lyme, CT, USA)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seed bank sampling and creation of plots cleared of standing vegetation showed that aboveground vegetative propagules were more important than seeds in colonization of a freshwater tidal wetland but that the relative importance of sexual reproduction varied among species. Nine submerged species established in colonization plots. Of these colonization events, 60% were achieved by plant fragments, either in the sediment or floating in the water, and 16% resulted from vegetative growth. Only 4 of 16 submerged species in the community were represented in the seed bank. The collection of vegetative propagules in nets demonstrated that drifting propagules were very abundant and that the relative abundance of species in the propagule stream corresponded most closely with the standing community.

J	Thomas, PB; Morris, EC; Auld, TD				Thomas, PB; Morris, EC; Auld, TD			Interactive effects of heat shock and smoke on germination of nine species forming soil seed banks within the Sydney region	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The germination response of seeds from fire-prone vegetation to fire-related cues such as heat shock and smoke has usually been studied by applying the cues singly. The few studies that have applied the cues in combination have shown that interactions between the cues are possible. Here, the response of seeds from a number of species to combined heat shock and smoke is reported. Heat shock (25, 50, 75 and 100degreesC) and aerosol smoke (0, 5, 10 and 20 min) were applied factorially to nine species that form soil seed banks in the Sydney region of south-eastern Australia. These species were from Epacridaceae (four species), Myrtaceae (four species) and Cyperaceae (one species) and ranged from fire-sensitive obligate seeders to fire-tolerant facultative resprouters. Germination of Dracophyllum secundum R. Br and Sprengelia monticola (A. Cunn. ex DC.) Druce was low and did not respond to the germination cues. The positive response of Gahnia sieberiana Kunth and Kunzea ambigua (Sm.) Druce to heat shock and smoke was independent and additive. The positive response of Kunzea capitata Rchb. to the interaction between heat shock and smoke was synergistic, and the response of Baeckea diosmifolia Rudge and Baeckea imbricata (Gaertn.) Druce was unitive, with germination increase only occurring following combined heat and smoke application. Epacris coriacea A. Cunn. ex DC. and Epacris obtusifolia Sm. had low levels of dormancy and hence it was not possible to find a fire response. Gahnia sieberiana and K. capitata responded differently to the combination of heat shock and smoke than has previously been reported. Germination of species from habitats that are infrequently burnt was not affected by heat shock or smoke. Low-intensity fire or patches within fire may be important for seedling recruitment as the 50degreesC heat shock stimulated germination in four of the five species that responded to the heat cue, and germination of Baeckea imbricata declined within the 100degreesC heat shock treatment. Germination of one species, Baeckea imbricata, was only stimulated by a specific combination of cues, indicating that regeneration niches may be narrow for some species and that the application of a range of heat and smoke doses is required to find such responses. Of the species positively responding to heat shock and smoke, a requirement for both cues was prevalent, therefore the response to these cues in isolation cannot be relied upon to give a true indication of the fire response of a species.

But the re-vegetation efforts were not very successful: Five years after re-vegetation, the river banks bore hardly any vegetation. In the course of additional scientific monitoring, the re-vegetation potential of macrophytes especially Phragmites australis was studied. We aimed to assess the size and composition of the soil seed bank, the quality and quantity of imported diaspores, and their ability to establish reed species. A marked difference between the diaspore community of the new river banks and the flood basins was found. The input of reed species into the seed bank was low and reed macrophytes could not establish very successfully. After the dislocation of the river Ochtum actual vegetation as well as a seed bank pool of reed species were missing and colonization could not take place from within the side.

J	Campos, JB; de Souza, MC				Campos, JB; de Souza, MC			Potencial for natural forest regeneration from seed bank in an upper Parana river floodplain, Brazil	BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY												The historical process of deforestation was analyzed to evaluate the regeneration potential of forests from soil seed batik of Porto Rico island (53degrees 15'W and 22degrees 45'S) in the upper Parana river floodplain. Remnant forest fragments were identified and measured and the structure of arboreous vegetation and the composition of the seed batik of the forests and grassland of the island were evaluated. Results showed a fast process of deforestation with critical levels of forest: the remaning twice fragments represented only 5.98% of the total surface of the island. Disturbance by cattle raised on the island continuously degraded the fragments (backward succession), while expansion of areas with pasture favored severe impoverishment of the seed banks flora. The latter 'factor, soil compaction, and characteristics of seeds of existing arboreous species in the bank suggested that the immediate reestablishment of vegetation was more conditioned to introduction processes of seeds (by rain and "flood seed") than by stock of seeds in the bank.																	1516-8913					DEC	2003	46	4					625	639		10.1590/S1516-89132003000400018							WOS:000220990900018						
J	McKinstry, MC; Anderson, SH				McKinstry, MC; Anderson, SH			Improving aquatic plant growth using propagules and topsoil in created bentonite wetlands of Wyoming	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Aquatic plants usually establish at created wetlands via water, wind, or animal transport of propagules from nearby wetlands. However. plants may not establish in created wetlands that are far removed from natural wetlands and their seed sources. In northeast Wyoming, over 1500 wetlands have been created as a result of bentonite mining and most are >50km from natural wetlands. Aquatic plants have not established at many of these wetlands, and creation and restoration activities have not included plant propagation techniques. Furthermore, these wetlands were created using bentonite as the substrate, with no addition of topsoil. This might pose a further barrier to plant growth. Our objectives were to examine the growth of various aquatic plants within four substrate types: (1) native bentonite, (2) native topsoil, (3) topsoil and bentonite mix, and (4) greenhouse soil. We grew nine submergent and emergent plant species, using the four treatments, during 2000 and 2001, in wetland microcosm located at the University of Wyoming's Greenhouse. We also conducted growth trials for six aquatic plant species using experimental exclosures and existing bentonite substrates at ten wetlands during 2000 and 2001. The greenhouse experiments demonstrated that the addition of topsoil can increase plant numbers and growth weights by >50% for most of the species we tested, although several species exhibited moderate growth in the bentonite treatments. The wetland exclosures suggested that the addition of plant propagules to existing bentonite wetlands can increase aquatic vegetation dramatically. Because many more wetlands will be created in this region, we believe that incorporating topsoil at a minimum ratio of 50:50 by volume with bentonite during basin construction and introducing plant propagules are two techniques that can be used to increase the value and productivity of these created wetlands.

J	Wright, JP; Flecker, AS; Jones, CG				Wright, JP; Flecker, AS; Jones, CG			Local vs. landscape controls on plant species richness in beaver meadows	ECOLOGY												There is considerable interest in determining whether the species richness of communities is determined by forces controlling dispersal into patches that operate at the landscape scale, or forces controlling persistence that act at the local scale. Understanding the relative importance of these two classes of factors in controlling within-patch species richness is particularly important when patches are created via ecosystem engineering. In such cases, factors affecting the population dynamics or behavior of a single species could indirectly affect species richness if richness is controlled primarily by landscape-level factors. We used a combination of experimental mesocosms and field observations to determine whether species richness in beaver wetlands in the Adirondack Mountains (New York) is more strongly controlled by the position of the wetland in the landscape or by within-wetland hydrology. Drainage rate had a significant effect on both richness and composition in mesocosms, with well-drained treatments having significantly higher richness than poorly drained treatments. Seed germinated from the seed bank in sediments collected from different ponds showed relatively small differences in richness or community composition in mesocosms, suggesting a comparatively small effect of dispersal limitation on species richness. Experimental results were mirrored in a survey of 14 meadows over two years, which indicated that variability in water table depth was consistently a significant predictor of species richness, while meadow area and isolation showed little relation to richness. The survey also suggested that the number of years since beaver had abandoned a site was a significant predictor of the number of species found in beaver meadows. The results indicate that species richness in beaver meadows is strongly controlled by local factors', but that the population dynamics of beaver could also potentially affect species richness by altering the age distribution of meadows across the landscape.

The effect of increasing salinity on the emergence of zooplankton eggs and the germination of aquatic plant seeds from the sediment of two wetlands was examined. Salinity was found to cause reductions in species richness and abundance of aquatic plants and zooplankton at salinities between 1000 and 5000 mg L-1. Aquatic plants also had an associated decrease in above ground biomass. 2. Individual taxa showed different responses to salinity, and four response patterns were identified: (i) increased number of organisms emerging at 1000 mg L-1; (ii) decreased number of organisms emerging above 1000 mg L-1; (iii) decreased number of organisms emerging between 300 and 1000 mg L-1; (iv) no difference in number of organisms emerging across the range of salinities. Response patterns (iii) and (iv) were common to both plants and zooplankton, whereas response patterns (i) and (ii) were only identified for zooplankton. 3. Results indicate that there is potential for the increasing salinity in Australian rivers and wetlands to decrease the species richness of aquatic communities resulting in loss of wetland biodiversity.

J	Middleton, BA				Middleton, BA			Soil seed banks and the potential restoration of forested wetlands after farming	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Changes in farming practice provide an opportunity to restore once extensive forested wetlands on agricultural land. In some parts of the world, however, it has proved difficult to restore the full complement of plant species through natural regeneration. Similarly, the restoration of forested wetlands by replanting has often resulted in ecosystems of low diversity. Better methods of restoring these important ecosystems are now required and baldcypress swamps provide an opportunity to investigate alternative approaches to the restoration of forested wetlands. This study examined the composition of seed banks of farmed fields to determine their value in restoring swamps in the south-eastern United States. 2. A seed bank assay of soils from baldcypress swamps was conducted to determine the extent to which seeds are maintained during farming for various lengths of time. Soils from swamps that were farmed for 0-50 years were collected near the northern boundary of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley along the Cache River, Illinois. Soils were placed in a glasshouse setting in flooded and freely drained conditions, and the numbers and species of seeds germinating were recorded. 3. Woody species including trees, shrubs, and vines were poorly represented in seed banks of both farmed and intact sites (51 and 9 sites, respectively). Missing dominants in the seed banks included tree species with short-lived seeds such as Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica. Cephalanthus occidentalis constituted the most abundantly dispersed seed of all woody species. 4. Herbaceous species were well represented in the seed banks of both farmed and intact swamps (species richness of 207 vs. 173 species, respectively) suggesting that herbaceous species may live longer than woody species in seed banks. Few of the herbaceous species decreased in seed density in seed banks with time under cultivation, although seed density was lower at sites that had not been farmed. Species that relied on vegetative organs for dispersal were absent in the seed banks of farmed sites including Heteranthera dubia, Hottonia inflata, Lemna minor, Lemna trisulca and Wolffia columbiana. These species may require active reintroduction during restoration. 5. Synthesis and applications. Both restoration ecologists and managers of nature conservation areas need to be cognisant of seed bank and dispersal characteristics of species to effectively restore and manage forested wetlands. In the case of baldcypress swamps, critical components of the vegetation are not maintained in seed banks, which may make these floodplain wetlands difficult to restore via natural recolonization. Ultimately, the successful restoration of abandoned farm fields to forested wetlands may depend on the re-engineering of flood pulsing across landscapes to reconnect dispersal pathways.

Seeds of 18 species were added to half the plots in each of eight combinations of elevation, canopy and litter, and seedling emergence was observed for two growing seasons. 2 Both individual and interactive effects on plant diversity and colonization were determined for all four examined factors. Interactive effects explained 41-63% of the total variation in both species richness and numbers of individuals growing from added seeds. 3 Neither elevation nor vegetation canopy had significant individual effects on total species richness, but their interaction was significant. Litter addition limited seedling emergence at the low elevation but favoured it at the high elevation. 4 The relative importance of vegetation canopy and plant litter in affecting plant community composition varied with the community parameter considered (species richness or number of seedlings), elevation and stage of vegetation development. In general, plant litter was more important in determining species richness, whereas the vegetation canopy was more important in determining seed germination and seedling emergence. Plant litter was also more important than vegetation canopy at an early stage of vegetation development and at low elevation. 5 Seed availability was the most important factor in determining overall species richness in the studied community. The influence of the local seed bank was very limited. Seedling emergence and seedling species richness were generally enhanced by lower elevation and seed addition, but depressed by vegetation and litter addition. 6 The complex relationships observed have considerable implications for ecological modelling and ecosystem restoration. Manipulation of one factor may produce unexpected effects on other factors, which may induce a series of consequences for the whole community. Further knowledge on how natural communities are organized and maintained is needed to guide the management of ecosystems.

J	Alexander, HM; Schrag, AM				Alexander, HM; Schrag, AM			Role of soil seed banks and newly dispersed seeds in population dynamics of the annual sunflower, Helianthus annuus	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 We explored the role of the seed bank in population dynamics of the summer annual Helianthus annuus. First, we determined seed survival under field conditions. Secondly, we conducted an experiment in which a dispersal treatment (plants allowed/not allowed to disperse seeds) was crossed with a soil disturbance treatment that was predicted to increase seed bank recruitment. Our goal was to evaluate the relative importance of the previous year's seed production vs. the remainder of the seed bank to numbers of plants. 2 Yearly seed survival was variable, ranging from 46 to 83% when seeds were buried in mesh packets and from 12 to 76% for seeds placed on the soil surface. Survival was higher for plots established in 1999 than in 2000. Survival was often higher in later years but was unaffected by the presence of litter. 3 By comparing seedling establishment between dispersal treatments, we inferred that approximately 10-23% of the seedlings were from the seed bank, independent of soil disturbance. 4 Although seed dispersal the previous year led to increased numbers of seedlings by at least 4.5 times, the number of adults only increased 2.5 times and head production only increased 1.5 times because of density-dependent processes. 5 Patches of seedlings emerging only from the seed bank (often at low densities) may have a disproportionate contribution to the next generation. Average head production/seedling was 3.6 for such seedlings vs. 0.8 for seedlings from both the previous year's seed set and the seed bank. Emergence of seeds from the seed bank in high-density seedling areas may, however, have little effect on patch reproduction as reproductive output was asymptotically related to the number of seedlings initially present. Studies of seed survival and seedling biology should therefore be done with consideration of the entire life cycle.																	0022-0477					DEC	2003	91	6					987	998		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00824.x							WOS:000186751200007						
J	Lamb, EG; Mallik, AU				Lamb, EG; Mallik, AU			Plant species traits across a riparian-zone/forest ecotone	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												We examined the changes in prevalence of nine plant traits - including the presence of woody stern tissue, leaf longevity, nitrogen fixation, seed longevity, dispersal vector, pollination vector, and clonal growth form - across a riparian/forest-understory ecotone. This ecotone, found along headwater streams in boreal mixed-wood forests, supports four distinct vegetation zones: streambank, riparian, transition, and upland forest understory. The objective of this Study was to identify specific trait patterns that may indicate functional responses to the changes in environmental factors such as nutrient availability and wind exposure that occur across the ecotone. The suites of plant species traits found in each zone were distinct, with a strong change in the prevalence of several traits. Wind and insect pollination, wind and vertebrate diaspore dispersal, and deciduous and evergreen leaves showed the greatest change in prevalence between the vegetation types. Some traits, including insect pollination and vertebrate diaspore dispersal, were strongly correlated within species. The consistent co-occurrence of pairs of traits in the same species suggests common responses by very different traits to the same environmental factor. This study demonstrates that an ecotone can be characterized not only as a discontinuity in species distributions or environmental factors, but also as a discontinuity in the trait spectrum. Examining ecotones from a trait perspective has strong potential for identifying the environmental factors and associated species functional responses that encourage the development of distinct vegetation boundaries.

J	Wilson, SD; Partel, M				Wilson, SD; Partel, M			Extirpation or coexistence? Management of a persistent introduced grass in a prairie restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Introduced perennial grasses are one of the greatest constraints to prairie restoration. Herbicides suppress but do not eliminate introduced grasses, so we explored the interaction of herbicide with two additional controls: heavy clipping (to simulate grazing) and competition from native species. A 50-year-old stand of the introduced perennial grass Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass) in the northern Great Plains was seeded with native grasses and treated with herbicide annually for 7 years in a factorial experiment. Clipping was applied as a subplot treatment in the final 3 years. Both herbicide and clipping significantly reduced the cover of A. cristatum, but clipping produced an immediate and consistent decrease, whereas herbicide control varied among years. The cover of A. cristatum decreased significantly with increasing cover of a seeded native grass, Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama), suggesting that both top-down (i.e., grazing) and bottom-up (i.e., resource competition) strategies can contribute to A. cristatum control. No treatment had any effect on the seed bank of A. cristatum. Even in the most effective control treatments, A. cristatum persisted at low amounts (approximately 5% cover) throughout the experiment. The cover of B. gracilis increased significantly with seed addition and herbicide, and, after 7 years, was similar to that in undisturbed prairie. The total cover of native species increased significantly with clipping and herbicide, and species richness was significantly higher in plots receiving herbicide. Clipping season had no effect on any variable. In summary, no method extirpated A. cristatum, but clipping reduced its cover by 90% and doubled the cover of native species. Extirpation might not be a realistic goal, but relatively simple management allowed coexistence of native species.

J	Shiels, AB; Walker, LR				Shiels, AB; Walker, LR			Bird perches increase forest seeds on Puerto Rican landslides	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Landslides result in the loss of vertical vegetative structure, soil nutrients, and the soil seed bank. These losses impede timely recovery of tropical forest communities. In this study we added bird perches to six Puerto Rican landslides with three types of surfaces (bare, climbing fern, grass) in an effort to facilitate inputs of forest seeds through bird dispersal and to accelerate plant succession. Numbers of bird-dispersed forest seeds were significantly higher in plots beneath introduced perches than in control plots. Perches did not increase forest seedling densities compared with control plots. Seven different species of birds were observed on introduced perches. Because 99% of the seed inputs to controls and perch plots in the six landslides were wind-dispersed seeds (mostly graminoids), perches can improve landslide restoration if woody plants establish and shade out the dominant graminoid and climbing fern ground cover. Although increasing seed inputs from forest species is a critical step in accelerating revegetation of landslides, we suggest that supplemental restoration techniques be applied in addition to bird perches to promote forest recovery.																	1061-2971					DEC	2003	11	4					457	465		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2003.rec0269.x							WOS:000186531800007						
J	Burne, HM; Yates, CJ; Ladd, PG				Burne, HM; Yates, CJ; Ladd, PG			Comparative population structure and reproductive biology of the critically endangered shrub Grevillea althoferorum and two closely related more common congeners	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Grevillea althoferorum is a critically endangered, sprouting shrub known from two disjunct populations within the South-West Botanical Province of Western Australia. This study compares the conservation biology of G. althoferorum and two closely related but more common congeners, the non-sprouter G. rudis and the sprouter G. synapheae subsp. pachyphylla in order to determine whether there are differences in reproductive and ecological attributes that might explain why G. althoferorum is rare. In contrast to the more common species, neither population of G. althoferorum exhibited evidence of seedling recruitment. However, the northern population was confirmed to be clonal and was actively recruiting from root suckers. Both populations of G. althoferorum were found to have reduced amounts of viable pollen on stigmas in comparison with the other species. The fruit set at the southern population of G. althoferorum was considerably lower than that found for the common species, with only 0.15% of flowers setting fruit and no fruit was produced in the northern population. In addition no evidence of a soil seed bank was found for either population of G. althoferorum, but G. rudis and G. synapheae subsp. pachyphylla both had soil stored seed which germinated following treatment with aqueous smoke solution. Sexual recruitment at both populations of G. althoferorum was absent, and reproduction appears to be predominantly clonal in the northern population. Management strategies for G. althoferorum should therefore focus on the protection of adult plants from accidental destruction. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 132 species were found, 76 in the seed-bank and 109 in the vegetation, with 53 species in common. Conifer cover was not found to be associated with a decrease in total number of species in the vegetation or seed-bank, but the mean number of species in the vegetation, total cover in field layer vegetation and mean number of individuals in the seed-bank decreased significantly from grassland to forest stands. The grassland seed-bank was dominated by Saxifraga tridactylites and Veronica agrestis; the seed-bank of plots of scattered cedars was dominated by Trifolium incarnatum ssp. molinerii; and that of dense cedar plantations was dominated by Campanula rapunculus. The number and cover of grassland species of field layer vegetation decreased in the forest, with respect to open grassland, and the same trend was found for density of individuals in the seed-bank. It is concluded that grassland restoration by cutting cedars cannot rely on the presence of grassland species in the soil seed-bank.

J	England, PR; Whelan, RJ; Ayre, DJ				England, PR; Whelan, RJ; Ayre, DJ			Effects of seed bank disturbance on the fine-scale genetic structure of populations of the rare shrub Grevillea macleayana	HEREDITY												Dispersal in most plants is mediated by the movement of seeds and pollen, which move genes across the landscape differently. Grevillea macleayana is a rare, fire-dependent Australian shrub with large seeds lacking adaptations for dispersal; yet it produces inflorescences adapted to pollination by highly mobile vertebrates (eg birds). Interpreting fine-scale genetic structure in the light of these two processes is confounded by the recent imposition of anthropogenic disturbances with potentially contrasting genetic consequences: (1) the unusual foraging behaviour of exotic honeybees and 2. widespread disturbance of the soil-stored seedbank by road building and quarrying. To test for evidence of fine-scale genetic structure within G. macleayana populations and to test the prediction that such structure might be masked by disturbance of the seed bank, we sampled two sites in undisturbed habitat and compared their genetic structure with two sites that had been strongly affected by road building using a test for spatial autocorrelation of genotypes. High selfing levels inferred from genotypes at all four sites implies that pollen dispersal is limited. Consistent with this, we observed substantial spatial clustering of genes at 10 m or less in the two undisturbed populations and argue that this reflects the predicted effects of both high selfing levels and limited seed dispersal. In contrast, at the two sites disturbed by road building, spatial autocorrelation was weak. This suggests there has been mixing of the seed bank, counteracting the naturally low dispersal and elevated selfing due to honeybees. Pollination between near neighbours with reduced relatedness potentially has fitness consequences for G. macleayana in disturbed sites.

The method developed to detect such agents must be selective for a broad spectrum of microbes, which may be present at very low levels, while discriminating from the host organisms. Although Pichia pastoris strains are frequently used as cell lines for the expression of heterologous proteins, a method that is specific for monitoring culture purity has yet to be reported for this type of organism. An assay that is capable of recovering contaminating bacteria, fungi, and closely related yeast from cultures of P. Pastoris at parts per million detection limits is described here.																	1367-5435	1476-5535				NOV	2003	30	11					643	650		10.1007/s10295-003-0089-2							WOS:000188191200003	14605910					
J	De Villiers, AJ; Van Rooyen, MW; Theron, GK				De Villiers, AJ; Van Rooyen, MW; Theron, GK			Similarity between the soil seed bank and the standing vegetation in the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, South Africa	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The similarity in species composition and abundance between the soil seed bank and its associated vegetation was studied in six vegetation units of the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, South Africa. A total of 103 taxa were recorded in the vegetation, of which 34 taxa were also present in the seed bank. Five taxa were unique to the soil seed bank. In general, the taxa most abundant in the vegetation were also recorded in the seed bank and vice versa. Mean seed bank density varied between different plant types. Perennial taxa were most abundant in the vegetation, while annual taxa were most abundant in the seed bank. Annual taxa (excluding grasses) yielded the highest sintilarity between vegetation and seed bank (67.9 per cent), while that of perennial (excluding grasses) and grass taxa were 34.2 per cent and 40.0 per cent respectively. An overall similarity of 47.0 per cent between the seed bank and its associated vegetation was obtained for this part of the Strandveld Succulent Karoo. The seed bank of the study site will be a good source of future annual vegetation, but not of perennial vegetation. Topsoil replacement, sowing and transplanting of selected species will be essential for the success of post-mining revegetation efforts following complete destruction of the existing vegetation. Annual species may be recruited from the soil stored seed bank, while many perennial species will have to be reintroduced by means of sowing and/or transplanting.

J	Harrison, SK; Regnier, EE				Harrison, SK; Regnier, EE			Postdispersal predation of giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida) seed in no-tillage corn	WEED SCIENCE												Giant ragweed seeds have high nutritional value, consisting of 47% crude protein and 38% crude fat, and may be an important food source for rodent and invertebrate populations in agricultural and early successional ecosystems. We investigated temporal patterns of postdispersal giant ragweed seed predation on the soil surface of a no-tillage cornfield as affected by involucre (seed dispersal unit) size and presence or absence of crop residue. Cage exclusion experiments indicated that rodents and invertebrates were the principal predators of giant ragweed seed, and total predation of involucres over a 12-mo period beginning in November was 88%. Rodents were the greatest predators of giant ragweed involucres during fall and winter, and cumulative predation by February I in treatments with rodent access ranged from 39 to 43%. In contrast, giant ragweed involucre predation by invertebrates occurred mainly from May I to November 1. When rodent access to involucres was prevented, total involucre predation by invertebrates over a 12-mo period ranged from 57 to 78%. Rodents showed an initial preference for large involucres (> 4.8-mm diameter), and invertebrates preferred small involucres (< 4.8-mm diameter). Involucres covered with corn plant residue underwent less predation by rodents from November to February than uncovered involucres, but residue cover had no effect on seed predation by invertebrates. In a laboratory feeding trial, the carabid Harpalus pensylvanicus preferred seed of smooth pigweed and yellow foxtail to giant ragweed seed, suggesting that giant ragweed seed is an incidental rather than a preferred food source for some carabids. Because giant ragweed exhibits relatively low fecundity and short seed bank persistence, results of this study suggest that postdispersal predation may directly reduce giant ragweed recruitment the next year by reducing new seed bank inputs. However, seed losses from predation alone may be insufficient to maintain giant ragweed populations below economic threshold levels in no-tillage cornfields.																	0043-1745					NOV-DEC	2003	51	6					955	964		10.1614/P2002-110							WOS:000186783600016						
J	Howlett, BE; Davidson, DW				Howlett, BE; Davidson, DW			Effects of seed availability, site conditions, and herbivory on pioneer recruitment after logging in Sabah, Malaysia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Woody pioneers invade disturbed tropical forests but can be patchily distributed. We investigated causes of this patchiness in selectively logged forests near the Danum Valley Field Centre (DVFC) in Sabah, Malaysia. In a recently logged forest, we compared seed sources and seedling establishment between two logging systems (conventional practices [CL] and reduced impact logging [RIL]) and between two soil disturbance classes (topsoil or subsoil exposed). Tree seeds were less abundant than shrub and treelet seeds, and seed banks contributed many more viable seeds than did seed rain. Topsoil removal reduced seed and seedling counts and growth rates of planted seedlings. More pioneer seedlings established on RIL than on CL plots, but survival of planted seedlings was lower under RIL, perhaps due to denser canopy cover. Broadcasting seeds increased seedling recruitment for five animal-dispersed pioneer trees but not for two wind-dispersed trees. Longer term survival and growth of pioneer seedlings were compared between logging gaps (canopy but not soil disturbed) and skid tracks (canopy and soil disturbed) at a second site. Relative numbers in gaps vs. skid tracks varied by species, but across species, seedlings grew 40% more rapidly in gaps than in skid tracks. Survivorship differed among species but not between habitats. The three most common species experienced >95% mortality within 42 months. At a third site, we compared effects of mammalian herbivores on pioneer seedling performances in exclosures and open (control) plots centered at the edge of recently abandoned skid tracks. Fewer pioneer seedlings established in skid tracks than in less-disturbed edges, but abundances did not differ between exclosure and control plots. Over 18 months, pioneers survived better and grew on average 44% taller with mammalian herbivores excluded. Pioneer colonization can be seed limited, but high seedling mortality, exacerbated by herbivore damage, can limit recruitment even when seeds are available. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Harwell, MC; Havens, KE				Harwell, MC; Havens, KE			Experimental studies on the recovery potential of submerged aquatic vegetation after flooding and desiccation in a large subtropical lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												In Lake Okeechobee (Florida), above average water depths from 1994 to early 2000 created poor light conditions on the lake bottom, leading to a widespread loss of submerged aquatic vegetation. In 2000, a controlled laboratory study quantified seedling emergence of Vallisneria americana (80 +/- 20 m(-2); mean +/- S.E.) and emergence of Chara spp. (504 +/- 21 m(-2); mean +/- S.E.) from sediments collected at a variety of sites confirming that a viable seed bank had persisted through years of poor light conditions. Considerable variance existed among the five sites from which seed banks were collected. Other species of submerged vegetation were hardly encountered. Additionally, a field transplant study using young V americana plants examined the survival potential of V americana in regions that had not supported submerged vegetation in the recent past. Although all transplants lost biomass, they produced new shoots and stolons in both sediment types. Transplants fared better in peat sediments than in the sandy sediments characteristic of areas where submerged vegetation was lost in the recent past. In summer 2001, an extensive drought exposed thousands of hectares of near-shore lake bottom, killing much of the submerged vegetation community. The potential for recovery of submerged vegetation from a desiccated and re-inundated seed/oospore bank was examined with cores taken from areas that had previously supported submerged vegetation. Extensive emergence of Chara spp., including a faster rate of emergence and a greater magnitude of emergence observed in desiccated cores (mean from three sites: 2728 m(-2); I S.E.: +/-192) relative to cores still inundated (mean from one site: 918 m(-2); I S.E.: +/-165), suggests that the drought may have led to an increased germination response for Chara. In contrast, there was little germination of vascular species except for a few seedlings of the native V americana and a few plants of Hydrilla verticillata. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Warwick, NWM; Brock, MA				Warwick, NWM; Brock, MA			Plant reproduction in temporary wetlands: the effects of seasonal timing, depth, and duration of flooding	AQUATIC BOTANY												In less predictable, drier climates depth, duration and season (month) of flooding influence not only germination and establishment of wetland plants but also completion of the life cycle through to sexual or asexual reproduction. A tank trial was carried out to investigate the effects of season (summer, autumn), duration (0-16 weeks) and depth of flooding (0-60 cm) and their interactions on sexual reproduction of a range of aquatic plant species. Seed bank material was collected from four New England wetlands in New South Wales, Australia. The majority of species germinating and establishing in the summer experiment were able to flower and set seed. In contrast, few of the plants growing during autumn had flowered after 16 weeks and biomass production was significantly reduced. For obligate submerged species flooding duration must be long enough to allow reproductive organs to form and for fertilisation and seed maturation to occur. Amphibious plants, in contrast, in particular those that respond morphologically to water presence or absence, had inflorescences emerging under a wide range of conditions, i.e. out of the water column when submerged, damp or spending only a portion of the life cycle submerged. Terrestrials established in autumn only in the damp treatments. A significant correlation was found for the dominant species from the amphibious and submerged groups between plant biomass and the number of reproductive units produced. Hence, diaspore production of wetland species is often a function of biomass production. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At Mount Panorama, higher levels of defoliation by the leaf-feeding beetle Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister and galling by the moth Epiblema strenuana Walker in 1996-97 coincided with an above average summer rainfall, but in the following three years with below average summer rainfall the defoliation and galling levels were significantly lower. Biocontrol had significant negative impact on the weed only in 1996-97 with no major impact in the following three years. At Plain Creek, galling by E. strenuana was evident in all the four years, but varied significantly between years due to non-synchrony between P. hysterophorus germination and E. strenuana emergence. At Plain Creek biocontrol had limited impact on the weed in 1996-97 and 1997-98, with no significant impact in the following two years. Over the 4-year period, defoliation and galling resulted in 70% reduction in the soil seed bank at Mount Panorama, but the reduction in the soil seed bank at Plain Creek due to galling was not significant. Effectiveness of Z. bicolorata and E. strenuana was dependent on weather conditions and as a result had only limited impact on the weed in three out of four years.

Two complementary aspects of seed biology were examined: germination and seed bank dynamics. Achenes were tested for changes in germinability over time using various light, temperature, and moisture treatments. Soil cores were collected over time to monitor changes in achene density. Both plumed and nonplumed achenes exhibited photo reversible responses to red and far-red light. White and red light enhanced germination above that occurring in darkness. Achenes showed seasonal changes in germinability, which were characteristic of conditional dormancy. Exposure of achenes to field conditions during summer alleviated primary dormancy, allowing germination to occur at higher temperatures and lower substrate moisture. Nonplumed achenes collected in winter showed reduced germinability at or above moderate temperatures under both single and multiple light exposures. Imbibition and moderately low temperatures with subsequent drying induced secondary conditional dormancy in some achenes. Plumed achenes dominated the soil seed bank before the rainy season, then declined rapidly following rain. Nonplumed achenes peaked after rains began, then declined. Although nearly all achenes were depleted after 4 years, both types remained, showing annual cycles of high and low germinability in autumn and late spring, respectively.																	0008-4026					OCT	2003	81	10					993	1007		10.1139/B03-093							WOS:000186777300001						
J	Keeley, JE; Lubin, D; Fotheringham, CJ				Keeley, JE; Lubin, D; Fotheringham, CJ			Fire and grazing impacts on plant diversity and alien plant invasions in the southern Sierra Nevada	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in response to disturbance were examined along an elevational gradient in blue oak savanna, chaparral, and coniferous forests. Total species richness, alien species richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to 1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover increased with increasing native species richness in all communities. This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives and aliens. Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites, livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion. In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the shrublands return to their former closed-canopy condition determine alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance in favor of alien invasion. In the higher-elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a function of fire severity and time since fire. High-intensity fires create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low-severity burns, and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about one-third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a challenge for fire restoration of these forests.																	1051-0761					OCT	2003	13	5					1355	1374		10.1890/02-5002							WOS:000186599400015						
J	Conte, R; Nodari, RO; Vencovsky, R; dos Reis, MS				Conte, R; Nodari, RO; Vencovsky, R; dos Reis, MS			Genetic diversity and recruitment of the tropical palm, Euterpe edulis Mart., in a natural population from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest	HEREDITY												The genetic diversity and recruitment of plants of heart-of-palm tree (Euterpe edulis Mart.) were investigated in a natural population located in Southern Brazil. Five categories of plants, from seedlings to adults, were analysed using 16 allozymic loci. The results showed an average population level of genetic diversity (H-e = 0.278) greater than the average of plant species already studied. The recruitment process of E. edulis is related to its genetic characteristics. A significant increase in the heterozygote frequency towards the adult stages was observed at three loci (Pgdh-2, G6pdh-1 and Mdh-1). This suggests the possible action of natural selection in promoting such heterozygote increase. In the same way, a linear increase in allele frequencies was observed at four loci (Prx-3, Prx-4, Pgdh-2 and G6pdh-1), indicating that recruitment is also related to a greater survival of individuals that are carriers of certain alleles. The maintenance of high diversity levels, as well as the increase in the heterozygote frequency, are positive aspects for in situ conservation. Furthermore, an increase in heterozygote frequency is favourable to the management of the species, since the maintenance of a stock of reproductive individuals with high heterozygosity levels favours the maintenance of the population dynamic and structure.

J	Meli, P				Meli, P			Tropical forest restoration. twenty years of academic research	INTERCIENCIA												Ecological restoration is a young discipline that focuses upon the biotic and abiotic rehabilitation of natural systems in order to restore its structure and functional properties. The study of ecological restoration in tropical forests has concentrated on identifying the barriers that limit recovery, with the aim of accelerating secondary succession. These barriers include: 1) lack of dispersal or propagules in the seed bank, 2) low germination rates, and 3) low rates of seedling recruitment due to the negative effects of diseases, predation and competition, or adverse physical conditions. Based on the analysis of literature from the last 20 years on ecological restoration in tropical forests, this work reviews the state of the art and perspectives in this area of research. The analysis indicated that 64% of the studies have been conducted in tropical rain forests, that 55% of them are mainly descriptive, and that, the experimental studies tend to evaluate only one or two limiting barriers, rather than concentrating on a long term integrative approach. Nevertheless, there is a promising future for restoration ecology; the experimental approach has grown exponentially and the social component is being included in the projects. Ecological restoration is consolidating itself as an integrative discipline, keeping in mind all the necessary aspects (ecological, social, economic) to achieve the recovery and conservation of the natural systems.				, 0000-0001-5390-7552/G-1872-2018	, 0000-0001-5390-7552/0000-0001-5390-7552												0378-1844					OCT	2003	28	10					581	+									WOS:000186289200004

Seed bank density was relatively high (16,214 seed/m(2)) with a very clumped spatial distribution. Landform and microslope were the best predictors for seed density, indicating that density can be at least partly interpreted as a result of the physical processes regulating secondary dispersal. A high number of species appeared in the seed bank (68) being most of them annual gypsophytes. A relevant feature is that three widely distributed perennial gypsophytes occurred among the 10 more abundant species (Helianthemum squamatum, Lepidium subulatum and Sedum gypsicola). Presence of perennial among the most frequent species of the seed bank is not a shared characteristic with other and and semiarid systems. CCA model suggested that vegetation bands, microslope and vegetation perennial cover were factors shaping the composition of the seed bank. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights. reserved.

In one treatment, all individuals of each species were genetically unique. The second contained four randomly selected genotypes of each species. In the third, there was no genetic diversity in any of the species but each community contained a unique combination of genotypes. 3 Over a period of 5 years the communities were allowed to develop in microcosms containing natural rendzina soil and exposed to a standardized regime of simulated grazing and trampling. The treatments were maintained by the removal of flowers, immature seed-heads and seedlings originating from the seed-bank and seed rain. Point quadrat surveys were used to monitor changes in species composition and diversity in the three experimental treatments. 4 During the experiment a distinction rapidly developed between five canopy dominants and five subordinates, a process that caused the vegetation structure to closely resemble that occurring at Cressbrookdale. 5 A gradual loss of species diversity occurred in all three treatments but by the end of the fifth growing season species diversity was higher in the most genetically diverse communities. 6 Ordination of the 36 communities at intervals over a 5-year period revealed a gradual convergence in the species composition of the 4-genotype and 16-genotype communities and this effect was more strongly developed in the latter. A comparable process was not observed in the 1-genotype communities, suggesting that interaction between particular genotypes of different species in local neighbourhoods may be an essential part of the mechanism that determines the predictable composition of a mature pasture community. 7 It is concluded that, under the conditions of this experiment, genetic diversity within component species reduced the rate at which species diversity declined. The relative importance in this effect of factors such as greater disease resistance and moderated competitive interactions remains uncertain.																	0022-0477					OCT	2003	91	5					721	730		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00804.x							WOS:000185446200002						
J	Pearson, TRH; Burslem, DFRP; Goeriz, RE; Dalling, JW				Pearson, TRH; Burslem, DFRP; Goeriz, RE; Dalling, JW			Interactions of gap size and herbivory on establishment, growth and survival of three species of neotropical pioneer trees	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The difference in gap size requirements observed for neotropical pioneer species is a classic example of habitat partitioning among tropical tree species. Previous research has shown that the three species Miconia argentea, Cecropia insignis and Trema micrantha differ in the minimum gap size that they occupy as adult plants in semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama. Here we test whether these differences result from variation in seed germination and seedling establishment requirements, or from differences in susceptibility to herbivores. 2 We planted seeds of Miconia argentea and Trema micrantha into artificially created small (25 m(2)), medium ( 64 m(2)) and large (225 m(2)) gaps in secondary forest, and transplanted seedlings of all three species into small and large gaps inside and outside mesh cages that excluded invertebrate herbivores. 3 Miconia seedlings emerged and established successfully across a broad range of gap sizes, and transplanted seedlings grew slowly but survived well in all gap sizes. By contrast, emergence and survival of Trema seedlings occurred only in the large gaps and transplants died in small gaps. Survival of Cecropia seedlings was intermediate between Trema and Miconia in the small gaps and growth was greater than either species in the large gaps. 4 Herbivore exclosures reduced foliar herbivory on all three species. The median lifespan of Trema seedlings in small gaps was reduced when the seedlings were exposed to herbivores, but survival of the other species was not affected by the exclosure treatment in either gap size. The growth of Miconia seedlings was lower outside exclosures in both gap sizes. 5 Differences in germination and establishment could generate the contrasting gap size distributions observed between Miconia and Trema, but they are partially offset by measured differences in seed bank density. However, patterns of seedling growth and survival reinforce differences among species at the establishment phase and provide a mechanism for the observed differences in gap size distribution at the sapling stage. 'Cross-overs' in species growth rates result in specialization to different environments and reduce their survival in unfavourable conditions. We found no evidence for a definitive influence of herbivory as a mechanism driving differences in gap size distribution among species.

The soil seed bank was estimated by the germination technique. In each community patch, diversity, woody species cover and herbaceous species frequency was measured. Three biodiversity components - species richness, endemism and taxonomic singularity - were considered in the vegetation and the seed bank. Forest patches had a soil seed bank of ca. 11200-14 100 seed.m(-2) and their composition had low resemblance to (epigeal) vegetation. The grassland patch had a more dense seed bank (ca. 31800 seed.m(-2)) and a higher index of similarity with vegetation, compared with the forests nearby. The complete forest diversity was 71-78 species on 0.1 ha, including 12-15 species found only in the seed bank; the grassland species richness was higher (113 species on 0.1 ha). We discuss the role of soil seed banks in the vegetation dynamics and in the complete plant biodiversity of the mosaic landscape studied.

(Boraginaceae), an endangered plant of the Canary Islands, Spain	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Blue bugloss (Echium acanthocarpum Svent.) is an endangered vascular plant endemic to La Gomera, Canary Islands, Spain. Field observations suggest that establishment of this species may be limited by low seed dispersal, inhibition of germination by parent plants, and intraspecific competition among seedlings. We studied seed germination of E. acanthocarpum in the laboratory to characterize seed dormancy, and to determine the effects of heat, soil source, and E. acanthocarpum leaf litter on seed germination. Seed coats of E. acanthocarpum are permeable to water; imbibition occurred without mechanical scarification. Light, heat treatment, gibberellic acid, and hydration did not affect seed germination, but exposure to high temperatures (17 degreesC - 10 h in dark / 20 degreesC - 14 h in light) enhanced germination. Leaf litter significantly lowered seed germination (mean = 26.1 +/- 3.6 SD) compared to controls (mean = 68.3% +/- 10.9 SD). We conclude that Echium acanthocarpum seeds have physiological, mechanical, and chemical dormancy. Dormancy should facilitate establishment of soil seed banks, but recruitment may be limited to sporadic events, such as fire, that stimulate germination.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				OCT	2003	23	4					362	367									WOS:000227290800009

We tested the hypothesis that increasing the initial plant species diversity enhances the biomass production and consequently stimulates soil microbial biomass and abundance of soil invertebrates. We performed five identical field experiments on abandoned arable land in five European countries (CZ, NL, SE, SP and UK) which allowed us to test our hypothesis in a range of climate, soil and other environmental factors that varied between the experimental sites. The initial plant diversity was altered by sowing seed mixtures of mid-successional grassland species with two or five grass species, one or five legumes and one or five forbs. The results of low and high sown diversity treatments were compared with plots that were naturally colonized by species present in the seed bank. In three out of the five field sites, there was no correlation between plant species number and plant biomass production, one site had a positive and the other a negative relation. Treatments with a high diversity seed mixture had a higher biomass than the naturally colonized plots. However, there was no significant difference between high and low sown diversity plots at four out of five sites. The three-year study did not give any evidence of a general bottom-up effect from increased plant biomass on biomass of bacteria, saprophytic fungi or abundance of microarthropods. The biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal was negatively related to plant biomass. The abundance of nematodes increased after abandonment and was related to plant biomass at four sites. Our results support the hypothesis that plant species diversity may have idiosyncratic effects on soil communities, even though studies on a longer term could reveal time lags in the response to changes in composition and biomass production of plant communities.

J	Pico, FX; Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Menges, ES; Lopez-Barrera, F				Pico, FX; Quintana-Ascencio, PF; Menges, ES; Lopez-Barrera, F			Recruitment rates exhibit high elasticity and high temporal variation in populations of a short-lived perennial herb	OIKOS												Empirical studies for different life histories have shown an inverse relationship between elasticity (i.e. the proportional contribution to population growth rate) and temporal variation in vital rates. It is accepted that this relationship indicates the effect of selective pressures in reducing variation in those life-history traits with a major impact on fitness. In this paper, we sought to determine whether changes in environmental conditions affect the relationship between elasticity of vital rates and their temporal variation, and whether vital rates with simultaneously large elasticity and temporal variation might represent a characteristic life-history strategy. We used demographic data on 13 populations of the short-lived Hypericum cumulicola over 5-6 years, in three time-since-fire classes. For each population of each time-since-fire, we computed the mean matrix over years and its respective elasticity matrix, and the coefficients of variation in matrix entries over study years as an estimate of temporal variability. We found that mean elasticity negatively significantly correlated with temporal variation in vital rates in populations (overall eight out of 13) included in each time-since-fire. However, seedling recruitment exhibited both high elasticity and high temporal variation in almost all study populations. These results indicated that (1) the general relationship between elasticity and temporal variation in vital rates was not modified by environmental changes due to time-since-fire, and (2) high elasticity and high temporal variation in seedling recruitment in H. cumulicola is a particular trait of the species' life history. After seed survival in the soil seed bank, seedling recruitment represents the most important life-history trait influencing H. cumulicola population growth rate (and fitness). The high temporal variability in seedling recruitment suggests that this trait is determined by environmental cues, leading to an increase in population size and subsequent replenishment of the seed bank in favorable years.

J	Conner, WH; Inabinette, LW				Conner, WH; Inabinette, LW			Tree growth in three South Carolina (USA) swamps., after Hurricane Hugo: 1991-2001	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												While coastal forested wetlands of the southern United States have developed with hurricanes as normal aperiodic events and suffer little damage or mortality due to wind, they can be heavily impacted by saltwater storm surges. Three wetland stands (Boardwalk, Crabhaul; and Marsh Road) were studied on Hobcaw Barony, SC, USA, from 1991 to 2001 to. determine the. recovery of trees following,Hurricane Hugo. Five 0.05 ha plots were established during the spring and summer of, 1990 in each stand, and diameter measurements were made annually. In terms of the number of trees, basal area, and importance value, baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and swamp blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) were the most important tree species in the Boardwalk and Marsh Road sites, while baldcypress, water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and swamp blackgum were most important in the Crabhaul site. The influx of saltwater from the storm surge killed all individuals of five species (sweetgum (Liquidambar slyraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), redbay (Persea borbonia), and waxmyrtle (Myrica cerifera)) in the Boardwalk site, as well as three species (sweetgum, red maple, and laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia)) in the Marsh Road site. Of the remaining trees in both of these sites, baldcypress was the most impacted by saltwater, and mortality continued for several years after the hurricane. No saltwater damage occurred in the Crabhaul site. Mean annual growth rate of baldcypress was greater than other species in all three sites. Diameter change of baldcypress in the Boardwalk site averaged 1.80 +/- 0.77 mm per year (+/-1S.D.), followed by swamp blackgum at 0.85 +/- 0.39 mm per year and water tupelo at 0.46 +/- 0.84 mm per year. In the Crabhaul site, average growth of baldcypress was 2.00 +/- 0.52 mm per year, followed by water tupelo at 1.35 +/- 0:62 mm per year and swamp blackgum at 0.51 +/- 0.59 mm per year. Baldcypress growth was 2.12 +/- 1.2 mm per year in the Marsh Road site, while only 0.60 +/- 0.84 mm per year and 0.55 +/- 0.45 mm per year growth occurred for. water tupelo and swamp blackgum, respectively. The loss of a majority of the mature trees in the Boardwalk and Marsh Road sites, combined with the lack of a viable seed bank and the loss of most of the shrub layer, means that it will take years before these stands fully recover. The Crabhaul site, on the other hand, had less than 3% mortaliiy from the hurricane, and canopy recovery was complete after only one growing season. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

(Oligochaeta, Glossoscolecidae) on the soil seed banks was investigated in a Colombian savanna and two intensive pastures. Germination and washing-sieving methods were used to compare seed density, diversity, species composition and germination rates in earthworm casts and the surrounding soil. Although large amounts of seeds were present in casts (163.65, 156.84 and 60.36 seeds per 100 g of dry casts in the savanna, the old and young pastures, respectively), germination rates were 3-40 times lower than in the surrounding soil. likely due to degradation during the gut transit. The number of viable seeds present in casts was 0.40, 7.46 and 1.99 seeds per 100 g of dry casts in the savanna, the old and young pastures, respectively. Species composition of viable seeds was quite different in casts compared to soil. probably because of selective seed ingestion by earthworms. Viable seeds deposited in surface casts each year represented 0.65%. 16.17%, and 8.24% of the total viable seed bank of the soil, in the savanna, the old and young pastures, respectively. In the savanna and the old pasture, species composition in casts was more similar to the vegetation than species composition in the soil was. This may indicate that ingested seeds that survive gut transit have a greater chance to germinate than those of the soil seed bank, providing vegetation cover is sufficiently opened to enable germination processes. Thus, casts may be considered as a regeneration niche for plant species, and earthworm activity a factor that enhances. in some cases, the expression of the soil seed bank in the standing vegetation.

They produce large quantities of seed and may have large soil-stored seed banks. In Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, the number of adult Acacia nilotica trees per hectare far exceed that of A. karroo adults. The relative dominance is reversed in the juvenile stage with A. karroo outnumbering A. nilotica threefold outside closed woodlands. Acacia karroo trees were smaller than A. nilotica trees on average, but produced more seeds for a given basal diameter size class. Acacia karroo showed less bruchid infestation than A. nilotica at all stages of pod development. Unlike A. nilotica, a proportion of A. karroo seeds was able to germinate after bruchid attack. We detected no difference between the two species in the soil-stored seed bank or in the viability of seeds found in the seed bank.

J	Boedeltje, G; Bakker, JP; ter Heerdt, GNJ				Boedeltje, G; Bakker, JP; ter Heerdt, GNJ			Potential role of propagule banks in the development of aquatic vegetation in backwaters along navigation canals	AQUATIC BOTANY												The diversity and abundance of plant species in propagule banks of backwaters along two navigation canals in The Netherlands were studied in order to assess the relationship with the standing vegetation and the potential role of propagule banks in the establishment of (submerged) aquatic vegetation. At five sites, varying in vegetation composition and age, 180 samples were collected: 100 from surface sediment and 80 from the interface between original soil and sediment (=subsediment). In total, 113 species emerged of which Juncus spp. and Lythrum salicaria L. were the most abundant. Seven submerged species occurred at low densities. On average, there were 10.8-17.8 species l(-1) in the surface sediment, and 8.5-10.2 l(-1) in the subsediment. The mean number of propagules in samples ranged from fewer than 200 l(-1) in 3-year-old to over 3000 l(-1) in 10-year-old sites. There was little correspondence between propagule bank and standing vegetation. Vegetation establishment 2 months after sediment removal in six plots revealed 10 species; submerged species, however, hardly occurred. It is concluded that propagule banks cannot play a significant role in the (re-)establishment of diverse submerged aquatic vegetation along these canals. After creation of bare sites as a result of cutting and dredging in narrow zones along the water line, however, propagule banks may contribute to the development of species-rich emergent vegetation.

Statistically significant differences were found in germination across marsh zones for both species in the field. However, germination percentages for small seeds of A. prostrata and S. europaea were above 50% and 75%, respectively, across all zones for seeds placed on the surface. For large seeds of each species placed on the surface, germination was above 90% across all zones. Small seeds for both species had primary dormancy, a light requirement for germination, and appeared to exhibit dormancy cycling. Large seeds of A. prostrata were nondormant from December through March, whereas large seeds of S. europaea were nondormant when produced. Persistent seed banks were most likely to be formed from small seeds of both species. Seeds typically germinate in the spring when salinity across the marsh is sufficiently low for seeds to germinate in all zones, indicating that the germination stage of development does not effect the spatial distribution of A. prostrata or S. europaea on the marsh.																	0008-4026					SEP	2003	81	9					918	926		10.1139/B03-086							WOS:000186049300003

These species grow and reproduce under conditions of disturbance; they are occasionally browsed by goats and used for firewood. The effect of temperature on germination, the longevity of the seeds in the field, and the germination potential of seeds parasitized by insects of the family Bruchidae were tested. It was found that the seeds require scarification to germination. The optimum temperature for seed germination of M. similis, M. lacerata, and M. depauperata was between 20degreesC and 35degreesC and for M. texana var. texana between 30degreesC and 35degreesC. The species germinated just as well beneath the canopy as in open areas in the field. The seeds of each species are parasitized by bruchids of the genus Acanthocelides spp., and seed infestation necessarily had a detrimental effect. The seeds in the seed bank lose their longevity at a rate of 20-73% per year. As with other legumes, Mimosa seeds have a tough seed coat, which influences germination, longevity, and susceptibility to predation by bruchids. The results form this study contribute to an understanding of the phases of germination and the longevity of the seeds of Mimosa in the seed bank in and and semi-arid communities.

Invasion by leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is a serious threat to western prairie fringed orchid habitat. The objectives of this study were to develop a herbicide treatment to control leafy spurge while sustaining western prairie fringed orchid populations and to evaluate the soil seedbank composition of leafy spurge-infested sites to guide long-term management strategies. Quinclorac (3,7-dichloro-8-quinolinecarboxylic acid), imazapic {(+/-)-2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-1H-imidazol-2=yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid}, and glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] plus 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid) were applied in the fall for 2 consecutive years, and changes in leafy spurge cover, density, yield, and herbaceous yield were assessed. In a separate study, quinclorac, imazapic, and glyphosate plus 2,4-D were each fall-applied to 12 western prairie fringed orchids and assessed for reoccurrence and density of orchids 1-year after treatment. Quinclorac and imazapic, but not glyphosate plus 2,4-D, reduced leafy spurge cover, density, and yield without causing deleterious effects to associated native herbaceous cover and yields. Western prairie fringed orchid reoccurrence and density were unaffected by any herbicide 1 year after treatment. Soil cores were removed in spring and fall following the first year herbicide treatment, washed and placed in trays. Seedlings were allowed to germinate for 16 weeks in the greenhouse. Over 50 plant species were identified in the soil seedbank, of which approximately 60% were early seral species indicative of disturbance. Given the dominance of leafy spurge in the seed bank, a long-term management program to control this noxious species is warranted. Although these results are promising, longer-term studies need be conducted to ensure that repeated herbicide treatments do not harm the western prairie fringed orchid.																	0022-409X					SEP	2003	56	5					466	473		10.2307/4003838							WOS:000185463200010

We hypothesized that in irrigation furrows, PAM prevents loss of weed seed and might affect weed establishment and management practices. We grew corn (Zea mays L.) in plots without herbicides, or that were treated with either Eradicane((R)) (EPTC + dichlormid) or Dual((R)) II (S-Metolachlor) and irrigated in furrows that had either no PAM, or that were treated either with 10 g m(-3) (10 kg ML-1 or 10 ppm) dissolved PAM during water advance, or with PAM applied as a powder patch at the furrow head. As in previous studies, erosion was greatly reduced with PAM and infiltration was increased. PAM use also reduced runoff loss of weed seeds (barnyardgrass, kochia, redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, and hairy nightshade) 62% to 90%. Interactions of herbicide treatments and PAM on erosion, infiltration, and weed seed loss were related to the mulching effect of weed vegetation. PAM is an effective and environmentally safe means of reducing weed seed distribution in furrow irrigation water while simultaneously reducing erosion and increasing infiltration in weed-free crop production.																	0022-4561					SEP-OCT	2003	58	5					319	326									WOS:000186726700017						
J	Gordon, E; van der Valk, AG				Gordon, E; van der Valk, AG			Secondary seed dispersal in Montrichardia arborescens (L.) schott dominated wetlands in laguna grande, Venezuela	PLANT ECOLOGY												Laguna Grande, Monagas State, Venezuela, is a shallow, V-shaped lake created by the confluence of two rivers. Montrichardia arborescens ( L.) Schott. dominated wetlands cover most of the north and south arms and the littoral zone of the main body of the lake. The vegetation and seed banks of Montrichardia wetland sites were sampled in the north arm, south arm and main body five times from the end of the dry season in 1991 to beginning of the rainy season in 1992. The composition of the vegetation was similar and changed very little at all three sites during the course of the study. These wetlands had 53 species. Besides M. arborescens, other common species were Hamelia patens Jacq., Mikania cordifolia ( L.) Wild., Sarcostemma clausum ( Jacq.) Roem. & Schult., and Vitis caribaea L. In both the vegetation and seed banks, species richness was highest during the dry season. Altogether, the seed banks contained the seeds of 61 species of which 35 were also found in the vegetation. Seeds of three tree species were found in the seed banks that did not grow anywhere in the lake. In the seed bank, seeds of Cyperus odoratus L., Eleocharis interstincta ( Vahl.) R& S, Ludwigia hyssopifolia ( G. Don.) Excell, L. lithospermifolia (Mich.) Hara, Polygonum acuminatum H. B. K., and Sacciolepis striata ( L.) Nash were the most abundant. Mean total seed density over the entire study was 6,500, 3,800, and 6,000 seeds/m(2) in the north arm, south arm, and main basin, respectively. Seed production and dispersal occur primarily during the dry season, and the highest seed densities at all sites were found in the dry season when there was no or little standing water. The lowest seed densities at all sites were found during the rainy season during which seed densities declined over 80% at the north and south arm sites. In the main body of the lake, however, seed densities during the rainy season, although lower than during the dry season, actually increased significantly from 3,600 seeds/m(2) in August 1991 to 6,000 seeds/m(2) in October 1991. A significant decrease in seed density in either the north or south arms or both and a significant increase in the main body site during the rainy season occurred for 5 of the 8 species whose seeds were the most abundant, for all life-form guilds, except hydrophytes and for the entire seed bank. Secondary dispersal by water currents during the rainy season appears to be transporting seeds from the north and south arms into the seed bank of the main body of the lake.																	1385-0237					SEP	2003	168	2					177	190		10.1023/A:1024421324294							WOS:000183836200001						
J	Nicol, JM; Ganf, GG; Pelton, GA				Nicol, JM; Ganf, GG; Pelton, GA			Seed banks of a southern Australian wetland: the influence of water regime on the final floristic composition	PLANT ECOLOGY												The sediments of a southern Australian wetland complex were investigated to determine the germinable seed bank. The number of seeds ranged from 22,000 to 78,000 m(-2). Non-metric multi dimensional scaling (NMS) ordination based upon species composition separated the four basins but each contained the representatives of the major functional groups: terrestrial, amphibious and submerged. To test the influence of water regime on the final floristic composition derived from these seed banks, sediments were positioned at three elevations ( 0, 30 and 80 cm) and subjected to three hydrologic regimes ( static water level, and draw down rates of 2.5 and 7 cm week(-1)). Species compositions were analysed after 98 days via ordination. Despite significant differences in the initial seed bank composition the final floristic compositions were correlated with the water regime and independent of the initial seed bank composition. Species groups were segregated on a basis of whether sediments were continuously exposed to the atmosphere, the rate of draw down and the water depth. Moist sediments were dominated by species belonging to all the main functional groups. Sediments subject to rapid drying were dominated by terrestrial species whereas sediments that were flooded for the majority of the time were dominated by submerged species.																	1385-0237					SEP	2003	168	2					191	205		10.1023/A:1024430919811							WOS:000183836200002						
J	Borchert, M; Johnson, M; Schreiner, DS; Wall, SBV				Borchert, M; Johnson, M; Schreiner, DS; Wall, SBV			Early postfire seed dispersal, seedling establishment and seedling mortality of Pinus coulteri (D. Don) in central coastal California, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seedling recruitment in many highly serotinous populations of Pinus coulteri on California's central coast depends almost entirely on periodic, stand-replacing fire. Compared to serotinous pines of the Mediterranean Basin, little detailed information is available on the postfire demography of California closed-cone pines, including P. coulteri. In September 1996 a wildfire burned the 760-ha American Canyon Research Natural Area ( RNA). Using aerial photography, we mapped burn severity of P. coulteri-chaparral woodlands and forests within the RNA. From May to September of 1997, we also quantified seedling establishment and mortality in relation to biophysical site characteristics including fire severity. Seventy-six percent of P. coulteri forests and woodlands experienced high-severity burns, 9% moderate-severity burns, and 15% low-severity or unburned. Of the 53 plots used for seedling counts, 70% were high-severity, 26% moderate-severity, and 4% low-severity. Seedling densities 13 months postfire were low (0.21 m(-2)), but seedling mortality also was low (8.4%). Aerial seed bank size increased from north-facing to south-facing slopes and from high-severity to low-severity burns. Seedling recruitment was unrelated to burn severity and increased with the size of the canopy seed bank ( cone density). Many seedlings established from rodent seed caches; 23% of the seedlings established in clumps from seeds cached by Dipodomys agilis, Chaetodipus californicus and Peromyscus maniculatus. Pinus coulteri seeds have low potential for dispersal by wind, but secondary dispersal by rodents moves seeds away from source trees and into neighboring chaparral. We discuss the potential importance of rodent seed caching to postfire demography of California and Mediterranean serotinous pines.																	1385-0237					SEP	2003	168	2					207	220		10.1023/A:1024447811238							WOS:000183836200003						
J	Bender, MH; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC				Bender, MH; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC			Seed germination ecology of Polymnia canadensis (Asteraceae), a monocarpic species of the North American Temperate Deciduous Forest	PLANT ECOLOGY												The seed germination of Polymnia canadensis was studied in relation to its wide variation in life history and its ecology as a mostly facultative biennial, a life cycle type that is rare in stable forest habitats in eastern North America. The seed dormancy and germination characteristics of P. canadensis were like some other herbaceous woodland species of diverse life cycle types. That is, its seeds have physiological dormancy, and they ( 1) germinated to higher percentages after cold stratification, ( 2) germinated better in light than in darkness and ( 3) formed a persistent soil seed bank. Since its seed dormancy and germination characteristics are not uncommon and are not particularly associated with any one life cycle type in woodlands, those properties do not contribute to the rarity of its life cycle type in deciduous forests. These properties are also found in many facultative biennials of open, disturbed habitats and in other Asteraceae of various life cycle types. In addition, the germination phenology of P. canadensis differed between mesic and dry field sites in central Kentucky. At the dry sites, most of the yearly germination occurred in fall, while at the mesic sites most germination occurred in the spring due to being inhibited during fall. A reciprocal seed transplant experiment conducted in two different years demonstrated that the cause of this difference was environmental and that there was no source x site interaction; i.e., no difference between sources in phenotypic plasticity for germination phenology. Absence of genetic effects was also shown by no consistent pattern in the few differences between seed sources in seed incubation laboratory experiments and in a germination phenology experiment in glasshouse flats. Exposure of seeds to a high ratio of far-red/red light prior to or during incubation did not inhibit germination. Neither did changes in leaf litter thickness qualitatively alter germination phenology in field quadrats or in glasshouse flats. Thus, germination in fall at mesic sites was inhibited by other unknown factor(s), perhaps interacting with the effects of closed tree canopy and/or thick leaf litter.																	1385-0237					SEP	2003	168	2					221	253		10.1023/A:1024437510330							WOS:000183836200004						
J	Miller, GR; Cummins, RP				Miller, GR; Cummins, RP			Soil seed banks of woodland, heathland, grassland, mire and montane communities, Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland	PLANT ECOLOGY												The size and species composition of soil seed banks were assessed at 111 altitudinally diverse sites in the Cairngorm Mountains. Mean densities of germinable seeds varied from 83 000 m(-2) in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) woodland at 230 - 490 m to 200 m(-2) in moss (Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid.) heath at 1000 - 1120 m. Seed banks were dominated by Calluna vulgaris ( L.) Hull, not only wherever it was prominent in the vegetation, but also at some sites with less than 5% cover of parent plants in the ground vegetation. Many species conspicuous in the vegetation were under-represented in or absent from the seed bank and surface vegetation generally was more species rich than was the underlying seed bank, especially in high montane communities. Multiple regression was used to examine the relationship between the density of buried Calluna seeds and the abundance of parent plants in the vegetation, site altitude and the organic matter content of the soil. The model fitted to woodland communities accounted for 95% of the variation in seed density. The heathland model was less predictive but still explained 52% of the variation in seed bank size. In mire communities there was no relationship, collective or individual, between buried seed density and the measured environmental variables, possibly due to variations in the duration and frequency of waterlogging at these sites. The potential role of seed banks for initiating the recolonisation of disturbed ground is discussed. Densities of buried seeds at most Calluna-dominant sites were probably sufficient to generate successful recolonisation but the prospects for recovery were poor at other sites, particularly in graminaceous communities at 800 m or higher.																	1385-0237					SEP	2003	168	2					255	266		10.1023/A:1024464028195							WOS:000183836200005						
J	Gasque, M; Garcia-Fayos, P				Gasque, M; Garcia-Fayos, P			Seed dormancy and longevity in Stipa tenacissima L. (Poaceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												In the present paper we studied the life history traits related to seed germination of Stipa tenacissima, a key species in semiarid environments of western Mediterranean areas. S. tenacissima is a perennial tussock grass, which has traditionally been considered to expand mainly by vegetative propagation with little or no sexual reproduction. We analysed seed longevity as well as the type of seed dormancy and the role of the seed covers from seeds collected from different populations in SE Spain. We also studied the variation in seed germinability among populations, individuals, and years and the ability of seeds of S. tenacissima to form soil seed banks. There was significant variation in seed germination among individuals, populations and years. Lemma and palea were the main factor controlling these differences since their removal promoted higher and faster germination and eliminated the differences in germination parameters among populations. However, the control of dormancy by lemma and palea was independent of their weight, suggesting that their chemical nature plays a more important role than does size in controlling seed germination. Mechanical scarification treatments ( via abrasion with sand) did not affect seed germination. The decay in seed germinability two years after seed collection and the low density of viable seeds in soils one year after seed dispersal indicated that S. tenacissima forms transient soil seed banks.

J	Capon, SJ				Capon, SJ			Plant community responses to wetting and drying in a large arid floodplain	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					Joint Meeting on Environmental Flows for River Systems/4th International Ecohydraulics Symposium	MAR, 2002	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA					The flow regimes of large and river catchments are amongst the most variable in the world. Plant communities which inhabit and floodplains typically exhibit high spatial heterogeneity and are temporally dynamic in response to changing flow conditions. It has been suggested that and floodplain ecosystems, adapted as they are to variability, will be relatively resilient to anthropogenic alterations to flow. This paper argues that floodplain plant communities in and catchments, as in temperate and tropical regions, are primarily structured by flow regimes despite their inherent unpredictability. Consequently, changes to flood pulses through water extraction can be expected to result in changes in vegetation composition and structure which in turn may have a dramatic effect on wider ecosystem functioning. Results are presented from an ongoing study of the Cooper Creek floodplain in central Australia which illustrate the relationships between plant community dynamics and variable flood pulses. These results indicate that alterations to flow may result in a shift in community structure and an eventual loss of bio-diversity. It is essential, therefore, that water resource managers in and regions consider the requirements of floodplain plant communities when allocating environmental flows.

J	Burke, A				Burke, A			Practical measures in arid land restoration after mining - a review for the southern Namib	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												THE PRINCIPLE OF ECOLOGICAL RESTORAtion offers opportunities to re-vegetate disturbed areas cost-effectively after mining. The southern Namib is the northern tip of one the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots and is under pressure from mining and exploration activities. This paper provides a review of methods available for and land restoration and assesses their applicability in the context of southern Namib restoration ecology. The techniques available are discussed under the headings: (a) provision of suitable landform and substrate and (b) facilitating natural processes. Landscaping man-made landforms to match their surroundings, the provision of rough surfaces and small water catchments as well as applying fresh topsoil are the main aspects to be considered. Growth-impeding soil properties such as toxicity, and acidic, saline and sodic conditions will require treatment to ensure natural plant re-establishment is feasible or replanting areas is successful. Seeding and relocating native plants are feasible options to accelerate natural plant succession that merit further development in the southern Namib. Apart from the involvement of mining and exploration companies, the use of these techniques will require good planning, a small team of dedicated staff, limited training and some very basic facilities to become a reality.																	0038-2353					SEP-OCT	2003	99	9-10					413	417									WOS:000188538100005						
J	Colbach, N; Durr, C				Colbach, N; Durr, C			Effects of seed production and storage conditions on blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides) germination and shoot elongation	WEED SCIENCE												Blackgrass is a common winter annual grass weed in autumn-sown crop rotations in Atlantic European countries. Control with a minimum amount of herbicides in integrated cropping systems would be facilitated by modeling the effect of cropping systems on its demography. To develop the submodel relating weed seed bank to emerged seedlings, laboratory experiments were conducted to analyze and quantify seed germination and shoot elongation. These processes were studied as a function of environmental conditions during seed production (nitrogen availability, water deficit, plant density, and crop) and of seed characteristics (seed weight, harvest date, storage length, and dry-stored/soil-buried). Nonlinear equations relating germination and shoot elongation to time calculated as cumulated degree-days were fitted to the observed germination and shoot elongation data. These were used to estimate parameters for germination proportion and rate, as well as final shoot length and elongation rate. Recently harvested seeds germinated best and fastest when they were collected in spring crops compared with winter crops. Germination proportion and rate increased with seed storage length, especially for seeds collected in winter crops. Midgermination time decreased with seed weight and water deficit during seed production; it increased with nitrogen amounts available to the mother plants. Maximum shoot length increased with seed weight and plant density during seed production. It decreased with nitrogen availability to mother plants and with storage length, irrespective of whether the seeds were dry-stored or buried in soil. Elongation rate was highest for early- and fast-germinating seeds. Time to midelongation increased with maximum shoot length. These germination and preemergence growth models can now be combined with other submodels to develop a blackgrass emergence model.

J	Arnaud, JF; Viard, F; Delescluse, M; Cuguen, J				Arnaud, JF; Viard, F; Delescluse, M; Cuguen, J			Evidence for gene flow via seed dispersal from crop to wild relatives in Beta vulgaris (Chenopodiaceae): consequences for the release of genetically modified crop species with weedy lineages	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Gene flow and introgression from cultivated to wild plant populations have important evolutionary and ecological consequences and require detailed investigations for risk assessments of transgene escape into natural ecosystems. Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) are of particular concern because: (i) they are cross-compatible with their wild relatives (the sea beet, B. vulgaris ssp. maritima); (ii) crop-to-wild gene flow is likely to occur via weedy lineages resulting from hybridization events and locally infesting fields. Using a chloroplastic marker and a set of nuclear microsatellite loci, the occurrence of crop-to-wild gene flow was investigated in the French sugar beet production area within a 'contact-zone' in between coastal wild populations and sugar beet fields. The results did not reveal large pollen dispersal from weed to wild beets. However, several pieces of evidence clearly show an escape of weedy lineages from fields via seed flow. Since most studies involving the assessment of transgene escape from crops to wild outcrossing relatives generally focused only on pollen dispersal, this last result was unexpected: it points out the key role of a long-lived seed bank and highlights support for transgene escape via man-mediated long-distance dispersal events.

J	Grundy, AC; Mead, A; Burston, S				Grundy, AC; Mead, A; Burston, S			Modelling the emergence response of weed seeds to burial depth: interactions with seed density, weight and shape	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Weeds play an important role in arable and horticultural habitats, and models are being developed to improve our understanding of their population dynamics. The position of a weed seed in the soil profile influences the probability of a seed germinating, emerging successfully and its relative time of emergence. Identifying a relationship between the shape or weight of a seed and its ability to emerge from depth may allow the development of generic models. The aim of this study was to quantify seed response to burial depth, to improve the wider application of existing seedling emergence models. 2. A field experiment used weed seeds sown at different depths and densities in a standard substrate. In addition, two laboratory studies used pre-germinated seeds of the same range of species, buried at a range of depths in optimum conditions using the same substrate. These studies explored the effects of seed size, shape and sowing density on seedling emergence and also enabled reserve-dependent pre-emergence mortality to be quantified. 3. The largest and heaviest of the seeds tested overall, Veronica hederifolia , emerged from the greatest depth (8 cm). In contrast, Tripleurospermum inodorum and Veronica arvensis , the two smallest species, showed a sharp decline when burial exceeded 1 cm. However, the link between seed shape or weight and the ability to emerge from depth suggests a complex relationship. Given optimum conditions, some species (Stellaria media and Chenopodium album) have the physical reserves to emerge from a wider range of burial depths than normally observed in the field, suggesting an ability to exploit opportunities when they occur. 4. For some species, emergence was reduced at high seed densities (e.g. Veronica arvensis). These responses may be associated with traits that have evolved to counteract sibling competition. 5. Synthesis and applications. Generic models identifying the maximum depths for seed germination and emergence have a number of practical applications. For example, they can be used to target cultivation to deplete the weed seed bank or to prescribe the optimum depth of mulches to favour certain species. Our model showed that, in general, larger-seeded species emerged from deeper in the soil, but the relationship between seed size and shape and emergence was complex, possibly species specific. Our germination data may also assist our understanding of the relative importance of different causes of seed losses, particularly from different zones of the soil profile, such as the soil surface. Understanding the component processes of seed behaviour and germination is essential to developing sustainable weed management practices in agriculture and horticulture, and the work reported here contributes to a larger programme modelling weed seed bank population dynamics.																	0021-8901					AUG	2003	40	4					757	770		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00836.x							WOS:000184109200014

Germination of small batches of the seeds from the large, long-lasting soil seed bank of S. arabicus contributes to its success as a very common annual plant in large areas of the Negev, under the unpredictable small amounts and distribution of rain. The lower the percentage of germinating caryopses on local loess soil, and the faster the speed of germination (from 4 h) of caryopses that, do germinate, the higher is the chance of plants survival to reproduce.

J	Franks, SJ				Franks, SJ			Facilitation in multiple life-history stages: evidence for nucleated succession in coastal dunes	PLANT ECOLOGY												Understanding plant interactions during succession is a central goal of plant ecology. The nucleation model of succession proposes that facilitative interactions lead to outward radiations of colonization from established plants. I tested the nucleation hypothesis for early successional plants on the primary dunes of barrier islands in the southeastern United States. On the coast of Florida and Georgia, I sampled the above-ground vegetation and the seed bank, and conducted a seedling emergence experiment in the field. Vegetation sampling at both field sites showed more positive correlations in percent cover of adult species than expected by chance. At both sites, there were significantly more seeds under plants than in open microsites. Seeds of the same species as the adult plants in the vegetated microsites were removed from the analysis, so the accumulation of seeds under adults is not due simply to a seed shadow effect. Seeds of six species were added to plots under plants and in open microsites, and seedling emergence was significantly higher under plants than in the open. The findings support the predictions of the nucleation hypothesis for the early life-history stages of seed dispersal and germination, and help to explain the clumped distribution of dune plants seen in the field. The results add further support for the contention that facilitation is an important mode of plant interaction in stressful and disturbed habitats.																	1385-0237					AUG	2003	168	1					1	11		10.1023/A:1024426608966							WOS:000183835900001						
J	Lopez, RP				Lopez, RP			Soil seed banks in the semi-arid Prepuna of Bolivia	PLANT ECOLOGY												The Bolivian Prepuna is a high-altitude, summer-rain semidesert. The aim of this work was to sample, for the first time, the composition, abundance, and distribution of its seed bank in two different seasons. Soil samples were collected at four sites with a corer (3.5 cm diameter, 2.5 cm deep), 80 in January (summer) and 80 in May (autumn). On each date, half the samples came from under shrubs and half from between shrubs. Seeds were separated from the soil by a flotation-filtering technique and compared with a reference collection established previously. Seeds belonging to a few species, mostly summer annuals, were found in the seed bank. These had heterogeneous distribution in the soil. However, there were more seeds in areas under shrubs. The relatively low seed bank density ( 1150-1650 seeds/m(2)) may have been due mainly to precipitation values well below the average in the previous growing season. Despite its low density, seeds>0.25 mg represented 92% of seed bank's total dry weight. Long-term studies are needed to assess true seasonal and annual fluctuations of Prepuna's seed bank.

There were distinct differences in both the seed bank composition and the aboveground vegetation between the off-prairie dog colony treatments and the on-colony treatments. The three on-colony treatments were similar to each other at all three sites with vegetation dominated by the forbs Dyssodia papposa, Hedeoma spp., Sphaeralcea coccinea, Conyza canadensis, and Plantago patagonica and seed banks dominated by the forbs Verbena bracteata and Dyssodia papposa. The two off-colony treatments were also similar to each other at all three sites. Vegetation at these sites was dominated by the grasses Pascopyrum smithii, Bromus tectorum and Bouteloua gracilis and the seed banks were dominated by several grasses including Bromus tectorum, Monroa squarrosa, Panicum capillare, Sporobolus cryptandra and Stipa viridula. A total of 146 seedlings representing 21 species germinated and emerged from off-colony treatments while 3069 seedlings comprising 33 species germinated from on-colony treatments. Fifteen of the forty species found in soil seed banks were not present in the vegetation, and 57 of the 82 species represented in the vegetation were not found in the seed banks. Few dominant species typical of mixed-grass prairie vegetation germinated and emerged from seed banks collected from prairie dog colony treatments suggesting that removal of prairie dogs will not result in the rapid reestablishment of representative mixed-grass prairie unless steps are taken to restore the soil seed bank.

To gain a better understanding of the balance between sexual and asexual regeneration strategies and to assess the role of the seed bank in regeneration, the similarities in species composition and abundance of four fundamental compartments involved in regeneration (the seed rain, the seed bank, the recruits and the canopy) were compared in three hardwood forest stands with different flooding conditions. The results show that the floristic composition of the recruits is very similar to that of the canopy, whereas the composition of the seed bank is very dissimilar to the latter and comprises very few hardwood species. However, some species such as Fraxinus excelsior, Carpinus betulus and Acer pseudoplatanus which are very rare in the seed bank release a high number of diaspores, and seedlings of these species germinate abundantly in the field in the year following seed release. Moreover, the germinating seeds originate from the litter layer and not from the soil itself. This shows that most woody species regenerating by seed in the hardwood Rhine forest build transient seed banks and that the role of persistent seed banks for regeneration is very limited. Furthermore, it appears that many woody species have developed strategies favouring vegetative propagation for their regeneration, particularly understorey species, such as Cornus sanguinea and Prunus padus. As vegetatively grown individuals better withstand prolonged inundation in their early life stages than seedlings, species relying on vegetative regeneration strategies might be advantaged by regular and prolonged flooding of the Rhine forest over species regenerating only by seeds.

ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We studied a congeneric species pair that shows very different abundances in Estonia - Viola elatior occurs in only five localities in mesic calcareous grasslands, while Viola mirabilis is abundant in mesic calcareous grasslands and forests all over the country. Both species were sown in patches of mesic calcareous grassland, in clipped and untreated plots. Both species were established successfully after sowing, indicating that they both may be dispersal limited to the same extent. V elatior showed higher fecundity in the second year than V mirabilis. V elatior was more sensitive to the availability of light. In the first year, V elatior established more successfully in clipped plots than V mirabilis. In the second year, the number of established V elatior individuals decreased in unmanaged plots, where competition for light was more severe. Since many calcareous grasslands in Estonia have been abandoned and the standing crop, as well as the cover of shrubs and trees, has increased, sensitivity to light competition may be one reason why V elatior has become more rare. It cannot be the only reason for its rarity in the whole region, since many other grassland species that are vulnerable to reduced light in overgrown unmanaged grassland communities still occur in much higher numbers in the country. It was hypothesised that historical factors, e.g. relatively late arrival in the region, may also be behind the rarity of V elatior. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

J	Pico, FX; Retana, J				Pico, FX; Retana, J			Seed ecology of a Mediterranean perennial herb with an exceptionally extended flowering and fruiting season	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Lobularia maritima is a Mediterranean short-lived herb with a flowering and fruiting season that lasts for ten months. Previous studies have shown that recruitment in periods other than autumn of the flowering season has few demographic implications; that is contributes little to the population growth rate. Since environmental conditions in periods other than autumn would allow recruitment, we examined to what extent the seed ecology of L. maritima accounts for recruitment shortage for the greater part of the year. To this end, we studied the effects of selfing and outcrossing on seed production and germination, within- and between-year variation in seed mass and germination, seed characteristics in the soil seed bank throughout the year, and the effect of temperature as a factor controlling seed germination. Results indicate that selfing does not decrease recruitment, and thus the observed changes in visitation rate and pollinator composition throughout the year cannot account for differences in recruitment. Germinability decreases throughout the year, suggesting a possible cost in reproduction associated with extended flowering. L. maritima has a transient seed bank whose seeds also experience a decrease in their germination throughout the year. Finally, temperature affects seed germination patterns, indicating the existence of quiescence mechanisms that prevent germination in the months prior to the summer drought. Overall, the results obtained support and, at least partly, explain the recruitment patterns of L. maritima observed in the field.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Lactuca serriola (prickly lettuce, compass plant) is a winter or summer annual, introduced to Canada from Eurasia, and found in all provinces except Newfoundland. It occupies a variety of disturbed sites, and is becoming an increasing problem in crops grown with reduced tillage. Most seedlings emerge in autumn and form overwintering rosettes, with a smaller peak of emergence in spring. Flowering occurs from July through September. Seed production is proportional to stem height, and ranges up to 200 000 seeds per plant. The wind-dispersed seeds have no primary dormancy and form only a short-term seed bank (I to 3 yr). Many populations in the western United States and southern Australia have developed resistance to Group 2 herbicides, which inhibit the enzyme acetolactate synthase. Prickly lettuce is closely related to, and inter-fertile with, cultivated lettuce, Lactuca sativa L.																	0008-4220					JUL	2003	83	3					619	628		10.4141/P02-059							WOS:000185060800022						
J	van Loon, AJ				van Loon, AJ			The dubious role of man in a questionable mass extinction	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Ongoing extinction of species and higher-order taxa was the rule rather than the exception in the geological past. In addition, mass extinctions occurred several times. However catastrophic these may have been, they have also created the opportunities for a wide variety of new species to develop, thus constituting an integral part of life's evolution on Earth. It is generally believed that both plant and animal species have, in the geologically recent past, become (and are still becoming) extinct at such a high rate that the Late Quaternary may be considered-from a geological point of view-as a timespan of mass extinction. Several actions are currently being taken to save species from extinction. It is argued that no scientific proof for a mass extinction currently taking place exists. In addition, measures to save threatened species from extinction do, however nature-friendly they may seem, in fact counteract natural evolution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

J	Tomasoni, C; Borrelli, L; Pecetti, L				Tomasoni, C; Borrelli, L; Pecetti, L			Influence of fodder crop rotations on the potential weed flora in the irrigated lowlands of Lombardy, Italy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Extensification has recently become an important option in Western European agriculture, driven both by economic considerations (product surpluses) and growing public concern on the possible adverse effects of intensive farming on the environment and human health. The adoption of rational fodder crop rotations, with the rediscovery of the beneficial effect of the meadow, is viewed as a possible means to reduce the impact of farming systems in the lowlands of northern Italy, characterised by highly intensive cropping and animal husbandry. Crop rotations are also expected to exert a positive effect in controlling the weed flora, thereby reducing the need for chemicals and increasing the sustainability of fanning. The current study examined, by the 'seedling emergence' technique, the quanti-qualitative composition of the potential weed flora (seed bank in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers) at the end of the second cycle (12 years since establishment) of a long-term crop rotation trial in northern Italy. The experiment compared five fodder crop systems, different in the degree of crop intensification and for the presence or absence of the meadow: a 1-year continuous cereal double cropping (R 1); a 3-year rotation (R3); a 6-year rotation (R6); a permanent meadow (PM); and a continuous grain maize cropping (CM). Each rotation was subjected to two input treatments, defined as optimal and sub-optimal (input reduction of approximate to25-30%) for the region, respectively, in terms of nutrient levels, herbicide doses, and soil tillage methods. The crop rotations exerted a marked influence on the potential weed flora, both qualitatively (mean number of weed species) and quantitatively (number of emerged weed seedlings m (-2)). Long rotations and maize monoculture had opposite trends with respect to the weed species diversity, the latter showing the narrower composition of the weed flora. The rotations including grain maize (viz., CM and R3) showed the highest seed stock, whereas the PM had the lowest weed infestation. Grain maize was particularly infested by warm-season, weed grasses, such as Digitaria sanguinalis and Panicum spp., against which neither the spring herbicide nor the post-emergence cultivation seemed effective. The meadow also showed an outstanding 'cleansing' effect when inserted into the R6 rotation after 3 years of annual double cropping, reducing to about one-third the initial seed stock. The input levels did not influence significantly the weed seed bank, suggesting the possibility of adopting less intensive agronomic practices without markedly worse weed control.

J	Brock, MA; Nielsen, DL; Shiel, RJ; Green, JD; Langley, JD				Brock, MA; Nielsen, DL; Shiel, RJ; Green, JD; Langley, JD			Drought and aquatic community resilience: the role of eggs and seeds in sediments of temporary wetlands	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A long-lived bank of propagules consisting of eggs, seeds and spores is one mechanism that allows aquatic communities to survive drought. A drying (drought) event is, for aquatic organisms in a temporary wetland, a phase from which communities must recover. Such a dry phase is often considered a disturbance but should not be considered adverse or catastrophic for the organisms that have evolved to live in temporarily wet habitats. 2. This paper explores the parallels between the egg bank of zooplankton and the seed bank of aquatic plants as means of survival in temporary wetlands. The resilience of communities in temporary wetland ecosystems is assessed by examining dormancy, hatching, germination, establishment and reproduction of animals and plants from the egg and seed banks of wetlands with a range of wetting and drying regimes. 3. Both the zooplankton and aquatic plants of the temporary wetlands studied rely on their egg and seed banks as a means for surviving drying. These communities recover after the disturbance of drying by means of specific patterns of dormancy, dormancy breakage, hatching, germination, establishment and reproduction. Spatial and temporal patterns of species richness allow resilience through dormancy, as not all species are present at all sites and not all species hatch and germinate at the same time. Multiple generations in the egg and seed bank and complexity of environmental cues for dormancy breakage also contribute to the ecosystem's ability to recover after a drying event. A persistent egg and seed bank allows species-rich communities to hatch, germinate and develop rapidly once dormancy is broken. Rapid establishment of species-rich communities that reproduce rapidly and leave many propagules in the egg and seed bank also facilitates community recovery on flooding of a temporary wetland after a drying event. 4. To maintain the diversity of temporary wetland communities through droughts and floods we need to manage the dry and wet phases of wetlands. To conserve a wide range of wetland types, we need to maintain a variety of hydrological patterns across the landscape.

J	Cain, MD; Shelton, MG				Cain, MD; Shelton, MG			Fire effects on germination of seeds from Rhus and Rubus: competitors to pine during natural regeneration	NEW FORESTS												Throughout the southeastern United States, Rhus and Rubus species are common associates of the southern pines on a wide array of upland site and stand conditions. Because of their ability to overrun disturbed sites, these species are categorized as competitors to pine during stand regeneration. Since prescribed burning is often used for site preparation in advance of pine regeneration, this study investigated the effect of fire on the germination of seeds from three pine competitors (Rubus argutus Link, Rhus copallina L. and Rhus glabra L.). During dormant-season burns, sumac seeds were located 45 cm above litter, within the F layer of a reconstructed forest floor, and at the interface of the forest floor and mineral soil. During growing-season burns, fresh blackberry fruits were placed at heights of 0, 15, 30, and 45 cm above the surface litter of a reconstructed forest floor. In subsequent germination tests, sumac seeds from within the F layer of burned litter had significantly higher germination rates for smooth sumac (31%) and shining sumac (42%) as compared to unburned control seeds (1-5%). In general, germination rates for sumac seeds placed in the air or on mineral soil during burning were no better than control seeds. Seeds from blackberry fruits that were located at heights of 15, 30, and 45 cm had germination rates that were comparable to unburned control seeds (18%), but seeds from fruits placed on the litter during burning had <1% germination. Results suggest that sumac seed germination may be enhanced by the heat from prescribed burning, whereas blackberry seeds showed more germination response to multiple germination cycles which indicated a potential for long-term storage in the soil seed bank.																	0169-4286					JUL	2003	26	1					51	64		10.1023/A:1024406209842							WOS:000183709200005						
J	Stapp, P; Polis, GA				Stapp, P; Polis, GA			Influence of pulsed resources and marine subsidies on insular rodent populations	OIKOS												Inputs of marine resources contribute to high consumer densities on small, barren islands in the and Gulf of California, Mexico. Episodes of rainfall associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, however, stimulate plant growth and seed production and replenish soil detritus and seed banks. We studied the effects of marine inputs and pulsed ENSO resources on rodent populations on islands before, during and after the strong 1997-1998 ENSO event. Stable isotope analysis was used to determine rodent diets. During dry years, P. maniculatus consumed marine prey near shore and on small islands, and were much more abundant in these areas than farther inland and on larger islands. Captures were particularly concentrated near shore on three islands inhabited by Chaetodipus rudinoris, a granivore that was numerous in inland areas. Following the ENSO, Peromyscus maniculatus increased in abundance by 408%, compared to only 160% for C. rudinoris, and new individuals invaded inland areas. P. maniculatus populations declined sharply the following year, however, whereas C. rudinoris populations remained relatively stable. In response to ENSO conditions, P. maniculatus ate more seeds on islands with C. rudinoris than on islands without C. rudinoris. P. maniculatus also increased less markedly and declined more quickly in abundance where C. rudinoris was present. We speculate that P. maniculatus is capable of rapid numerical response to resource pulses but depends on marine foods during dry years. C. rudinoris is restricted to islands with sufficient seed resources, but maintains stable populations by exploiting low-density seeds and caching seeds from wet years. On islands with both species, C. rudinoris restricts P. maniculatus to near-shore areas via interference, but spillover consumption of seeds by subsidized P. maniculatus may limit the response of C. rudinoris to ENSO resources. Combined with differences in life history and dispersal abilities, these ecological factors help explain the distinct biogeographic distributions of these rodents on Gulf islands.																	0030-1299					JUL	2003	102	1					111	123		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12445.x							WOS:000183694000012						
J	Lopez-Pintor, A; Espigares, T; Benayas, JMR				Lopez-Pintor, A; Espigares, T; Benayas, JMR			Spatial segregation of plant species caused by Retama sphaerocarpa influence in a Mediterranean pasture: a perspective from the soil seed bank	PLANT ECOLOGY												Retama sphaerocarpa is a leguminous shrub whose important role in the semi-arid regions of south-eastern Spain has already been assessed: shrub canopies reduce light intensity, and thus evapotranspiration; also their extensive radical system take water and nutrients from great volumes of soil, concentrating them in the understorey. Consequently, subcanopy vegetation benefits from these facilitation processes, increasing its productivity. However, these shrublands have been rarely studied at a broader scale, i.e. as a savannah-like system composed of a variable number of shrubs scattered in a herbaceous matrix. As the microenvironmental conditions associated to the understorey are rather different from those of the open spaces among shrubs, species composition of the herbaceous matrix is expected to change accordingly. Thus, R. sphaerocarpa would be an important and still unknown source of spatial heterogeneity to the system. Our main purpose was to evaluate, through the soil seed bank, the heterogeneity in the herbaceous community induced by this shrub species. Soil samples were collected around adult shrubs from three positions relative to the canopy: near the centre of the shrubs, at the edge of the understorey, and completely outside the canopy. Floristic composition was evaluated by germination under greenhouse conditions. The results show that each position has a different floristic composition, characterised by a group of different species. The herbaceous species associated with the external position have functional traits which enable them to resist water stress and herbivore pressure, such as hairs, CAM metabolism, early flowering, horizontal growth or tiny stature. The species associated with the central position lack those traits, and are more competitive in more mesic environments, rich in nitrogen. The lowest number of seedlings and species was found in the internal position, suggesting that in our study the facilitation process may have less importance for community dynamics due to less stressful environmental conditions.																	1385-0237					JUL	2003	167	1					107	116		10.1023/A:1023950414863							WOS:000183204200010						
J	Griffith, AB; Forseth, IN				Griffith, AB; Forseth, IN			Establishment and reproduction of Aeschynomene virginica (L.) (Fabaceae) a rare, annual, wetland species in relation to vegetation removal and water level	PLANT ECOLOGY												Aeschynomene virginica is a rare annual plant found in freshwater tidal wetlands of the eastern United States. We hypothesized that standing vegetation and water inundation were two important environmental factors in its population dynamics. To test these hypotheses, we sowed seeds into plots with undisturbed vegetation or plots with all aboveground vegetation removed in 1998 and 1999. Presence/absence of seedlings was noted and seedling survival to reproduction, final size, and seed set were measured throughout both growing seasons. Seedling establishment from germination to the first true leaf stage increased with decreasing water depth. Vegetation removal plots had greater seedling establishment, higher seedling survival, and higher seed set per plant than non-removal plots. In a greenhouse study designed to test the effects of water level on seed germination and seedling establishment, no seedlings established in submerged soils, and seed germination and seedling establishment were lower in waterlogged soil than in wet soil. Physical stress associated with deeper water likely limits the distribution of A. virginica to higher elevations, where seeds that colonize patches with low vegetative cover are more likely to produce reproductive adults that produce more seeds relative to patches with established vegetation. A. virginica appears to be a fugitive species specializing on open habitat patches in tidal wetlands. This species may be dependent on disturbances for population establishment and maintenance.																	1385-0237					JUL	2003	167	1					117	125		10.1023/A:1023952907092							WOS:000183204200011						
J	Wilson, BG; Witkowski, ETF				Wilson, BG; Witkowski, ETF			Seed banks, bark thickness and change in age and size structure (1978-1999) of the African savanna tree, Burkea africana	PLANT ECOLOGY												The population dynamics of the tree, Burkea africana Hook. was assessed within six sites in a nutrient-poor broad-leaf savanna, and seed banks were assessed within three of these sites. Population size and age structure in 1978 ( representing the effects of 60 years cattle farming) differed little to those in 1999 ( representing 20 years of conservation management). Greatest differences were in the smaller size classes, possibly in response to increased fire intensities over the last 20 years, although both periods displayed inverse J-shaped curves, typical of strongly recruiting populations. Growth rings were used to age trees, but estimates of age are actually the age since the last resprouting event, thus underestimating total age. Bark thickness increased almost linearly with plant size up to 400 mm trunk circumference, whereafter the relationship was poor for both currently fruiting and non-fruiting plants. This appears to represent a size at which trees are sufficiently protected by their bark to become fire resistant. It is also the typical minimum size for sexual maturity ( flower and pod production), suggesting that the attainment of fire resistance immediately precedes the development of sexual maturity. Even though scarring of B. africana trees by porcupines was rare, the significant relationship between scarring and fire damage and consequent tree death resulted in the creation of gaps for regeneration. Densities of small plants (<1 m in height) were 363 &PLUSMN; 341 plants ha(-1) for those that had resprouted (94% of total), with only 7 &PLUSMN; 37 (1.7%) current and 13 &PLUSMN; 43 (4.3%) previous year's seedlings ha(-1). Similar proportions occurred subcanopy (48%) and in the open (52%). Most seeds in the soil seed bank (69%) were recently dispersed and occurred in the litter ( 94%), while non-current seeds (31%) occurred mainly in the soil (55%). Buried seeds had greater viability than those at the surface. Seeds were effectively dispersed to all microsites but with highest densities below parent trees. At the landscape level, seed densities were about 750 000 ha(-1). Presently, B. africana appears to be resilient to the change in management of the reserve.

J	Steiger, J; Gurnell, AM; Goodson, JM				Steiger, J; Gurnell, AM; Goodson, JM			Quantifying and characterizing contemporary riparian sedimentation	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Fluvial processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition determine the changing form and sedimentary structure of naturally adjusting riparian zones. Riparian sediment storage has both scientific and management importance in relation to: (i) the quantities of sediment that are involved; (ii) the quality of the sediment; and (iii) the dispersal of biological materials, notably the vegetation propagules that are transported and deposited in association with the sediment. After discussing the significance of riparian sedimentation processes, this paper reviews methods for quantifying contemporary sediment deposition within water bodies and their margins. Methods for investigating contemporary riparian sedimentation are given particular emphasis, and the extent to which different methods provide comparable estimates and have been used to support the analysis of different physical and chemical properties of the sediment are outlined. The importance of the following are stressed: (i) selecting a sampling method that is suited to the sedimentation environment; (ii) incorporating careful cross-calibration if measurements from different methods are to be combined; and (iii) replicating measurements to give more robust estimates if small traps are employed. It is concluded that artificial turf mats provide a useful design of sediment trap across a range of environmental conditions because: (i) their surface roughness reduces problems of sediment removal by flood waters or rainfall; (ii) their pliability permits installation on irregular surfaces; (iii) they can be securely attached to the ground with metal pins to resist high shear stresses from river flows; (iv) they are robust and light and so easily manipulated in the field and laboratory; (v) it is,possible to fully recover the deposited sediment to accurately determine the amount of sediment deposited and to support a range of other analyses. Results are presented to illustrate how artificial turf mats can be used to estimate the quantity and quality of deposited sediment and to explore the associated deposition of viable seeds. This provides one example of the important hydroecological role of riparian sedimentation processes and of the potential for the development of innovative, interdisciplinary research on riparian sediment dynamics.

J	Donath, TW; Holzel, N; Otte, A				Donath, TW; Holzel, N; Otte, A			The impact of site conditions and seed dispersal on restoration success in alluvial meadows	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												We studied the restoration success of flood plain meadows in the northern Upper Rhine valley, where between 1988 and 1992, 35 ha of arable land was converted into grassland and subsequently managed for nature conservation. Remnant populations of typical alluvial meadow species were found in old meadows and along drainage ditches that dissect the whole area. We analysed the site conditions and phytosociological releves in old and new meadows. Small differences in site parameters between old and new meadows contrasted with a clear floristic differentiation between the two meadow types. The vegetation of old meadows was much more differentiated along prevailing environmental gradients than the vegetation of new meadows. Despite the favourable site conditions for the re-establishment of species-rich meadows on the former arable land, restoration success was limited to the vicinity of remnant stands. In contrast to old meadows, indicator species of new grassland were still typical species of regularly disturbed ruderal and arable habitats, often capable of building up a persistent seed bank. The precise mapping of 23 target species revealed that even wind dispersal predominantly leads to re-establishment in the close circumference of parent plants. We found no indication that regular flooding, hay-making and autumnal grazing had an impact on recolonization of newly created grassland. Even under favourable conditions for the re-establishment of target species, restoration success in alluvial meadows proved to be strongly dispersal limited. We discuss the implications of our findings for future restoration management in grasslands.

J	Ortega, E; Laterra, P				Ortega, E; Laterra, P			Fire-induced colonization of a Flooding Pampa grassland by thistles: Remnant litter and interference effects	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Winter and spring burnings constitute a traditional management practice of the Flooding Pampa grasslands which are dominated by the tussock grass Paspalum quadrifarium. In addition to increasing the primary productivity and the nutrient quality of the regrowth, this burning favours the establishment of opportunistic species, especially the legume Lotus glaber and the thistles Cirsium vulgare and Carduus acanthoides. The aims of the present study were to assess the effects of burning and those of the remnant litter on L. glaber and thistle recruitment, as well as the effects of L. glaber density on the emergence, survival and flowering of thistles. Two field experiments were carried out: 1. A completely randomized factorial design with occurrence of L. glaber and fire was applied in a mature Paspalum stand; 2. A completely randomized design with four L. glaber seed densities oversown on a burned Paspalum stand, as the treatments. Thistle and L. glaber recruitment within the Paspalum stand was dependent on fire, but their emergence in burnt plots was reduced by the presence of remnant litter. Remnant litter and interference from L. glaber provide complementary mechanisms to reduce fire-cued colonization by thistles. While seedling emergence of thistles was mostly affected by the presence of remnant litter, seedling survival depended on local density of L. glaber. By the end of the first post-fire growing season, the survivorship of established thistles was linearly reduced with increasing sowing density and above-ground biomass of L. glaber. The maintenance of a significant litter coverage and a high density of L. glaber in the pre-fire seed bank, as well as the oversowing of L. glaber after fire, may be useful tools in fire management of Paspalum stands aimed to improve their forage value with reduced dependence on chemical control of weeds.																	1402-2001					JUN	2003	6	1					35	44		10.1658/1402-2001(2003)006[0035:FCOAFP]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000186178600004

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Vegetation and soil seed banks of a threatened Atlantic fen meadow community were studied using recent phytosociological records and seedling emergence from soil samples. Similarly managed but differently degraded stands that suffered different levels of species impoverishment were compared. The actual vegetation was related to a set of phytosociological references representing the subassociations of the community. DCA positions of reference releves from the different subassociations were overlapping, suggesting that in all references many common species occur. Recent records were positioned in-between the seed bank samples and the references. The soil seed banks of all stands were dominated by ordinary species. Most character species had at most sparse seed banks and no seedlings of locally extinct character species, mentioned in historic floristic records, were detected. In contrast species of pioneer and small-sedge communities as well as those of heathlands were abundant in the seed banks. Based on the vertical distribution of seeds in the soil layers most fen meadow species were classified into transient or short-term persistent seed bank types. We concluded that complete restoration of the Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum without reintroduction is only likely in stands that were degraded only a few years ago. On the other hand, the presence of viable seeds of Nanocyperion and Parvocaricetea species is promising for the restoration of these communities even after decades. Recreation of pioneer habitats by sod cutting will preserve these species.

J	Brown, J; Enright, NJ; Miller, BP				Brown, J; Enright, NJ; Miller, BP			Seed production and germination in two rare and three common co-occurring Acacia species from south-east Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Seed set, size, viability and germination requirements were investigated for two rare (Acacia ausfeldii and A. williamsonii) and three common (A. pycnantha, A. genistifolia and A. paradoxa) co-occurring congeners in box-ironbark eucalypt forests near Bendigo, south-east Australia to investigate correlates of rarity. Seed size was significantly smaller for the two rare species and germinants were less able to emerge from deeper sowing depths than were the larger seeded common congeners. All species had a strong heat-stimulated germination response. While the rare A. ausfeldii showed strong germination only at the highest temperature treatment (100degreesC), the common and widespread A. pycnantha showed strong germination across a broad range of temperatures (60-100degreesC) likely to be experienced by soil-stored seeds during a fire. Seed viability, number of seeds per plant, and number of firm, aborted and eaten seeds per pod varied between species, but the pattern of variation was not related to rarity. Small seed size and a very specific temperature requirement for germination may help to explain rarity in A. ausfeldii, and to a lesser extent in A. williamsonii. Fires are often patchy and heating of the soil is likely to be highly spatially variable, so species with germination responses to a broad range of temperatures have an advantage over those that respond only to a narrow range. A narrower range of soil depths from which seeds can emerge will further reduce the proportion of the seed bank that might recruit following fire. Human impacts on species habitats, such as fragmentation, loss of topsoil through mining, timber harvesting, grazing and urbanization, and consequent reduction in fire intensity, are likely to have further contributed to rarity in these species. The role of pollination and other factors in relation to population size is the subject of further investigation.

J	Garvin, SC; Meyer, SE				Garvin, SC; Meyer, SE			Multiple mechanisms for seed dormancy regulation in shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia : Chenopodiaceae)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia (Torr. & Frem.) Wats.) is a dominant shrub species of western North American deserts. Its one-seeded utricles are enclosed in bracteoles, and its seeds are highly dormant at dispersal. We examined the role of soluble inhibitors, bracteole effects, after-ripening, and chilling in regulating dormancy for six shadscale populations. Seeds in bracteole-enclosed fruits required chilling to become germinable, and the fraction responsive to chilling was small for recently harvested seeds. This fraction increased during dry storage for 24 weeks, but the rate of increase decreased asymptotically. After-ripening rate was an exponential function of storage temperature over the range 22-50degreesC. After-ripening models based on these nonlinear relationships for each of four seed populations accounted for 96% of the change in the chilling-responsive fraction during 3 years of laboratory storage. Rate of change in the chilling-responsive fraction during laboratory storage was log-linearly related to the chilling-responsive fraction for recently harvested seeds. Excision of utricles from recently harvested fruits increased the chilling-responsive fraction but did not generally eliminate the chilling requirement. Leaching or dewinging to remove soluble inhibitors increased germination of otherwise nondormant seeds but did not relieve primary dormancy. Knowledge of dormancy loss mechanisms will facilitate prediction of germination phenology and seed bank persistence for shadscale under fluctuating field conditions.																	0008-4026					JUN	2003	81	6					601	610		10.1139/B03-050							WOS:000184536800009						
J	Pearson, TRH; Burslem, DFRP; Mullins, CE; Dalling, JW				Pearson, TRH; Burslem, DFRP; Mullins, CE; Dalling, JW			Functional significance of photoblastic germination in neotropical pioneer trees: a seed's eye view	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. We investigated the relationship between seed mass and the suitability of microsites for germination for five small-seeded (<2.4 mg fresh mass) photoblastic neotropical pioneer trees. We determined the germination response of these species to the ratio of red to far-red irradiance (r:fr) and compared it to r:fr measured under varying conditions of canopy openness, litter and soil thickness. 2. At a constant temperature the germination percentage of each of the species increased sharply with increasing r:fr above a species-specific threshold r:fr. The smallest-seeded species, Miconia argentea , had the lowest r:fr threshold for germination (0.12) while the larger-seeded Cecropia species and Solanum hayesii possessed higher values (0.21-0.27). The largest seeded species, Solanum hayesii , also showed a positive germination response to a 10degreesC temperature fluctuation, which was independent of the response to r:fr. 3. The mean r:fr at ground level declined with decreasing gap size but not sufficiently to suppress the germination of these five species. However, a covering of one litter leaf in direct sunlight reduced the r:fr to between 0.18 and 0.83 depending on the species and leaf wetness. The top-soil at our study site was aggregated and irradiance was transmitted or reflected between soil aggregates with little change in r:fr. Light did not penetrate the aggregates. 4. We suggest that photoblastic germination in neotropical pioneers has evolved to inhibit germination in response to conditions most likely to alter within the life of an individual seed (i.e. superficial burial by leaf litter or incorporation into the surface soil), rather than to fine scale variation in canopy openness. Among photoblastic species, the pattern of response to r:fr suggests that smaller-seeded species would germinate in a broader range of microsites than larger-seeded species. This lower degree of discrimination may be associated with their higher risk of mortality and therefore more limited persistence in the soil seed bank.

J	Martinez-Garza, C; Howe, HF				Martinez-Garza, C; Howe, HF			Restoring tropical diversity: beating the time tax on species loss	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Fragmentation of tropical forest is accelerating at the same time that already cleared land reverts to secondary growth. Fragments inexorably lose deep-forest species to local extinction while embedded in low-diversity stands of early successional pioneer trees. 2. Pasture matrices undergoing passive secondary succession become a 'pioneer desert' from the vantage of remnant immigration, imposing a 'time tax' of loss of deep-forest plants from forest fragments. However, if seeds of deep-forest trees find pastures, or seedlings are planted there, many will prosper. 3. Bypassing early domination of pioneer trees in regenerating matrices, or enriching matrices with animal-dispersed forest trees, may stem the loss of species from forest fragments and accelerate succession far from the edges of old forest. 4. Synthesis and applications. Planting disperser-limited trees that establish in open ground may bypass 30-70 years of species attrition in isolated remnants by attracting animals that encourage normal processes of seed dispersal into and out of the fragments. Development of criteria for selection of persistent, reasonably rapidly growing, animal-dispersed species that are mixed with planted or naturally arriving pioneers will be an important component of enrichment planting.

Treatments included manipulations of stocking rates and of grazing regimes, in a factorial design. The retrieved soil seed bank community was rich in species, with 133 species accounting for 80% of the 166 species recorded at the site. Within the seed bank, 89% of the species were annuals. Seed bank dynamics was analysed in terms of plant functional groups and germination strategies. In terms of total seed bank density and including all functional groups, 42% of the seeds present in the soil did not germinate under watering conditions. The dormancy level differed greatly among functional groups. The seed bank of annual legumes, crucifers, annual thistles and annual forbs had a large fraction of non-germinated seeds and characterized areas grazed early in the growing season under high and very high grazing intensity. These functional groups were considered to have a higher potential for persistent seed banks production. In contrast, short and tall annual grasses and tall perennial grasses, that were dominant in ungrazed or moderately grazed paddocks, generally had seed banks with a very small fraction of non-germinated seeds. Seed bank densities varied widely between grazing treatments and years. Under continuous grazing, heavy grazing pressure reduced seed bank densities of grasses and crucifers in comparison to moderate grazing. The greatest reduction on the seed bank densities resulted from heavy grazing concentrated during the seed-set stages.																	1100-9233					JUN	2003	14	3					375	386		10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0375:EOGOSS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000184495400008						
J	Alexander, JM; D'Antonio, CM				Alexander, JM; D'Antonio, CM			Seed bank dynamics of French broom in coastal California grasslands: Effects of stand age and prescribed burning on control and restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Successful control of invasive exotic plants depends to a large degree on the regeneration potential of the target exotic species and other species that might also be influenced by the removal effort. In coastal grasslands of California, exotic French broom (Genista monspessulana) forms both dense stands aboveground and abundant seed banks belowground. Land managers attempt to reduce broom cover and the seed bank through prescribed burning, but before this study, no investigators had examined the effect of repeated burning on French broom and associated grassland species. We found that the soil seed bank of stands that were burned had fewer broom seeds than unburned areas but that repeated burning did not reduce the seed bank beyond what was observed after one fire. Fire also did not have any consistent effect on the seed banks of other grassland species. We also examined the relationship between broom stand age and seed bank size but did not find a strong relationship between them. Our data suggested that the broom seed bank stays constant or declines slightly with stand age. We did, however, find that nonbroom seed numbers decreased as broom stands aged. Our results suggest that fire does reduce the size of the broom seed bank and that control of broom need not be limited to only the youngest stands.																	1061-2971					JUN	2003	11	2					185	197		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2003.00169.x							WOS:000183078400007						
J	Leck, MA				Leck, MA			Seed-bank and vegetation development in a created tidal freshwater wetland on the Delaware River, Trenton, New Jersey, USA	WETLANDS												The initial stages of seed-bank and vegetation development were documented in a newly created tidal freshwater wetland where donor soils were not applied. The 32.3-ha site adjacent to the Delaware River in New Jersey, USA was completed in stages from November 1993 to November 1994. Objectives of the study were to determine characteristics of the seed bank and vegetation and to monitor spatial and temporal changes. The study was carried out from 1995 to 1999 using three sites (North, East, and South Marshes) and three elevation locations (1 m from a tidal channel, midpoint, and 1 m from the upland edge). Development of the seed bank and vegetation demonstrated tremendous colonization potential derived from regional and local sources. Colonization and complete plant cover occurred within one year, and subsequent changes were rapid. Individual species behaved uniquely regarding colonization time, duration, and decline in both the seed bank and vegetation. Large seed banks of some species were present even after decline in the vegetation. Overall, the seed bank was large, small-seeded and persistent, and diverse. A total of 177 species occurred in soil seed bank and 92 in field vegetation samples, with 72 contributing to cover. Seed-bank densities (mean +/- SE/m(2)) ranged from 450 +/- 152 to 394,600 +/- 29,950. Species richness (species/ sainple) ranged from 3.3 +/- 1.2 to 32.3 +/- 1.8. Density and species richness were clearly reduced by inundation and were lowest in channel edge samples and in the first year (1995). Cover species richness ranged from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 7.3 +/- 0.6 per quadrat. Complexity of the vegetation increased over time, with lowest diversity along the channels. The 1995 site differences, with greatest densities and species richness in the East Marsh, could be related to site history (timing of construction). Species similarity between the seed bank and vegetation ranged from 11 to 53 % and showed no site, location, or temporal pattern. However, similarity between sites of the seed bank and vegetation increased from 1995 to 1998. Several New Jersey State rare or threatened species, as well as invasive species, were present. Results indicated that it is ecologically feasible to create a wetland adjacent to a tidal freshwater river without use of donor soil and that transplantation had not been necessary.																	0277-5212					JUN	2003	23	2					310	343		10.1672/9-20							WOS:000184016200009

The composition and structure of soil seed banks were analyzed between the microhabitats by using functional group method. The distribution patterns of soil seed bank were also analyzed between the microhabitats. We also analyzed the relationship between seed size and seed persistence in soil. The results show greatly spatial heterogeneity existed in soil seed bank of the Mediterranean coastal sand dune, even in the same microhabitats seed distribution was uneven. Sometimes a great difference occurred between them. Microhabitats significantly affected the distribution patterns of total soil seed banks and seed banks of the functional groups. The open area generally had the greater densities of seeds, but the seed densities under shrub and in trail were lower than that in the open area. Legumes seeds accounted for 76.0% total persistent seed banks. Annual and perennial grasses produced transient seed banks as no seeds were retrieved from the sieved soils. Seed persistence of legumes, umbeliferaes, perennial forbs, compositaes, annual forbs, crucifer decreased gradually. They were 50.1%, 45.6%, 40.6%, 6.3%, 5.6% and 0.6% respectively in the soil. There was a positive relationship between seed size and seed persistence. Bigger seeds had higher persistence, and vice versa.																	0577-7496					MAY	2003	45	5					536	543									WOS:000183077400006

The aim of this study was threefold: (1) to compare vegetation dynamics over a period of 8 years in grazed and ungrazed conditions (2) to investigate the response of annual species to grazing duration during seedling establishment (3) to test the effect of an increase in soil nitrogen availability after cessation of grazing on interactions between Suaeda maritima and Puccinellia maritima. In grazed conditions, during all the survey, vegetation was dominated by a short R maritima sward with the annual Salicornia europaea in the lower and middle marshes. However, after cessation of grazing in 1994, a homogeneous matrix of the forb Halimione portulacoides, quickly replaced P. maritima in the well drained lower marsh. At the middle marsh level, fine sediment and poor drainage maintained R maritima while the annual S. maritima which tolerates taller and denser vegetation replaced S. europaea. Elymus pungens cover was limited till 2000 but its rising in 2001 let expect its dominance in the future. While P. maritima abundance remained high, spring abundance of annual species such as S. europaea and S. maritima globally decreased with sheep grazing duration on the salt marsh between February and June. Experiments with monocultures of P. maritima and S. maritima demonstrated that nitrogen was a limiting factor on the salt marsh. In a mixed community, a moderate application of nitrogen (15 g N m(-2) year(-1) as NH4-NO3) promoted growth of P. maritima and limited the biomass of S. maritima, but growth of the latter was enhanced by a high application of nitrogen (30 g N m(-2) year(-1)). An increase in the abundance of annuals such as S. maritima on the salt marsh is discussed. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

J	Hammerstrom, KK; Kenworthy, WJ				Hammerstrom, KK; Kenworthy, WJ			A new method for estimation of Halophila decipiens Ostenfeld seed banks using density separation	AQUATIC BOTANY												Few studies have addressed the spatial and temporal variability in seagrass seed banks. For small-seeded species in particular, seed banks are hard to sample quantitatively because of the difficulty in separating small seeds from sediment. Halophila decipiens is a highly fecund and cosmopolitan seagrass species, occupying niches which other larger-sized perennial species cannot utilize. Although many studies have suggested H. decipiens meadows are annual and depend on seed banks to re-establish, none have quantitatively examined this necessary life history component. To process the number of samples required to adequately address questions of spatial and temporal variability in H. decipiens seed banks, we developed a density separation technique which removes seeds from sediment and allows easier enumeration. Sediment samples were treated with refrigerated Ludox, a colloidal silica. The colloidal silica supernatant and two surface sediment rinses were examined for the presence of seeds. Our protocol removed between 78 and 100% of seeds from sediment, with a mean removal efficiency of 89%. Use of this method increased our sample processing capability from 4 to 20 samples per day.

J	HilleRisLambers, J; Clark, JS				HilleRisLambers, J; Clark, JS			Effects of dispersal, shrubs, and density-dependent mortality on seed and seedling distributions in temperate forests	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Processes limiting recruitment of trees may have large impacts on forest dynamics. In this paper, we determined the effects of dispersal, shrubs (Rhododendron maximum), and density-dependent mortality on seed and seedling distributions of Southern Appalachian trees. We quantified the spatial distribution of seed rain, seed bank densities, first-year seedlings, and older than first-year seedlings in five vegetation plots. We fit models to these data assuming effects of limited dispersal, R. maximum (an understory shrub), and (or) density-dependent mortality (as well as a null model with none of these effects) and used best-fitting models to indicate which processes affected a particular species. We found that all factors examined limit species distributions, and thus, affect seedling dynamics. Seedling densities are higher near parent trees long after dispersal occurs. This pattern is less frequently observed for animal-dispersed species than for wind-dispersed species, presumably due to secondary dispersal of seeds by animals. Seedling densities of five species are decreased beneath R. maximum. Shade tolerance does not explain which species are affected, suggesting that factors other than low light are responsible for increased seedling mortality under this shrub. Our results suggest that density-dependent mortality affects four species, decreasing seedling densities close to parent trees. Dispersal, density-dependent mortality, and R. maximum all act in ways that may promote or limit diversity, illustrating that multiple factors are likely to control species diversity.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				MAY	2003	33	5					783	795		10.1139/X03-001							WOS:000182987200004

We find that, in addition to protected co-existence by the competition-colonization trade-off, the two species may also co-exist in an unprotected manner (i.e. such that a single-species equilibrium is also stable), and the rare species may be excluded and the common species preserved regardless of which of the two species is rare. In the case of unprotected co-existence, a small change in the environment (e.g. in site density) can cause the abrupt extinction of a species, with no advance warning from its density approaching zero. To restore biodiversity, a substantial change, or (if exclusion of the rare species also occurs) a more complicated non-monotonous change in the environment, is necessary. We investigate the robustness of the model with respect to introducing seed banks, changing the degree of competitive asymmetry and assuming partial displacement of adults by juveniles.

SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												There is confusion in the ecological literature between seed dormancy and persistence in soil. Some ecologists seem to assume that dormancy is necessary for persistence, while others imply that dormancy and persistence are virtually synonymous. Here, we show that there is no close relationship between dormancy and persistence and, incidentally, that conventional methods of investigating soil seed banks underestimate the persistence of species with dormant seeds. The confusion appears to arise from the concept of 'enforced dormancy', which is not genuinely dormancy at all, and would be eliminated if ecologists adopted the definition of dormancy employed by physiologists. Dormancy is a characteristic of the seed, not of the environment, the degree of which defines the conditions required to make the seed germinate.																	0960-2585					MAY	2003	13	2					97	100		10.1079/SSR2003128							WOS:000182978400001

Effective control of these species often begins with an understanding of their biological and reproductive characteristics. At two sites in Missouri, six pigweed species (redroot pigweed, common waterhemp, spiny amaranth, tumble pigweed, smooth pigweed, and Palmer amaranth) were established in 60-m rows spaced 1.5 in apart. At biweekly intervals, plant heights and dry weights were recorded for each species; seed numbers were estimated at the end of the growing season. Dry weight of Palmer amaranth was up to 65% greater than those of all other species 2 wk after planting (WAP). Palmer amaranth biomass accumulation remained greater than those of the other species throughout. the season and at the end of the season was 1.2- and 2.7-fold greater than those of redroot and tumble pigweed, respectively. Palmer amaranth was approximately 10 cm tall 2 WAP (37% taller than the next tallest species, redroot pigweed) and approximately 24 cm tall 4 WAP (45% taller than redroot pigweed). In contrast, common waterhemp had not emerged 2 WAP, and plant dry weight 4 WAP was approximately I I and 26% those of Palmer amaranth and redroot pigweed, respectively. Final plant height ranged from 58 (tumble pigweed) to 208 cm (Palmer amaranth). Redroot pigweed, smooth pigweed, common waterhemp, and Palmer amaranth plants each produced over 250,000 seeds plant(-1). Spiny amaranth and tumble pigweed produced approximately 114,000 and 50,000 seeds plant(-1), respectively. Common waterhemp produced 535 seeds g(-1) of total plant dry weight; this seed production was 1.4-, 1.4-, 2.0-, 3.4-, and 3.4-fold greater than those of redroot pigweed, smooth pigweed, Palmer amaranth, tumble pigweed, and spiny amaranth, respectively. Because the timing for many postemergence herbicides depends on weed height, rapid growth shortly after emergence reduces the time frame for optimum control of species such as Palmer amaranth. Delayed emergence also could result in escaped common waterhemp. Escape of only a few plants could result in a rapid increase in seed populations in the soil seed bank and may select for late-emerging biotypes.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	2003	51	3					329	333		10.1614/0043-1745(2003)051[0329:CGOSAS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000183094600008						
J	Eriksson, I; Teketay, D; Granstrom, A				Eriksson, I; Teketay, D; Granstrom, A			Response of plant communities to fire in an Acacia woodland and a dry Afromontane forest, southern Ethiopia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												To understand the role of fire in degrading tropical dry forest ecosystems of north-east Africa, fire potential was studied within two vegetation types: Acacia woodland and dry Afromontane forest. Fire behaviour was analysed in experimental fires late in the dry season (February) and the potential response of the soil seed bank was studied on samples taken before and after fire treatment. Bark thickness was also measured, as an indication of fire-resistance, on a suit of tree/shrub species representing the two vegetation types and an ecotone between them. The total fuel biomass differed only marginally between the two vegetation types. But biomass of the litter fuel differed significantly, and the biomass of litter fuel was two times greater in the Acacia woodland (673 g m(-2)) than in the dry Afromontane forest (308 g m(-2)). In contrast, the biomass of woody fine fuels was four times greater in the dry Afromontane forest (300 g m(-2)) than in the Acacia woodland (76 g m- 2) and the biomass of live fine fuels was also several times greater in the dry Afromontane forest (110 g m(-2)),compared with the Acacia woodland (15 g m-2). During experimental fires in the Acacia woodland, fuel consumption was 100% for all burned plots, but in the dry Afromontane forest fuel consumption ranged between 10 and 40% of the available fuel within the plots. The results from the soil seed bank study indicated little if any impact from fire. There was a gradual increase in bark thickness of trees when going from the dry Afromontane forest over the ecotone towards the Acacia woodland site. Considering all species analysed, bark thickness of trees 15 cm in diameter at I m height ranged from 2.4 to 15.4 mm. Therefore, based on the differences in microclimate, fuels, fire behaviour and bark thickness the Acacia woodland was determined to be the most fire prone as well as fire resilient ecosystem. In contrast, sustained combustion was unlikely at the studied dry Afromontane forest site. Spread of fire was not possible due to the high fuel moisture content and poor fuel bed. Forest fragmentation and intentional burning of grasslands, followed by an altered microclimate, should however increase the probability of fires penetrating the dry Afromontane forest.

J	Pickup, M; McDougall, KL; Whelan, RJ				Pickup, M; McDougall, KL; Whelan, RJ			Fire and flood: Soil-stored seed bank and germination ecology in the endangered Carrington Falls Grevillea (Grevillea rivularis, Proteaceae)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Seed germination is dependent on the interaction between the dormancy state of a seed and the presence of favourable environmental conditions. Thus, the spectacular pulse of seedling recruitment in many Australian vegetation communities following disturbances such as fire can be attributed to changes in microsite conditions and/or the dormancy-breaking effect of the disturbance on accumulated seed banks. Grevillea rivularis is a threatened species endemic to the area immediately above Carrington Falls in the NSW Southern Highlands. Most of the population is confined to the riparian vegetation zone in woodland and heath, and is therefore subject to periodic disturbance from fire and flood. For this species, a pulse of seedling recruitment has been recorded after fire, flood and mechanical soil disturbance. The aims of this study were to examine the density and vertical distribution of the soil-stored seed bank and to investigate the role of heat and scarification as cues for germination of fresh and soil-stored seed. There was a large seed bank under the canopies of established individuals (194 +/- 73 seeds m(-2)) and most seeds were found in the 0-2 cm and leaf-litter layers of the soil profile. The germination response of soil-stored and fresh seed was examined using a hierarchical series of laboratory experiments. Seeds of G. rivularis showed marked dormancy polymorphism. Thirty-six percent of soil-stored seed germinated without treatment, whereas no untreated fresh seeds germinated. Scarification or heating caused significant germination of dormant soil-stored seed, but only scarification resulted in germination of dormant fresh seeds. These results highlight important differences in the dormancy state of soil-stored and fresh seed. Thus, being a riparian species in a fire-prone environment, the dormancy mechanisms in seeds of G. rivularis suit this species to disturbance by both fire and flood.

J	Wardle, GM				Wardle, GM			Experimental determination of seed emergence and carry-over in the soil seed bank of the herbaceous perennial, Trachymene incisa (Apiaceae)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Many populations of herbaceous perennial plants contain seeds stored in a soil seed bank. The contribution of seeds to population persistence is an important parameter in population models but germination rates of known-age seeds are difficult to obtain because individual seeds cannot easily be followed. Although Trachymene incisa Rudge plants produce copious seeds that are dispersed into the soil, the existence of a seed bank has not been confirmed. To quantify the potential for a seed bank fresh seeds of T. incisa were sown into experimental seed banks in the eucalypt-dominated Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney, NSW. A recent fire provided the opportunity to compare germination in the burnt and unburnt vegetation. Density of seed sowing and time of maturation/dispersal of seeds were manipulated in 75 seed cages. Emergence of seeds after 5 months was significantly higher for the earliest planting date but after 1 year, germination of seeds planted in the later weeks increased, and the final germination for all weeks was 28%. Density of sowing and the recent fire did not affect emergence. A second experiment planted over a broader time span (9 weeks instead of 3 weeks) confirmed the effect of planting date but also found significant spatial variation on a scale of tens of metres. Laboratory germination rates of over 70% confirmed that the seeds were viable and non-dormant when sown in the field cages. The carry-over of non-germinated seed in the soil seed bank is estimated to be about 70% after 2 years, implying that a cohort of seeds would not be depleted through germination alone for up to 40 years. The potential for a long-lived seed bank in this species is interesting because the plants are also capable of resprouting from their rootstock after fire, giving them characteristics of both resprouters and seeders.

I. 2003. The biology of Canadian weeds. 120. Neslia paniculata (L.) Desv. Can. J. Plant Sci. 83: 441-451. A review of biological information is provided for Neslia paniculata. Native to central Eurasia, this species is naturalized in other temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. In North America it is most abundant in Canada's prairie provinces, but has spread west and north to British Columbia, Alaska, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, and to scattered locations in eastern Canada and the northern United States. It is typically a summer annual weed of disturbed soils. Its growth habit and persistence in the seed bank have enabled it to spread as an adventive and to maintain its presence in cultivated areas. While it is present in relatively low frequency as a weed in most crops its indehiscent seed pods can contaminate harvested crops and spread in seed commodities. The small size of its seed pods and the similarity of its seeds to those of canola and condiment mustard have led to its regulation as a significant contaminant of commercial seed. It is generally well controlled by herbicides (e.g., sulfonylureas, glyphosate, MCPA, bromoxynil, and 2 4-D); however, a population resistant to metsulfuron-methyl, one of the Group 2 herbicides that inhibit acetolactate synthase (ALS), was found at a site in Alberta in 1998.																	0008-4220					APR	2003	83	2					441	451		10.4141/P02-076							WOS:000183038500029

We explored extinction risks of Hypericum cumulicola , a fire-dependent plant endemic to the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida (U.S.A). Stochastic and deterministic matrix population models based on six censuses (1994-1999) and data from several germination and seedling survival experiments were used to compare H. cumulicola demography and extinction probabilities under different fire regimes. Environmental variation associated with site, year, and winter precipitation was included in these models. We estimated time to extinction of unburned populations of different sizes and the probabilities of extinction under no fire, different regular fire-return intervals, and alternating short and long fire-return intervals. Following an initial fire, even relatively large populations of thousands of individuals may become locally extinct within 300-400 years without additional fires. Extinction probability declined as intervals between fires decreased. Fire intervals of >50 years resulted in an appreciable extinction probability after 200 years. Cycles of highly staggered short and long fire-return intervals caused slightly higher chances of extinction than regular fire-return intervals. The simulations were sensitive to estimates of survival in the seed bank. Active management will be required to restore favorable fire regimes in areas where fire has been suppressed. To maintain biodiversity, managers should consider variable fire regimes to match the requirements of a variety of species with different life histories.

J	Mayor, MD; Boo, RM; Pelaez, DV; Elia, OR				Mayor, MD; Boo, RM; Pelaez, DV; Elia, OR			Seasonal variation of the soil seed bank of grasses in central Argentina as related to grazing and shrub cover	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The objectives of this research were to (a) study seasonal variation of the seed bank of grasses in two areas with different grazing history, (b) analyse the effect of the presence of shrubs on the seed bank and (c) study seed viability and dormancy in buried seeds of Piptochaetium napostaens and Stipa tenuis. The seed density of grasses was in general low and showed seasonal variation. Most of the grasses showed maximum seed density in December when seed dispersal occurs. Shrub cover did not show a marked influence in seed accumulation. The relatively high number of damaged seeds suggests that predation may be an important factor in seed bank dynamics in the Caldenal. Seeds of dominant perennial forage grasses showed dormancy that could explain, at least in part, persistence of these species in spite of periodical disturbance.

J	Stark, KE; Lundholm, JT; Larson, DW				Stark, KE; Lundholm, JT; Larson, DW			Relationships between seed banks and spatial heterogeneity of North American alvar vegetation	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												This is the first quantitative study of seed bank characteristics in North American alvar habitats. We assessed seed bank density, species richness, and species composition in 75 plots distributed among five alvar sites in Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada, each of which displayed areas of high and low vegetation cover within the alvar and a fully forested perimeter area. Forested habitats immediately adjacent to alvar patches contained minimal seed banks for species restricted to the alvar patches. Open alvars contained less than 1% seeds from woody forest species. This suggests that forest is not invading adjacent alvar habitat via seeds and that adjacent forest does not contain a reservoir of alvar seeds. When compared to areas on the alvar with high vascular plant cover, areas with low cover contained a slightly smaller viable seed bank, but seed banks from high and low vegetation cover plots had similar species composition and species richness. High vegetation cover plots had slightly higher mean and maximum soil depths compared with low cover plots, but no differences in other physical and chemical parameters. Thus, spatial heterogeneity in plant cover is associated only weakly with heterogeneity in below-ground factors. Despite the availability of seed and soil resources, vegetation dynamics are constrained in areas with low plant cover, and thus alvar community development seems to respond non-linearly to resource availability.

We selected 10 sampling plots at three altitudinal levels (1200 m, 1600 m and 2200 m). We assessed the composition of the established vegetation and took ten compound soil samples (0 - 5 cm depth) at each plot in autumn and spring. The soil samples were sieved, chilled, and incubated in a glasshouse to assess the composition of the seed bank. The similarity between the composition of the seed bank flora and that of the established vegetation was low throughout the gradient. Most species did not change their seed bank strategy along the gradient. Seed bank richness and density increased with altitude. Most species had a persistent seed bank at all altitudinal levels, and the proportion of such species increased with altitude. These results suggest that a cold climate directly and/or indirectly favours the formation of seed banks and seed persistence in the soil.

J	Walker, LR; Clarkson, BD; Silvester, WB; Clarkson, BR				Walker, LR; Clarkson, BD; Silvester, WB; Clarkson, BR			Colonization dynamics and facilitative impacts of a nitrogen-fixing shrub in primary succession	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Whether nitrogen-fixing plants facilitate or inhibit species change in primary succession is best resolved by examining their impacts throughout the plant's entire life cycle from arrival to senescence. We experimentally examined two aspects of the successional impacts of a nitrogen-fixing shrub, Coriaria arborea, on Mt. Tarawera, a volcano in New Zealand: factors limiting Coriaria colonization and impacts of Coriaria-induced soil changes on a later successional tree, Griselinia littoralis. Coriaria germination was promoted by artificial wind protection and by the presence of heath shrubs. Transplanted Coriaria seedlings survived only if nodulated with Frankia, and the addition of Coriaria-enriched soils slowed Coriaria seedling growth and did not improve seedling survival. This explained why Coriaria seedlings were found mostly in protected habitats away from adult Coriaria, and suggested that Coriaria thickets are not self-replacing. Coriaria increased soil fertility by developing a 4 cm thick organic soil horizon that was richer in nitrogen (tenfold) and phosphorus (threefold) than pre-Coriaria stages. These soil changes resulted in three- to sixfold increases in growth of Griselinia when it was grown in Coriaria-enriched soils in a glasshouse. Coriaria's net effect on primary succession is facilitative, but the establishment of Coriaria is itself facilitated by the amelioration of the physical habitat by earlier colonists, suggesting facilitation is important throughout the life cycle of Coriaria. Sequential facilitative events determine the order of species replacements in this study but inhibition, linked to the developmental stages of Cariaria, may determine the rate of species change.

J	Laughlin, DC				Laughlin, DC			Lack of native propagules in a Pennsylvania, USA, limestone prairie seed bank: Futile hopes for a role in ecological restoration	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												The highly threatened limestone prairies of Pennsylvania, USA, will be lost from the landscape entirely unless they are soon protected and restored. Several studies have demonstrated that seed banks can be useful in the restoration of native plant communities. If native prairie propagules are still present in the soil of an early successional forest, which was once prairie according to aerial photographs from 1949, then it may be possible to remove the invading woody plants and utilize the seed bank for limestone prairie seedling recruitment. The soil seed bank of a limestone prairie in central Pennsylvania was analyzed by extracting soil cores from the current prairie, the edge of the prairie, and the surrounding forest. The seedling emergence method was used to germinate seeds for species identification. Although viable seeds of 12 native prairie species were present in soil samples from within the limestone prairie, only 9 and 4 native prairie species were present in the edge and surrounding forest soils, respectively. Thus, the richness of prairie propagules in the soil seed bank declined since the onset of woody plant invasion. Moreover, no viable seeds of Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Tort., the dominant grass of limestone prairies, were detected, even within the prairie. Therefore, the soil seed bank of limestone prairies in Pennsylvania cannot be expected to contribute significantly to seedling recruitment during restoration efforts. As a rule of thumb, if the dominant or co-dominant plant species in a community does not generate a large and/or long-lived seed bank, then recruitment from the seed bank is not a viable method for ecological restoration.

J	Van Buren, R; Harper, KT				Van Buren, R; Harper, KT			Demographic and environmental relations of two rare Astragalus species endemic to Washington County, Utah: Astragalus holmgreniorum and A-ampullarioides	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Two endemic locoweeds of Washington Comity, Utah, Astragalus holmgreniorum and A. ampullarioides, were recently listed as federally endangered plant species (Federal Register 2001). They both occur in few, small populations surrounded by increasing human activity in the St. George, Utah, area Demographic and habitat studies have been ongoing since 1992 and results of those studies are presented here. Astragalus holmgreniorum (Holmgren locoweed) is presently limited to 1 larger population and 2 smaller, isolated populations oil the eastern and western edges of its range. It is a short-lived perennial that grows primarily oil the Virgin limestone member of the Moenkopi Formation. Density of A. holmgreniorum over the 10-year study averaged about 2 plants per m(2). The number of living plants of this species perhaps never exceeds 10,000. In drought years A. holmgreniorum populations are as much as 95% smaller than in years with adequate water, and few plants produce flowers that successfully contribute to the seed bank. Astragalus ampullarioides (Shivwits locoweed) occurs in 4 populations where plant density fluctuated between 0.5 and 4.8 plants per m(2) during our study period (average = 2.6). This locoweed is restricted to clay soils of the Chinle Formation. Direct threats to both Astragalus species include widespread urbanization, road construction, population fragmentation, and off-highway vehicle use. Indirect threats include competition from aggressive, introduced annual species such as Bromus rubens, B. tectorum, Malcolmia africana, and Erodium cicutarium. Our data show that 3 of 4 species most closely associated with these Astragalus species are introduced. Studies of seed banks and reproduction biology, as well as continued monitoring of these Astragalus species, are critically needed. Studies of the consequences of competition from alien and native species oil seedling establishment of these locoweeds are especially needed.																	1527-0904					APR	2003	63	2					236	243									WOS:000182734600010

A review of bat/plant dispersal interactions revealed that 15 species of Cecropia are consumed by 32 species of bats. In French Guiana, bats were captured in primary and secondary forests, yielding 936 fecal samples with diaspores, among which 162 contained fruits of C. obtusa, C. palmata, and C. sciadophylla. A comparative morphological and anatomical study of fruits and seeds taken directly from herbarium specimens, bat feces, and an experimental soil seed bank was made. Contrary to previous reports, the dispersal unit of Cecropia is the fruit not the seed. Bats consume the infructescence, digest pulp derived from the enlarged, fleshy perianth, and defecate the fruits. The mucilaginous pericarp of Cecropia is described. The external mucilage production of Cecropia may facilitate endozoochory. The exocarp and part of the mesocarp may be lost after passage through the digestive tract of bats, but fruits buried for a year in the soil seed bank remain structurally unchanged. Fruit characters were found to be useful for identifying species of bat-dispersed Cecropia. Bat dispersal is not necessary for seed germination but it increases seed survival and subsequent germination. Fruit structure plays a significant role in seed longevity.																	0002-9122					MAR	2003	90	3					388	403		10.3732/ajb.90.3.388							WOS:000183133100008	21659132

The importance of intrinsic (seed production, dispersal ability and habitat specificity) and extrinsic factors (weed competition) acting to restrict the distribution of this threatened species were investigated with a field experiment, demographic monitoring and soil seed bank analysis. I. exilis is not confined to its present site because of high habitat specificity, but rather is limited-by low seed production and limited dispersal as well as by competition with invasive weeds. Conservation management of this critically endangered species should focus on controlling weeds and on establishing new populations in suitable weed-free habitat. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the past habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity have been threatened by over-exploitation; in the future depopulation may lead to partial abandonment. The soil seed bank was examined to see whether there are sufficient species represented as persistent seeds to reconstitute the vegetation in the event of habitat deterioration. There were differences between seed banks from different soils and vegetation types but essentially all soil seed banks contained few species and low densities of seed. Moreover, the species in the seed bank were unrepresentative of the vegetation. During future periods of changing land use it will be important to maintain the existing vegetation. There are however indications of successful recent conservation management. Annuals are abundant in the woodland seed bank but absent from the vegetation. The forest is recovering from the disturbance of collecting fire-wood. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Germination of seeds, seed banks, and vegetative sprouts were studied in one Betula nana L., one Vaccinium uliginosum L., and two Campanula rotundifolia L. habitats in Svalbard. For comparison, one islet and three alpine habitats in northern Norway were studied. In each habitat, 50 soil cores (9.6 cm(2)) were collected and placed in a phytotron for germination tests. In Svalbard, no germinable seeds or seed bank of the three species were observed, whereas vegetative sprout densities were 83, 1060, and 21-1060/m(2) for B. nana, V uliginosum, and C rotundifolia, respectively. In northern Norway, germination percentages of the collected seeds were 59, 10-27, and 15-40%, seed bank densities of seedlings 21-2765, 21-187, and 21-374/m(2), and vegetative sprouts densities 94-206, 56-674, and 94-711/m(2) for B. nana, V uliginosum, and C rotundifolia, respectively. Less thermophilous plant species produced germinable seeds in Svalbard, as 1247-5405 seedlings/m(2) of 26 species germinated from the soil cores. In comparison, 5322-9626 seedlings/m(2) of 43 species germinated in soil cores from the alpine habitats and 3534 seedlings/m(2) of 26 species from the islet habitat. The results suggest that the most thermophilous species in Svalbard rarely produce germinable seeds under the present climatic conditions.

There was a significant difference in the proportion of infested acorns in the three plots in a low crop year, but not in a mast year. Within oakwoods on the southeast-facing slope, the insect infestation rate on the upper slope was significantly higher than on the lower slope, but not in the northwest-facing plot. Infestation rate in the low crop year in all three plots was significantly higher than infestation in the mast year. Most of the early fallen acorns had a higher proportion of insect infestation, and in the mast year it was much more obvious than in the low crop year. The proportion of infested acorns in seed bank along the topographic gradient showed a similar decreasing trend with acorn fall time, but the proportion on the upper slope was the highest and the proportion on the lower slope was the lowest. Larval emergence from acorns commenced just after acorns fell from the trees and lasted for 40-50 days, with peak emergence occurring from 24 to 32 days after acorn rain began. We conclude that insect-infested acorn distribution in Q. liaotungensis shows spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and an early drop of infested acorns can be a short-term defensive strategy against insect infestation.																	0912-3814					MAR	2003	18	2					155	164		10.1046/j.1440-1703.2003.00543.x							WOS:000182081900005						
J	Kramberger, B; Klemencic, S				Kramberger, B; Klemencic, S			Effect of harvest date on the chemical composition and nutritive value of Cerastium holosteoides	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												Cerastium holosteoides is a short-lived plant often found in small proportions on dry and mesotropic semi-natural, species-rich grassland communities. To obtain more information about its nutritive value, two experiments on Arrhenatheretum elatioris grassland were carried out to examine the effect of harvest date on in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF), acid-detergent fibre (ADF), acid-detergent lignin (ADL), estimated net energy for lactation (NEL) and crude protein (CP) concentrations of C. holosteoides , and selection of this plant by dairy cows grazing on semi-natural grassland. C. holosteoides starts flowering in spring and continuously develops new flowers on new branches throughout the summer. Harvests were made in relation to particular growth stages of Dactylis glomerata present in the sward: (A) tillering; (B) stem elongation; (C) ear emergence; (D) flowering; and (E) ripening. Chemical composition and nutritive value were evaluated in 1998 and 1999. With advancing maturity, IVOMD of C. holosteoides decreased from 0.771 at growth stage A to 0.485 at growth stage E. At the same time, CP concentration decreased from 153 to 69 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM) and estimated NEL concentration from 6.00 to 4.07 MJ kg(-1) DM. With advancing maturity, there was a significant increase in NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations. In the summer harvest season, C. holosteoides contained significantly higher NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations, lower NEL concentration and had a lower IVOMD value than in the spring. Differences between years were also found for IVOMD and for NDF, ADF, ADL and NEL concentrations. In a grazing experiment in the year 1999, at growth stage B, Simmental cows grazed an A. elatioris sward in which the main species was D. glomerata (0.092), and the proportion of C. holosteoides was 0.034. C. holosteoides was, on average, grazed by cows to the same relative extent as other species in the sward.																	0142-5242					MAR	2003	58	1					12	16		10.1046/j.1365-2494.2003.00346.x							WOS:000183958800002						
J	Gutierrez, JR; Meserve, PL				Gutierrez, JR; Meserve, PL			El Nino effects on soil seed bank dynamics in north-central Chile	OECOLOGIA												The soil seed bank was monitored in four 75x75 m plots over 6 years (1990-1995) in an arid thorn scrub community in north-central Chile. Sixty-six species were identified. Total seed densities ranged from 2,000 to 42,000/m(2). Average mass of shrub seeds was significantly greater than that of other growth-forms. Between 70 and 90% of the seeds were less than 1 mg, with those in the 0.51-1.00 mg size class being most numerous. Seed densities were highly variable between years as well as within years, but were also closely associated with plant cover patterns and rainfall regime. Higher seed densities were found in wet years, and in samples taken in early summer and early autumn (i.e., after seed set); the lowest seed densities were in late winter (i.e., after annual plant germination). The annual plant species with the highest cover were also the most abundant in the soil seed bank and exhibited the largest seed density fluctuations. In general, seed densities were 5- to 10-fold higher during the 1991-1992 El Nino/southern oscillation (ENSO) years than non-ENSO years, showing the importance of this phenomenon for seed bank replenishment in the arid region of Chile.																	0029-8549					MAR	2003	134	4					511	517		10.1007/s00442-002-1156-5							WOS:000181582700008	12647123					
J	Ambrose, LG; Wilson, SD				Ambrose, LG; Wilson, SD			Emergence of the introduced grass Agropyron cristatum and the native grass Bouteloua gracilis in a mixed-grass prairie restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Prairie restoration at the northern edge of the Great Plains can be frustrated by previously established non-native perennial grasses. We compared the emergence of a widely introduced grass, Agropyron cristatum , and a common native grass, Bouteloua gracilis , in a 4-year-old field experiment in which the Agropyron -dominated vegetation had either been left intact or treated annually with herbicide. This was done at two levels of water supply, reflecting conditions expected in wet and dry years, to examine the effects of among-year variability in precipitation. Water addition significantly increased the emergence of both surface-sown and buried (1 cm deep) seeds. Herbicide treatment of neighbors did not increase the emergence of experimentally added seeds. Emergence was much greater for buried (80%) than surface-sown seeds (20%). Significantly more Bouteloua than Agropyron germinated from experimentally buried seeds. Whereas only a single seedling of Bouteloua emerged from the existing seed bank, the mean density of Agropyron seedlings emerging from the seed bank was 930/m(2) (range, 0 to 6,455/m(2)). Surprisingly, the emergence of Agropyron from the seed bank was not decreased by 4 years of herbicide treatment, possibly because herbicide may release Agropyron from intraspecific competition and allow increased seed production to compensate for decreased plant abundance. In summary, we found few differences between Agropyron and Bouteloua in spring and summer emergence at high or low water availability. The persistence of Agropyron stands despite repeated herbicide application may be partly due to increased seed production.

It has been suggested that seed shape should also be linked to the ease of burial and, thus, to seed persistence, even if some studies failed to show this. The relationship between seed size and shape and persistence in soil was analysed for 259 species of the Italian flora, belonging to a wide range of habitats, from alpine pasture to limestone prairies and meadows of the Prealps, and from woodlands to Mediterranean maquis and garigues. Seed size was related to persistence in soil in the same way as in most other floras examined. Furthermore, seed shape was highly related to persistence in soil among the species analysed, when considered both altogether and divided among the different habitats. Our results suggest that not only seed size, but also seed shape, are key factors in determining seed fate and seed persistence in soil.

We tested whether these variables were robust predictors of seed persistence in the soil for 58 abundant herbaceous species, primarily annuals, in grass and scrubland of central Spain. Seed persistence was estimated from data on germinable seed banks, while seed weight and shape were measured using fresh seeds collected in the study area. There was a significant tendency for species with persistent seeds to have smaller seeds than species with transient seeds. Seed shape was not, however, related to persistence and we did not find any clear seed weight/shape threshold for predicting persistence. The binary logistic model of seed bank type as a function of seed weight was significant and explained 67% of total variability. Supplementary information about dormancy, environmental conditions of habitat, predation and attack by pathogens has to be used to elaborate more accurate general predictive models of seed persistence.

J	Mickelson, JA; Stougaard, RN				Mickelson, JA; Stougaard, RN			Assessment of soil sampling methods to estimate wild oat (Avena fatua) seed bank populations	WEED SCIENCE												Accurate and precise estimation of weed seed bank populations is critical to studying to (1) examine the spatial distribution of wild oat seed banks on a small scale (1 m(2) plots), (2) compare wild oat seed bank density sample means and precision between two soil samplers, and (3) predict the sample area needed to quantify a range of wild oat seed bank densities at several levels of precision. Seed bank sample means obtained with a large sampler (10- by 10-cm box) were greater than means obtained with a small sampler (4.4- or 3.8-cm-diam cylinder) for 15 of 18 seed banks. There was no clear advantage in precision (SE/mean) when sampling seed banks using a large number of small soil samples rather than using a small number of large soil samples. Furthermore, at very low seed bank densities, using a small number of large samples gave better precision. Precision improved as sample number increased for each seed bank at each site-year. High-density seed banks tended to have better precision than low-density seed banks at any given sample number. Seed banks had an aggregated spatial distribution when sampled with either soil sampler. As the desired precision level decreases (becomes more precise), the predicted sample area required increases greatly. A seed bank containing 6,000 seeds m(-2) has a predicted sample area of 0.5, 0.7, 1.3, and 2.9% of the total area to obtain precision levels of 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	2003	51	2					226	230		10.1614/0043-1745(2003)051[0226:AOSSMT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000181737400014						
J	Gleason, RA; Euliss, NH; Hubbard, DE; Duffy, WG				Gleason, RA; Euliss, NH; Hubbard, DE; Duffy, WG			Effects of sediment load on emergence of aquatic invertebrates and plants from wetland soil egg and seed banks	WETLANDS												Intensive agricultural activities near prairie wetlands may result in excessive sediment loads, which may bury seed and invertebrate egg banks that are important for maintenance and cycling of biotic communities during wet/dry cycles. We evaluated effects of sediment burial on emergence of plants and invertebrates from seed and invertebrate egg banks. Sediment-load experiments indicated that burial depths of 0.5 cm caused a 91.7% reduction in total seedling emergence and a 99.7% reduction in total invertebrate emergence. Results of our burial experiments corroborated prior research on seedling emergence. However, our study demonstrated that invertebrate emergence is also highly susceptible to the effects of burial. Our research suggests that sediment entering wetlands from agricultural erosion may also hamper successional changes throughout interannual climate cycles. Land-management strategies need to be implemented that will prevent erosion of cropland top soil from entering wetlands.																	0277-5212					MAR	2003	23	1					26	34		10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0026:EOSLOE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000181785300003						
J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM			Seed germination and propagation of Xyris tennesseensis, a federal endangered wetland species	WETLANDS												The recovery plan for the U.S. federally endangered Xyris tennesseensis calls for increasing the size of some existing populations and establishing new ones in suitable sites. As a contribution to this goal, we investigated seed dormancy and germination and attempted to propagate the species in non-native soil. Freshly matured seeds were conditionally dormant and germinated to 0, 0, 92, 91, and 74% in light after two weeks at 15/6, 20/10, 25/15, 30/15, and 35/20degreesC, respectively. Seeds retained the ability to germinate to 80-100% in light at 25/15 and at 30/15degreesC throughout a 39.5-month period of burial in an unheated greenhouse. Following the first year of burial, however, germination at 20/10degreesC showed an annual cycle, with 79-86% of the seeds germinating in spring but only 0-1% in autumn. Under natural temperature regimes, seeds sown on native soil germinated from mid-May to early August. Seeds had an absolute light requirement for germination, and those incubated at 30/15degreesC required six days of light (14-hour daily photoperiod) to subsequently germinate in darkness. The species has a small persistent soil seed bank. Although no dormancy-breaking treatments are required for seeds to germinate to high percentages in light at high temperatures, growing seedlings/juveniles in non-native soil is very difficult. Seeds germinated during summer when sown on both inorganic and black organic soils, with and without the addition of lime, but few seedlings lived for more than one month. Only two of 125 juveniles lived for two months after they were transplanted from native soil into black organic soil. One strategy to increase the number of plants at a site may be to remove litter and sow seeds on the surface of undisturbed soil in late spring-summer.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2003	23	1					116	124		10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0116:SGAPOX]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000181785300011						
J	Wurster, FC; Cooper, DJ; Sanford, WE				Wurster, FC; Cooper, DJ; Sanford, WE			Stream/aquifer interactions at Great Sand Dunes National Monument, Colorado: influences on interdunal wetland disappearance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Between 1937 and 1995 a complex of more than 100 interdunal wetlands disappeared from Great Sand Dunes National Monument, Colorado. We investigated three hypotheses that could explain Welland disappearance: (1) dune movement during a severe drought in the 1950s buried the wetlands, (2) agriculture related ground water pumping lowered the regional water table, and (3) changes in local hydrologic processes led to wetland loss. We used regional stream flow records, ground water level measurements, natural stable isotope analyses, soil stratigraphy, buried seed banks, and ground water modeling to address these hypotheses. Hydrologic data and stable isotope analyses illustrated the interaction between Sand Creek, a nearby stream, and the unconfined aquifer in the area where wetlands occurred. When the intermittent Sand Creek flows, seepage through its bed creates a large ground water mound under the creek. The seasonal development and dispersion of this mound propagates pressure waves through the aquifer that influence ground water levels up to 2 km from Sand Creek. Our data suggest the primary factors contributing to wetland disappearance were recent climatic fluctuations and incision of the Sand Creek channel. Below average stream flow between 1950 and 1980 reduced the duration of Sand Creek flow across the dune complex, minimizing ground water mound development. Consequently, the water table in the unconfined aquifer dropped similar to 1.0 m and interdunal wetlands dried up. Twentieth Century incision of Sand Creek's channel reduced ground water mound height similar to 2.5 m, decreasing seasonal water table fluctuations at interdunal wetlands and contributing to the overall water table decline. Longterm wet and dry cycles affect the water table elevation more than channel incision, leading us to conclude that many interdunal wetlands are ephemeral features. Wetland area is maximized during consecutive years of above average Sand Creek discharge and minimized as the water table drops during dry periods. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Hill, SJ; French, K				Hill, SJ; French, K			Response of the soil seed-bank of Cumberland Plain Woodland to heating	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Soil was investigated in a Cumberland Plain Woodland community to determine the presence of a soil seed-bank and whether species richness and abundance of plants germinating from it were affected by heating such as that experienced in a fire. Soil samples were taken from the Holsworthy Military Area, in the south-eastern region of the Sydney Basin, New South Wales, Australia, and one of four treatments was applied; soil was heated to 80degreesC, 40degreesC, unheated or unheated with litter not removed. Sixty-eight species, representing 26 families including 11 exotic and 57 native species germinated from the soil. Herbs and grasses dominated and were in similar proportions to those surveyed in the above-ground vegetation, suggesting that the soil seed-bank reflected the current structure of the vegetation, although species composition differed. Species responded differently to heating. The seeds of some species germinated when heated at a higher temperature (80degreesC), particularly those from the family Fabaceae, whereas other species were more common in unheated or lightly heated samples (40degreesC). This suggests that fire is likely to change the species composition of the above-ground vegetation and indicates that management must ensure that species that do not germinate when heated are maintained, as well as those species that germinate following heating. A large proportion of soil seed-bank species showed low germination rates in the trials, and 112 above-ground species did not germinate in the soil samples. We do not understand whether species of these two sets do not produce a soil-stored seed-bank or whether the seed-bank has been depleted by past practices at Holsworthy. Further research is needed.

J	Warton, DI; Wardle, GM				Warton, DI; Wardle, GM			Site-to-site variation in the demography of a fire-affected perennial, Acacia suaveolens, at Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, New South Wales, Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Acacia suaveolens (Sm.) Willd is a perennial shrub that forms even-aged stands, recruited from a soil seed-bank following fire. It has previously been subject to demographic studies, which used a space-for-time substitution to investigate temporal patterns following fire. In the present study the potential for spatial variation across sites was investigated by sampling at several similarly aged populations in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, northern Sydney, Australia. Significant variation in mean size and fecundity of A. suaveolens individuals was observed among sites, over a 2-4.6-fold range in plant size, and a sevenfold range in mean fecundity. The observed variation at 3 years after fire encapsulated most of the variation previously observed among sites 0-17 years since fire, emphasizing the importance of spatial variation in this species. For each site a two-stage (seed, plant) matrix model was constructed, and projected from 3 to 25 years following fire. Population growth was measured as number of seeds per 3-year-old plant, and found to vary 1.4-fold across models for different sites. This site-to-site variation, as well as that in size, fecundity and survival, was statistically significant. Variation in projected seeds per plant could mostly be attributed to differences in fecundity rather than plant survival. Sensitivity analyses emphasized the biological significance of the variation in fecundity. Whereas previous studies have focused on temporal variation, this work demonstrates the importance of extending our understanding of a species to include the spatial component of population dynamics.

J	Price, JN; Morgan, JW				Price, JN; Morgan, JW			Mechanisms controlling establishment of the non-bradysporous Banksia integrifolia (Coast Banksia) in an unburnt coastal woodland	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Remnant stands of the non-bradysporous Banksia integrifolia on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria appear to be in decline due to old age and other unknown factors. Many stands have been unburnt for >55-100 years and there is little evidence of successful regeneration by seed. The cause(s) for this lack of recruitment are unclear. In the present study we quantified (i) seed production and germinability in four remnant forests in the region; (ii) the microsite conditions necessary for seedling emergence; and (iii) the effect of herbivore browsing on early seedling survival in order to understand this apparent recruitment failure. Despite large intra-annual variation, no evidence was found that old forest trees do not produce viable seed. Emergence and survival of seedlings were not inhibited by the presence of groundlayer vegetation. Rather, vegetation facilitated early seedling survival by providing protection from browsing. Seedling transplants exhibited extremely high mortality (greater than or equal to75%) due to browsing and summer soil desiccation and these factors appear to be major contributors to the lack of recruitment at the study site. Stand-replacing recruitment is therefore considered to remain unlikely under the present conditions. Developing fire and/or grazing management regimes will be necessary to conserve the structural integrity of these coastal ecosystems.

J	Paynter, Q				Paynter, Q			Integrated weed management: effect of herbicide choice and timing of application on the survival of a biological control agent of the tropical wetland weed, Mimosa pigra	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Herbivory by Neurostrota gunniella stunts mimosa (Mimosa pigra) plants, which should diminish seedling survival during wetseason floods, reduce competition with regenerating grasses and. therefore, reduce the need for repeated herbicide applications to control mimosa regenerating from the seed bank following clearance of dense stands. Few or no mimosa plants may survive the use of fire to control dense thickets, so N. gunniella populations will be unable to persist. Therefore, for damage to regenerating seedlings to be maintained over subsequent seasons, N. gunniella populations must be rapidly reestablished. Results presented in this manuscript indicate treating regenerating mimosa seedlings with herbicide does not necessarily prevent N. gunniella larvae from completing their development, and optimal timing of herbicide application during ground spraying operations can minimize the negative impact on N. gunniella. Delaying application until approximately 2 weeks from the first appearance of leaf mines should ensure that a high proportion of N. gunniella emerge and can infest any surviving mimosa nearby. The data do not indicate any major differences in the choice of herbicide and N. gunniella survival. However, 331% of seedlings treated with tebuthiuron survived. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

J	Odom, DIS; Cacho, OJ; Sinden, JA; Griffith, GR				Odom, DIS; Cacho, OJ; Sinden, JA; Griffith, GR			Policies for the management of weeds in natural ecosystems: the case of scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius, L.) in an Australian national park	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Environmental weeds are plants that invade natural ecosystems and present a serious threat to conservation of nature. Environmental weeds have been implicated in the extinction of several indigenous plant species, and they also threaten ecosystem stability and functional complexity. Historically, emphasis in weed control in Australian national parks has been placed on chemicals, manual pulling of small plants, excluding tourists and feral animal control measures. Recently, biological control has been introduced to control weed infestations. These methods typically have been applied as funds have become available, with little opportunity to consider their long-term effectiveness. As the threat from environmental weeds is becoming more fully recognised, an integrated, strategic, ecological and economic approach to weed management is needed. A deterministic dynamic programming model is developed for this purpose in this paper. A case study for scotch broom is presented, to assess the ways in which this approach can address the policy issues that face the community in the management of an environmental weed in a national park. The model takes account of the weed population dynamics, the effectiveness and cost of control measures, and the value of the park outputs (biodiversity, recreation and grazing). The dynamic programming model includes weed density and seed bank as state variables and a budget constraint for the control variables. The model is used to derive optimal control rules for any given state of the weed population. An optimal decision rule provides a package of control measures that can be used to attack the problem each year, depending on the current weed density and seed bank. Optimal trajectories are developed for a planning horizon of 45 years, and the effect of the budget constraint is analysed. The marginal value of an extra dollar for: weed control, in terms of discounted future benefits, is estimated. It is shown that a combination of controls that targets both weed density and the seed bank is important. It is also shown (given the assumed parameters) that biological control is worth undertaking, as it appears as part of most of the optimal strategies identified. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for managing weeds in natural ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gao, LZ				Gao, LZ			The conservation of Chinese rice biodiversity: genetic erosion, ethnobotany and prospects	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												As one of important original centers of Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa L., China is abundant in genetic resources of rice and its wild relatives. They are not only useful for mountainous farmers to cope with heterogeneous microclimates, but also of extremely significance for rice genetic improvement programs in the future. Unfortunately, the combination of new conditions, including rapid population growth, new agricultural technology and swift economic & cultural changes produces a new environment. As a result, most of wild populations have disappeared, and others are at the edge of the extinction. Moreover, widespread adoption of high-yielding rice varieties (HYVs) have led to biological impoverty of rice germplasms, as local rice varieties are abandoned for modern varieties. These processes, known as "genetic erosion'', are generally summarized as two types in Chinese rice genetic resources. Based on our recent studies on the conservation of Chinese rice biodiversity, this paper reviews the biodiversity, ethnobotany and genetic erosion of rice and its wild relatives in China. Finally, some suggestions for the ways to enhance efforts to conserve rice genetic resources, including investigation of genetic erosion, studies on population genetics and conservation genetics using molecular approaches, settings of in situ & ex situ conservation priorities, significance of ethnobotanical knowledge for taking in situ conservation, and necessities of extensive participation in the conservation activities, are given.																	0925-9864					FEB	2003	50	1					17	32		10.1023/A:1022933230689							WOS:000181857600003

There are few studies of the performance of species in restored vegetation communities. Here we report the results of a meta-analysis of 25 experiments concerned with species-rich grassland restoration on ex-arable land and agriculturally improved grasslands situated at a wide range of locations throughout lowland Britain. Differences in species' performance were related to 38 physiological and morphological traits. 2. An experiment-adjusted performance index was calculated for each of the 58 species (13 grasses and 45 forbs). The performance index was calculated for the first 4 years after establishment together with a temporal trend. 3. Individual species showed large differences in performance indices. However, grasses consistently out-performed forbs. 4. We examined the linkage between species' performance and traits according to four non-exclusive hypotheses. The ability to establish and persist in restored vegetation communities requires: (H1) good gap colonization ability; (H2) strong competitive capability; and (H3) ability to undergo vegetative regeneration. (H4) Successful species are generalists associated with fertile habitats. 5. Trait analyses supported all four hypotheses. Within the forbs, good establishment in the first year was linked to traits determining colonization ability: ruderality, percentage germination of seeds and autumn germination. However, traits linked to competitive ability, vegetative growth and seed bank persistence became increasingly important determinants of success with time. Species with generalist habitat requirements, and especially those associated with fertile soils, performed increasingly well with time. This reflects the development of a closed vegetation in which the ability to grow vigorously and out-compete other established plants is important. 6. Stress-tolerators, habitat specialists and species of infertile habitats performed badly. This may reflect high residual fertility in restored grasslands and particular niche requirements of these species. This may be a problem as grassland restoration often targets communities characterized by species with these traits and many are food plants of invertebrates of conservation value. 7. There were few significant correlations between the performance of the grasses and traits reflecting their overall good performance in comparison with the forbs. 8. This study has important implications for practical restoration programmes and policies. Efficiency might be increased by introducing only species with good performance, but this would lead to uniformity among restored grasslands and would diminish the benefits of habitat restoration for national and regional biodiversity. 9. Synthesis and applications. Future work should focus on practical methods to increase the successful establishment of the poor performing but desirable species, by (i) targeting restoration to low fertility soils, (ii) changing the abiotic environment or (iii) the 'phased introduction' of species several years after restoration, when both the plant community is more stable and the environmental conditions are more favourable for establishment.

The spatial structure of plant communities can have strong impacts on ecosystem functions and on associated animal communities. None the less, spatial structure is rarely used as a measure of restoration success. 2. The restoration of hundreds of wetlands in the prairie pothole region in the mid-western USA provided an excellent opportunity to determine whether the re-establishment of abiotic conditions is sufficient to restore structure, composition and spatial patterning of the vegetation. 3. We mapped the topography and vegetative distributions in 17 restored and nine natural wetlands. We used these data to compare the composition and spatial structure of the vegetation in both wetlands types. 4. The composition of the plant communities differed between restored and natural wetlands; the restored wetlands lacked the well-developed sedge-meadow community found in most natural wetlands. However, the spatial heterogeneity was similar, although the zonation patterns were less well-developed in the restored wetlands. 5. Although the overall structure was similar, species distributions differed among wetland types, such that species were found more than 10 cm higher in restored wetlands than in natural wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study illustrates that restored plant community composition and spatial structure may converge on their targets at different rates. Evaluations of restoration success should consider spatial structure of communities along with compositional and functional metrics.

Salicornia showed high germination rates at low salinity in front of Arthrocnemum. For both species, germination was delayed with increase of salinity until 3%. Recovery experiments and tetrazolium test show that exposure to high salinity does not harm seeds and that exposure to high salinity stimulates germination of the seeds of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. Our results about viability and seed bank suggest a different behaviour because of ecological connotations. These connotations are highly influenced by the life cycle of each species.

This species has aggressive growth, competitively replacing native trees in the natural forest of the islands. The aim of this study was to examine seed and seedling factors which might confer an advantage to the establishment of Bischofia over native trees. During a 5-yr period we compared the demographic parameters of early life history of Bischofia and Elaeocarpus photiniae-folius, a native canopy dominant, in actively invaded forests. Predation of Elaeocarpus seeds by introduced rodents was much higher before (27.9-32.9%) and after (41.3-100%) dispersal of seeds than that of B. javanica. Most Elaeocarpus seeds lost viability ca. 6 mo after burial in forest soil while some seeds of Bischofia remained viable for more than 2 yr. Seedling survival in the first 2 yr was much higher in Bischofia (16%) than in Elaeocarpus (1.3%). The high persistence of Bischofia in the shade, coupled to its rapid acclimation to high light levels, is an unusual combination because in forest tree species there is generally a trade-off between seedling survival in the shade and response to canopy opening. Compared with a native canopy dominant, greater seed longevity, lower seed predation by introduced rodents, longer fruiting periods and the ability to form seedling banks under closed canopy appear to have contributed to the invasive success of Bischofia on the Bonin Islands.																	1100-9233					FEB	2003	14	1					15	24		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2003.tb02123.x							WOS:000182915300002

Nine plots were defined within a homogeneous pajonal stand, and treatments of low (LF), medium (MF) and high frequency (HF) of fire were defined by the application of one, two or four cold-season burns, respectively, along a 6-yr period. Both burned and unburned plots were exposed to grazing by cattle during the summer following the first and the third years of that period. High cattle preference for burned sites conditioned fire temperature and vegetation responses to the following burning events. Cumulative effects between successive burning events were observed for the cover of basal area of the dominant and other sprouting species, the cover and thickness of the litter layer, the seed bank size of the principal recruiter species, and the floristic composition. While light interception by the canopy was positively related to fire frequency during the early growth season, further growth of P. quadrifarium determined a greater light interception in LF than in MF and HF. These patterns of light interception were associated with a faster occupation of the inter-tussock areas by opportunistic species in plots subjected to frequent fires (HF and MF) than in plots with low fire frequency (LF), and a more lasting regrowth of P. quadrifarium in the LF plot than in the HF ones. High fire frequencies reduced the dominance of P. quadrifarium. Percent of species classified as subordinated graminoids or forbs did not vary among treatments. However, the abundance of different forb species was differentially favoured by contrasting frequencies of fire, describing some coarse relationships between their specific responses and their dispersal strategies.																	1100-9233					FEB	2003	14	1					43	54		10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0043:CEOFOA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000182915300005

Sampling the soil seedbank was carried out by using a tubular soil sampler core of 5 cm diameter, from 0 to 10 cm soil depth. Emerged weeds were scouted by placing iron quadrats (0.5x0.5 m), randomly. The number of samples required was estimated as a function of the average seeds per sample, given a required precision (CV = 20% or 40%). For the small plots, means between 10 and 20 seeds/soil sample (500 to 1,000 seeds/m(2)) and CV of 20%, it would be necessary 40 to 90 samples, respectively; with CV of 40% (lower precision), the need would be 10 to 20 samples. For the same seed number per soil sample in cropland areas, estimated sample size is about tree times higher. Emerged weed scouting presents lower data correlation between mean and variance, and was less appropriated for handling weed management decisions.																	0100-204X					FEB	2003	38	2					211	218		10.1590/S0100-204X2003000200007							WOS:000181269700007						
J	Baba, W				Baba, W			Changes in the structure and floristic composition of the limestone grasslands after cutting trees and shrubs and mowing	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The calcareous grasslands belong to the species-rich plant communities in Poland. Most of them are of anthropogenic origin and they need specific management (i.e. periodical cutting suckers of trees and shrubs, grazing or mowing) in order to protect their floristic diversity. Many of calcareous grasslands have been overgrown by shrubs as a result of cessation of traditional management. The aim of this study was to compare the structure and dynamics of xerothermic hazel shrub patches, which were undergoing secondary succession with patches where different management practices aiming at restoration of species-rich limestone grassland were applied. The managed plots had a significantly higher species richness than the control one. However, they strongly differed in their floristic composition from well-preserved limestone grasslands. There were also significant differences observed between both the managed plots. Too intensive management, particularly frequent mowing of herbs resulted in expansion of grass species such as Brachypodium pinnatum and Calamagrostis arundinacea and caused a sharp decline in species richness. The species composition and turnover rate strongly depended on succesional stage (soil layer thickness) of plots at the start of the experiment. The deeper was the soil, the higher was the rate of species turnover and the smaller was the share of xerothermic and thermophilous species. The last mentioned group was dominated by species with a persistent seed bank in the soil, frequently colonizing anthropogenic habitats.																	0001-6977						2003	72	1					61	69									WOS:000181433100008

For 40 species, seed bank persistence types could be determined. Most grassland species were found to have a short-term persistent or a transient seed bank. Sites where management had ceased were found to have a significantly higher number of seeds of Carex spp., and, at least at the long-term abandoned site, a significantly lower number of seeds of grassland herbs. The highest number of grass seeds was found at the managed site, although this was non-significant. Similarity between seed bank and vegetation decreased with increasing time since abandonment and with soil depth. Implications for restoration are discussed. This study confirms that only on recently abandoned sites can the seed bank play a significant role in meadow restoration.

In many cases, recovery of a population may primarily be determined by a single life history property or ecological interaction, allowing for straightforward management actions. For example, a generalist predator may prevent the recovery of its prey, and populations with sex-biased dispersal are particularly vulnerable to demographic stochasticity. However, linking life history with intra- and interspecific population dynamics is needed to assess the relative importance of these factors. A clear example is depensatory dynamics that can be caused either by e.g., mutual predation or cooperative breeding. Moreover, dynamics of a recovering population can alter both its physiological and behavioural traits, affecting its interspecific interactions. Here we review life histories (reproduction, resource use and dispersal) and species interactions affecting recovery processes, and discuss their implications for management.

J	Jusaitis, M; Sorensen, B; Polomka, L				Jusaitis, M; Sorensen, B; Polomka, L			Reproductive biology of the endangered Brachycome muelleri (Asteraceae), an endemic herb of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The reproductive biology of Brachycome muelleri Sonder (Asteraceae) was studied from 1995 to 1997 by using nursery and field experiments. Reproductive development and seed dispersal occupied approximately half of the 4-month growth cycle. Flowers of B. muelleri did not have any obvious self-incompatibility systems and were readily selfed to produce viable seed. It appeared that B. muelleri may be preferentially cross-pollinated under ideal conditions of pollinator visitation, but could revert to self-pollination in the event of outcross failure. Seed dispersal was assisted by the epinastic curvature of peduncles as fruit matured, bringing capitula into contact with the soil a short distance away from the parent plant. Slight wind-stimulated movement of the capitulum was sufficient to dislodge seed directly onto the soil surface. Seed was shed in the immediate vicinity of parent plants and although some short-range movement facilitated by rain splash, water flow and gravity was observed, no long-distance dispersal mechanisms were apparent. Annual seed production of the single extant population of B. muelleri in South Australia was estimated at about 5 million seeds. Immediately after dispersal, the soil seed bank in the vicinity of B. muelleri plants contained, on average, over 1700 germinable seeds m(-2). Many of these seeds germinated or died within a year, the remainder persisting into a second or third year. Seed viability under field-burial conditions declined to less than 10% over that time. Population size did not appear to be limited by seed production, but rather by seed dispersal syndrome.

The maintenance and stability of the, often abrupt, transition between Australian rainforest and non-rainforests is often attributed to fire. We use pre-germination treatments of smoke and heat on soil seed bank samples to determine plant distributions across the edge between subtropical rainforest and an adjacent eucalypt-dominated wet sclerophyll forest. Soil seed bank collections at 15 m within the eucalypt forest had both significantly higher density and diversity of seedlings than those at 30 m, at the edge itself or at any site within the rainforest. This response was most apparent when a pre-germination smoke treatment was applied. We suggest that smoke is an important germination trigger for species regenerating at this interface. Our results confirm the importance of fire in determining and maintaining the nature of this ecotone.

BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY					14th Annual Meeting of the Gesellschafr-fur-Okologie	MAY, 2001	UNIV AGR SCI, INST BOT, VIENNA, AUSTRIA	Gesell Okol	UNIV AGR SCI, INST BOT			Dormancy patterns and germination responses to incremental stratification were investigated in Verbena officinalis L. (Verbenaceae), a widely-distributed ruderal, but considered as an originally mediterranean plant. In an initial experiment, samples of seeds buried in the field were exhumed at monthly intervals over a period of 38 months and tested for germination in light and darkness at 25/15 degreesC and 1515 degreesC. Seeds were strongly dormant when fresh and mature and came out of dormancy during winter. Seeds entered conditional dormancy in spring, while main dormancy relief occurred in winter. There was no seed mortality, and no germination occurred in the soil during burial. The results imply, that V officinalis germinates preferably in late spring and has the potential to accumulate a persistent seed bank. The effects of stratification temperature and duration on dormancy were investigated in a second experiment. Dry-stored seeds were stratified wet at a range of temperatures from 3-18 degreesC in darkness for periods of up to 28 weeks, and tested over a range of constant temperatures (3-25 degreesC) and at 1515 degreesC in light, and at 25 degreesC and 1515 degreesC in the dark. Seeds came out of primary dormancy when kept at temperatures between 3-12 degreesC, while higher temperatures were ineffective in breaking dormancy. There was no induction of secondary dormancy during the stratification period of 28 weeks. We conclude that a gradual increase of the ambient temperatures and/or an increase in amplitude size is required for dormancy induction. Weakly dormant seeds required either high constant mean (> 15 degreesC), or fluctuating temperatures for germination. Only a small fraction of the seeds acquired the ability to germinate in darkness with incremental stratification. There is no indication of germination and dormancy traits that can be interpreted as relict adaptations to mediterranean conditions.																	1439-1791						2003	4	4					329	337		10.1078/1439-1791-00164							WOS:000184879400006

We investigated 36 populations from an area of approximately 900 square kilometres in a geographically well-defined region in Northwestern Germany. For these 36 populations we did not find any geographical structuring of genetic diversity. For ten out of the 36 populations we compared the genetic diversity of established population and soil seed bank from two different depths. At these ten sites we also studied differences in the species composition of soil seed bank and of established vegetation as an indicator of environmental dynamics. The corresponding results indicate that increasing dynamics of the habitat decreased the similarity between aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank and the homogeneity of the vertical distribution of seeds. Moreover, increasing environmental dynamics non-significantly increased heterozygosity. In typical, disturbed wet woodland habitats, Cardamine amara established a long-term persistent seed bank with up to 35,900 seeds m(-2). Here the overall genetic diversity stored in the seed bank was similar to the one of the actually established population. Nevertheless, wet woodland seed bank subpopulations from different depths were more similar to each other genetically than compared to the established populations. Most established and seed bank populations were genetically close to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our study demonstrates that established C. amara populations do not represent simple representative genetic subsets of the underlying seed banks.

The model is used to predict the effects of crop rotations and herbicides on the soil seed bank of Avena fatua (spring wild oat) using data obtained from the literature and from studies of the soil seed bank within the Focus on Fanning Project (FOFP) at Stoughton, Leicestershire. Interestingly, the dynamics of the seed bank in the FOFP IAFS effectively contained the broad-leaved weed infestation and neither A. fatua nor Galium aparine (cleavers) were capable of becoming problem weeds. Conversely, the two-year grass ley in the rotation probably helped to ensure that Poa annua (annual meadow grass) was present at economically significant levels. The use of the model as an aid to crop management in an IAFS by evaluating weed control sustainability as a strategy which would contain a weed infestation at or below a specified density will be described.																			1-901396-63-0				2003							521	526									WOS:000226380000072

Treatments I and 3 were immediate stubble tillage, later followed by primary tillage with a plough or cultivator. In treatment 2, the stubble tillage was delayed for four weeks and later followed by primary tillage ploughing. Treatment 4 was zero tillage. The following crop in all treatments was winter wheat. In autumn, between about 7 and mostly less than 50% of the initial rape seeds emerged, whereas volunteer emergence was less than 0.01% in spring. Depending on the treatment, a seed bank was built up reaching up to 30% of the initial number of seeds. The seed bank was largest when seeds were immediately incorporated into the soil by stubble tillage. Up to 85% of seeds could not be found; the heaviest losses occurring when the seeds remained on the soil surface for a while in treatments 2 and 4. When volunteers flowered at the same time as an oilseed rape crop, gene dispersal in space by pollen transfer was possible. Flowering volunteer plants could be observed mainly in treatments 3 and 4, at a population density of up to 0.78 plants m(-2) in treatment 3. A new generation of seeds could be produced by the volunteers that may found a further cohort of volunteers and enable gene dispersal in time or, in case of volunteers emerging in a rape crop, be harvested with the crop.

J	Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M				Bossuyt, B; Hermy, M			The potential of soil seedbanks in the ecological restoration of grassland and heathland communities	BELGIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												This study aimed at evaluating the potential role of persistent soil seedbanks in restoring grassland and heathland communities in sites that have been afforested or are currently cultivated. To do so, we used the results of 16 case studies and an analysis of the database of Thompson et al. (1997). Generally, there is a decrease in total seed density with increasing age since abandonment or transformation. This decline is much faster for species of calcareous or alluvial grasslands than for heathland and grassheath species. During succession, seeds of target species disappear from the seedbank, owing to seed senescence. In many cases, the seed density of nontarget species increases with time. These species are often ruderal or competitive species, typical of arable land and other disturbed sites, with long-term persistent seeds. Grassland species have a low seed longevity index and low densities in the soil. Moreover, a few years after abandonment, almost all species have disappeared from the soil seedbank. Hence, restoration of species-rich grasslands cannot rely on the seedbank. Where the colonization by target species is hampered because of the isolation of the site, seed introduction is necessary. Heathland species, especially Calluna vulgaris, and grassheath species have a higher seed longevity index and can survive for a long period in the soil. However, the density of their seeds also declines with time and restoration of heathland on sites abandoned or forested for longer than 40 years is also seed limited. If the former heathland was converted to arable land, the decline of heathland species in the seedbank is much faster owing to ploughing. Moreover, high nutrient levels in the soil favour competition from nontarget species after germination. In that case, restoration of heathland or grassheath is expected to be problematic.

After decades of minimum tillage, ploughing was conducted in Winter 1998, Winter 2000 or in both 1998 and 2000 in part of the field as a preventive weed control strategy. Plant density assessments and quantification of the seed bank at the end of 3 years were taken. Less P. rhoeas emerged in the ploughed plots and the effect was still visible 2 years after ploughing. In the twice ploughed plots, emergence was higher than in the once ploughed plots but lower than in the non-ploughed treatment. Harrowing conducted post-emergence as an annual control method in part of the plots caused a remarkable reduction of the weed population in all three years. The effect caused by the harrowing was more important than the ploughing treatments. However, the combination of single ploughing and harrowing induced the lowest weed plant emergence. The depth distribution of P. rhoeas seed was similar for all treatments but there was a higher total seed bank in the twice ploughed plots. Occasional ploughing was found to be an effective method for placing P. rhoeas seeds in non-optimal germination situations. When the initial weed seed bank is very high as in this field trial, the reduction achieved by ploughing is not sufficient and an additional weed control method should be conducted.

J	Chang, JS; Dai, CF; Chang, J				Chang, JS; Dai, CF; Chang, J			Gametangium-like structures as propagation buds in Codium edule Silva (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta)	BOTANICA MARINA												Gametangiumlike structures were found on the sides of utricles of Codium edule collected during the latter period of its growing season in southern Taiwan. They are usually fusiform and bigger than the regular gametangia, but do not contain gametes. In addition, the gametangiumlike structures bear protuberances on their surface, a character not observed in regular gametangia. In culture, the protuberances extended into filaments that developed new utricles terminally after two weeks.This indicates that the gametangiumlike structures, named propagation buds, have the potential to form new thalli and can be regarded as an effective reproductive structure. In the field, the abundance of both gametangia and propagation buds on the macrothalli of C. edule was highest towards the end of its growing season, in August. Microspectrophotometric studies with DAPI showed that relative fluorescent units of nuclei in propagation buds were similar in number to those in the utricles, and were higher than those in the gametangia.We suggest that the propagation buds are possibly transformed gametangia with incomplete meiosis. The propagation buds may serve as a persistent stage when the macrothalli disintegrate at the end of the growing season, and act as a seed bank for vegetative reproduction for C. edule in the next season.

However, such restoration projects are interesting to be undertaken in south-eastern France (Parc Naturel Regional du Luberon) because there are still enough of the arable weed species specifically growing in cereal fields (segetal species), whereas they decrease in other regions of France. This study over three years (1999-2001) assessed the above-ground vegetation and the permanent seed bank of a field (0.2 ha) cultivated with cereals on a ploughed 10 year-old meadow. Our results show that among the 113 species recorded, only two segetal species germinated from permanent seed bank (Galeopsis angustifolium, Papaver rhoeas), while ten segetal species were recorded in above-ground vegetation (1/4 of typical segetal species in Pare Naturel Regional du Luberon). Arable weed vegetation was dominated by grassland or ruderal species. This suggests that, segetal populations are not resilient after 10 years of putting the arable fields under grass and that restoration cannot occur from permanent seed bank. Thus, in order to preserve species-rich segetal communities, fields should be cultivated with cereals and should not be included in a rotation with a long meadow phase.

J	Narita, K				Narita, K			Size-specific carbon allocation, seed production, and seed dispersal patterns in a desert lignified annual, Blepharis sindica (Acanthaceae)	ECOSCIENCE												Blepharis sindica (Acanthaceae) is a lignified annual plant inhabiting the Thar Desert. It has relatively large seeds (7.8 mg dry mass) and unique structures: lignified stems, spiny hard bracts, and hard, lignified capsular fruits. In order to understand the life history characteristics of this annual and its adaptation to the unpredictable and harsh conditions of the desert environment, resource allocation pattern and dispersal traits were analyzed in relation to plant size. Seed size and/or number may decrease with an increase in allocation to lignified stems, branches, bracts, and capsular fruits. However, these non-seed structures may play important roles with respect to reproductive success in desert environments. Reproductive allocation and seed output (total resources devoted to seeds) decreased and relative allocation to stems increased as plant size increased. Seed size increased rapidly at a certain plant size and held relatively constant above that size. The number of seeds produced did not increase below the critical resource level; however, seed number increased exponentially above this level. Seed dispersal correlated to plant size: larger plants tended to disperse lower proportions of seeds. These results suggest that non-seed maternal efforts in this annual plant are important for the establishment of a seed bank and the regulation of seed dispersal.																	1195-6860						2003	10	3					327	333									WOS:000185589200009						
J	Moffatt, SF; McLachlan, SM				Moffatt, SF; McLachlan, SM			Effects of land use disturbance on seed banks of riparian forests in southern Manitoba	ECOSCIENCE												Riparian forests have been adversely affected by human land use and are threatened across North America. Seed banks play an important role in the maintenance and regeneration of forests, yet effects of land use and fragmentation on forest seed banks remain poorly understood. In 1998 and 1999, we assessed impacts of human disturbance on the diversity and species composition of seed banks in upland portions of riparian forests along an urban-rural gradient in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five forest fragments were categorized according to the following land-use: urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively undisturbed reference classes. Seeds of weedy and exotic species were positively associated with fragmentation, high levels of disturbance, and dry alkaline soils. Seed bank species diversity was lower in urban sites than in rural sites, and the similarity of urban to reference sites was significantly lower than that of rural to reference sites. In contrast, the proportion of exotic to native species richness was highest in seed banks of urban sites. Exotic species Hackelia virginiana and Poa pratense were associated with urban and suburban sites, respectively. Six exotic species were unique to urban sites; these included Hesparis matronalis and Plantago major. In contrast, many of the frequently encountered native species were absent from urban sites; these included Anemone canadensis and Rubus idaeus. These changes in seed bank may affect the ability of riparian forests to recover from adverse impacts associated with urban development and agriculture.																	1195-6860						2003	10	3					361	369		10.1080/11956860.2003.11682785							WOS:000185589200013

Within this context, a comparative study on germination in response to light and temperature conditions simulating those in nature was carried out on the narrowly distributed endemic arable weed Sisymbrium cavanillesianum (Brassicaceae) and on the geographically widespread S. runcinatum. Seeds were periodically tested for germination from 0 month (freshly matured seeds) to 16 months from collection. The study was supplemented with an S. cavanillesianum seed soil-burial experiment and an assessment of the persistent soil seed bank of both Sisymbrium species in the natural habitat. Results revealed that S. cavanillesianum seeds may have physiological dormancy that markedly reduces germination of young seeds at high temperatures (32-18degreesC). In general, seeds of S. cavanillesianum reached higher final germination percentages than those of S. runcinatum, so seed-germination restrictions or difficulties should be rejected as a reason for explaining the rarity of S. cavanillesianum. Both the seed-burial experiment and the analysis of soil samples from the natural habitat showed that S. cavanillesianum has the capacity to form short-term persistent seed banks, which play a crucial role in the maintenance of populations of this threatened species periodically disturbed by agricultural practices.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218; Copete Carreno, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-5253-0586												1195-6860						2003	10	4					532	541		10.1080/11956860.2003.11682802							WOS:000187465200016

A prefire vegetation map was used for detailing species composition, vertical structure, and density and another for detailing the extent and intensity of fire damage. Between 3 and 7 years after the fires, an inventory was made of the vegetation in each area, using the step-point method. The information thus obtained was used to determine the amount of cover in the dwarf/shrub and tree layers, the frequency of species in each of the layers, floristic richness, and diversity (Shannon index). The botanical composition of the dwarf and shrub layer was analyzed using TWIN-SPAN. Variables were poorly correlated with level of fire damage, which suggests that the forests in this study followed the autosuccession model. Because of the artificial origin or semi-natural condition, regeneration of the dominant tree species is poor, and it seems unlikely that forests will recover to their prefire state. Therefore action is recommended to restore these ecosystems.

J	Kelman, WM; Culvenor, RA				Kelman, WM; Culvenor, RA			The genetic correlation of panicle shattering with the intact rachilla form of seed retention in Phalaris aquatica L.	EUPHYTICA												Panicle shattering and seed retention are distinct characters that influence seed dispersal in Phalaris aquatica L. (phalaris). One form of seed retention in phalaris is the result of the thickening of the rachilla (intact rachilla) and disruption of the rachilla-breakage mechanism. This form of seed retention results in seed dispersal as seed-retaining panicle fragments, providing an opportunity to reduce ant predation of seed, and thereby increase the potential for seedling recruitment. A genetic analysis of panicle shattering and the intact rachilla form of seed retention was conducted on parental clones and derived half-sib families of a cross between the seed retaining cultivar Atlas PG and the non-seed retaining cultivar Sirocco, grown as spaced plants over two seasons in the field. A simulation of panicle shattering of the parents and families was also devised under glasshouse conditions. The narrow-sense heritability of panicle shattering in the field was 51 +/- 10% and 58 +/- 12%, on the basis of half-sib family means and parent-offspring regression, respectively, and its genetic correlation with panicle shattering under simulated conditionswas 24 +/- 8%. The narrow-sense heritability of the intact rachilla form of seed retention was 70 +/- 17% on a half-sib family mean basis. Seed retention had a negative genetic correlation of 71 +/- 19% with panicle shattering, posing a difficulty for breeding seed-retaining cultivars with readily shattering panicles. However, it was considered likely that the two traits were controlled by independent sets of genes and that this association could be broken. This association is discussed in the context of breeding cultivars with seed dispersal characteristics that promote seedling recruitment under conditions of ant predation of the seed bank.

J	Honek, A; Martinkova, Z; Jarosik, V				Honek, A; Martinkova, Z; Jarosik, V			Ground beetles (Carabidae) as seed predators	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												The consumption and preferences of polyphagous ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) for the seeds of herbaceous plants was determined. The seeds were stuck into plasticine in small tin trays and exposed to beetle predation on surface of the ground. In the laboratory the effect of carabid (species, satiation) and seed (species, size) on the intensity of seed predation was investigated. The consumption of the generally preferred Cirsium arvense seed by 23 species of common carabids increased with body size. Seed of Capsella bursa-pastoris was preferred by small carabids and their consumption rates were not related to their size. The average daily consumption of all the carabid species tested (0.33 mg seeds.mg body mass(-1).day(-1)) was essentially the same for both kinds of seed. Because of satiation the consumption of seed of C. arvense provided ad libitum to Pseudoophonus rufipes decreased over a period of 9 days to 1/3-1/4 of the initial consumption rate. Preferences of P. rufipes (body mass 29.6 mg) and Harpalus affinis (13.4 mg) for the seeds of 64 species of herbaceous plants were determined. The small H. affinis preferred smaller seed than the large P. rufipes. Predation of seed present on the ground in the field was studied in 1999-2000, at Praha-Ruzyne (50degrees06' N 14degrees16' E). Seeds were placed in stands of different crops as in the laboratory experiments and vertebrate predation was excluded by wire mesh cages. Pitfall traps placed near the cages revealed that carabids were the only seed predators active in the area. Rates of removal of seed of 6 weed species varied with crop, season, seed and site. Average rate of removal in June-August was 2.5 seeds.day(-1).tray(-1) and was smaller before and after this period. The rates of removal increased with increasing activity density of the carabids and paucity of seed from naturally occurring weeds, which may have satiated the carabids. In stands of winter wheat, millet and soybeans there were significant differences in the rates of removal of the seed of 43 herbaceous species. The field preferences were correlated with those established in the laboratory. Predation of seed on the ground in arable fields can be as high as 1000 seeds.m(-2).day(-1) and may selectively influence the quantity of seed of particular herb species that enters the soil seed bank. Seed predation thus may be an effective component of weed control on arable land, particularly at low weed densities.																	1210-5759						2003	100	4					531	544		10.14411/eje.2003.081							WOS:000187974700011

J	Karlsson, LM; Tamado, T; Milberg, P				Karlsson, LM; Tamado, T; Milberg, P			Seed dormancy pattern of the annuals Argemone ochroleuca and A-mexicana (Papaveraceae)	FLORA												Seed dormancy of the tropical annual weeds Argemone ochroleuca Sweet and Argemone mexicana L. was studied in a series of experiments. Factors investigated included: light, darkness, five temperature regimes and combinations of periods of light, darkness and the different temperature regimes for various time periods (up to one year). Furthermore, germination in solutions of gibberellic acid, after leaching, after mechanical treatments, and after periods of dry storage, was Studied. Since the seeds have underdeveloped embryos, their growth was also studied. There was no, or very little, germination (< 5%) or embryo growth in most experiments, irrespective of light and temperature conditions. Argemone ochroleuca after-ripened slightly and germinated to 10-20% after one year of dry storage. Germination to 100% occurred only after artificial treatments, either after removal of part of the seed coat and endosperm or after incubation in gibberellic acid solution. The significance of the strong dormancy was confirmed in the field for A. ochroleuca when only 8% of seeds sown produced seedlings in the first season after shedding. We conclude that the majority of seeds normally do not germinate during their first season after shedding, but instead enter into the seed bank, thus producing seedlings, even in a well-maintained field, probably for several years.

Here, we characterize the metapopulation structure and short-term dynamics of Polygonella basiramia. This rare, short-lived perennial herb is endemic to Florida scrublands and lacks a seed bank. Fires create the open sand gaps within a shrub matrix that support this species but also kill established plants. Thus, persistence depends on frequent colonization of unoccupied gaps. We are monitoring population dynamics within and among 1204 gaps distributed among 19 shrub patches. Considerable subpopulation turnover is evident at the gap level with rates of gap extinction exceeding rates of colonization in the first year. Whether declines in overall abundance continue is likely to depend on patterns of disturbance and regional stochasticity in this dynamic landscape. Polygonella is more likely to occupy larger and less isolated gaps, demonstrating that landscape features and disturbance strongly affect metapopulation dynamics. Because Polygonella basiramia displays characteristics, occupancy patterns, and turnover dynamics consistent with metapopulation theory, it represents a model system for studying plant metapopulations.

J	Brendonck, L; De Meester, L				Brendonck, L; De Meester, L			Egg banks in freshwater zooplankton: evolutionary and ecological archives in the sediment	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Many representatives of freshwater zooplankton produce at some stage in their life cycle resting stages. A variable portion of the eggs of the previous growing period will hatch at the next occasion while the remaining ones are added to a persistent egg bank, where they can remain viable for decades or longer. The importance of the study of resting eggs and egg banks in general for such different disciplines as taxonomy, ecological biogeography, paleolimnology, nature conservation, evolutionary ecology and community and population ecology is generally appreciated. The major current and expected future developments in this rapidly expanding field of research are presented here. The structure and dynamics of the egg bank are determined by the life history characteristics of the species (or local population), the hatching phenology of their resting stages, and the characteristics of the habitat. The horizontal distribution of dormant stages is generally patchy, with a greater density in the deeper and/or windward parts of a pond or lake. In sediment cores, most viable ( responsive) eggs occur in the upper centimeters, although vertical variation related to the history of fish predation or water quality occurs. The accumulation of resting stages of different species, generations and genotypes with variable regeneration niches results in a mixed egg bank with greater potential biodiversity than the active community sampled at any one moment. Through the benthic-pelagic coupling, this dormant reservoir may have considerable impact on the evolutionary potential of the organisms, the ecological dynamics of the community and the distribution of species. Egg banks can be considered the archive of the local habitat, since the pattern of changes in species assemblage and genotypes from the past up to the present reflect changes due to natural or anthropogenic impact that can be used to reconstruct evolutionary processes or even to restore the local habitat. Overlooking the egg bank as an important component of zooplankton communities may lead to erroneous interpretations in the analysis of community and population genetic structure. This review integrates technical and scientific information needed in the study of the structure and function of egg banks in zooplankton with special focus on the fascinating latest developments in the field.

J	Beklioglu, M; Ince, O; Tuzun, I				Beklioglu, M; Ince, O; Tuzun, I			Restoration of the eutrophic Lake Eymir, Turkey, by biomanipulation after a major external nutrient control I	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient loading in lakes is recognized as a serious threat to water quality. Over 25 years of raw sewage effluent discharge shifted Lake Eymir from a state dominated by submerged plants to a turbid water state. Successful effluent diversion undertaken in 1995 achieved 88% and 95% reductions in the areal loading of total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), respectively. Furthermore, the reduced load of TP was very close to the suggested threshold areal load (0.6 g m(-2) yr(-1)) to attain recovery. Even though diversion also reduced the in-lake TP level by half, the poor water clarity and low submerged plant coverage (112 +/- 43 cm and 2.5% coverage of the lake total surface area, respectively) persisted. Domination of the fish stock by planktivorous tench (Tinca tinca L.) and the benthivorous common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) (66 +/- 0.7 and 31 +/- 1 kg CPUE, respectively) appeared to perpetuate the poor water condition. A substantial fish removal effort over 1 year achieved a 57% reduction in the fish stock which led to a 2.5-fold increase in Secchi disk transparency. This increase occurred largely because of a 4.5-fold decrease in the inorganic suspended solid concentration, and to some extent, a decrease in chlorophyll-a concentration. A strong top-down effect of fish on the large-sized grazers was evident as density and the body size of Daphnia pulex de Geer increased significantly after the fish removal. Even though the spring and annual euphotic depths occurred well above the maximum and mean depths of the lake, respectively, re-development of submerged plants was poor (6.2% coverage). A weak re-establishment of submerged plants might be attributed to an insufficiently viable seed bank, inappropriate chemical conditions of the sediment (severe oxygen deficiency), or to the high coot (Fulica atra L.) density. However, the top-down effect of fish appeared to be of great importance in determining water clarity, and in turn, conditions for submerged plant development in a warm temperate lake as recorded in the north temperate lakes. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for the importance of top-down control of fish, which, in turn, can be effectively utilised as a restoration strategy in warm-temperate lakes as well. More applications, along with long monitoring programs, are needed to develop a better understanding about requirements for biomanipulation success in this climate.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2003	490	1-3					93	105		10.1023/A:1023466629489							WOS:000182463800009						
J	Azcarate, FM; Peco, B				Azcarate, FM; Peco, B			Spatial patterns of seed predation by harvester ants (Messor Forel) in Mediterranean grassland and scrubland	INSECTES SOCIAUX												Seed predation by harvester ants is one of the main processes involved in the seed bank dynamics of Mediterranean grassland and scrubland. We investigated the spatial patterns of seed predation by Messor spp. in these systems from a multi-level approach (nest-site selection, foraging patch selection and seed predation risk), using ten experimental plots (20 m x 40 m) set in central Spain. All habitats in grasslands are dominated by M. barbarus, while in scrubland this species shares seed exploitation with M. bouvieri. In this type of system, the nest-hole and foraging territory distribution of the two species show a certain degree of segregation. Messor bouvieri focuses on the exploitation of dry scrub, while M. barbarus also forages on subhumid and humid patches. We interpret this as a consequence of the different foraging behaviour and nest site requirements of the two species. In general, the spatial distribution of seed predation risk reflects the patterns detected for the nest-holes and foraging areas, although scrubland has a more heterogeneous predation pattern than grassland.

J	Edwards, AL; Sharitz, RR				Edwards, AL; Sharitz, RR			Clonal diversity in two rare perennial plants: Sagittaria isoetiformis and Sagittaria teres (Alismataceae)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Most perennial herbs can produce clones (genetically identical ramets), and the frequency of asexual propagation relative to sexual reproduction can affect genetic and genotypic diversity. The power to detect clones also depends on marker diversity. Using horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis, we surveyed two rare perennials found in isolated wetlands: Sagittaria isoetiformis, restricted to the inner coastal plain of southeastern North America, and Sagittaria teres, endemic to glacial ponds in northeastern North America. Fifteen polymorphic loci were resolved on 527 individuals across 11 populations (ca. 48 ramets/ population) for S. isoetiformis, and 12 polymorphic loci were resolved on 367 individuals across seven populations (ca. 52 ramets/ population) for S. teres. Although genets commonly produce clones in these species, we found no significant influence of genotype duplication on genetic structure. Genotypic structure and our power to detect clones did differ among species. The proportion of distinguishable genotypes per population was higher in S. isoetiformis (G/N = 0.92 +/- 0.12) than in S. teres (G/N = 0.54 +/- 0.21). When standardized by the number of polymorphic markers in each population, genotypic diversity was high in both species ((D) over bar = 0.99 in S. isoetiformis and (D) over bar = 0.94 in S. teres), but genotypes were less evenly distributed across S. isoetiformis populations ((E) over bar = 0.75), ranging from 0.60 to 1.00, than across S. teres populations ((E) over bar = 0.84), ranging from 0.80 to 0.92. Overall, we had greater power to detect unique genotypes in S. isoetiformis than in S. teres, demonstrating the importance of reporting some measure of statistical power to distinguish genetic individuals. The combined genetic and genotypic evidence indicates that sexual recruitment from persistent seed banks helps to maintain genetic and genotypic diversity in these species.																	1058-5893	1537-5315				JAN	2003	164	1					181	188		10.1086/344552							WOS:000180635600017

Highest germination percentages were recorded at fluctuating temperatures of 15-4 degreesC, followed closely by 20-7 degreesC and 15 degreesC. Geographical (interpopulation level) and maternal (intrapopulation level) sources of seeds, as well as position of seeds in fruit (intraindividual level) influenced the germination patterns decisively. Thus, significantly different final germination percentages between populations in the same taxa were achieved at certain temperature-incubation treatments. In 5 of the 7 populations investigated, a high intrapopulation variability in germination patterns was detected, depending on the maternal source. In two populations of C. rupestris subsp. rupestris and in one of C. rupestris subsp. leptocarpa, seeds from the beak of the fruit germinated to higher percentages than those from the valvar portion. The soil seed bank of all Coincya taxa studied had a persistent component, but also had a high nonviable-seed fraction in the soil, indicating the existence of short-term persistent seed banks. The importance of such a seed bank type in population maintenance of threatened species is discussed.

Bromus species, important winter annuals, are very common in shrub patches and in places where the soil crust has been disturbed. Therefore, patch properties such as substrate and microclimate may have important effects on the size of the seed bank, germination, and seedling establishment of these species. We studied germination under laboratory conditions in light and darkness, at different temperatures, and on various substrates collected from the Sayeret Shaked Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) station. We compared the experimental results with findings of the distribution of abundance of the species in the field. Germination in all three Bromus species responded to light and temperature. The seeds germinated faster in darkness below 20 degreesC, but more rapidly in the light at 20 degreesC. Different constant temperatures not only influenced the rate of germination, but also the start and the time to achieve 75% and 100% germination. The differences in the occurrence of B. alopecuroides and B. fasciculatus in the Sayeret Shaked LTER station may not depend on the substrate. The highest germination (96-100%), with no significant differences, occurred on all substrates except for sterile organic matter, which resulted in 64-66% germination. Comparing these results with the findings of germination abundance in the field, the differentiating factor may be related to the number of seeds that arrive and remain in the different patch types, which in turn depends either on the numbers of seeds produced per plant or on their dispersability or protection against removal. Nevertheless, B. rubens did show significant differences between the two patch types.																	0792-9978						2003	51	4					267	273		10.1560/0WQ1-WH6H-9RJD-LNE3							WOS:000189195200004

Twelve years after their creation, the 50 cm x 50 cm gaps supported a distinctive vegetation composed of a mixture of perennial forbs, grasses and mosses. Three species (Bryum sp., Epilobium alsinoides and Plantago novae-zelandiae) were recorded only in the gaps. Plantago novae-zelandiae and Polytrichum juniperinum had their highest frequency in the centres of the gaps, while Celmisia gracilenta and Geranium microphyllum were most frequent at the edges. The distinctive species composition of the gap plots indicates that they are still in an early stage of succession, assuming an eventual reversion to the surrounding 'climax' grassland.																	0110-6465						2003	27	1					31	36									WOS:000182899600004

We estimated the disturbance rate ( mound building activity) by Mediterranean voles, their effects on vegetation and the mechanisms of these effects during a period of vole outbreak. The effects on vegetation were analysed at the levels of species, functional groups and plant community. Disturbance rate was high and voles can disturb the entire soil surface once every four or five years. The availability of certain trophic resources ( perennial plants) appeared to drive vole expansion in the experimental plots and it was independent of the irrigation and grazing treatments. Mound building activities largely affected vegetation but conserved plot differences. Total vegetation cover, absolute cover of all functional groups, mean vegetation height and species richness were less on mounds than on undisturbed ground. These effects did not change the relative abundance of annuals, perennials, grasses and forbs. Only the relative abundance of small-seeded species decreased on mounds. As the proportion of these seeds was similar in both types of patches, we suggest that small-seeded species had more difficulties for germinating or emerging when they are buried during mound formation. Irrigation and sheep grazing promoted large changes in the vegetation parameters but these effects were, in general, similar on mounds and undisturbed ground. Our results show that the availability of germinable seeds may be the major limitation for mound revegetation, probably due to the scarcity of seeds existing at the depths from which soils are excavated. Our results also suggested a resource limitation on mounds. The results provide additional evidence that soil disturbances by small herbivore mammals exert relevant ecological effects on abandoned Mediterranean croplands. We discuss the ecological implications of vole mound-building activities for plant succession, plant species conservation and forage resource availability for livestock.

J	Montiel, S; Montana, C				Montiel, S; Montana, C			Seed bank dynamics of the desert cactus Opuntia rastrera in two habitats from the Chihuahuan Desert	PLANT ECOLOGY												In desert environments the main input to the seed bank of many succulents is the seed rain through zoochory while high levels of granivory by rodents, birds and ants are the main cause of subsequent losses. In the patchy environment of arid lands the characteristics of both processes may vary between habitats causing differences in the recruitment of new genets. To test this hypothesis we used populations of the desert cactus Opuntia rastrera which has different recruitment rates in the two adjacent habitats where it grows. In Opuntia-dominated scrublands (nopaleras, density ca. 4,000 plants/ha) 1 seedling out of 7,000,000 seeds establish, whereas in grasslands (density ca. 100 plants/ha) this ratio is 1:20,000. From 1996 until 1998 the seed rain, seed removal by granivores and seed abundance in the soil were monitored in both habitats. Results showed striking differences in the dynamics of the seed bank of both habitats. Seed rain was 8.5 times bigger in nopaleras than in grasslands. In nopaleras most seeds were removed by rodents while the quantities of seeds removed by rodents, birds and ants in grasslands were similar. One year after dispersal (the time necessary to break seed dormancy) only 6% of original nopalera seeds and 12% of grassland seeds remained. After germination trials only 1% (ca. 15,000 seeds/ha) and 2% (ca. 2,500 seeds/ha) respectively were viable. These differences in the effective seed bank (6 times bigger in nopaleras) can not explain the differences in genet recruitment (which is several orders of magnitude bigger in grasslands). Apparently the between habitat difference in nurse plant availability and in rodent density (which inflict a strong hervibory upon seedlings) can explain the differences in genet recruitment. It is speculated that this between habitat difference in genet recruitment suggests that the species evolved in less extreme environments (e. g. grasslands) than desert scrublands which, in turn, are colonised due to the singular ability of O. rastrera for vegetative propagation.

J	Jutila, HM				Jutila, HM			Germination in Baltic coastal wetland meadows: similarities and differences between vegetation and seed bank	PLANT ECOLOGY												The abundance and variety of seedlings in Baltic coastal grasslands was studied in cattle grazed and ungrazed areas in seashore and delta on the western coast of Finland. The vegetation, seed bank and environmental conditions of the same sites were also studied. Altogether 4609 seedlings were observed in 79 field plots (20 cm x 20 cm) making an average of 1458.54 seedlings/m(2). The majority of the seedlings were dicots (67.5%) and perennials (96.8%). Altogether 44 species and an average of 4.14 species per plot were identified as seedlings. The most abundant taxon, Carex formed 23.2% of all the seedlings observed in the field. In the delta the seedling density was two times that found at the seashore. Also, the numbers of species of seedlings per plot were significantly higher in the delta than in the seashore, but in total, more species germinated from the seashore than from the delta even though the number of plots was higher in the delta (n = 51) than in the seashore (n = 28). The numbers of species and seedlings per plot were smaller in grazed sites than in ungrazed ones similar to the pattern earlier reported concerning the mature vegetation and seed bank. The mean numbers of seedlings were the highest at lower geolittoral plots (about 20 cm elevation), where the seed bank was also densest. About 60.0% of the mature species in the plots were also detected as seedlings and 91.4% of the seedling species were found in the mature vegetation of the plots. The number of seedlings was positively correlated with the cover of mature vegetation giving support to the nurse effect theory. Seedling numbers were negatively correlated with the abundance of litter indicating that litter restricts germination because it is a mechanical barrier but also decreases the amount of light. The number of seedlings and species, both in total and per unit area, were greater in the seed bank than in the field seedling population. The seedling population was more similar to the mature vegetation than to the seed bank.

J	Reynolds, CE; Houle, G				Reynolds, CE; Houle, G			Mantel and partial Mantel tests suggest some factors that may control the local distribution of Aster laurentianus at Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec	PLANT ECOLOGY												Spatial heterogeneity is a significant aspect of ecosystem structure and function. Because ecological variables often are spatially autocorrelated, standard statistics frequently are not appropriate to analyze ecological data. In this paper, we use Mantel and partial Mantel tests to explore the spatial structure of and relationships between several variables - micro-topography, substrate salinity, wrack cover and the density of Aster laurentianus -at two sites at the periphery of a shallow lagoon at Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec. A. laurentianus is an annual halophyte endemic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It typically occurs in a narrow band (from ca. 50 to 200 cm wide) at the periphery of shallow lagoons. In this habitat, plants are exposed to frequent deposition of plant debris (wrack) and to the limiting effects of substrate salinity. Our analyses show that substrate salinity, wrack cover and density of A. laurentianus are significantly correlated with topography, and that wrack cover affects substrate salinity at both sites. At the first site, the abundance of A. laurentianus increases progressively with distance from the waterline, while at the second site, density increases initially, but then diminishes with distance from the waterline. At the first site, the most important structuring variable is wrack deposition, the effect of salinity on plant density being indirect. At the second site, which is somewhat sheltered, wrack deposition is far less important and substrate salinity predominates over wrack deposition as structuring variable. We suggest that A. laurentianus distribution along the shores of shallow lagoons is limited both by substrate salinity and wrack deposition, but that the relative importance of these structuring variables changes with the physical characteristics of the site.

These sites have been invaded within the past 50 years, with the upstream site from the town of Many Farms being invaded more recently. Seed banks of E. angustifolia were determined from sieved soils samples and direct counting of all seeds, and partitioning the seed population from the year 2000 samples into categories of fresh, viable, and old seeds. The average number of seeds in the seed bank averaged 494 and 336 seeds/m(2) for the five sites in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 415 for the two years of study. The fresh and viable seeds comprised 63% of the seed bank with the remaining 37% of seeds considered old and with low or no germination potential. Of the seeds deemed viable, physical examination showed that 60% contained fresh endosperm, which would further, decrease the reproduction potential of the total seed count for E. angustifolia seeds. The remaining number of seeds capable of germination would provide a seed source to assure recruitment of new seedlings to the stands, and provide a seed source that could be transported from the site by hydrochory or zoochory for invasion of new sites by this highly invasive tree.																			90-5782-135-4				2003							267	276									WOS:000186911300018

We present a synthesis of 5 years of research that includes recently obtained results on tree species seed bank, its viability and epiphytic and tree diversity. Seeds were more abundant in transitional and colonizing (185 and 136 seeds) than in mature stages (57 seeds) but seed species richness was higher in colonizing and mature stages. In the colonizing stages, seed species richness was 3. Seed viability was low for Cedrella lilloi (20%). The other species had a higher seed viability (more than 40%). Epiphytic richness was high (15 species). The highest richness in epiphytic species was recorded for native tree species. Frequency of epiphytic species was higher on G. Triacanthos, for the Tilandsia group only. There were no differences in tree diversity between invaded and non invaded environments (comparing transitional and mature stages), but there was a biodiversity loss in the pool of tree species that colonizes the recently formed gaps as well as in the epiphytic richness due to invasion.																			90-5782-135-4				2003							277	287									WOS:000186911300019

We spatially studied the soil seed bank to a depth of 2.5 cm, in terms of germination, viability, and dormancy per species. Results indicated that the seed bank was highly variable in all its parameters. Spatial variability was associated with soil properties. Only some species showed spatial dependence under the sampling intensity utilized. Seed input by irrigation was small and can be considered negligible. Weed presence caused a depletion of crop yield, due to increased competition, especially for nutrients. According to our results, sampling the soil seed bank would allow predicting weed problems in a given field. However, further research is needed to adjust sampling protocols and validate map predictions.																			90-76998-21-3				2003							507	513									WOS:000186384100075

Most of these have been introduced from the wild with little selection or breeding. In Europe alone, 12 000 species are found in cultivation in general garden collections (i.e. excluding specialist collections and botanic gardens). In addition, specialist collections (often very large) of many other species and/or cultivars of groups such as orchids, bromeliads, cacti and succulents, primulas, rhododendrons, conifers and cycads are maintained in several centres such as botanic gardens and specialist nurseries, as are 'national collections' of cultivated species and cultivars in some countries. Specialist growers, both professional and amateur, also maintain collections of plants for cultivation, including, increasingly, native plants. The trade in ornamental and amenity horticulture cannot be fully estimated but runs into many billions of dollars annually and there is considerable potential for further development and the introduction of many new species into the trade. Despite this, most of the collections are ad hoc and no co-ordinated efforts have been made to ensure that adequate germplasm samples of these species are maintained for conservation purposes and few of them are represented at all adequately in seed banks. Few countries have paid much attention to germplasm needs of ornamentals and the Ornamental Plant Germplasm Center in conjunction with the USDA National Plant Germplasm System at The Ohio State University is an exception. Generally there is a serious gap in national and international germplasm strategies, which have tended to focus primarily on food plants and some forage and industrial crops. Adequate arrangements need to be put in place to ensure the long- and medium-term conservation of representative samples of the genetic diversity of ornamental species. The problems of achieving this will be discussed. In addition, a policy for the conservation of old cultivars or 'heritage' varieties of ornamentals needs to be formulated. The considerable potential for introduction of new ornamental species needs to be assessed. Consideration needs to be given to setting up a co-ordinating structure with overall responsibility for the conservation of germplasm of ornamental and amenity plants.																	0567-7572		90-6605-896-X				2003		598					43	53		10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.598.5							WOS:000182075100005

Weed densities were monitored, and soil samples were taken to measure the effects of the treatments on weed seedbanks and microbial biomass over a 24-mo period. Reduced tillage increased the density of shepherd's-purse in the upper soil layer (0 to 15 cm) of the soil seedbank compared with conventional tillage. Evidence is presented that suggests relationships between organic amendments, weed population reductions, and increases in soil microbial biomass: (1) shepherd's-purse emergence and seedbank densities were lower in the organic amendment plots, (2) microbial biomass was nearly always higher in the organic amendment plots, and (3) significant negative correlations between microbial biomass and burning nettle and shepherd's-purse emergence densities were found. These results suggest that organic matter addition may lead to reduced weed emergence.

J	Beckie, HJ; Kirkland, KJ				Beckie, HJ; Kirkland, KJ			Implication of reduced herbicide rates on resistance enrichment in wild oat (Avena fatua)	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Model simulations predict that lowering herbicide efficacy by reducing the application rate would slow the rate of enrichment of herbicide-resistant individuals in a weed population, but the resulting increase in density of susceptible plants would reduce crop yield and increase the weed seed bank. A study was conducted at three sites in Saskatchewan, Canada, from 1997 to 2000 to examine the implication of reduced rates of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors in a diverse 4-yr crop rotation, in conjunction with variable crop seeding rates, on the enrichment of resistant wild oat in a mixed (resistant and susceptible) population. Main-plot treatments were crop (barley, canola, field pea, and spring wheat), subplot treatments were crop seeding rate (recommended and high), and sub-subplot treatments were ACCase inhibitor rate (0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1.0 times the recommended rate). Herbicide rate frequently interacted with seeding rate in affecting wild oat seedling density, seed return, the viable fraction of the weed seed bank, and crop seed yield. As simulation models predict, reduced herbicide efficacy decreased the proportion of resistant individuals in the population. The high crop seeding rate compensated for a one-third reduction in herbicide rate by limiting total wild oat seed return and by reducing the number of resistant seedlings recruited from the seed bank. The level of resistance in the seed bank can be reduced without increasing the total (resistant plus susceptible) seed bank population by manipulating agronomic practices to increase crop competitiveness against wild oat when ACCase inhibitor rates are reduced to a maximum of two-thirds of that recommended.

Special attention is given to the importance of the seed bank in the soil as compensation potential. The flower and fruit phenology of the plant species was analyzed by counting. A fence was erected so that data samples outside and within an exclosure could be compared. Extracted soil samples and a germination test give information about the diaspore reservoir in the soil at the beginning of the investigation. The comparison of grazed and ungrazed stands yielded the following results. The Spergulo-Corynephoretum typicum is poor, the S.-C. cladonietosum richer in palatable inflorescences and infructescences (e.g. Carex arenaria). In the former only 12-24% of the inflorescences and infructescences are grazed (Carex arenaria, Corynephorus canescens), in the latter 45-51% (Carex arenaria). The Spergulo-Corynephoretum can regenerate itself from the diaspore potential to a slight extent if there are gaps, e.g. caused by cattle trampling. The Diantho-Armerietum is quite intensively grazed, entailing a major reduction of flowers and fruits of certain plant species (Agrostis capillaris: inflorescences by 71%, infructescences 72%, Diantbus deltoides: flowers by 61%, fruits 22%). In contrast, two species increase flower and fruit numbers (by 36-77%) in the grazed sites (Agrostis vinealis, Ranunculus bulbosus). Faeces microsites are important elements for patch dynamic systems in the Diantho-Armerietum. At faeces microsites in the Diantho-Armerietum, which constitute about one-third of the plot areas, many flowers and fruits develop. Flower and fruit development at the faeces microsites and the seed bank in the soil ensure a generative regeneration of the Diantho-Armerietum. Gap dynamics, patch dynamics of faeces microsites and seed bank processes are driving forces for the generative regeneration of the investigated plant communities.

A field experiment was established in 1998. Soil seed bank and seed rain were assessed. Directed and spontaneous succession was monitored for 3 years. For diaspore transfer (inoculation) 1. mown material, 2. raked material or 3. sods from intact sand habitats were used. The experimental plots were grazed by sheep from 1999 to 2001; in 2001 also by donkeys. Comparisons with grazed-only plots and controls were made. Additionally, spontaneous succession was determined in two non-managed sand grassland plots. Spontaneous succession leads to ruderal communities (first Stellarietea phase, followed by increasing dominance of Artemisietea and Agropyretea species, e.g. Poa angustifolia, Calamagrostis epigejos). A few target species were able to establish themselves, but they play a minor role, because they are only present in small numbers in both soil seed bank and seed rain. Grazing-only (without inoculation) is not sufficient to stop the ruderalisation trend. However, after each of the three diaspore inoculation treatments nearly all target species established themselves. Ruderalisation was suppressed by inoculation combined with grazing. Nevertheless, many ruderal species occur and represent a latent ruderalisation potential. Ruderal species are grazed preferentially by sheep. Several ruderal species that are rejected by sheep are grazed by donkeys (e.g. Cirsium arvense, Calamagrostis epigejos). A compensation for biomass loss after grazing (as supposed by the grazing optimization hypothesis) was not observed (except for some perennial Fabaceae species). Thus, grazing appears to be a suitable measure to inhibit ruderalisation. Most sand-specific, endangered species are not grazed and thus are able to spread. The analysis of plant tissue has shown that sheep prefer nitrogen-rich plant species (Fabaceae) and plant parts >2% N. Plant parts containing <1% N are avoided. This may enhance oligotrophication of ruderalised habitats and alter ecosystem functions.																	0340-269X					DEC 10	2002	32	4					595	625		10.1127/0340-269X/2002/0032-0595							WOS:000179868300006

Of 25 endangered species recorded in the source meadow, only one (Holcus lanatus) was present in the target meadow. After sowing, 16 of the endangered species in addition to Holcus lanatus were recorded in the new site. Six species were only present in sown plots and seven others were more frequent there, while three species might have arrived by chance or originated from the seed bank. Replacing the traditional management regime, including one late cut and grazing in spring and in autumn, with three cutting times and the creation of gaps in the sward, resulted in a higher number of endangered species in plots which were only cut, possibly because the grazing was too intensive in the small enclosures.																	1402-2001					DEC	2002	5	2					185	194		10.1658/1402-2001(2002)005[0185:SITSFA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000181162900004

The study area was sown with a commercial seed mixture, composed of Phleum pratense, Festuca pratensis, Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens. The above-ground vegetation in the study area 1, 2 and 3 yr after restoration was compared to (1) the vegetation present during the previous 5-yr fallow stage and (2) target flood-plain meadows. Before restoration, the above-ground fallow vegetation was dominated by ruderal and annual species, while only very few meadow species were present. Sowing led to tall, dense vegetation, mainly dominated by the sown species. Ruderal and annual species had decreased 3 yr after restoration, but target species were still poorly represented. Species richness was significantly lower in the sown site than in the semi-natural target meadows and the vegetation had a different composition. Analysis of the soil seed bank of the restored meadow showed that only a few meadow species were present and that it was dominated by a few ruderal species. Three years after sowing, the vegetation of our experimental site is moving slowly towards the target communities but impoverished seed sources seem to limit the success of this restoration operation and will lead to under-saturated communities.																	1402-2001					DEC	2002	5	2					263	270		10.1658/1402-2001(2002)005[0263:ROSFMF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000181162900012

Dandy on Success Bank, Western Australia, was assessed over a 3-year period (1996-1998). Interannual and spatial variation in inflorescence, flower and seed density and the probability of flowers setting seed were examined for both species of seagrass. Flower and seed densities of R coriacea showed that sexual reproduction could contribute to the maintenance of this population on Success Bank. Substantial interannual variation in flowering intensity indicates that the relative contribution of sexual reproduction to meadow maintenance varies among years. Flower densities of H. tasmanica in 1997 pointed to potential sexual reproduction as a contribution to the meadow, but the absence of flowers in the 2 other years of the study, and the absence of a seed bank within the sediment, suggested that sexual reproduction did not contribute to the maintenance of this population on Success Bank. Seed production determines the upper bounds of the potential for a species to recruit. We have quantified these upper bounds for P. coriacea and H. tasmanica on Success Bank, southwestern Australia at 15 +/- 3 and 60 +/- 11 m(-2) per year (mean +/- S.E, n = 110), respectively. These upper bounds are comparatively low relative to vegetative shoot recruitment at 240 +/- 84 and 360 +/- 86 m(-2) per year (mean +/- S.E., n = 6) for R coriacea and H. tasmanica, respectively.

Such sites will increasingly be targeted for heathland restoration in order to achieve the objectives set by current conservation policy. Therefore information on management to achieve effective restoration is a priority for research. In this study we examined the size, composition and distribution of the seed bank beneath conifer plantations of different ages at two important heathland sites in Britain. Changes in the physical and chemical properties of heathland soil under the plantations were also described. There were significant, exponential declines in the mean density of viable heather seeds with plantation age at both sites. However, relatively large seed banks survived for 40 years and under some circumstances for more than 70 years, suggesting that restoration on first rotation sites is unlikely to be seed limited. There were small, but significant differences in the soil nutrient status under the plantations compared to the adjacent heaths. It was concluded that the main constraint on heathland regeneration is likely to be the burial of the seed bank by a thick layer of conifer leaf litter. The mechanical removal of this layer has been shown to be practically feasible. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Feldmeyer-Christe, E; Kuchler, M				Feldmeyer-Christe, E; Kuchler, M			Eleven years of vegetation changes after a bog burst	BOTANICA HELVETICA												In the mire of la Vraconnaz located in the Jura Mountains (Switzerland) at a mean altitude of 1090 m, a bog burst occurred in September 1987 after an extraordinary spell of heavy rainfall. This mire has a surface of about 30 ha of raised bog surrounded by 25 ha of fen. An area of about 15 ha on the western part of the mire was affected by the slide. The affected vegetation included various bog communities as well as communities of acidic and alcaline fen plants (Sphagnion magellanici, Caricion nigrae, Caricion davallianae). This study reports on the changes in vegetation that took place during the 11 years after the bog burst. The behaviour of pioneer species and the secondary succession on bare peat were also observed. Statistical analysis of indicator values showed a general eutrophication and a closing of the herb layer in the slide area. The most sensitive vegetation group is that of the acidic fen (Caricion nigrae) that became significantly drier. The total species richness showed an increase. All pioneer species (first colonists) that appeared on bare peat after 2 years are perennials, either geophytes or hemicryptophytes and the majority of them are transient species. Species diversity in pioneer vegetation increased during the first 9 years and then become stable. The fuzzy ordination pointed to a succession towards the vegetation groups of acidic and alcaline fen rather than towards bog or meadow vegetation. We suppose that the settlement of plants on bare peat is greatly influenced by the species composition in the adjacent areas and that the mosaic pattern of bare peat and full-cover vegetation favorish the comeback of the vegetation present before the disturbance.																	0253-1453					DEC	2002	112	2					103	120									WOS:000180341500002						
J	Correia, E; Freitas, H				Correia, E; Freitas, H			Drosophyllum lusitanicum, an endangered West Mediterranean endemic carnivorous plant: threats and its ability to control available resources	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Drosophyllum lusitanicum (L.) Link (Droseraceae), Erva pinheira orvalhada, an endangered carnivorous plant, is a local endemic of clearings in pine, cork oak and oak forests or their successional shrublands in the western Iberian Peninsula and Morocco. The conservation status, distribution and population dynamics of this species are only partially known, both for Spanish and Portuguese occurrences. Portuguese distribution data from herbarium and bibliographic sources were collected for this study. Field work on 50 populations was undertaken in order to improve knowledge on their conservation status and possible threats. Natural causes, infrastructure and housing construction are stressed as the most important threats. Germination tests were carried out and the distribution patterns, plant height and the number of flowers were studied in an arbitrarily chosen population. A relatively high light requirement and low competitive ability to gain light are considered factors likely for the microdistribution pattern. Drosophyllum lusitanicum cannot compete for light in habitats with intense competition. Seeds from D. lusitanicum have reduced probability of germination when adult plants are already growing in the area. It is hypothesized that seed germination shows a similar pattern to flowering, viz over a considerable time rather than in a sudden flush. This strategy may be a key factor for the species' survival, representing attempts to take advantage of available resources, preventing intraspecific competition and, finally, preventing sudden total disappearance of a population, resulting from any catastrophic events due to natural causes or to human activity. As a result of this study, some conservation measures are suggested. (C) The Linnean Society of London.

J	Odion, D; Tyler, C				Odion, D; Tyler, C			Are long fire-free periods needed to maintain the endangered, fire-recruiting shrub Arctostaphylos morroensis(Ericaceae)?	CONSERVATION ECOLOGY												Morro manazanita (Arctostaphylos morroensis) is a distinctive shrub restricted to a small area along the coast of California, USA. This endangered species faces two opposing fire-related extinction risks: (1) adults are killed by fire, and (2) recruitment opportunities only occur with fire. These strongly limit the capacity of this, as well as other obligate-seeding species, to recover from a population decline, which may result if there is an inadequate amount of time between fires for replenishment of sufficient seed populations. Using a prescribed burn, we tested whether the size of the seed bank that had accumulated in a 40-yr-old stand would prove adequate for maintaining A. morroensis population sizes through fire. Prior to the burn, we found similar to11,000 seeds/m(2) in the soil, mostly in the top 5 cm. However, the number of viable seeds was substantially lower (334 seeds/m(2)), and less than one-third of these survived the experimental fire (99 seeds/m(2)). Germination occurred only in the first two wet seasons after the fire, and may have been adequate to replace the number of A. morroensis present before the burn. However, most seedlings did not survive their initial summer drought. After three years, the new population of A. morroensis was less than half the size of the parent population. Further mortality is expected because the remaining seedlings are highly clumped. We conclude that A. morroensis may require considerably longer than 40 years to establish an adequate seed bank to compensate for mortality and prevent population decrease or local extinction. This prolonged risk is perhaps explained by specialization of this species to a historic regime of relatively infrequent fire. There are many obligate-seeding species in fire-prone shrublands that may not be resilient to a regime of fire more frequent than that with which they evolved.																	1195-5449					DEC	2002	6	2							4								WOS:000186130300006						
J	Masaki, T; Nakashizuka, A				Masaki, T; Nakashizuka, A			Seedling demography of Swida controversa: effect of light and distance to conspecifics	ECOLOGY												Some shade-intolerant trees with soil seed banks also have advanced recruits under a closed canopy. To determine the relative roles of advanced recruits and seed banks in regeneration, we studied the demography of seedling cohorts of the deciduous canopy tree, Swida controversa, in an old-growth temperate forest in Japan. Five cohorts that germinated in 1988-1992 were followed for 10 yr, relating their survival. and growth to the environment. We measured distance to the nearest conspecific adult, initial local density of conspecific seedlings, herbaceous plant coverage,, light intensity, and soil water content. Seed production occurred only in 1988 and 1990, but seedlings emerged every year from 1988 to 1992. Only increasing distance to the nearest conspecific adult had a significant, positive effect on seedling survival. Damping-off by fungal pathogens was the most common cause of seedling mortality, especially near conspecific adults. Growth of seedlings was significantly and positively affected by light level; rapid growth occurred mostly in a large gap (similar to200 m(2)). Even here, however, the growth rate of seedlings decreased over time. A stochastic simulation suggested that the relative importance of soil seeds and advanced recruits changes with the distance. In sites < 25 m from conspecific adults, colonization of gaps should occur via the soil seed bank, because seedlings do not survive at these distances. In sites farther away, advanced recruits were more important than the seed bank in colonizing gaps. We hypothesize that, in sites with an abundant population of S. controversa, regeneration would most likely originate from the soil seed bank, but in other sites regeneration would most likely be from advanced recruits.																	0012-9658					DEC	2002	83	12					3497	3507									WOS:000180318200025

Although sexual reproduction plan's a role in cassava's evolution it is poorly studied. We examined one aspect of cassava reproductive ecology, seed dormancy and germination. Volunteer seedlings emerge from a soil batik of seeds produced during the previous cycle of cultivation that remain ungerminated through the fallow period. then germinate synchronously after vegetation is slashed and burned. Laboratory experiments showed that germination can be enhanced by mechanical scarification and also by dry heat treatments suggesting that hunting after field clearing could help break dormancy. Germination was also stimulated by high temperatures (35degreesC) that in nature indicate bare soils, and inhibited by temperatures (25degreesC) close to those in soil shaded by vegetation and by light. Seeds of both wild and domesticated cassava exhibit physiological dormancy, an adaptation for germination in periodically disturbed habitats. In addition to these preadaptations, preliminary results also suggest specific adaptations of domesticated cassava to the distinctive disturbance regimes of swidden agriculture.

J	Harwell, MC; Orth, RJ				Harwell, MC; Orth, RJ			Seed bank patterns in Chesapeake Bay eelgrass (Zostera marina L.): A bay-wide perspective	ESTUARIES												The decline of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Chesapeake Bay in the 1960s. and. 1970s has been studied in the context of changes in water quality and habitat suitability, little effort has focused on the importance of reproductive ecology in understanding current and potential recovery of these populations. The spatial variability of seed-bank characteristics of Z. marina in Chesapeake Bay was explored by a reproductive shoot and seed-bank sampling effort. Seed banks were sampled from 105 beds of submerged aquatic vegetation among 12 zones throughout the lower and middle Chesapeake Bay. Number of viable seeds was highly variable among and within zones, with seeds found in all but one zone and also found in cores not containing any Z. marina shoots. Number of reproductive shoots was also highly variable among and within zones, with differences probably driven by different local environmental conditions. Bay-wide, viable seeds were found in more monospecific Z. marina cores than in mixed species or monospecific Ruppia maritima cores suggesting local biological and environmental control on sexual reproduction. Lower densities of viable seeds in the middle Chesapeake Bay region reflect the lower abundance of Z. marina in these regions and provide context for discussion of historical changes in Z. marina in Chesapeake Bay. While this study focused on a snap shot of the seed bank immediately after establishment, we highlight critical questions for future study that may be important for their conservation and restoration.																	0160-8347					DEC	2002	25	6A					1196	1204		10.1007/BF02692216							WOS:000180611200013

Soil tillage was conducted at night or during daylight. In 20 out of a total of 23 field experiments, weed density after nighttime tillage was reduced compared to conventional daytime tillage. The average reduction of weed density attributable to photocontrol was 28.4 %. Results of field trials in the literature suggest that the emergence of Chenopodium album , Matricaria species and Stellaria media is especially reduced by nighttime tillage practices, but photocontrol had almost no effect on the emergence of Galium aparine and Polygonum convolvulus . The level of reduction of weed emergence after nighttime tillage was very variable. Important factors affecting this variation were: (1) the different light sensitivities of weed species, (2) the different light sensitivities of populations within one species, (3) the dormancy status of the seeds in a natural seed bank, and (4) the variation of light sensitivity of seeds.																	0931-2250					DEC	2002	188	6					389	397		10.1046/j.1439-037X.2002.00575.x							WOS:000179792300005

Groves, the single living species of genus Nitellopsis and to draw the relationships between first finds of N. merianii in North Africa and previously known records. Location South part of the High Atlas Range, Ait Kandoula basin, Morocco. Methods New finds of fossil charophyte gyrogonites were determined and illustrated. Using a large bibliographic database of both fossil and extant charophytes, we depict the biogeographical distribution N. merianii and N. obtusa and summarize the ecological requirements of N. obtusa as a modern analogue. Results The Ait Kandoula deposits, dated by magnetostratigraphy and vertebrate fossils to Upper Miocene, provided the first fossil populations of N. merianii in Africa. The distribution patterns of the Tertiary N. merianii and the living N. obtusa superimpose on a large area that extends from Spain to East Asia and characterize them as typically Eurasian taxa indicative for permanent, relatively cold and deep freshwater lakes. During the Quaternary, similar palaeolakes in the Sahara were colonized by N. obtusa . Main conclusions The presence of the Eurasian species N. merianii in North Africa is the result of dispersal by migratory waterbirds and attests to N-S migration occurring during the Upper Miocene (10-5 Myr ago). Gyrogonites imported from Southern Europe could germinate and fulfil their life cycle so as to form a new seed bank of gyrogonites because they had been deposited in a suitable environment consisting of a freshwater mountain lake.																	0305-0270					DEC	2002	29	12					1703	1711		10.1046/j.1365-2699.2002.00749.x							WOS:000179767400006

Soil samples were taken every 2 in in a regular grid (196 points) and divided into two fractions (0-3 cm and 3-10 cm deep). The viable seed bank was studied by monitoring seedling emergence for ten months. The effect of different factors on seed bank composition and patterning was analysed using constrained ordination as a hypothesis testing tool. Furthermore, the existence of spatial autocorrelation was evaluated by geostatistical analysis. Seed density was high, 7057 seed.m(-2), with a few species dominating. Species composition in the various layers were significantly correlated. The seed bank showed significant spatial structure, which was partially explainable by the spatial structure of the canopy and understorey vegetation. Spatial clumping from 0-8 in was observed in seed bank density and composition, mainly due to the pattern of two abundant taxa Juncus effusus and Ericaceae. The Ericaceae seed bank was related to the spatial distribution of dead stumps of Erica arborea. J. effusus was not present in the above-ground vegetation, which indicates that its seed bank was formed in the past. As expected, the seed bank of this forest reflects its history, which is characterized by complex man-induced perturbations. The seed bank appears to be structured as a consequence of contrasting driving forces such as canopy structure, understorey composition and structural and microhabitat features.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The relationship between communities of submerged annual macrophytes (predominately Chara spp.) and environmental characteristics is studied in three habitats with different dominant perennial species (Arthrocnemum, Juncus, Scirpus) and areas of bare soil. The distribution of submerged annual macrophytes is significantly dependent on two independent environmental factors: a dominant gradient of flooding/salinity, and a secondary gradient of nutrients related exclusively to the combined abundance of helophytes of the genus Scirpus (S. maritimus and S. litoralis). The results suggest that these emergent helophytes (1) are able to modify water column parameters (such as concentration of nitrates, phosphates, potassium, and bicarbonates) which are important for the communities of submerged macrophytes, and (2) play a fundamental role in the generation of secondary sources of environmental variability which, superimposed on the main gradient of flooding/salinity, favours the appearance of new compositional equilibria in such communities. The existence of a process of facilitation is discussed by which the emergent helophytes induce changes in nutrient availability that would favour relatively nutrient-demanding charophyte species (such as Chara connivens and Nitella hyalina), altering the established relationships with other coexisting charophytes (such as Chara canescens and C. galioides) that dominate in the absence of the facilitating species. Nevertheless, the increased nutrient concentration associated to the presence of helophytes would not introduce significant changes in the total biomass of submerged aquatic macrophytes.

However, there is no information about how relationships are established during colonization and how total biomass is distributed among plants. The main objective of this study was to determine the role of several factors which we have hypothetized as affecting biomass distribution among species in an early old-field community. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in a deeply ploughed Agropyro-Rumicion crispi community in the Basque Country (Spain). Light, water and soil nitrogen content were factorially manipulated resulting in eight experimental treatments. We also examined several site features, which could potentially influence final biomass distribution: seed bank composition, soil physico-chemical heterogeneity and cover and density of the dominant plant species in the community. A partition hypothesis testing approach using Redundancy Analysis was conducted to determine the fraction of biomass distribution variability assigned to each treatment and site feature. The most important species, in terms of biomass, were Agropyron repens, Sinapis arvensis, Arrhenatherum bulbosum and Picris echioides. As a general conclusion, biomass distribution among species during early secondary succession primarily depends on light availability and nitrogen supply. Several soil variables, such as magnesium, calcium and clay contents, also explain a relevant fraction of the biomass distribution among plant species. On the contrary, we found no effect of seed bank composition on biomass distribution. Finally, the total species number and cover of dominant species such as Sinapis arvensis, may determine final biomass distribution.

J	Cummins, RP; Miller, GR				Cummins, RP; Miller, GR			Altitudinal gradients in seed dynamics of Calluna vulgaris in eastern Scotland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Relationships between seed deposition, size of soil seed banks and some of the environmental factors affecting them were assessed for Calluna vulgaris throughout its altitudinal range (150-960 m a.s.l.) in eastern Scotland. Seed rain was assessed using pitfall traps, collected every 5-10 wk for 3 yr; germinability was determined by laboratory incubation. Seed bank size was estimated, once only, by counting seedlings emerging from soil cores kept for 50 wk in a glasshouse. Seed deposition varied annually, was related to parent plant cover but always declined with altitude, failing sharply above 600 m a.s.l. Seed bank size was more closely correlated with the proportion of organic matter in the soil than with the amount of seed rain. Seed bank sizes declined gradually with altitude but did not differ significantly between four altitudinal zones. The mean density of buried seeds was less than half the mean annual seed rain at sites below 300 m a.s.l. but was over 200 x greater than annual seed rain above 800 m, suggesting that seeds buried at high altitudes remain viable for much longer than those at lower altitudes.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				DEC	2002	13	6					859	866		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2002.tb02115.x							WOS:000181457500012

The soil seed bank was assessed using soil sample, from eight community types which form distinct vegetation units of the study area. The germinable seeds contained in the uppermost 2 cm of the soil showed a great diversity among the different communities. It ranged between 37 seedlings m(-2) in the soil inhabited by Alhagi maurorum to 2478 seedlings m(-2) in the soil inhabited by a Rhazya stricta community type.

J	Clarkson, BR; Walker, LR; Clarkson, BD; Silvester, WB				Clarkson, BR; Walker, LR; Clarkson, BD; Silvester, WB			Effect of Coriaria arborea on seed banks during primary succession on Mt Tarawera, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												An experiment was conducted over two years to investigate the effect of Coriaria arborea, a native nitrogen-fixing shrub, on soil seed banks at sites representing a post-volcanic successional sequence on Mt Tarawera, New Zealand. The sites ranged from bare volcanic ash and lapilli substrate, through low-growing pre-Coriaria vegetation, to dense stands of Coriaria scrub. Soils (to a depth of 50 mm) under recently established Coriaria and older stands had more seedlings (1096 and 1585 seedlings 0.4 m(-2), respectively) and species (37 and 45 species 0.4 m(-2), respectively) emerge than where there was no Coriaria (243-320 seedlings 0.4 m(-2), 14-25 species 0.4 m(-2)) and were the only soils with Coriaria seedlings. In total, 3488 seedlings representing 63 taxa were recorded. Seeds were still germinating after 24 months but rates declined markedly in the second year. For example, Coriaria reached a germination peak at 8 weeks but continued to germinate sporadically over the 2-year period. Tree species present in young forest within 0.5 km of the sites were absent. Establishment of Coriaria greatly accelerated an underlying trend of gradually increasing abundance and diversity of seeds in the soil with vegetation age. Adventive, wind-dispersed, and annual species were over-represented in the seed banks compared with the regional evergreen forest-dominated flora. These proportions are expected to decline as succession to forest gradually occurs.

Replicated mesh exclosures were placed at sites differing in wave exposure and received transplanted charophyte oospores and plants, with identical material placed outside. Charophyte establishment from oospores and plant biomass were greater inside exclosures compared with outside. Wave exposure did not depress germling response and the effect of fish exclosures on charophyte establishment was least apparent at the most exposed site. Exclosures did not have a statistically significant influence on the light climate, and epiphytic algal development was similar or higher inside the exclosures. However, sediment mobilisation was lower inside the exclosures. Results suggest that fish were primarily responsible for the poor performance of unprotected charophytes in Lake Rotoroa, with fish effects on plants operating via direct disturbance or grazing.																	0028-8330					DEC	2002	36	4					815	823		10.1080/00288330.2002.9517134							WOS:000180330900013

At the same time there may be circumstances in which their removal may have unforeseen negative consequences or their use in restoration is desirable. We review the types of effects exotic species may have that are important during restoration and suggest research that could increase our ability to set realistic management goals. Their control and use may be controversial; therefore we advocate consideration of exotic species in the greater context of community structure and succession and emphasize areas where ecological research could bring insight to management dilemmas surrounding exotic species and restoration. For example, an understanding of the potential transience of exotics in a site and the role particular exotics might play in changing processes that influence the course of succession is essential to setting removal priorities and realistic management goals. Likewise, a greater understanding of the ecological role of introduced species might help to reduce controversy surrounding their purposeful use in restoration. Here we link generalizations emerging from the invasion ecology literature with practical restoration concerns, including circumstances when it is practical to use exotic species in restoration.

J	Middleton, B				Middleton, B			Winter burning and the reduction of Cornus sericea in sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												To control shrubs, which are increasing in dominance in wetlands worldwide, winter burning may be an important tool, especially from the perspective of minimizing urban hazards. The goal of this project was to determine if winter burning was successful in reducing the dominance (mean percentage cover and maximum height) of Cornus sericea in sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin, where shrubs proliferated after cattle were excluded. Experimental burn and control plots were set up within sedge meadows, including an ungrazed "reference" site that had been little, if ever, grazed and a "historically grazed" site, a recovery site that had not been grazed by cattle since 1973. None of the dominant species including C. sericea was significantly affected by burning for either mean percentage cover or maximum height (analysis of variance: no burning x species interaction). Both mean percentage cover and maximum height were only weakly related to burning (28.1 and 14.3% of the variability contributed to the cumulative percentage of the coefficient of determination, respectively) at both sites based on non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Although species richness increased in burned plots in 1999 and 2000, no differences were apparent between pre-burned and unburned plots in 1997 and unburned plots in 1999 and 2000 (analysis of variance: year x burning interaction). After burning in the ungrazed site, herbaceous species appeared that had not been detected for decades, including Chelone glabra and Lathyrus palustris. Exotic species were present in both the ungrazed reference and recovery site. Although winter burning treatments did not reduce the dominance of woody shrub species in the site recovering from cattle grazing, burning was useful in stimulating the maintenance of species richness in the ungrazed sedge meadow.

Species composition, vertical and horizontal structure, and biomass were investigated, as well as diaspore communities of heavily disturbed vegetation (on trails) and adjacent undisturbed (natural and seminatural) vegetation. Results show that species resistant to trampling (e.g., Poa supina) are more frequent in disturbed than in seminatural vegetation, and that they reproduce under trampling pressure and can store more than 20,000 germinable seeds/m(2) in the uppermost 5 cm of soil. Some species (e.g., Deschampsia cespitosa) show hardly any negative effects on abundance and/or diaspore bank, whereas aboveground biomass and vegetative growth of the single ramet can be reduced by trampling. Because of the presence of species like Poa supina, some trails store a larger diaspore community than the adjacent vegetation. However, most of the species investigated, including some endemic or threatened species of the Eastern Alps, are neither able to germinate nor to establish themselves on trampled sites. There is no evidence that they develop a sufficiently persistent and evenly distributed diaspore bank for a possible regeneration in the future.																	1523-0430					NOV	2002	34	4					377	388		10.2307/1552195							WOS:000183096400003						
J	Yates, CJ; Broadhurst, LM				Yates, CJ; Broadhurst, LM			Assessing limitations on population growth in two critically endangered Acacia taxa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Flowering phenology, soil seedbank and the impact of fire, weeds and grazing were investigated in two rare Acacia taxa restricted to the agricultural district north of Perth Western Australia. Acacia aprica is known from six extant populations and one extinct population. Five of the extant populations are restricted to linear road reserves with the sixth population located in a small native vegetation remnant. Acacia cochlocarpa ssp. cochlocarpa is known from a single population also situated on a road verge. Size class structure, levels of canopy death and an absence of juveniles indicated that all populations are in decline. Flowering intensity and success varied between populations and years in A. aprica and between years in A. cochlocarpa ssp. cochlocarpa. Seed bank analysis indicated that seeds were patchily distributed while experimental fires demonstrated that such events could break seed dormancy and promote germination. Both taxa have similar germination physiologies and showed increased germination after seeds were exposed to heat. Following emergence, however, competition with annual weeds had a negative impact on seedling growth and survival in both taxa. While vertebrate grazing had some influence, weeds were the major inhibitory influence on recruitment. Reduced fire frequencies since fragmentation may be responsible for population decline in both taxa but other site specific factors such as weeds and grazing may affect the establishment of seedlings following fire.

J	Bertiller, MB; Ares, JO; Bisigato, AJ				Bertiller, MB; Ares, JO; Bisigato, AJ			Multiscale indicators of land degradation in the Patagonian Monte, Argentina	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Depletion of vegetation by overgrazing in and environments has long-lasting effects on the environmental quality over extended geographic areas. An adequate inspection of habitat changes requires scaled up procedures that would allow assessing end-points of environmental status in broad areas that would be based on processes occurring at the plant canopy level. Our purpose was to find indicators of land degradation-conservation status for use in land monitoring programs and in planning management practices that would be amenable to further up-scaling for use with remotely sensed imagery. In several sites of the Patagonian Monte differing in the impact of grazing management, we evaluated vegetation attributes at three spatial scales. At the population scale, we found that the severity of grazing impact was characterized by the reduction of the palatable grass, P. ligularis, outside and inside shrub canopies. At the vegetation patch scale, we found that land degradation by domestic herbivore impact was characterized by changes in attributes of patch shape (radius, height, internal canopy cover) and patch abundance. At the plant community scale, we found that the structure of the plant canopy as described using Fourier analysis of cover data changed after long-term grazing impact consistently with the modifications in plant population and patch structures. We present a conceptual multiscale scenario of structural changes triggered by domestic herbivore impact, and quantitative indicators of plant structure and processes useful to develop management strategies of the Patagonian-Monte that would conserve its natural habitats. The developed end-points are also amenable for use in land conservation assessment through remotely sensed imagery.

J	Lei, TT; Semones, SW; Walker, JF; Clinton, BD; Nilsen, ET				Lei, TT; Semones, SW; Walker, JF; Clinton, BD; Nilsen, ET			Effects of Rhododendron maximum thickets on tree seed dispersal, seedling morphology, and survivorship	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												In the southern Appalachian forests, the regeneration of canopy trees is severely inhibited by Rhododendron maximum L., an evergreen understory shrub producing dense thickets. While light availability is a major cause, other factors may also contribute to the absence of tree seedlings under R. maximum. We examined the effects of R. maximum on several life history stages of tree species, including seed dispersal, seed bank germination, seedling growth, and survivorship. We found no significant effect of R. maximum on seed reaching the forest floor for Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus rubra, Quercus prinus, Carya spp., and Nyssa sylvatica. This indicates that either seed output of maternal trees rooted within the thicket were unaffected by R. maximum or seed dispersal from surrounding areas into thickets compensated for a lower seed production of canopy trees rooted in the thickets. Germination of tree seeds (A. rubrum, L. tulipifera, Q. rubra, and Betula lenta) from the seed bank also was not reduced by leaves and substrates within the thickets. Seedling mortality of all species (Q. rubra, Prunus serotina, and Tsuga canadensis) planted in our experimental plots was up to fivefold higher in thickets of R. maximum compared with those outside the thickets. The order of mortality under the R. maximum thickets,, was consistent with the shade tolerance Prunus 1 Quercus 1 Tsuga ranking of these species. Loss of Tsuga seedlings was attributed to burial by litter rather than shade. Surviving seedlings of Quercus and Prunus in R. maximum thickets were taller than those outside the thickets, but the seedlings in R. maximum thickets produced significantly fewer leaves, smaller total leaf area, leaf mass, and stem mass. Leaf N (%) was significantly higher in Quercus seedlings in R. maximum thickets compared with seedlings outside the thickets. Moreover, no difference was found in leaf N (%) between forest types for Prunus and Tsuga, indicating that seedlings in R. maximum thickets were not N limited. Rather, light limitation, herbivory, and litter fall contributed to the lack of tree regeneration under R. maximum thickets.																	1058-5893					NOV	2002	163	6					991	1000		10.1086/342711							WOS:000178972600012						
J	Preston, CA; Betts, H; Baldwin, IT				Preston, CA; Betts, H; Baldwin, IT			Methyl jasmonate as an allelopathic agent: Sagebrush inhibits germination of a neighboring tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata is the dominant and defining shrub in the Great Basin Desert, with well-documented allelopathic tendencies that have generally been ascribed to its most abundantly released secondary metabolites. However, as a minor component, sagebrush releases a highly biologically active substance, methyljasmonate (MeJA), which is known to function as both a germination inhibitor and promoter in laboratory studies. Nicotiana attenuata is a tobacco species native to the Great Basin Desert and grows in newly burned juniper sagebrush habitats for 2-3 yr following a fire. With a combination of field and laboratory studies, we examined the role of MeJA release from sagebrush by both air and water transport in inhibiting N. attenuata seed germination. We demonstrated that sagebrush interacts allelopathically with the seed bank of N. attenuata through its release of MeJA. In the field, seeds buried 0-40 cm from sagebrush plants for 4 months in net bags had significantly reduced germination compared to seeds buried similarly but protected in plastic bags. Moreover, germination on soils collected from underneath sagebrush plants was reduced by 60% compared to seeds placed on soils collected between sagebrush plants or outside of the sagebrush population. Exposure to A. tridentata seeds and seedlings did not affect N. attenuata germination, suggesting that established sagebrush plants only influence the tobacco's seed bank. In the laboratory, exposure of seeds to sagebrush emissions resulted in germination delays of up to 6 d. Exposure to volatile and aqueous MeJA also inhibited germination of N. attenuata seeds at quantities that are released naturally by sagebrush: 3.5 mug/hr and 1.12 mug/seed cup (56 ng/seed), respectively. A. tridentata seeds were significantly more resistant to MeJA, being inhibited at 336 mug MeJA (16.8 mug/seed), 300 times greater than the level of aqueous MeJA required to inhibit N. attenuata seeds. MeJA inhibited N. attenuata germination regardless of the seed's dormancy state and the specific epimer (trans- or cis-) of MeJA. Germination on sagebrush chaff that had been heated to reduce MeJA content was negatively correlated with the amount of MeJA remaining in the chaff. Germination of a nondormant, conspecific tobacco, N. trigonophylla, which grows in the same area but is not associated with fire, is less sensitive than N. attenuata to the extracts of sagebrush litter, but similarly sensitive to MeJA. Additionally, four of five other tobacco species that are not known to be associated with sagebrush are less sensitive to MeJA, suggesting an evolved sensitivity to MeJA. To determine the proportion of germination inhibition of a sagebrush extract that could be attributed to MeJA, we serially diluted sagebrush extracts with water and restored the quantity of MeJA of the original extract by adding appropriate quantities of synthetic MeJA; 16-60% of the inhibitory activity of the original extract could be attributed to the MeJA. We conclude that MeJA release from sagebrush plays an allelopathic role for N. attenuata seed banks, but other unidentified compounds are also involved.

J	Stahl-Delbanco, A; Hansson, LA				Stahl-Delbanco, A; Hansson, LA			Effects of bioturbation on recruitment of algal cells from the "seed bank" of lake sediments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Effects of different bioturbators on recruitment of several nuisance algae, Anaboena spp. (Cyanophyta), Microcystis spp. (Cyanophyta), and Gonvostomum semen (Raphidophyta), from sediment to water were studied in a long-term laboratory experiment. Natural sediment, where macrofauna larger than 1 mm had been removed, was added to 18 aquaria. To each of six aquaria, individuals of Asellus aquaticus (Isopoda) or Chironomus plumosus (Arthropoda) larvae were added, and six aquaria were left as bioturbation-free controls. Recruitment of Anabaena, Microcystis, and G. semen from the sediment was detected using inverted traps that were sampled once a week during 8 weeks. The activities of the isopod A. aquaticus increased recruitment rates of all algal groups investigated, whereas chironomids had a less pronounced effect. With respect to Anabaena, increased recruitment rate was expressed as a promotion of growth in the pelagic habitat. To our knowledge, these results are the first to demonstrate that bioturbating invertebrates affect the recruitment of phytoplankton resting stages. Moreover, our results suggest that recruitment rate might be more pronounced in littoral areas, which are often dominated by A. aquaticus, rather than in profundal areas of a lake, generally dominated by chironomids. Hence, with respect to algal dynamics, the strength of the coupling between the benthic and pelagic zones might vary both spatially and temporally, depending on composition of the benthic invertebrate community and the ontogenetic development of the individuals within it.

Five populations were selected in contrasted environments. In all cases, distribution of seeds in the soil was limited to 3 cm depth. No innate dormancy was observed but combination of hard seed coat and hilum opening controlled by environmental conditions were responsible for an induced dormancy and the constitution of a persistent seed bank. Breaking of this dormancy was obtained by a brief elevation of temperature from 25degrees to 45degreesC. Impacts of this phenomenon concern both genetic and demographic aspects of in situ conservation of the species. Consequences on ex situ conservation are mainly related with the regeneration of the seed collection.																	0002-9122					OCT	2002	89	10					1644	1650		10.3732/ajb.89.10.1644							WOS:000183131800011	21665592					
J	Warwick, SI; Francis, A; Susko, DJ				Warwick, SI; Francis, A; Susko, DJ			The biology of Canadian weeds. 9. Thlaspi arvense L. (updated)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												An updated review of biological information is provided for Thlaspi arvense. Native to Eurasia, the species is naturalized and widely spread in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, including all of Canada's provinces and territories, and has recently spread to temperate regions in the southern hemisphere. It is an annual pioneer of disturbed soils and is an important weed of grain, oilseed, and forage crops in Canada, particularly in the prairies. High levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates can contaminate canola. When present in hay or other fodder, its seeds or leaves can be toxic to animals, as well as contaminate milk and meat with unpleasant flavors. It can serve as a host for insect, nematode, fungal and viral pests of canola and mustard crops. A persistent seed bank, high fecundity, and the growth habit of a hardy winter annual with early- (EF) and late-flowering (LF) strains, all contribute to its ability to compete with crops. Effective herbicides include the sulfonylureas, chlorsulfuron and ethametsulphuron, MCPA, tribenuronmethyl, phenocyacetic acid, flurtamone, 2,4-D, 2,4-D + dicamba, and 2,4-D + picloram. A resistant biotype to Group 2 herbicides, which inhibit acetolactate synthase (ALS), has been found at two to five sites in Alberta in 2001. The potential of T. arvense as an industrial oilseed crop is being investigated.																	0008-4220					OCT	2002	82	4					803	823		10.4141/P01-159							WOS:000179839400026

J	Sheppard, AW; Hodge, P; Paynter, Q; Rees, M				Sheppard, AW; Hodge, P; Paynter, Q; Rees, M			Factors affecting invasion and persistence of broom Cytisus scoparius in Australia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The effective management of invasive plants requires an understanding of their invasiveness in contrasting environments. The effects of disturbance on recruitment of broom Cytisus scoparius, a European shrub invading parts of Australasia, was assessed in a 7-year experiment carried out in two countries, respectively, in its native and exotic ranges. This paper presents the results for Australia and their implications for the biological control of this weed. 2. Disturbance treatments involved removal (cut or cut plus cultivation) and grazing effects on broom seed banks and recruitment, in mature and immature stands and in three habitats, ranging from improved, largely exotic pasture to unimproved native grassland. 3. The time between recruitment and flowering varied between 5 and 7 years depending on habitat, the slowest being in native unimproved grassland. In cultivated plots, regeneration was faster in immature compared with mature broom stands. 4. Following broom removal, whether the ground was cultivated or not had little effect on the speed of regeneration, indicating weak suppression from the ground flora in uncultivated plots. In contrast, grazing tended to increase the rate of regeneration. 5. The timing of seedling establishment had little effect on survival to reproduction, in marked contrast to European populations. The overall rates of seedling mortality were greater in Australia compared with Europe. 6. A simulation model, parameterized from the field data, was used to explore the likely impact of biological control from pre-dispersal seed predation. 7. The simulation studies demonstrated large habitat-specific differences in seed rain requirement for broom persistence and the potential impact of seed predators. Seed rain requirements were fivefold less in improved exotic pasture vs. native grassland. Seed loss of 62% was theoretically sufficient to suppress broom in native grassland, whereas > 97% was required in exotic pasture. 8. This study suggests that successful broom control in Australia is likely to be site dependent, because while broom seed has greater opportunities for recruitment in Australia than in Europe, immature plant mortality can be very high, particularly in native grassland.

J	Dupre, C; Ehrlen, J				Dupre, C; Ehrlen, J			Habitat configuration, species traits and plant distributions	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 In a metapopulation context, the distribution of a species in a patchy landscape is interpreted as the equilibrium outcome of extinction and colonization processes. Populations are thus more likely to occur in larger, better connected habitat fragments. 2 To test whether metapopulation models explain distribution patterns of plant species with different life histories we investigated the incidence of herbaceous species in deciduous forests in four provinces of south Sweden. 3 These data were correlated with habitat quality (soil pH, nitrogen mineralization and organic matter) and habitat configuration (patch area and distance to the nearest deciduous forest patch). We also examined whether habitat configuration affected the distribution of species with different life history attributes. 4 All ground layer plant species at 81 sites were recorded, and distribution patterns of 57 species were tested against seed mass, seed number, presence of a seed bank, plant height, life span, mode of pollination, dispersal mode and habitat preference. 5 Habitat quality, especially pH, was more important for the incidence of species than habitat configuration with patch area and isolation significantly affecting only 11 and four species, respectively. Species favoured by larger area were also disadvantaged by greater isolation. 6 The importance of habitat configuration to a species varied with life history. Species that were more negatively affected by patch isolation tended to be habitat specialists and clonal perennials and to produce fewer seeds. Animal-dispersed species were more negatively affected by small stand size. 7 Habitat configuration may be less important for vascular plant distributions than habitat quality or the effects of land use history.

J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM			Studies on the seed germination and flowering stages of the life cycle of the shale barren endemic Arabis serotina Steele (Brassicaceae)	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Arabis serotina Steele is endemic to the shale barrens of Virginia and West Virginia, USA, and long-term seed storage has been proposed as part of the recovery plan for this federally listed endangered species. However, seeds slowly lose viability during storage and must be replaced with new ones, potentially produced by plants held in storage. Thus, it is important to be able to grow plants to reproductive maturity from seeds. The purpose of our research was to determine the environmental conditions required for seed dormancy break and germination, as well as those for bolting and flowering. Seeds were dormant at maturity in autumn, and dormancy break occurred during 12 weeks of cold stratification at 5degreesC or during burial at natural winter temperatures. After dormancy was broken, seeds germinated over a wide range of temperatures and to higher percentages in light than in darkness. Seeds buried under natural temperatures from October 1990 to March 1991 were nondormant, but those remaining buried until September 1991 were dormant (secondary dormancy). Seeds sown on soil in a nonheated greenhouse in October 1992 germinated in the springs of 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996, suggesting that the species has the potential to form a persistent soil seed bank. Rosettes required >1235 h of vernalization (i.e., exposure to temperatures from ca. 0degreesC to 10degreesC) before subsequently bolting and flowering. However, plants were day neutral with respect to critical photoperiod required for bolting and flowering. Knowledge of the low temperature requirement for seed dormancy break and for vernalization of rosettes for bolting and flowering will facilitate (1) production of new seeds from plants grown from seeds held in long-term storage, and (2) ex situ propagation of the species.																	0885-8608					OCT	2002	22	4					270	276									WOS:000178695200003						
J	Odland, A; del Moral, R				Odland, A; del Moral, R			Thirteen years of wetland vegetation succession following a permanent drawdown, Myrkdalen Lake, Norway	PLANT ECOLOGY												Myrkdalen Lake in Western Norway was subjected to a 1.4 m drawdown in June 1987. Plant establishment and vegetation succession on the exposed sediments of a fluvial delta plain was monitored through 2000. The investigated area extended from the original Equisetum fluviatile zone to the new lake edge. The substrate was homogeneous and consisted mainly of minerogenous fluvial sediments. Vegetation data were sampled within continuous quadrats along transects perpendicular to the shore, and they dropped 93 cm in elevation. Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis confirmed that "time since drawdown" and "elevation of the quadrats" appeared to be of nearly equal importance in explaining succession. Plant establishment was rapid on the exposed sediments due to a seed bank and to rapid invasion of plants. The succession includes both floristic change as a function of time and a spatial separation in relation to the water level. The species succession was marked by a growth form progression: mosses and annuals non-clonal perennials clonal perennials. After one month, the annual Subularia aquatica and small acrocarpous mosses dominated the site. Dominance then shifted to Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus filiformis, Blasia pusilla and Polytrichum commune. Subsequently there was an increase of Carex vesicaria in the lower zone and Calamagrostis purpurea in the upper zone, while Phalaris arundinacea was common over most of the elevational gradient. Equisetum declined where it had dominated before drawdown, but it expanded gradually towards the new shoreline. The vegetation remained dynamic after 13 years and it is not considered to be in equilibrium with the new environmental gradient yet. However, annual changes measured by DCA scores have slowed and two vegetation zones have developed. The major vegetational differences along the elevational gradient can be explained by the height of the mean June water limit. This example of species turnover in space and time may be a model for other successions that occur along a strong gradient.																	1385-0237					OCT	2002	162	2					185	198		10.1023/A:1020388910724							WOS:000178213400004						
J	Sawma, JT; Mohler, CL				Sawma, JT; Mohler, CL			Evaluating seed viability by an unimbibed seed crush test in comparison with the tetrazolium test	WEED TECHNOLOGY												The unimbibed crush test, in which seed viability is evaluated by crushing and visual inspection of dry seeds, was compared with tetrazolium staining, an established method of testing seed viability. The unimbibed crush test potentially provides an immediate and rapid method for determining seed viability. Six sets of seed lots, involving the four weed species, velvetleaf, common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, and smooth pigweed, were tested by each method. For four of the six sets, results from the crush test were statistically indistinguishable from those of the tetrazolium test. For the other two sets of seed lots, the crush test indicated higher viability than did the tetrazolium test. The crush test may be most useful for seed bank surveys in which many samples are typically processed, and most of the variation in density of viable seeds is associated with number of seeds present rather than percentage viability. Its use in more exacting circumstances like seed survival studies requires caution.																	0890-037X					OCT-DEC	2002	16	4					781	786		10.1614/0890-037X(2002)016[0781:ESVBAU]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000179784600014

J	Crossle, K; Brock, MA				Crossle, K; Brock, MA			How do water regime and clipping influence wetland plant establishment from seed banks and subsequent reproduction?	AQUATIC BOTANY												This paper presents the findings from an experiment designed to address whether grazing in interaction with water regime influences wetland plant establishment and reproduction, using clipping to simulate grazing. The experiment was a randomised complete block design in a set of outdoor tanks in which communities establishing from seed banks were assessed. For wetland plant species from the Northern Tablelands of NSW, Australia, water regime primarily determined which species germinated from the seed bank to form a wetland community. The subsequent total reproductive output was largely controlled by clipping and its influence,on growth of species. Three different responses to clipping were observed. For some species, e.g. Limosella australis R. Br., Centipeda minima (L.) A. Braun & Asch., and Lythrum salicaria L., both biomass and production of reproductive units increased following clipping. Other species did not replace biomass lost to clipping and produced fewer reproductive units compared to unclipped populations (e.g. Vallisneria gigantea Graeb., Myriophyllum variifolium Hook. f.). A third response, shown by Cyperus sanguinolentus Vahl., was an increase in the number of reproductive units produced together with a decrease in biomass as a result of clipping. These clipping-mediated changes in reproductive output have the potential for altering the structure and dynamics of the extant wetland vegetation and soil seed bank, with implications for species conservation and weed management.

The effects of the movement of these herbicides in the soil and in maize plants was measured on Striga germination and on legumes intercropped with maize. Striga seeds were killed when high rates of either herbicide percolated through simulated soil columns; almost no viable Striga seeds remained in the upper 10 cm, and >80% were killed at 30 cm. The herbicides applied to maize leaf whorls moved systemically out of roots, killing attached and germinating Striga. Sensitive crops (beans, cowpea, and yellow gram) were unaffected when planted at >15 cm. from maize coated with 0.4 mg a.i. pyrithiobac or 0.84 mg a.i. imazapyr seed(-1), but were severely inhibited when planted within 12 cm. Simple herbicide seed coatings are thus compatible with commonly used African intercropping systems, while facilitating maize growth and depleting the Striga seed bank.

Using both descriptive statistics and detrended correspondence analysis, major contrasts are found in the abundance and floristic composition of the viable seed bank between the bank top, bank face and bank toe and between the three study sites. Canonical correspondence analysis identifies associations between the floristic composition of the seed bank and the percent organic matter, percent clay, percent sand and median particle size of the soil matrix that contains the seeds. The patterns revealed by the above analyses indicate (i) an increasing influence of fluvial processes (hydrochory) on the species composition of the seed bank with decreasing elevation; (ii) a low abundance of viable seeds on unvegetated eroding bank sections, suggesting limited long-term storage of viable seeds within floodplain sediments; and (iii) a very substantial seed bank where old channel sections provide a local depositional environment. The implications of these observations for understanding the role of fluvial processes in riparian seed bank dynamics and their implications for riparian management are discussed.

Soil samples (depth 3 cm, 0.25 m(2)) were collected within a 1-ha plot in the dry seasons of 1996 and 1997 and the rainy season of 1997 (84 samples per collection). Thirty-five seed traps (0.25 m(2) each) were placed randomly in the forest from March 1997 to February 1998. The greatest density of seeds in the soil occurred in samples collected during the rainy season, the period which coincides with the main fruiting period in this forest.. The Sorensen similarity index values for the seed bank composition among the three periods were high (> 0.50). The fallout of propagules was strongly seasonal, with more than half of the annual total number of seeds being caught in the two months around the end of the dry season and beginning of the rainy season. The mean density of seeds in the soil bank was nearly 86% lower than the seed rain density. There was no clear evidence of seasonal effects on species density and richness in this forest.				grombone-guaratini, maria/D-8754-2015; Rodrigues, Ricardo Ribeiro R/D-5557-2012	Rodrigues, Ricardo Ribeiro R/0000-0003-4818-0736												0266-4674					SEP	2002	18		5				759	774		10.1017/S0266467402002493							WOS:000178060700008						
J	Senbeta, F; Teketay, D; Naslund, BA				Senbeta, F; Teketay, D; Naslund, BA			Native woody species regeneration in exotic tree plantations at Munessa-Shashemene Forest, southern Ethiopia	NEW FORESTS												Regeneration of native woody species was studied in the plantations and the adjacent natural forest at Munessa-Shashemene Forest Project Area, Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that tree plantations foster regeneration of native woody species. A total of 60 plots, having 10x10 m area each, were studied in monoculture plantations of 4 exotic species (Cupressus lusitanica, Eucalyptus globulus, E. saligna, Pinus patula) and an adjacent natural forest. Ages of the plantations ranged between 9 and 28 years. Soil seed bank analysis was also undertaken from soil samples collected in each of the 60 plots to examine the similarity between the soil seed flora and aboveground vegetation. A total of 56 naturally regenerated woody species were recorded beneath all plantation stands with densities ranging between 2300 and 18650 individuals/ha in different stands. There was a significant difference among plantation stands with regard to understorey density (standard deviation: 4836+/-1341). Vegetation diversity was assessed through analyses of floristic composition, species richness and abundance. Generally, seedling populations were the most abundant components of the regeneration in most of the plantation stands, forming 68% of the total regeneration count in all stands. A total of 77 plant species represented by 44 herbs, 13 woody species, 8 grasses and 12 unidentified species were recorded in the soil seed bank from all stands. Similarity between the soil seed bank and aboveground flora was very low implying that the role of soil seed banks is negligible rather dispersal plays an important role in the process of regeneration. These results support the concept that forest plantations can foster the regeneration of native woody species, thereby increasing biological diversity, provided that there are seed sources in the vicinity of the plantations.																	0169-4286	1573-5095				SEP	2002	24	2					131	145		10.1023/A:1021201107373							WOS:000179476900004

The seed ecology of this species was investigated by laboratory germination of fresh seed, and germination of samples from soil seed banks of two North Island populations. Seed collected from a submontane population had higher germinability (76%) than seed collected from a lowland population (32%). Seed collected from an isolated lowland garden tree had high germinability (82%). A. lucida seeds were abundant in both the surface and basal soil layers, and it was predicted that the species maintains a persistent seed bank for up to c. 8 years. A. lucida was the dominant component of the seed bank at the submontane site. The germination pattern of A. lucida was compared with other woody species in the seed bank and found to have similarities with species that often colonise disturbed sites. The maintenance of a persistent seed bank, coupled with the long period of time over which fresh seed germinates, gives this species flexibility in the timing of germination. Overall, the results indicate that the species is adapted to disturbed environments.																	0028-825X					SEP	2002	40	3					397	404									WOS:000179133400009

J	Bossuyt, B; Heyn, M; Hermy, M				Bossuyt, B; Heyn, M; Hermy, M			Seed bank and vegetation composition of forest stands of varying age in central Belgium: consequences for regeneration of ancient forest vegetation	PLANT ECOLOGY												Vegetation composition differs significantly between ancient and recent forest, due to slow colonization capacity of typical forest species and the higher abundance of early successional species in recent forest. However, little is known about differences in persistent seed bank composition between ancient and recent forest and about the interaction between seed bank and vegetation in relation with forest age. We surveyed the seed bank and the understorey vegetation composition in transects from ancient to recent forest. Seed bank and field layer vegetation characteristics and similarity between seed bank and vegetation were analysed in relation to recent forest age and distance to the ancient forest. A total of 39 species and 14,911 seedlings germinated, which corresponds with a seed density of 12,426 seeds/m(2). Total seed density is significantly higher in the youngest recent forest parcel (55 years). Also the seed bank composition in the youngest forest parcel differs significantly from the other parcels. After a longer period of reforestation, the seed bank approaches that of the ancient forest, suggesting seed bank depletion, although the seed bank is permanently replenished to some extent by seed bank forming species from local disturbances. Seed bank composition does not change significantly with distance to the ancient forest. Similarity between seed bank and vegetation composition, no matter the forest age, is very low, but decreases with increasing forest age. The most frequent species in the vegetation are absent in the seed bank and vice versa. The contribution of forest species is high in the vegetation and they almost not occur in the seed bank, while species of forest edges and clearings, and species of disturbed environments are more frequent in the seed bank. The seed bank is mainly composed of early successional species of former forest stages or species which temporary occur in small-scale disturbances. The seed bank may enhance the negative effects of early successional, mainly competitive species to the forest species richness in the recent forest. In this respect, forest management should minimise forest disturbances, to prevent germination of competitive species form buried seeds.

J	Geertsema, W; Sprangers, JTCM				Geertsema, W; Sprangers, JTCM			Plant distribution patterns related to species characteristics and spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity in a network of ditch banks	PLANT ECOLOGY												In this study we investigated the relationship between the distribution patterns of a number of herbaceous plant species and the isolation and age of habitat patches. The study was conducted for a network of ditch banks in an agricultural landscape in The Netherlands. Thirteen plant species were selected representing contrasting dispersal and seed bank characteristics. Isolation of habitat patches was determined by the distance to the nearest occupied patch and by the number of occupied patches in circles of increasing radius around the patches. Age was the number of years since the creation of the ditches. In a multiple logistic regression model the separate effects of age of the habitat and the spatial variables were analyzed. A number of habitat variables were used to correct the effect of habitat quality. We concluded that distribution patterns of plant species were mainly determined by habitat quality and the presence of seed sources at short distances (< 25 m). This conclusion was independent of the dispersal characteristics of the species. Most species had higher occupation frequencies in older than younger ditch banks. Only species with persistent seeds had comparable occupation probabilities in older and younger habitat patches, indicating the importance of the soil seed bank as a source of colonization after large-scale disturbances. The effect of age and management on the occupation probabilities of the species was often diminished in the regression model, probably due to correlation between some habitat variables and the age of the patches.																	1385-0237					SEP	2002	162	1					91	108		10.1023/A:1020336908907							WOS:000178213200008

A rich set of dynamical phenomena is uncovered. We consider two forms of density dependence in the active population: logistic and exponential. In the former case, the basin of attraction for stable population growth becomes fractal, and the bifurcation diagrams for the active and refuge populations are chaotic over a wide range of parameter space. In the case of exponential density dependence, the dynamics are unconditionally stable (in that the population size is always positive and finite), and chaotic behavior is completely eradicated for modest amounts of dispersal. We argue that the use of exponential density dependence is more appropriate, theoretically as well as empirically, in a model of refuge dynamics.

We simulated competition between a seed banking and a non-banking morph of an annual plant. A constant fraction of the banker morph seeds was allocated to the seed bank, where they had a constant mortality and germination rate. All surviving seeds of the non-banker morph germinated in the next generation. The seedlings of both morphs experienced similar density-dependent mortality. Whether one of the morphs wins or the morphs coexist was evaluated from parameter space plots and statistically with logistic regression analysis. All parameters of the model had a significant, nonlinear effect on the persistence of the morphs, supporting our approach of numerically covering a wide range of parameter values. The seed production of a focal morph increased its survival and decreased the survival of the other morph. Otherwise, the morphs showed opposite response to changes in the model parameters. The banker morph was usually the winning strategy when it had a higher seed production than the non-banker morph. The banker morph benefitted from high germination probability, while the non-banker benefitted from high allocation to seed bank and high seed mortality. The coexistence of the morphs was inhibited by high banker morph seed production and seed mortality and promoted by high values of all other parameters. The system showed complex dynamics when banking was the winning strategy or the morphs coexisted. In addition, a part of the parameter space where the non-banker morph wins showed complex dynamics. Our results suggest that seed banking is a beneficial strategy if seed number is increased consequently, e.g. due to a decreased seed size. If banking decreases seed number, the non-banker morph wins or the two morphs coexist. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nunney, L				Nunney, L			The effective size of annual plant populations: The interaction of a seed bank with fluctuating population size in maintaining genetic variation	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Many annual plant populations undergo dramatic fluctuations in size. Such fluctuations can result in the loss of genetic variability. Here I formalize the potential for a seed bank to buffer against such genetic loss. The average time to seed germination (T) defines the generation time of "annuals" with a seed bank, and assuming random seed germination, I show that, under otherwise ideal conditions, a population's effective size (N-e) equals NT, where N is the number of adult plants. This result supports the general principle that lengthening the prereproductive period increases N-e. When adult numbers vary, N-e at any time depends on N and on the numbers contributing to the seed bank in previous seasons. Averaging these effects over time gives N-e approximate to N-h + (T - 1)N-a, where N-h and N-a are the harmonic e h a and arithmetic means of the adult population. Thus if T >>1, N-e is determined primarily by N-a. Simulations showed that until fluctuations in N are large (>25x) this relationship is accurate. I extended the theory to incorporate a selfing rate (S) and reproductive variance (I) through seed production (k), outcrossed pollen (m), and variation in selfing rate: N-c = NT(1 - S/2)/(1 + I) = NT/[(1 + F-IS)(1 + I)]. Reproductive variance (I) equals [I-k(1 + S)(2) + I-m (1 - S)(2) + 2(1 - S-2)I-km + (SIs)-I-2(1 + I-k)]/4, where I-j is the standardized variance (V-j/j(2)) of factor j and I-km is the standardized covariance between k and m. These results are applicable to other organisms with a similar life history, such as freshwater crustaceans with diapausing eggs (e. g., tadpole shrimp, clam shrimp, and fairy shrimp) and other semelparous species with discrete breeding seasons and a variable maturation time (e. g., Pacific salmon).

The results show (i) that it is possible to establish a successional gradient from short grasslands to early stages of forests with vegetation data; (ii) that there is a weak correspondence between vegetation and seed bank (mean similarity 41%), which was mainly dominated by opportunistic annual or biennial species (Hypericum perforatum, Blackstonia perfoliata); (iii) that there are differences between spatial patterns of vegetation and seed bank. These spatial patterns often exhibit a time lag and represent different levels of heterogeneity. The spatial heterogeneity of the seed bank and its independence from the vegetation structure were interpreted according to the functioning of the two compartments and their type of exchanges (through seed rain and seedling recruitment).

J	Smith, LM; Haukos, DA				Smith, LM; Haukos, DA			Floral diversity in relation to playa wetland area and watershed disturbance	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												There are 25,000-30,000 playa wetlands in the intensively cultivated Southern Great Plains of the United States. Knowledge of area and watershed influences on wetland flora are needed to guide their conservation. We surveyed plant-community composition in 224 playas over 360,000 km(2) and examined the relationships of species richness and diversity (Shannon's) to playa area and watershed disturbance. The relationship of increasing species diversity to increasing area is most often hypothesized to be associated with an increasing number of habitats and/or larger populations as area increases. Watershed disturbance (perennial grassland vs. annual cropland) was included to determine its relationship to floral diversity and bioinvasion by exotic species. For all (terrestrial and wetland) plant species and all playas, there were only marginal relationships (r(2) < 0.1) between area and richness and diversity. Analyses supported the hypothesis that the number of habitats affects playa plant diversity because number of habitats changed little as playa area increased. Tests on only wetland plant species suggested stronger (r(2) &CONG; 0.2) relationships between richness and area. This relationship also was not likely related to increased population size, because large playas remain flooded longer than small playas, and therefore wetland plant species have a greater opportunity to become established. Finally, playas with cropland watersheds had more (p < 0.05) exotic species, higher diversity, and fewer perennial species than playas with grassland watersheds. Because watershed cultivation has altered playa hydroperiod and increased frequency of disturbance, playas are associated with a flora dominated more by annuals and exotics. Conservation efforts aimed at preserving playa wetland plant diversity and native communities should focus not only on the area of the wetland but also on the condition of its watershed.																	0888-8892					AUG	2002	16	4					964	974		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00561.x							WOS:000177199500013

For this, two successive crops of tori were grown in the same fields each year; the first crop was planted in the usual sowing date (third week of October) and it was harvested in the third week of January, when the crop was fully matured. The second crop was planted as catch crop immediately after the harvest of the first crop. Catch crop plants when 1-month-old (early flowering stage) were harvested as green vegetables. The reduction of Orobanche seed bank by the first crop was 20.9% in 1997/98 and 26.2% in 1998/99, and the reduction due to the second crop (catch crop) was 33.35% in 1997/98 and 27.95% in 1998/99. These values were significantly high compared with that of fallow plots. Optimum density of tori plants required for the significant reduction of Orobanche seed bank was found to be about 140/m(2) that equals 2.1 g of tori seeds sown/m(2). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Brooks, ML				Brooks, ML			Peak fire temperatures and effects on annual plants in the Mojave Desert	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Very little is known about the behavior and effects of fire in the Mojave Desert, because fire was historically uncommon. However, fire has become more frequent since the 1970s with increased dominance of the invasive annual,grasses Bromus rubens and Schismus spp.. and land managers are concerned about its ecological effect. In this paper, I describe patterns of peak tire temperature and their effect on annual plants in creosote bush scrub vegetation of the Mojave Desert. Temperatures were monitored among microhabitats and distances front the soil surface, and between spring and summer. Microhabitats ranged from high amounts of fuel beneath creosote bush Larrea tridentata) canopies, to intermediate amounts at the canopy drip line, to how amounts in the interspaces between them. Distances from the soil surface were within the vertical range where most annual plant seeds occur (-2. 0, 5. and 10 cm). I also compare temperature patterns with postfire changes in soil properties and annual plant biomass and species richness to infer potential mechanisms by which fires affect annual plants. Peak fire temperatures were most affected by the microhabitat fuel gradient, and the effects of fire oil annual plants varied among microhabitats, Beneath creosote bushes, lethal fire temperatures for annual plant seeds occurred above- and belowground, resulting ill four postfire years of reduced annual plant biomass and species richness due most likely to mortality. especially of Bromus rubens and native forbs. At the canopy drip line. lethal fire temperatures occurred only above-round, reducing annual plant biomass for 1 yr and species richness for 2 yr, and increasing biorriass of'Schisinus sp.. the alien furb Erodium cicularillm, and native annuals after 3 yr. Negligible changes were Caused by fire in inter,,paces or between spring and summer, Fire effects models for creosote bush scrub vegetation Must account for patterns of peak fire temperature along the shrub-intershrub gradient. The responses of annual plants to this gradient vary depending on the species composition of the seedling cohort, their microhabitat affinities. and their respective phenologic stages ill the time of burning. Fire can temporarily reduce seed densities of Bromus rubens, but dominance of Schismus sp, may quickly increase above prefire levels.																	1051-0761					AUG	2002	12	4					1088	1102		10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1088:PFTAEO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000177384300011						
J	Noe, GB				Noe, GB			Temporal variability matters: Effects of constant vs. varying moisture and salinity on germination	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Most ecological experiments test constant environmental conditions instead of the temporally varying conditions that are typical of most ecological systems. This study experimentally evaluated the effects of temporal variations of soil salinity and moisture on the germination of an 11-species annual plant assemblage. In soil-based microcosms with common seed banks, constant conditions were compared to different amplitudes, durations, and seasonal timing of low salinity or high moisture that simulate conditions in the upper intertidal marsh of southern California during periods of germination. The percentage germination of seeds of eight species decreased when low salinity or high moisture lasted for 1 wk before changing to high salinity and low moisture for 3 wk.(varying conditions) compared to 4 wk of low salinity or high moisture (constant conditions). The seed germination speed of two species differed (both faster and slower) between the varying and constant treatments. Species responses to varying vs. constant conditions depended on the specific amplitude of temporary low salinity (0, 8, or 17 g/kg) in the varying treatments. Similarly, the duration (1, 2, or 4 wk) of low salinity or high moisture affected the percentage germination (four species) and germination speed (two species). Percentage germination (four species) and germination speed (eight species) also differed according to whether low salinity and high moisture were initiated in November, January, or March. The sensitivity of species seeds to temporally varying conditions could be explained by their germination traits and identity as native or exotic. Seeds of the six exotic species were less sensitive to varying conditions, germinated faster, and were more tolerant of high salinity and low moisture than seeds of the five native species. Varying conditions resulted in different patterns of germination than constant conditions, and environmental factors typically vary through time in the field. Thus, experimenters who are trying to understand or predict plant establishment should consider and simulate, as closely as possible, the variability in field conditions.

J	Desplanque, B; Hautekeete, N; Van Dijk, H				Desplanque, B; Hautekeete, N; Van Dijk, H			Transgenic weed beets: possible, probable, avoidable?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Weed beets pose a serious problem for sugar beet Beta vulgaris crops. Traditionally, the only efficient method of weed control has been manual removal, but the introduction of transgenic herbicide-tolerant sugar beets may provide an alternative solution because non-tolerant weed beets can be destroyed by herbicide. We evaluated the possibility that new, transgenic, weed beets may arise by gene flow between wild and crop plants. 2. In a study area in northern France, weed beets were present in variable densities in sugar beet fields of up to 80 weed beet plants m(-2) . Weed beets arise from a long-lived seed bank, with seeds germinating from depths of 5 cm or less. In addition, diploid F-1 crop-wild hybrids and triploid variety bolters (individuals with a low vernalization requirement) were present in low densities in virtually all sugar beet fields. We found gene flow to be possible between all forms, illustrated by both overlapping flowering periods in the field and successful controlled cross-pollinations. 3. The F-1 crop-wild hybrids result from pollination in the seed-production region by wild plants possessing the dominant bolting allele B for flowering without experiencing a period of cold. In the case of a transgene for herbicide tolerance incorporated into male-sterile seed-bearer plants, such hybrids will contain both the herbicide-tolerance and the bolting allele. Contamination of the fields by transgenic weed beets will be the result unless bolters are removed manually. The same will apply in the case of a cytoplasmically inherited transgene. 4. Incorporation of the transgene into the pollinator plants will prevent the immediate formation of transgenic weed beets. However, in sugar beet fields, variety bolters may successfully cross-pollinate with weed beets in neighbouring fields. The use of diploid pollinator plants instead of tetraploids will considerably enhance gene flow towards wild beets, and is not, therefore, an attractive option. 5. In conclusion, the appearance of transgenic weed beets is possible but can best be retarded if the transgene for herbicide tolerance is incorporated into the tetraploid pollinator breeding line.

We evaluated the effects of soil type, burial depth and collection date on the emergence patterns of two populations of O. acanthium , ESW and Quarry (Q). 2 From each of four separate collections made throughout 1996, five replicates of 200 cypselas each were placed on the surface or buried at depths of 3 or 15 cm in both sand and silt-loam soils (i.e. field conditions) and emergence was recorded biweekly between August 1996 and September 1999. 3 Emergence was intermittent over the 3 years, with a higher total percentage from silt loam (17%) than from sand (9%), and from 3 cm depth (18%) compared with the surface (8%). 4 After 3 years, all remaining viable, split (germinated but not emerged), decayed and unfilled cypselas were retrieved. Total germination over the 3 years (emerged plus split) was up to 77% at 3 cm in silt loam but always less than 10% at 15 cm in both soils for both populations. Although a higher percentage of cypselas germinated under controlled conditions when retrieved from loam compared with sand (89% vs. 66%), a significant number from all treatments did not germinate until scarified. 5 Cypselas that ripened under the warmest temperature (collection 3) had the highest emergence in the year of collection (1996), while more of those that ripened under cooler temperatures (collections 1 and 4) emerged in later years (1998 and 1999). Both initial and later emergence patterns for both populations varied greatly with collection date. This may be the first time that seedling emergence from the seed bank for different collections has been monitored over several years. 6 We compared waxes, lignins and soluble phenolics in the coats of cypselas retrieved from soil (early germinators) with those that germinated only after scarification. More surface wax was found in dormant cypselas. 7 Understanding these complex germination/emergence patterns may help develop control policies for O. acanthium .																	0022-0477					AUG	2002	90	4					672	683		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00708.x							WOS:000177368400009

Synchronous death of Sasa occurred in 1995. We established four types of sampling sites differing in forest canopy conditions (Closed or Gap) and Sasa status (Dead or Live). Gap-Dead sites had the highest light levels and the greatest fluctuation in soil temperatures. The death of Sasa alone facilitated the emergence (Acer japonicum, Fagus crenata, Fraxinus lanuginosa, and Tilia japonica) and survival (Acanthopanax sciadophylloides, F. crenata, F. lanuginosa, Kalopanax pictus, and Sorbus commixta) of species with a seedling bank strategy. Cercidiphyllum japonicum grew at all sites at a higher density than other species, but survived well only in Gap-Dead sites. This behaviour was associated with a seed rain strategy. The additive effects of Sasa death and canopy gap formation promoted seedling emergence of pioneer tree species (Betula maximowicziana, Lindera umbellata, and Magnolia obovata), probably through break of dormancy by the large temperature fluctuation. In addition, the scarcity of advance regeneration in canopy gaps due to Sasa cover facilitates the regeneration of pioneer species. The dominance and dieback cycle of Sasa contributes to species diversity in this forest.																	1100-9233					AUG	2002	13	4					565	574		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2002.tb02083.x							WOS:000178961700012						
J	Gurung, B; Gurung, P				Gurung, B; Gurung, P			Addressing food scarcity in marginalized mountain environments - A participatory seed management initiative with women and men in eastern Nepal	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Experiences with a participatory seed improvement initiative as a strategy for combating food deficits in a remote community in eastern Nepal are outlined. On the basis of participatory methods of problem assessment, food deficits were attributed to several factors, such as limited arable land, poor soils, and lack of access to improved seeds and other agricultural services arising partly from the lowland and gender biases of national planners. Additionally, an increase in the number of households headed by women and the greater agricultural burden placed on women as a result of male out-migration have contributed to the problem of food deficits. During times of scarcity, women's preferences for nutritional value and easy postharvest preparation are subsumed by the more immediate need for higher yields. Most of the crop varieties preferred by women are landraces; hence, it is proposed that these crop varieties become the focus of future crop improvement initiatives to sustain crop diversity while addressing the needs of women. A strategy to develop capacity among women and men engaged in farming through a local community development organization was devised in consultation with the community, on the basis of criteria for participation by innovators and in recognition of gender-differentiated knowledge and the respective roles of women and men. The outcomes of the initiative were the development of a seed bank and plans for more advanced technical training to enhance local breeding practices, with an awareness of the gendered aspects of crop selection.																	0276-4741					AUG	2002	22	3					240	247		10.1659/0276-4741(2002)022[0240:AFSIMM]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000178450100008						
J	Ehrlen, J; Lehtila, K				Ehrlen, J; Lehtila, K			How perennial are perennial plants?	OIKOS												Trade-offs involving life span are important in the molding of plant life histories. However, the empirical examination of such patterns has so far been limited by the fact that information on life span is mainly available in terms of discrete categories; annuals, semelparous perennials and iteroparous perennials. We used transition matrix models to project continuous estimates of conditional life spans from published information on size- or stage-structured demography for 71 perennial plant species. The projected life span ranged from 4.3 to 988.6 years and more than half of the species had a life span of more than 35 years. Woody plants had on average a projected life span more than four times as long as non-woody plants. Life spans were higher in forests than in open habitats and individuals of non-clonal species tended to have a longer life span than ramets of clonal species. Self-incompatible plants on average lived longer than self-compatible plants. There were no clear relations between life span and geographical region, dispersal syndrome, pollination mode, seed size or the presence of a seed bank. We conclude that accurate estimates of life span are central to understand how longevity is correlated to other traits within the group of perennial plants.

J	Goergen, E; Daehler, CC				Goergen, E; Daehler, CC			Factors affecting seedling recruitment in an invasive grass (Pennisetum setaceum) and a nativegrass (Heteropogon contortus) in the Hawaiian Islands	PLANT ECOLOGY												In the Hawaiian Islands, native Heteropogon contortus (pili grass) is being replaced by alien grasses, one of which is Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass). Both grasses depend on seeds for population growth. To help understand factors promoting the spread of the alien and decline of the native, we investigated the effects of physical disturbance, nutrient addition, and seed supplementation on seedling recruitment in experimental field plots. In the first year, our field site experienced an unusual drought, and seedling recruitment was greater for H. contortus than for P. setaceum under all treatments. Disturbance increased recruitment of H. contortus seedlings during some sampling periods. Recruitment was not significantly increased by seed additions for either species despite our finding of only 49 and 4 seeds m(-2) in the seed bank for H. contortus and P. setaceum, respectively. In the first year, most P. setaceum seedlings died between monthly surveys. We resurveyed our field plots in a second, wetter year and found the pattern was reversed: recruitment of P. setaceum seedlings was greater than H. contortus seedlings in most treatments. Greenhouse comparisons of seedling survival under three drought regimes (water every 5,7 and 10 days) revealed that H. contortus seedlings tolerate drought better than P. setaceum seedlings. Seedling recruitment for these species in the leeward Hawaiian Islands appears to be primarily dependent on water availability, with the alien having the advantage in wetter years. Once seedlings of the long-lived alien become established, the alien seems capable of maintaining its dominance over H. contortus, even during periods of drought.																	1385-0237					AUG	2002	161	2					147	156		10.1023/A:1020368719136							WOS:000178213100001						
J	Rees, M; Kelly, D; Bjornstad, ON				Rees, M; Kelly, D; Bjornstad, ON			Snow tussocks, chaos, and the evolution of mast seeding	AMERICAN NATURALIST												One hitherto intractable problem in studying mast seeding (synchronous intermittent heavy flowering by a population of perennial plants) is determining the relative roles of weather, plant reserves, and evolutionary selective pressures such as predator satiation. We parameterize a mechanistic resource-based model for mast seeding in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae) using a long-term individually structured data set. Each plant's energy reserves were reconstructed using annual inputs (growing degree days), outputs (flowering), and a novel regression technique. This allowed the estimation of the parameters that control internal plant resource dynamics, and thereby allowed different models for masting to be tested against each other. Models based only on plant size, season degree days, and/or climatic cues (warm January temperatures) fail to reproduce the pattern of autocovariation in individual flowering and the high levels of flowering synchrony seen in the field. This shows that resource-matching or simple cue-based models cannot account for this example of mast seeding. In contrast, the resource-based model pulsed by a simple climate cue accurately describes both individual-level and population-level aspects of the data. The fitted resource-based model, in the absence of environmental forcing, has chaotic (but often statistically periodic) dynamics. Environmental forcing synchronizes individual reproduction, and the models predict highly variable seed production in close agreement with the data. An evolutionary model shows that the chaotic internal resource dynamics, as predicted by the fitted model, is selectively advantageous provided that adult mortality is low and seeds survive for more than 1 yr, both of which are true for C. pallens. Highly variable masting and chaotic dynamics appear to be advantageous in this case because they reduce seed losses to specialist seed predators, while balancing the costs of missed reproductive events.

For the seedling study, one hundred and eight 5 m(2) circular plots were established systematically (at 20 m intervals) with a random start point. For the seed bank study, soil samples were taken from 0.25 m(2) plots adjacent to 50% of the seedling plots at two depths (0-2 and 2-4 cm) and were germinated in a germination house. The study was conducted after the end of the seed dispersal season for tree species in the area. There were 11,780 seedlings ha(-1) of 55 tree species growing under the woven canopy of C. odorata and 72% of the seedlings were economically valuable species. Tree seedlings as a whole were relatively uniformly distributed across the area but the distribution of individual species was very uneven. Some of the species were present only in 1% of the plots. Viable seeds of seven tree species were found in the soil seed bank with an average density of 46,000 seeds ha(-1). The spatial distribution of tree seeds was very uneven across the site and only 39% of the lots contained tree seeds. C odorata seeds in the soil seed bank were over 1600 times more abundant than tree seeds. No clear relationships were found between the density and species richness of tree seedlings or seeds and the distance (up to 260 m) from adjacent forest stands in the direction of prevailing wind during the seed dispersal season. The data suggest that the stock of tree seedlings represented an accumulation of seedlings established over several years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Gibson, DJ; Spyreas, G; Benedict, J				Gibson, DJ; Spyreas, G; Benedict, J			Life history of Microstegium vimineum (Poaceae), an invasive grass in southern Illinois	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												The ecological life history of Microstegium vimineum, an invasive grass, was compared among four populations throughout southern Illinois. A detailed investigation of seed production was conducted at one of these populations in a secondary oak-hickory forest in Dixon Springs State Park, Illinois. In this park, M. vimineum occurs as a central, main population with several disjunct subpopulations. Size of flowering and non-flowering individuals was determined as the plants set seed. Seed dispersal was assessed using seed traps. A severe late summer drought impacted the Dixon Springs population in 1999 and few plants flowered. Plants that did flower were significantly larger than those not flowering and were limited to one small area at the edge of the core population. At Dixon Springs, the germinable seed bank was estimated from soil samples collected in Fall 1999 before flowering, and in the subsequent spring. Seedlings emerged from soils placed in a greenhouse from samples collected in the spring. No seedlings emerged from samples collected in the fall. Germinable seed had a 10 times higher density in samples collected near the soil surface than from samples collected at 5-10 cm depth. Seed dispersal occurred within the main population only. Despite the lack of seed dispersal in 1999, seedlings emerged from six of seven subpopulations in spring 2000, with the highest densities where plants had flowered in 1999. These data indicate the presence of a persistent soil seed bank for M. vimineum. Even following summer drought and discounting spring seedling emergence, the size of the seed bank increased by similar to25% in 1999. Reestablishment of the Dixon Springs population following the 1999 drought was vigorous, but the location of the largest, most fecund plants in 2000 was not the same as in 1999. In 2000, end of season survivorship of M. vimineum among all populations was 40-50%, with 90% of surviving individuals flowering. Performance of M. vimineum varied significantly within and among populations and was related to soil texture and chemistry, and overhead canopy cover. The findings of our study reflect the invasive nature of this plant. A sufficiently large seed bank and a highly plastic morphological response to local microhabitat conditions likely ensures its persistence in invaded sites.																	0040-9618					JUL-SEP	2002	129	3					207	219		10.2307/3088771							WOS:000177771600004						
J	Marod, D; Kutintara, U; Tanaka, H; Nakashizuka, T				Marod, D; Kutintara, U; Tanaka, H; Nakashizuka, T			The effects of drought and fire on seed and seedling dynamics in a tropical seasonal forest in Thailand	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seed production and seedling dynamics were studied for 6 years (1992-1997) with particular emphasis on the effects of the drought and fire in a natural tropical seasonal forest at Mae Klong Watershed Research Station, Kantchanaburi, western Thailand. The number of seed produced and emerged seedlings varied greatly among years and species. Most tree species produced very few seeds in 1994 and many in 1995 and 1996, particularly, Shorea siamensis Miq. which displayed the most seeding habit. Some seedlings, Shorea, Dipterocarpus alatus Roxb., and Dipterocarpus turbinatus Gaertn. f., emerged at the end of the dry season (late April, after the first rain but when soils still have a low soil moisture content), while the majority of seedlings emerged at the beginning of the rainy season. After a fire disturbed the plot in April 1996, many species increased their seedling emergences, especially Berrya ammonilla. Seedlings of most species less than a year old showed a relatively low mortality in the rainy season, but those of Pterocarpus macrocarpus Kurz had high mortality. The mean survival rate for all seedling species in this forest was quite low (24.1% y(-1)), and different values existed for the rainy and the dry season (11.5, and 6.1% month(-1), respectively). This suggests that different species have adaptations related to the season of seedling emergence and resistance to drought in this tropical seasonal forest community. The traits of tree species are classified in terms of their traits in the early stages of regeneration; seed and/or seedling bank, resprouting, and drought resistance. Most species have adapted to fire and/or drought by resprouting, seed bank, and/or seedling bank, although the few species which occur mainly in mesic evergreen forests have less adapted to these environments. The demographic variations in seed and seedling stages may contribute to the coexistence of these species in this species-rich dry tropical forest.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				JUL	2002	161	1					41	57		10.1023/A:1020372401313							WOS:000178213000003						
J	Middleton, B				Middleton, B			Nonequilibrium dynamics of sedge meadows grazed by cattle in southern Wisconsin	PLANT ECOLOGY												Equilibrium theory predicts that after disturbance, ecosystems eventually regain the structural and functional properties characteristic of their predisturbance condition. This study tested this idea by examining the effects of cattle grazing and exclusion on the long-term structural characteristics of sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin. To compare structural changes in mean percentage cover and height, repeated measures analysis was conducted on two sedge meadows over a twenty year period from 1977 to 1997. One sedge meadow was recovering from cattle grazing (cattle excluded in 1973) and the other was a reference area (nearly undisturbed). Both of these study sites changed structurally from 1977 to 1997, supporting non-equilibrium theory. Additional observations were made in a heavily and lightly grazed sedge meadow that were surveyed in 1977. As based on the positions of subunits in an ordination graph produced using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS), the recovery sedge meadow became less structurally similar to the grazed and more similar to the reference site over the 20 year study. However, from the perspective of mean maximum height in another NMS analysis, the recovery sedge meadow became less similar to the reference site over time likely because by 1997, a shrub carr of Cornus sericea had developed in the recovery sedge meadow that had been dominated by graminoids and forbs in 1977 (mean maximum height: 1977 vs. 1997; 0 vs. 47 cm). Seedlings of Cornus sericea were invading the grazed sedge meadows and in the recovery sedge meadow (cattle excluded 4 years earlier) in 1977. A shrub carr did not develop in the reference sedge meadow. Changes in the reference site were relatively minor over this time interval; certain species either increased or decreased in dominance, e. g., Carex stricta increased in cover (1977 vs. 1997, 20 and 28 mean percentage (%) cover, respectively). A few short-term species of the recovery sedge meadow followed the tenets of equilibrium theory. These became less common or disappeared 4-9 years after cattle exclusion including Aster lanceolatus, Calamagrostis canadensis, Poa compressa, Solidago altissima and Verbena hastata. Some of these species were eaten and likely spread by the cattle. This study suggests that the progression of sedge meadow to shrub carr may not be an inevitable outcome of succession but instead can be a consequence of past cattle grazing history. Also, because the recovery and the reference sedge both changed structurally over time, the tenets of non-equilibrium theory were supported by this study.																	1385-0237					JUL	2002	161	1					89	110		10.1023/A:1020361021072							WOS:000178213000006						
J	Cardina, J; Herms, CP; Doohan, DJ				Cardina, J; Herms, CP; Doohan, DJ			Crop rotation and tillage system effects on weed seedbanks	WEED SCIENCE												We characterized the size and species composition of the weed seedbank after 35 yr of continuous crop rotation and tillage system treatments at two locations in Ohio. Spring seedbanks were monitored during 1997, 1998, and 1999 in continuous corn (CCC), corn-soybean (CS), and corn-oats-hay (COH) rotations in moldboard plow (MP), chisel plow (CP), and no-tillage (NT) plots where the same herbicide was used for a given crop each growing season. There were 47 species at Wooster and 45 species at Hoytville, with 37 species occurring at both location sin all 3 yr. Crop rotation was a more important determinant of seed density than was tillage system. Seed density was highest in NT and generally declined as tillage intensity increased. Seeds accumulated near the surface (0 to 5 cm) in NT but were uniformly distributed with depth in other tillage systems. At both locations there was a significant interaction between tillage and rotation for estimates of the total seed density. Seed density was highest in NT-CCC, with 26,850 seeds m 2 at Wooster and 8,680 seeds m(-2) at Hoytville. At Wooster total seed density in CCC plots was 45 and 60% lower than in COH plots for CP and MP. In NT the total seed density was 40% greater in CCC than in COH. At Hoytville total seed density in CCC plots was 72% lower than in COH plots that were CP or NIP, whereas seed density was 45% higher in CCC than in COH plots that were in an NT system. There were more significant differences in seedbank density for any given species for crop rotation than for tillage treatments. Seed densities of three broadleaves (shepherd's-purse, Pennsylvania smartweed, and corn speedwell) at Wooster and four broadleaves (yellow woodsorrel, redroot pigweed, Pennsylvania smartweed, and spotted spurge) at Hoywille were more abundant in COH (140 to 630 seeds m(-2)) than in CS (10 to 276 seeds m(-2)) or CCC (<1 to 60 seeds m(-2)), regardless of the tillage system. At both locations Pennsylvania smartweed seeds were more abundant in COH (260 and 630 seeds m(-2)) than in other rotations (10 to 20 seeds m(-2)). Relative importance (RI) values, based on relative density and relative frequency of each species, were lower in CS than in CCC for common lambsquarters and five other weeds at Wooster; RI of giant foxtail was 80% lower in COH than in CCC at Hoytville. The data show-how species composition and abundance change in response to crop and soil management. The results can help to determine how complex plant communities arc "assembled" from a pool of species by specific constraints or filters.																	0043-1745					JUL-AUG	2002	50	4					448	460		10.1614/0043-1745(2002)050[0448:CRATSE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000177077100005						
J	Spencer, DF; Ksander, GG				Spencer, DF; Ksander, GG			Sedimentation disrupts natural regeneration of Zannichellia palustris in Fall River, California	AQUATIC BOTANY												Aquatic plants growing in flowing waters frequently inhabit dynamic substrates, subject to erosion or sediment deposition. Rooted macrophytes have disappeared from the upper portions of Fall River, CA where from 0.6 to 1.2 m of sandy sediments have accumulated. We assessed the abundance of Zannichellia palustris L. seeds in the seed bank, and performed experiments to determine the effect of sediment accumulation on germination and emergence of Z palustris seedlings. In 1996 and 1997, sediment cores were collected from the upper 15 km of Fall River. Cores were placed in a greenhouse and germination monitored for the next 30-40 days. Viable germinating Z palustris seeds were present in 67% of the cores collected in 1996. Z palustris seed density was 1219 seeds m(-2) on average and ranged from 0 to 5920 seeds m-2. Seed abundance did not differ between the upper (<11 cm) and lower portions (>11 cm) of cores collected in 1996 or 1997. We conducted four experiments in which Z palustris seeds and natural sediments containing Z palustris seeds were buried at various depths under sand. Burial by more than 2 cm of sand inhibited germination and emergence. The implication is that significant sediment accumulation may disrupt natural annual regeneration of Z palustris from seeds, although a viable seed bank is maintained for several years.

J	Fensham, RJ; Fairfax, RJ; Holman, JE				Fensham, RJ; Fairfax, RJ; Holman, JE			Response of a rare herb (Trioncinia retroflexa) from semi-arid tropical grassland to occasional fire and grazing	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Trioncinia retroflexa (Asteraceae) is a rare perennial herb endemic to Dichanthium -dominated grasslands on basaltic soils in central Queensland. Trioncinia lives for approximately 5 years and some seed remains viable in the soil for at least 18 months. Population densities increased sixfold over 4 years, coinciding with recovery during a period of above-average rainfall after a 4-year drought preceding this study. The species' lifespan, which can exceed 5 years, coupled with its extended seed-bank viability ensures that populations can endure drought despite low levels of seedling recruitment. The restricted occurrence of the species to spasmodically grazed stock routes provides evidence that Trioncinia is sensitive to the continuous grazing that typically occurs in paddocks. The hypothesis that the species requires occasional disturbance for survival was experimentally tested. Recruitment was depressed with burning and inflorescence production enhanced with both burning and simulated intense spasmodic grazing after the first application of treatments. However, these effects were not evident after a second application of the treatments and there were no significant effects of treatment on population densities at the completion of the 4-year experiment. Although not requisite, sporadic dry-season grazing and burning of these areas would appear to be compatible with the survival of Trioncinia. This project highlights the value of stock routes for rare plant conservation.

J	Villagra, PE; Marone, L; Cony, MA				Villagra, PE; Marone, L; Cony, MA			Mechanisms affecting the fate of Prosopis flexuosa (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) seeds during early secondary dispersal in the Monte Desert, Argentina	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The fate of seeds during secondary dispersal is largely unknown for most species in most ecosystems. This paper deals with sources of seed output of Prosopis flexuosa D.C. (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) from the surface soil seed-bank. Prosopis flexuosa is the main tree species in the central Monte Desert, Argentina. In spite of occasional high fruit production, P. flexuosa seeds are not usually found in the soil, suggesting that this species does not form a persistent soil seed-bank. The magnitude of removal by animals and germination of P. flexuosa seeds was experimentally analysed during the first stage of secondary dispersal (early autumn). The proportion of seeds removed by granivores was assessed by offering different types of diaspores: free seeds, seeds inside intact endocarps, pod segments consisting of 2-3 seeds, and seeds from faeces of one herbivorous hystricognath rodent, the mara (Dolichotis patagonum ). The proportion of seeds lost through germination was measured for seeds inside intact endocarps, seeds inside artificially broken endocarps, and free seeds. Removal by ants and mammals is the main factor limiting the formation of a persistent soil seed-bank of P. flexuosa : >90% of the offered seeds were removed within 24 h of exposure to granivores in three of four treatments. Seeds from the faeces of maras, on the other hand, were less vulnerable to granivory than were other types of diaspores. These results suggest that herbivory might be an indirect mechanism promoting seed longevity in the soil (and likely germination) by discouraging granivore attack. On the other hand, germination did not seem to have an important postdispersal impact on the persistence of P. flexuosa seeds in the soil. Both direct and indirect interactions between vertebrate herbivores and plants may foster P. flexuosa 's seed germination in some South American arid zones.																	1442-9985					JUN	2002	27	4					416	421		10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01195.x							WOS:000176633100007						
J	Facelli, JM; Temby, AM				Facelli, JM; Temby, AM			Multiple effects of shrubs on annual plant communities in arid lands of South Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The presence of shrubs in arid lands creates spatial heterogeneity that affects the distribution and performance of annual plants; several possible mechanisms have been implicated. A preliminary survey in a chenopod shrubland in South Australia showed differences in the distribution of annual plants under canopies of Atriplex vesicaria and Maireana sedifolia (the two dominant shrub species) and open spaces. A series of experiments were conducted to test the potential contribution to these patterns of nutrient enrichment under shrubs, differential seed accumulation, stress reduction by the canopy, competition by shrub roots, and protection against grazing. The germinable soil seed-bank under A. vesicaria and M. sedifolia was different from that in open spaces, but these differences can only explain a fraction of the differences observed in the growing annual plant community in different microsites. The soil under A. vesicaria had higher total nitrogen content than soil in open spaces, whereas soil under M. sedifolia had lower available phosphorus than open spaces. Although annual plant densities under A. vesicaria were higher than in open spaces, experimental removal of shrubs increased their density, suggesting that shrub canopies inhibit annual plants in this system. Surprisingly, trenching of open areas close to shrubs (severing lateral shrub roots) decreased annual plant density. We suggest that water moves laterally through shrub roots, in a process akin to a hydraulic lift, increasing water availability for the annual plants. Exclusion of vertebrate grazers had a stronger effect on annual plant biomass in open spaces than under M. sedifolia , suggesting that this shrub provides shelter against herbivory. Overall our results show that shrubs can have simultaneously facilitative and inhibitory effects on the annual plant community through different mechanisms, but more importantly that different shrub species have different effects. This is a potential mechanism allowing for species coexistence of annual plants.

J	Oswald, A; Ransom, JK; Kroschel, J; Sauerborn, J				Oswald, A; Ransom, JK; Kroschel, J; Sauerborn, J			Intercropping controls Striga in maize based farming systems	CROP PROTECTION												Intercropping maize was evaluated as a means to reduce Striga emergence and survival and improve overall farm productivity. Field experiments were conducted at two sites in western Kenya from 1996 to 1999 to study the effect of eight different intercrops on Striga populations and crop yield. Factors studied included relay or simultaneous planting of maize or intercrops, ridge and flat planting systems and in-row or between-row planting of intercrops. Mode of planting maize and intercrops (ridge/flat or in/between row planting) did not affect maize grain yield. However, ridge planting improved intercrop yields and reduced Striga densities. Peanut, bean, yellow gram, bambara nut and soybean intercrops produced considerable yields and increased the overall productivity of the cropping systems. The increase in output of farm produce ranged between 40% and 120% depending on the local agro-ecological conditions. Of the most productive intercrops, yellow gram provided the most stable Striga control over years and locations comparable only to cowpea. Peanut, bambara nut, bean and soybean were more variable in terms of Striga suppression in maize depending on the specific agro-ecological conditions. Shading, higher humidity and lower temperatures under the intercrop canopies were most likely the mechanisms which caused the decline of Striga numbers in intercropping systems. Intercropping can be an effective component of an integrated Striga control program compatible with the limited resources of small-scale subsistence farmers. In the long term, however, Striga populations can only diminish if intercropping is combined with handweeding of mature Striga plants to avoid the replenishment of the Striga seed bank in the soil.

J	Fernandez, RJ; Golluscio, RA; Bisigato, AJ; Soriano, A				Fernandez, RJ; Golluscio, RA; Bisigato, AJ; Soriano, A			Gap colonization in the Patagonian semidesert: seed bank and diaspore morphology	ECOGRAPHY												We report on a cold, windy South American steppe dominated by tussock grasses and shrubs of small stature that, together, cover only half of the soil surface. Our objective was to find out why seedlings and juveniles of these dominant species are generally absent from the bare or poorly-populated spots (gaps) that exist between established individuals. We hypothesized that matrix-forming species fail to colonize gaps because of their morphology are blown away from gaps that otherwise would constitute safe sites for recruitment. We evaluated diaspore size and wing loading (weight:area ratio) for all common species in the community, collected seed-bank samples in different occasions and microsites, and performed detailed field observations for one gap-dwelling species during several years. We found that: 1) Seeds of the dominant matrix-forming species are uncommon in the soil bank of the center of the gaps between established vegetation. 2) Seeds of the dominant species are more abundant towards the edges of the gaps than at their center. 3) Diaspores of those species present in the seed bank of the gaps are smaller than diaspores of absent species: contrary to expectations, not all gap-dwelling species had larger diaspore wing loading than non-gap species. 4) Seeds and adult densities of the most common gap species (the annual Camissonia dentata), were correlated between them and across subsequent years. We conclude that it is not an overall shortage of seeds that precludes the dominant species from becoming established in the gaps, but rather the seeds' uneven spatial distribution. We further argue that gaps would be suitable sites for recruitment, but large diaspore size makes seeds of the dominant species to be blown away by the strong westerly winds.

J	Bakker, JP; Esselink, P; Dijkema, KS; van Duin, WE; de Jong, DJ				Bakker, JP; Esselink, P; Dijkema, KS; van Duin, WE; de Jong, DJ			Restoration of salt marshes in the Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The conquest of land from the sea has been a long tradition in the Netherlands. When salt marshes were high enough, they were embanked when it was economically feasible, and transformed into intensively exploited agricultural land. This resulted in the transformation of halophytic communities to glycophytic communities. Often as an alternative, a low levee, a summerdike was built, which greatly reduced the flooding frequency of the landward summerpolder, hence creating a sedimentation deficit therein. Such summerpolders now cover 1200 ha in the Netherlands, 2100 ha in NW-Germany and small areas in England. Due to continuous embankments, the present salt-marsh area is relatively small with respect to the tidal basins. Discussions have been started how to increase the salt-marsh area. Two options will be discussed, firstly de-embankment of summerpolders and maintenance of the protective seawall, secondly increase of the effects of saline seepage behind the seawall by top soil removal. Both options include the restoration of salt-marsh communities (target communities) in intensively agriculturally exploited sites that have been salt marshes before. From the few examples abroad and experiments it is discussed (1) to which extent the sedimentation deficit in summerpolders could be compensated for, (2) if the soil seed bank is likely to contribute to re-establishment of salt-marsh communities, (3) if the dispersal of propagules of halophytic plants will be possible by hydrochory when the summerdike is breached, (4) to what extent is dispersal by endozoochory through waterfowl important in case re-establishment in a saline seepage area behind the seawall without open connection to the sea is envisaged. Two case studies of de-embanked summerpolders in the Netherlands revealed that the sedimentation deficit can be counteracted by rapid sedimentation, provided enough transport is possible from the foreshore. Dispersal by incoming tidal water from the nearby salt-marsh source area into the target area is possible for many salt-marsh plant species. The rate of success seems to depend on the relative position of source area and target area. A case study in a saline seepage area after top soil removal in the Netherlands, showed that the number of viable seeds dispersed by droppings from waterfowl is limited. Hence the possibilities for restoration of inland halophytic plant communities seem much lower than after de-embankment of summerpolders.																	0018-8158					JUN	2002	478	1-3					29	51		10.1023/A:1021066311728							WOS:000179168500003						
J	Grootjans, AP; Bakker, JP; Jansen, AJM; Kemmers, RH				Grootjans, AP; Bakker, JP; Jansen, AJM; Kemmers, RH			Restoration of brook valley meadows in the Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Until recently, restoration measures in Dutch brook valley meadows consisted of re-introducing traditional management techniques, such as mowing without fertilisation and low-intensity grazing. In the Netherlands, additional measures, such as rewetting and sod cutting, are now carried out on a large scale to combat negative influences of drainage and acidifying influences by atmospheric deposition. An analysis of successful and unsuccessful projects shows that restoration of brook valley meadows is most successful if traditional management techniques are applied in recently abandoned fields that had not been drained or fertilised. Large-scale topsoil removal in former agricultural fields that had been used intensively for several decades is often unsuccessful since seed banks are depleted, while hydrological conditions and seed dispersal mechanisms are sub-optimal. In areas with an organic topsoil, long-term drainage had often led to irreversible changes in chemical and physical properties of the soil. Successful sites were all characterised by a regular discharge of calcareous groundwater provided by local or regional hydrological systems, and, where not very long ago, populations of target species existed. On mineral soils, in particular, sod removal in established nature reserves was a successful measure to increase the number of endangered fen meadow species. It is argued that attempts to restore species-rich meadows should be avoided on former agricultural fields, where pedological processes have led to almost irreversible changes in the soil profile and where soil seed banks have been completely depleted. From a soil conservation point of view, such areas should be exploited as eutrophic wetlands that are regularly flooded.

J	Grootjans, AP; Geelen, HWT; Jansen, AJM; Lammerts, EJ				Grootjans, AP; Geelen, HWT; Jansen, AJM; Lammerts, EJ			Restoration of coastal dune slacks in the Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In order to stop the continuous decline of typical dune slack communities along the Dutch coast, restoration projects have been carried out since 1952. Restoration measures consisted of re-introducing traditional management techniques in dune slacks, such as mowing, grazing and sod removal, or constructing artificial dune slacks to compensate for lost biodiversity elsewhere. An analysis of successful and unsuccessful projects showed that constructing new dune slacks was not very successful for maintaining new populations of endangered dune slack species, since such projects were often carried out in areas where seed banks were depleted, while hydrological conditions and seed dispersal mechanisms were sub-optimal. The construction of sand dikes to prevent sea intrusion in large beach plains was, unintentionally, a temporary success for the establishment of many Red List species, although such measures often disrupted natural dune slack formation. Successful sites were all characterised by a regular discharge of calcareous groundwater provided by local or regional hydrological systems, where not very long ago populations of typical dune slack plants were present. Under such conditions, sod removal was a successful measure to create pioneer stages which were relatively stable, due to a very slow accumulation of organic matter in the topsoil. It is argued that new and more flexible coastal defence strategies can provide new opportunities for natural and relatively stable pioneer stages of dune slack formation, suitable for the long term preservation of endangered dune slack species.

J	Nienhuis, PH; Bakker, JP; Grootjans, AP; Gulati, RD; de Jonge, VN				Nienhuis, PH; Bakker, JP; Grootjans, AP; Gulati, RD; de Jonge, VN			The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Netherlands are a small, low-lying delta in W. Europe (42 000 km 2;50degrees-54degrees N; 3degrees-8degrees E), mainly consisting of alluvial deposits from the North Sea and from the large rivers Rhine and Meuse. The country was 'created by man'. The conversion of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems into drained agricultural land was a major cultural operation over the past 1000 years. Roughly 55% of the country's surface area is still agricultural land. Some decades ago, The Netherlands' landscape was characterised by an armoured coastline and bridled estuaries, a drastically reduced area of saline and freshwater marshes, fully regulated rivers and streams, and numerous artificial lakes. The aquatic ecosystems beyond the influence of the large rivers, the Pleistocene raised bogs and moor lands, have almost been completely annihilated in the past. Acidification and eutrophication led to the deterioration of the remaining softwater lake vegetation. Last but not least, an artificial drainage system was constructed, leading to an unnatural water table all over the country, high in summer, low in winter. Only very recently, some 25 years ago, the tide has been turned and ecological rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed ecosystems are in full swing now, enhanced by the European Union policy to set aside agricultural land in the Netherlands in favour of the development of 'nature'. The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands is given. Starting from the conceptual basis of restoration ecology, the successes and failures of hundreds of restoration projects are given. Numerous successful projects are mentioned. In general, ecological restoration endeavours are greatly benefiting from progressive experience in the course of the years. Failures mainly occur by insufficient application of physical, chemical or ecological principles. The spontaneous colonisation by plants and animals, following habitat reconstruction, is preferred. But sometimes the re-introduction of keystone species (e.g. eelgrass; salmon; beaver) is necessary in case the potential habitats are isolated or fragmented, or when a seed bank is lacking, thus not allowing viable populations to develop. Re-introduction of traditional management techniques (e. g. mowing without fertilisation; low intensity grazing) is important to rehabilitate the semi-natural and cultural landscapes, so characteristic for the Netherlands. For aquatic ecosystems proper (estuaries, rivers, streams, larger lakes) the rule of thumb is that re-establishment of the abiotic habitat conditions is a pre-requisite for the return of the target species. This implies rehabilitation of former hydrological end geomorphological conditions, and an increase in spatial heterogeneity. The 'bottom-up' technique of lake restoration, viz. reduction in nutrient loadings, and removal of nutrient-rich organic sediment, is the preferred strategy. The 'top-down' approach of curing eutrophicated ecosystems, that is drastic reduction of fish stock, mainly bream, and introduction of carnivorous fish, may be considered as complementary. For semi-aquatic ecosystems (river-fed and rain-fed peat moors, brook valleys, coastal dune slacks) it also counts that the abiotic constraints should be lifted, but here the species-oriented conservation strategy, the enhancement of the recovery of characteristic plant and animal species, is mainly followed. An important pre-requisite for the rehabilitation of the original natural or semi-natural vegetation is the presence of viable seed bank. Restoration of salt-marsh vegetation has to deal with a short-lived persistent seed bank, which means that transport of seeds by water currents is important. Isolated softwater ecosystems may rely on the long-lived seeds of the aquatic macrophytes. The paper ends with some notes on the predictability of the outcome of ecological restoration measures and the societal position of restoration ecology as a science. Scientists hold different views on the predictability of restoration measures. A fact is that the predictability of ecosystem development increases, with increasing knowledge of the underlying environmental processes.

J	Hairston, NG; Kearns, CM				Hairston, NG; Kearns, CM			Temporal dispersal: Ecological and evolutionary aspects of zooplankton egg banks and the role of sediment mixing	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2001	CHICAGO, ILLINOIS	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Zooplankton egg banks are the accumulation of diapausing embryos of planktonic animals buried in the sediments of many aquatic ecosystems. These eggs, which are analogous life history stages to the seeds of many plants, can survive in a ready-to-hatch state for periods ranging from a few years to greater than a century. Their presence in ponds, lakes and near-shore marine environments has substantial implications for understanding trajectories of ecological and evolutionary change. When the sediments of lakes are structured in historical sequence, diapausing eggs extracted from different sediment ages can provide a means of studying past changes in community or population-genetic structure. A completely different aspect of egg banks derives from the fact that hatching of diapausing eggs can influence, through what can be thought of as temporal dispersal, population and community response to environmental change. Eggs hatching from diapause introduce to current environments species or genotypes laid at times in the distant past. In addition, egg banks create extended generation overlap that can play an important role in maintaining diversity in a fluctuating environment when different types (species or genotypes) are favored at different times. These distinct aspects of egg banks (Le., their direct impact on ecological and evolutionary processes versus their usefulness in reconstructing historical changes), are potentially in conflict because for old eggs to hatch, the sediments must be at least partially mixed. This same mixing, however, degrades the accuracy of the historical record. Both aspects are possible, however, even within a single lake when sediment-mixing intensity is spatially heterogeneous.																	1540-7063					JUN	2002	42	3					481	491		10.1093/icb/42.3.481							WOS:000179058900008	21708742

Fields left fallow after harvest (i.e. stubble fields) support high wintering densities of many species of granivorous bird. We examined correlates of use by eight such species of different types of intensively managed wheat and barley stubble fields, organic wheat fields and set-aside fields on mixed lowland farmland in central England. Field occupancy was studied in relation to the physical characteristics of fields and seed abundance. 2. Higher seed abundance was associated with greater occupancy by linnet Carduelis cannabina, grey partridge Perdix perdix, chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus and corn bunting Miliaria calandra. Larger areas of bare earth within stubble fields were associated with greater occupancy by linnet, yellowhammer, reed bunting and corn bunting, but lower occupancy by woodpigeon Columba palumbus. 3. On conventional intensively farmed sites, seed abundance and area of bare earth were significantly greater on barley stubbles than on wheat stubbles. 4. Seed numbers fell throughout the winter in all stubble types, although reductions were greatest on intensive barley stubbles, intermediate on intensive wheat stubble and lowest on undersown organic wheat stubbles. 5. Within fields occupied by linnets, areas used for feeding had significantly greater quantities of seeds known to be important in their diet. Feeding areas also had a greater area of bare earth than randomly selected 'non-feeding areas'. 6. Linnets and reed buntings were rarely found on fields where densities of weed seeds important in their diets fell below 250 seeds m(-2). In autumn, yellowhammers and grey partridges rarely fed on fields where cereal grain density was below 50 m(-2). However, in spring, both species fed on these fields irrespective of grain density, perhaps indicating a switch to other food sources. 7. We suggest that land managers wishing to maximize the value of overwinter stubble fields for granivorous birds locate such fields where there is a substantial natural regeneration of weed flora and where previous cropping (e.g. barley) is likely to offer a sparse stubble with substantial areas of bare ground.

J	Lortie, CJ; Turkington, R				Lortie, CJ; Turkington, R			The effect of initial seed density on the structure of a desert annual plant community	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Few experiments directly test the role of density dependence in natural plant communities. 2 We tested (i) whether different initial seed densities of the entire seed bank of an annual plant community affected performance (emergence, mean plant biomass and survival) and (ii) whether density-dependent processes were operating within the communities. We also tested whether life-stage, year and soil moisture (both on a topographic gradient and in an experimental manipulation) influenced the effects of seed density. 3 We considered two distinct phases: seed to emergent seedlings, and emergent seedlings to established plants. 4 The seed bank was collected from a semistabilized sand dune in the Negev Desert, Israel. This was added to sieved sand in plots at the same site at four different initial seed densities: 1/16x, 1/4x, 1x (natural seed density) and 2x. The experiment was repeated for three consecutive growing seasons. 5 Emergence of seedlings was significantly influenced by initial seed density in all 3 years, with higher initial seed densities having lower rates of emergence. 6 Mean final plant size was negatively density dependent and consistently unaffected by the initial seed density sown. 7 In general, there were no strong interactions of topographic position with initial seed density, processes within the vegetation were not density dependent and the experimental addition of water did not influence any of the performance measures tested. Density-dependent processes vary from year to year, while moisture effects do not. 8 We conclude that seedling emergence and some processes in the established plant community are density dependent, but the established plant community is also affected by other processes, such as resource limitation.				lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014	lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023												0022-0477					JUN	2002	90	3					435	445		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00686.x							WOS:000175666900002						
J	Dalling, JW; Hubbell, SP				Dalling, JW; Hubbell, SP			Seed size, growth rate and gap microsite conditions as determinants of recruitment success for pioneer species	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 We examined how seed size and seedling growth rate influence recruitment success of neotropical pioneer species. We investigated the soil seed bank, and followed seedlings from emergence and establishment to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. 2 To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in a factorial design. 3 Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots than in control plots. 4 We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to the end of the first dry season. 5 In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers. 6 We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence-establishment success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily, a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed differences in light requirements among pioneer species.																	0022-0477					JUN	2002	90	3					557	568		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00695.x							WOS:000175666900013						
J	Burnside, NG; Smith, RF; Waite, S				Burnside, NG; Smith, RF; Waite, S			Habitat suitability modelling for calcareous grassland restoration on the South Downs, United Kingdom	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The South Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, UK, is an internationally and nationally important landscape, which contains a significant proportion (28%) of the southeast of England's calcareous grassland resource. The traditional calcareous grassland habitats characteristic of the downland landscape have suffered significant losses since the Second World War, and the remaining sites are small, fragmented and confined to the more marginal areas, often steeper slopes. The re-creation and restoration of these species rich grasslands has become a central aim of national and regional conservation organisations, however, the methods and mechanism by which restoration sites could be identified has not been clarified. The purpose of this work was to study the landscape characteristics of the calcareous grassland systems, and by use of GIS-based modelling approaches identify those sites on the downland most suited to the re-establishment and expansion of calcareous grasslands. Using a weighted scoring approach, a GIS-based Habitat Suitability Model is developed for use as a tool to support strategic landscape evaluation and to provide a method of identifying sites for targeted restoration. The approach models the relationship between specific grassland communities and topographic variables, and is applied to the South Downs landscape in order to predict the nature of grassland communities likely to result from restoration efforts at specific sites.

J	England, PR; Usher, AV; Whelan, RJ; Ayre, DJ				England, PR; Usher, AV; Whelan, RJ; Ayre, DJ			Microsatellite diversity and genetic structure of fragmented populations of the rare, fire-dependent shrub Grevillea macleayana	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Recent habitat loss and fragmentation superimposed upon ancient patterns of population subdivision are likely to have produced low levels of neutral genetic diversity and marked genetic structure in many plant species. The genetic effects of habitat fragmentation may be most pronounced in species that form small populations, are fully self-compatible and have limited seed dispersal. However, long-lived seed banks, mobile pollinators and long adult lifespans may prevent or delay the accumulation of genetic effects. We studied a rare Australian shrub species, Grevillea macleayana (Proteaceae), that occurs in many small populations, is self-compatible and has restricted seed dispersal. However, it has a relatively long adult lifespan (c. 30 years), a long-lived seed bank that germinates after fire and is pollinated by birds that are numerous and highly mobile. These latter characteristics raise the possibility that populations in the past may have been effectively large and genetically homogeneous. Using six microsatellites, we found that G. macleayana may have relatively low within-population diversity (3.2-4.2 alleles/locus; He-exp = 0.420-0.530), significant population differentiation and moderate genetic structure (F-ST = 0.218) showing isolation by distance, consistent with historically low gene flow. The frequency distribution of allele sizes suggest that this geographical differentiation is being driven by mutation. We found a lack mutation-drift equilibrium in some populations that is indicative of population bottlenecks. Combined with evidence for large spatiotemporal variation of selfing rates, this suggests that fluctuating population sizes characterize the demography in this species, promoting genetic drift. We argue that natural patterns of pollen and seed dispersal, coupled with the patchy, fire-shaped distribution, may have restricted long-distance gene flow in the past.

J	Peterson, BJ; Rose, CD; Rutten, LM; Fourqurean, JW				Peterson, BJ; Rose, CD; Rutten, LM; Fourqurean, JW			Disturbance and recovery following catastrophic grazing: studies of a successional chronosequence in a seagrass bed	OIKOS												In August 1997, a large aggregation of the common sea urchin, Lytechinus variegatus, was discovered moving southward through a lush and productive seagrass monoculture of Syringodium filiforme in the Florida Keys, FL. Sea urchin densities at the grazing front were greater than 300 individuals m(-2) which resulted in the overgrazing of seagrasses and a complete denuding of all vegetation from this area. The steady rate of the grazing front migration permitted the estimation of the time since disturbance for any point behind this grazing front allowing the use of a chronosequence approach to investigate the processes early on in succession of these communities. In May 1999, six north-south parallel transects were established across the disturbed seagrass communities and into the undisturbed areas south of the grazing front. Based on the measured rates of the migration of the grazing front, we grouped 60 sites into five categories (disturbed, recently grazed, active grazing front, stressed and undisturbed). The large scale loss of seagrass biomass initiated community-wide cascading effects that significantly altered resource regimes and species diversity. The loss of the seagrass canopy and subsequent death and decay of the below-ground biomass resulted in a de-stabilization of the sediments. As the sediments were eroded into the water column, turbidity significantly increased, reducing light availability and significantly reducing the sediment nitrogen pool and depleting the seed bank. The portion of the chronosequence that has had the longest period of recovery now consists of a mixed community of seagrass and macroalgae, as remnant survivors and quick colonizers coexist and jointly take advantage of the open space.

J	Joy, DA; Young, DR				Joy, DA; Young, DR			Promotion of mid-successional seedling recruitment and establishment by Juniperus virginiana in a coastal environment	PLANT ECOLOGY												Positive interactions between Juniperus virginiana and woody seedlings may influence trends in primary succession along the Atlantic Coast of eastern North America. Woody species richness was greater beneath isolated J. virginiana trees than in more exposed, grass-covered dune sites on a Virginia, USA barrier island. Fleshy fruited seeds were more abundant in the seed bank beneath J. virginiana than in adjacent exposed sites, suggesting that J. virginiana may be utilized by passerine birds. Photosynthetically active radiation was reduced below J. virginiana, and soil temperature fluctuations were moderated during the growing season. In addition, moisture content, organic matter, and chlorides were higher for soils under J. virginiana than in exposed sites. For planted Prunus serotina and Sassafras albidum seedlings, mortality was lower beneath J. virginiana as compared with the exposed treatment; however, no S. albidum seedlings survived beyond mid-August. The effect of J. virginiana on the recruitment and distribution of mid-successional woody seedlings in coastal environments may be passive, through the non-random distribution of fleshy seeds by perching birds, or active, through increased seedling survival due to J. virginiana initiated alterations in microclimate and edaphic factors.																	1385-0237					JUN	2002	160	2					125	135		10.1023/A:1015812923216							WOS:000176226300001						
J	Mulligan, MK; Kirkman, LK				Mulligan, MK; Kirkman, LK			Burning influences on wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana) restoration plantings: Natural seedling recruitment and survival	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Regeneration and expansion of Aristida beyrichiana and Aristida stricta (wiregrass) populations in remaining fire-maintained Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) stands of the southeastern United States has become an objective of land managers. Although growing-season fire is required for successful wiregrass seed production, studies examining naturally occurring wiregrass seedling dynamics are few. This study investigates how seedling survivorship is affected by season of burn, seedling size, time since germination, and proximity to adult plants. Restoration at this research site was begun in 1992 with the planting of containerized longleaf pine and wiregrass seedlings. Study plots were established in November 1997 after a growing-season prescribed fire (June 1996) that resulted in successful seed production and seedling recruitment. Burn treatment plots included (1) no burn (control), (2) fire in the dormant season of the first year after germination (March 1998), (3) fire in the growing season of the first year after germination (August 1998), and (4) fire in the growing season of the second year after germination (July 1999). Seedling mortality increased with growing season burning and close proximity to planted adults. Natural seedling recruitment continued into the second year after initial seed-drop in all plots, which verifies that wiregrass seed banking occurs for a minimum of 2 years after seed drop. Where wiregrass management objectives include population expansion, seedling recruits should be allowed 1 to 2 years post-germination without growing season fire for successful establishment.																	1061-2971					JUN	2002	10	2					334	339		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.00041.x							WOS:000175832600018						
J	McCauley, RA; Ungar, IA				McCauley, RA; Ungar, IA			Demographic analysis of a disjunct population of Froelichia floridana in the mid-Ohio River Valley	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Froelichia floridana (cottonweed) occurs as a disjunct population along the Ohio River in southeastern Ohio. The anomalous occurrence of F. floridana in this area has led to its designation as a state endangered species and a management regime to maintain the habitat conditions in which it occurs. As part of this effort, a restoration site was established on public lands in 1984 from seed collected in areas threatened by development. This study seeks to determine the demographic characteristics of this species in the restored and non-restored managed sites to provide basic ecological information regarding life history parameters and to judge the effectiveness of the restoration. For two years (1997-1998) we collected information on seed bank abundance, field seed germination, plant survivorship, and seed production to create a stage-based transition matrix model. The model suggests that population growth and abundance as assayed by lambda (rate of increase) are stable to declining and are similar between the restoration and natural sites. A reduction in competition had a positive effect on population growth. Elasticity analysis showed that plants germinating earlier in the spring and becoming established as an early cohort contributed a greater level of reproductive output than plants germinating in late spring. Lowered population growth for 1997 is attributed to a cooler and dryer than average early spring that delayed germination and subsequent seed production. Elasticity analysis also suggested that the presence of a persistent seed bank was crucial for long-term population maintenance and may allow for recovery in areas of low aboveground abundance through soil manipulation.																	1061-2971					JUN	2002	10	2					348	361		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.02021.x							WOS:000175832600020						
J	Marquez, S; Funes, G; Cabido, M; Pucheta, E				Marquez, S; Funes, G; Cabido, M; Pucheta, E			Grazing effects on the germinable seed bank and standing vegetation in mountain grasslands from central Argentina	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												We studied the effect of grazing on the standing vegetation and the germinable soil seed bank in natural mountain grasslands at Pampa de Achala, Cordoba Province, Argentine. We analyzed the germinable seed bank at two depths (0-5 and 5-10 cm) in five replicates from sites grazed at a moderate to intense grazing intensity, and in five replicates from sites excluded from herbivores during the last 10 years. We recorded species frequency on the standing vegetation and species abundance in the germinable seed bank. Grazing did not produce significant changes in the number of species of the standing vegetation, but produced an increase in species diversity due to a decrease in the dominance of perennial grasses such as Deyeuxia hieronymi and Festuca tucumanica. We registered only three alien species in the grasslands under study. Grazing did not produce significant changes in the seed bank richness and diversity. Average seed bank density significantly did not change after grazing, however, the density of the annual grass Muhlenbergia peruviana increased, while that of the tussock grass Deyeuxia hieronymi decreased in grazed plots. Seeds present in litter at the excluded sites comprised 20 % of the total number of species and 43 % of the total seed density. Ordination analysis, taking into account floristic composition of standing vegetation and the germinable seed bank, showed higher segregation between grazed-ungrazed samples than samples from vegetation and from the seed bank. At both grazed and protected sites, there were dominance of species with transient seed banks, followed by species with short and long persistent seed banks, respectively. Grazing, or its absence, did not modify plant species abundance of most species at the germinable seed bank, moreover, the two species that changed their seed density showed two opposite plant strategies, as observed previously: one dominates primary productivity in absence of grazing. the another could play an important role in pp restoration at a micro patch scale in heavy grazed sites.																	0716-078X					JUN	2002	75	2					327	337									WOS:000176358500006						
J	Baltzer, JL; Hewlin, HL; Reekie, EG; Taylor, PD; Boates, JS				Baltzer, JL; Hewlin, HL; Reekie, EG; Taylor, PD; Boates, JS			The impact of flower harvesting on seedling recruitment in sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum, Plumbaginaceae)	RHODORA												Flowers of Limonium carolinianum are harvested for use in dried flower arrangements and various crafts. The increasing commercialization of this harvest has led to concerns regarding its sustainability. We quantified the extent of the harvest on four marshes on the Bay of Fundy coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Over a four-year period from 1996 to 1999, flower stalk removal averaged 32% on easily accessible portions of these marshes (i.e., within 100 m of a road) compared to 5% on inaccessible portions (greater than 500 m from a road). In 5 x 5 m plots where flowers were experimentally removed, no seedlings emerged the following year, whereas seedlings always emerged in unpicked control plots. This rapid and dramatic impact of localized harvesting on seedling emergence is due to the limited dispersal and short life span of L. carolinianum seeds. Sampling in concentric circles around isolated adults revealed that 50% of seedlings emerged within 34 cm of the parent and 90% emerged within 61 cm. Tethered seed experiments revealed that seeds that did not germinate in the first spring after production did not survive to the next spring. Our results suggest that unregulated harvesting has the potential to dramatically impact recruitment into local populations. To reduce the likelihood of local extinction we recommend that harvesters do not reduce flower stalk densities below 1 per m(2).																	0035-4902					SUM	2002	104	919					280	295									WOS:000178896800004						
J	Combroux, ICS; Bornette, G; Amoros, C				Combroux, ICS; Bornette, G; Amoros, C			Plant regenerative strategies after a major disturbance: The case of a riverine wetland restoration	WETLANDS												In aquatic habitats, both vegetative and sexual reproduction are involved in vegetation maintenance. Restoration projects carried out in such habitats rarely consider the role of both sexual reproduction (seeds) and vegetative (vegetative propagules or clonal fragments) components of propagule banks in vegetation regeneration. Moreover, changes in the seed bank due to the restoration itself have rarely been studied. The aim of this paper is to answer the following questions. Does restoration consisting of sediment removal in a cut-off meander lead to a change in the propagule bank (both sexual and vegetative propagules), and does the vegetation regeneration involve vegetative propagules created by plant breakage during the disturbance? Vegetation was visually surveyed three times during a 15-year period before the restoration and two years afterwards in both the restored zone and an upstream undisturbed zone, The propagule bank was characterized just before and one year after the restoration in the restored zone by sampling of sediment cores and propagule germination in a greenhouse. The impact of restoration on the propagule bank was very pronounced. Sprouting propagules were three times more abundant in post-restoration samples than in pre-restoration samples. The ratio of seeds / vegetative propagules in the bank was lower in the year following restoration. Links between propagule bank and established vegetation were assessed through calculation of correlation and similarity indices. We observed a large difference between established vegetation and the propagule bank before restoration, suggesting that recruitment from the propagule bank was low before restoration. Restoration enhanced the recruitment from rhizomes and vegetative fragments, which were highly correlated with the established vegetation. The pre-eminent role of some vegetative propagules in the recolonization and the increasing abundance of an invasive species are related to the season (June) in which restoration was carried out. Impact of restoration on both the propagule bank composition and environmental conditions (especially those promoting or inhibiting germination or sprouting) thus has to be considered in further vegetation management work.

Inter-specific competition effects on P. halepensis were experimentally analysed by a shrub thinning-out treatment carried out 1 year after fire. The extension of the recorded period confirmed (i) a significant increase in height, and (ii) the lack of variation in density of P. halepensis saplings when the shrub layer was removed. In contrast, the increase in relative growth rate in height (RGRh) and the decrease in mortality recorded during early post-fire stages for treated units did not persist in subsequent years. These two treatment-induced effects disappeared 1 year after the shrub clearing (29 months after fire). It is hypothesised that this time should represent a culminating point in the inter-specific competition established between Cistus and Pinus saplings simultaneously colonising recently disturbed areas and be a critical period for pine sapling survival. After this time, a reduction in relatively short-lived Cistus populations and an increase in R halepensis abundance should be expected in the community. It is concluded that a shrub-clearing treatment could be recommendable if the initial post-fire pine sapling density is not high enough to successfully face the early critical competitive period. Consequences of early shrub competition on forest productivity during mature phases are also discussed. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

The importance of driftline material in seed dispersal and the relationship with succession is also investigated. The results indicate that the majority of species have a transient or short-term seed persistent bank. Seeds of most species are able to float over the salt marsh and become concentrated in the driftline higher up the marsh. After plants have established a seed bank, forms, which disappears when vegetation is replaced by later-successional species. Exceptions are Spergularia maritima,which is still present in the seed bank of late successional stages. and Juncus gerardi and Glaax maritima, which appear in the seed bank of early successional stages, but are absent in the vegetation. Based on the results of this study constraints and possibilities for salt-marsh restoration by de-embankment are discussed.																	1402-2001					MAY	2002	5	1					55	62		10.1658/1402-2001(2002)005[0055:SSBADC]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000176407800006						
J	Mitlacher, K; Poschlod, P; Rosen, E; Bakker, JP				Mitlacher, K; Poschlod, P; Rosen, E; Bakker, JP			Restoration of wooded meadows - a comparative analysis along a chronosequence on Oland (Sweden)	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Wooded meadows on the Baltic Island of Oland result from traditional agricultural management over centuries, which has led to a species-rich vegetation with high species diversity. Today. nearly all of these meadows have been abandoned and became rapidly overgrown by deciduous shrub and tree species forming a closed canopy which resulted in a rapid and strong decrease in species numbers of the herb layer. Recent efforts aim to restore overgrown wooded meadows by cutting single shrubs and trees to open the canopy. However, the effects of abandonment as well as of any restoration management in wooded meadows have rarely been documented until now. Mechanisms driving succession after restoration such as the dispersal potential of the respective species over time and space have not been analysed yet. Therefore, a chronosequence was studied which included a traditionally managed wooded meadow, an overgrown meadow which has been abandoned for more that) 100 yr and a meadow which was restored 36 yr ago by cutting and is now grazed. We analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep, After abandonment 87% of the typical grassland species vanished from the established vegetation and were replaced by species characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m(2)) to 18 species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed bank type while only 1/3 could be classified as having a short-term persistent seed bank. Thus. restoration of wooded meadows cannot rely on the soil seed bank. Endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep was shown for 15% of the species with seed densities per 100 g air dried dung of 737 and 767. respectively. Movement of animals between ancient and restored wooded meadows is recommended since many of the species only occurred in low densities and therefore, will probably not be found in the dung samples.

We present results from the First 5 yr of a long-term experiment studying vegetation change under more extensive grazing management at three sites. One treatment was representative of current, intensive management and 5 were unfertilized with different intensities of seasonal grazing. The species composition of unfertilized, ungrazed swards changed dramatically within 2 yr and the sown species had virtually disappeared by year 5. Ranunculus repens, Poa trivialis. Agrostis gigantea, Juncus spp. and Carex spp. became dominant at the wettest site. Grasses were dominant at the other sites. In contrast, the sown species were retained in the unfertilized. grazed treatments there were small shifts in abundance of the species present initially and few additions or losses of species. Some colonizing species were present in the seed bank whereas others with a transient seed batik appeared to have invaded front neighbouring vegetation. Implications of these results for compensation schemes to reduce animal output and increase biodiversity are discussed.

Most of these communities have disappeared under intensified farming i.e. application of fertilizers, We studied the possibilities of restoration i.e. re-establishment of the former plant community by adopting various cutting regimes after the cessation of fertilization in 1972. The various cutting regimes revealed different effects after 25 yr. Regimes with cutting every Second year with or without removal of the swath, and complete abandonment deviated from the other regimes that included annual haymaking with different frequency and timing. The latter group of cutting regimes came closer to the community of an adjacent field where fertilization stopped in 1967. This Field in turn harboured several Nardo-Galion species after 25 yr of annual cutting. and showed more resemblance with a local reference community (at a distance of 500 m) that had not been fertilized since the 1940s. The local reference still does not match poorly developed Nardo-Galion saxatilis communities found in the region of ca. 50 km around the Study area. and is far from well developed Nardo-Galion communities in the same region. The study site still harbours several species characteristic of eutrophic soil and few species characteristic of oligotrophic soil after 25 yr of annual cutting and removal of the swath. The soil seed bank harbours only few target species. Although species characteristic of oligotrophic soil are present in an adjacent field and Nardo-Galion saxatilis species occur at 500 m, they have not (yet) established in the tat-get area.																	1402-2001					MAY	2002	5	1					107	120		10.1658/1402-2001(2002)005[0107:EOLTCI]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000176407800011

To determine the maximum survival time of buried resting stages, samples from sediment depths down to 50 cm were incubated at temperatures of 3, 10 and 18 degreesC. Sediment cores were dated by Pb-210 and the age of samples containing viable resting stages was determined using the constant rate of supply model. Dilution cultures of surface sediments allowed semiquantitative estimates of the potential seed bank. Dinoflagellate cysts from species such as Diplopsalis sp.. Gymnodinium nolleri, Oblea rotunda and Protoceratium reticulatum were viable clown to 15 cm depth, or 37 years old. Spores and resting cells of the diatoms Chaetoceros spp., Detonzda confervacea and Skeletonema costatum were viable to over 40 cm depth. and may have been buried for Man. decades. The seed bank of living resting stages in surficial sediments was found to be rich (c. 57000 diatom resting stages g(-1) wet weight and c. 200 dinoflagellate cysts g(-1) wet weight), and the percentage of viable resting stages was higher for spore- and cyst-forming species. The oxygen-deficient sediments in Koljo Fjord appear to be a natural conservator of cell viability, a condition not easily simulated in laboratory studies. These results are ecologically important since spores and cysts are a repository of genetic material able to repopulate waters if resuspended and exposed to suitable light, temperature and nutrients.

J	Nadkarni, NM; Solano, R				Nadkarni, NM; Solano, R			Potential effects of climate change on canopy communities in a tropical cloud forest: an experimental approach	OECOLOGIA												Global climate change models predict reduced cloud water in tropical montane forests. To test the effects of reduced cloud water on epiphytes, plants that are tightly coupled to atmospheric inputs, we transplanted epiphytes and their arboreal soil from upper cloud forest trees to trees at slightly lower elevations that are naturally exposed to less cloud water. Control plants moved between trees within the upper site showed no transplantation effects, but experimental plants at lower sites had significantly higher leaf mortality, lower leaf production, and reduced longevity. After the epiphytes died, seedlings of terrestrial gap-colonizing tree species grew from the seed banks within the residual mats of arboreal soil. Greenhouse experiments confirmed that the death of epiphytes can result in radical compositional changes of canopy communities. Thus, tropical montane epiphyte communities constitute both a potentially powerful tool for detecting climate changes and a rich arena to study plant/soil/seed interactions under natural and manipulated conditions. This study also provides experimental evidence that the potential effects of global climate change on canopy and terrestrial communities can be significant for cloud forest biota. Results suggest there will be negative effects on the productivity and longevity of particular epiphytes and a subsequent emergence of an emerging terrestrial component into the canopy community from a previously suppressed seed bank.																	0029-8549					MAY	2002	131	4					580	586		10.1007/s00442-002-0899-3							WOS:000176218000013	28547553

The first seed batik (1988) was 15,300 seed m(-2) and ranged from 14,000 to 21,000 seed m-2, which represented a high seed population for the area. Seed rain treatments of 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48% of the 1988 soil seed bank were returned each fill. By 1993, snore than 90% of the original millet seed bank had been depleted for all treatments. It was estimated that 77% of the seed rain and 68% of the spring seed bank were lost each year. As a result, wild-proso millet must produce approximately three times the seed in the soil to maintain a constant seed bank population.																	0043-1745					MAY-JUN	2002	50	3					340	343		10.1614/0043-1745(2002)050[0340:IOSSRO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000176184300010						
J	Meekins, JF; McCarthy, BC				Meekins, JF; McCarthy, BC			Effect of population density on the demography of an invasive plant (Alliaria petiolata, Brassicaceae) population in a southeastern Ohio forest	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												As interest ill invasive species management increases, new information with respect to invasive species abundance and distribution in invaded habitats is imperative. One essential type of information is demographic data. When invasive plants colonize a new habitat, their numbers may be low at first, but the population may undergo rapid expansion, We were interested in the effect of intraspecific density oil the population dynamics and life history attributes of Alliaria petiolata a Eurasian biennial herb that has become an invasive pest in portions of North America. Thirty plots were established in a mesic second-growth deciduous forest in high, medium and low density patches of A. petiolata rosettes. Demographic data were collected for all A. petiolata cohorts present in the plot! from 1996-1998. In June 1998 all fitst year rosette and second year mature individuals were harvested, dried and weighed. Stage-based population projection matrices were constructed in order to compare demography among plots and years, and models were used to predict trends in future population growth. There were significant differences among demographic parameters as a function of density and year. Survival to flowering in 19138 was greatest for plants in low density plots. These plants, were also larger and produced more fruits than plants in either medium or high density plots. Initial differences among plots in plant density diminished and by 1998 there was no significant difference among density treatment plots in number of flowering plants or number of seeds produced. Seed bank formation ensures that, even under less favorable circumstances, A. petiolata call remain at a site for a number of years. Lambda values indicated that the number of plants in plots of each density is increasing, with the greatest increase in low density plots (lambda = 1.45). As this study shows, due to abundant seed production, patches, of low A.. petiolata density in a newly colonized mesic forest can grow rapidly and in a few years form a dense stand.																	0003-0031					APR	2002	147	2					256	278		10.1674/0003-0031(2002)147[0256:EOPDOT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000175333700007						
J	Bastida, F; Talavera, S				Bastida, F; Talavera, S			Temporal and spatial patterns of seed dispersal in two Cistus species (Cistaceae)	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Cistus species are obligate seeding, early colonizers that follow disturbance, particularly fire, in Mediterranean ecosystems. We studied seed release, seed dispersal and soil seed populations in stands of Cistus ladanifer and C. libanotis. Seed release started in mid- to late summer (C. ladanifer) or in early autumn (C libanotis), and continued for a very extended period: 8-10 months in C. ladanifer, and for a mean of 16 months in C. libanotis. The xerochastic capsules of both species released seeds by successive dehiscence of the locules. All capsules begin to dehisee simultaneously at the start of the seed release period, but in C. libanotis capsule fragmentation replaced dehiscence early in the seed release period. In plants of both species, seed shadows were characterized by a peak of density beneath the plant canopy and a very short tail of much lower densities, indicating that seeds are concentrated beneath mother plants when dispersed. Nevertheless, in late May, at the onset of the fire season, soil seed densities beneath plant canopies were low compared with densities expected from seed shadows, but were apparently high enough to allow recovery of the stands if a disturbance, such as fire, had taken place. Seed-eating Bruchidae in summer and granivorous ants during the seed release period were apparently the main causes of seed losses. Results suggest that in both Cistus species, the staggered seed release could constitute an efficient risk-reducing trait. The plant pool of seeds existing throughout most of the year could be a relevant component of Cistus seed banks. (C) 2002 Annals of Botany Company.

J	Bonis, A; Grillas, P				Bonis, A; Grillas, P			Deposition, germination and spatio-temporal patterns of charophyte propagule banks: a review	AQUATIC BOTANY												Charophyte oospore banks have been studied in different habitat types, whereas only one detailed study of bulbil banks has been recorded from the literature. The density of oospore banks generally appears to be very high, dominating the propagule bank in many wetlands. Oospore banks are characterised by high spatial variability within and between the sites. Bulbils and oospores are not uniformly distributed with sediment depth, oospores being generally more numerous in the top few centimetres. Animal activities can mix the sediment, bury propagules and/or homogenise their distribution. Burial deeper than 2 cm limits oospore germination, but burial to a depth of 5 mm can improve their germination capacities. Oospore banks are highly variable between years. They are generally perennial, cumulating several generations of oospores, and buffering the risk of reproductive failure with time. The limited germination rates recorded for cospores from the bank could be related to this perennial strategy, whereas up to 100% of freshly harvested oospores may germinate. Germination rates and patterns and the conditions required for germination vary greatly from one study to another as a result of the large range of species and habitats investigated. Certain water birds consume charophytes and could be efficient dispersal agents for oospores. Various abiotic factors can affect the charophyte biomass and therefore the oospore production which then in turn could affect the propagule bank. The oospore bank density appears to influence charophyte abundance in the field, but above a threshold, its abundance is not related to the number of oospores in the soil. Below a threshold of density, cbarophytes may be unable to establish dense stands of vegetation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Strykstra, RJ; Bekker, RM; Van Andel, J				Strykstra, RJ; Bekker, RM; Van Andel, J			Dispersal and life span spectra in plant communities: a key to safe site dynamics, species coexistence and conservation	ECOGRAPHY												Dispersal and life span of individual plant species within five plant communities were assessed to obtain a characterization of these communities in this respect. Such a characterization is important in the context of restoration and maintenance. The most frequent species of five communities were ranked in eight classes according to their level of seed dispersal capability, their seed bank formation (dispersal in time and space) and their individual life span. In the communities, all eight classes were found, but communities differed in the distribution of the species over the classes. A theoretical framework was constructed to use the level of specialization of plant species in terms of dispersal in space and time, and life span, to define the characteristics of safe site dynamics within communities. Following simple rules, the relative reliability of the occurrence of safe sites in space and time was defined. After that, the relative reliability of the habitat was linked to the best fitting combination of trait specialization level. Having defined this link, communities could be characterized in a comparative way by their level and pattern of reliability of the opportunities for recruitment in space and time. The meaning of the coexistence of a range of trait combinations in one community was discussed. It was postulated that habitat reliability can explain this by assuming that the habitat of the community is part of a larger system, or consists of several "subsystems". These insights need to be considered in nature conservation. Succession and also specializations beyond the scope of dispersal and life span may influence the occurrence of species in a seemingly unfit habitat (for instance the occurrence of semi parasitic annuals in a community of perennials, because they use the perennial root system of other species). Finally, the meaning of safe site reliability in space and time in the context of restoration of communities was discussed. The reliability in space and time may be different today from that of the past, which restricts the feasibility of restoration of communities.																	0906-7590					APR	2002	25	2					145	160		10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250203.x							WOS:000174928500003						
J	Kalamees, R; Zobel, M				Kalamees, R; Zobel, M			The role of the seed bank in gap regeneration in a calcareous grassland community	ECOLOGY												We conducted a factorial field experiment in order to investigate the role of the soil seed bank in gap recolonization in a calcareous Grassland, using 240 experimental Gaps (10 X 10 cm). Experimental manipulations included the elimination of the seed bank (by sterilizing the soil), the elimination of short-distance seed rain by removing all flowerheads in 2 X 2 in plots, and the prevention of lateral clonal spread by surrounding gap soil with 41 pm nylon mesh. The influence of competition on regeneration was also studied, by planting an adult individual of Filipendula vulgaris or Festuca rubra in the center of some gaps. There were 130 species of vascular plants in the established vegetation. Twenty-five species also occurred as seedlings; 51 species were recorded in the seed bank, of which only two were not present in the growing vegetation. There were on average 2362 seeds/m(2) in a 10 cm deep soil layer. Species relative abundances in the established vegetation and in the seed bank were not significantly correlated. Eighty-four vascular plant species emerged from seeds in the experimental gaps. The seed bank contributed on average 5.4 seedlings per gap, short-distance seed rain (<0.5 m) 4.1 seedlings, and longer distance (>0.5 m) seed rain 2.7 seedlings. Thirty-one vascular plant species arrived in experimental gaps by lateral clonal spread. Of these, only one was not recorded as a seedling in the experimental gaps. There were on average 2.7 clonally spread shoots per gap. Species with smaller seeds were present in significantly greater numbers in the seed bank than in the vegetation and were also more common colonizers of experimental gaps. There was no evidence of competition or facilitation between seedlings, or between seedlings and adults. It was concluded that the soil seed bank has an important functional role in a perennial grassland community as a means for population maintenance for many species. Thirty-six percent of the regeneration in small gaps was due to the seed bank, and one may expect that this proportion will increase in larger Gaps.

Patterns of seed diffusion among trial farmers were examined as well as among non-trial farmers who were members of seed banks. The study showed that trial follow-up surveys provide a cost-effective approach for assessing early adoption and providing feedback to researchers. While useful, however, such studies are not an end in themselves. Rather they need to be perceived and designed as one of several studies that help researchers understand the complexity of farmers' adoption decisions.																	0014-4797					APR	2002	38	2					211	221		10.1017/S0014479702000261							WOS:000175380900006

This paper describes the germination mechanism of hard seeds of a species of honey locust, Gleditsia japonica, which can germinate only when externally damaged, in relation to four germinating factors: feeding damage by two specialist seed predators, a bean weevil (Bruchidius dorsalis) and a cydid bug (Adrisa magna): feeding damage by a generalist seed predator, a wild mouse (Apodemus speciosus); and physical damage. 2. In laboratory experiments, both the bean weevil and physical damage facilitated germination. while damage by the cydid bug and wild mouse did not. 3. In contrast to laboratory findings, field censuses of G japonica seed survival revealed that more than 99% were damaged either by B. dorsalis or A. magna. Therefore, less than 0.5% of the seeds remained intact. preventing formation of a seed bank. 4. In addition, all germinating seeds found in the field contained B. dorsalis larvae. 5. These results strongly suggest that damage by B. dorsalis is a prerequisite for G japonica germination, in contrast to the conventional view that physical disturbance, possibly flooding, is the primary germinating factor for hard seeds.																	0269-8463					APR	2002	16	2					252	257		10.1046/j.1365-2435.2002.00619.x							WOS:000175467600012

Enhancement of plant species diversity is often an objective in grassland management for wildlife conservation. Such management regimes may also change the species composition of soil seed banks, which may themselves affect future vegetation change. We compared soil seed banks and vegetation from a long-term meadow management trial and from a series of traditionally managed species-rich meadows in northern England, UK. 2. The management trial used three hay-cut date treatments (14 June, 21 July and 1 September), two fertilizer treatments [no fertilizer or 25 kg nitrogen ha(-1) plus 12.5 kg ha(-1) phosphate (P2O5) and potash (K2O)] and two seed-addition treatments (no seed, seed of many species sown 1990-92). Soil seed banks were assessed in 1998. Subsequent vegetation development under these treatments, and under an additional farmyard manure treatment, was assessed in 2000. 3. Most seed was in the 0-5-cm soil layer and most of the frequent species germinated in the autumn. Short- and long-term persistent seed banks were most abundant. The species composition of the seed banks and the vegetation in the trial, and in the traditionally managed meadows used as a control, were distinctly different, the meadow trial seed bank being the most uniform. 4. An ordination of simulated plant communities based on the UK National Vegetation Classification provided a wider framework for comparing vegetation and seed banks with the species composition of British meadow communities, some of which are also found in Europe. The soil seed banks throughout the meadow trial plots and the control fields were very similar in species composition to that of the vegetation in agriculturally improved meadows. However, there were many more species in the soil seed bank of the traditionally managed control meadows. 5. In 2000, only the seed-addition treatment increased the species richness of the vegetation. Farmyard manure and mineral fertilizer had similar effects, increasing the cover of Poa trivialis and Rumex acetosa and decreasing the cover of Rhinanthus minor and Anthoxanthum odoratum. 6. It was concluded that the development of the soil seed bank probably lags behind increases in vegetation diversity initiated by seed sowing. This emphasizes the need to introduce additional species as seed when increased diversity is a target for the restoration management of previously intensively managed grasslands.																	0021-8901					APR	2002	39	2					279	293		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00715.x							WOS:000175731100009

Agricultural intensification has resulted in the reduction and fragmentation of species-rich grasslands across much of western Europe. 2. We examined the key ecological processes that limit the creation of diverse grassland communities on ex-arable land in a multi-site experiment over a wide variety of soil types and locations throughout lowland Britain. 3. The results showed it was possible to create and maintain these communities successfully under a hay-cutting and grazing management regime. Furthermore, there was a high degree of repeatability of the treatment effects across the sites. 4. Lack of seed of desirable species was the key factor limiting the assembly of diverse grassland communities. Sowing a species-rich seed mixture of ecologically adapted grassland plants was an effective means of overcoming this limitation. Community assembly by natural colonization from the seed bank and seed rain was a slow and unreliable process. However, there was no evidence to suggest that sowing a species-poor grass-dominated seed mixture made the vegetation any less susceptible to colonization by desirable species than allowing natural regeneration to take place. 5. Deep cultivation caused significant reductions in soil P and K concentrations across the sites. This had a significant beneficial effect on the establishment and persistence of sown forbs in all years. It also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of unsown weedy grasses. However, for both variables these differences were very small after 4 years. 6. Sowing a nurse crop significantly reduced the number of unsown grass species, but had no beneficial effect on the establishment of desirable species. 7. Treatments sown with the species-rich seed mixture following deep cultivation corresponded most closely to the specified target communities defined by the UK National Vegetation Classification. Natural regeneration and treatments sown with the species-poor seed mixture were much less similar to the target. The sites on circum-neutral soils achieved the greatest degree of similarity to the target. Those on calcareous and acid soils failed to achieve their targets and most closely resembled the target for neutral soils. This reflected the poor performance of the sown preferential species for these communities.

J	Kleyer, M				Kleyer, M			Validation of plant functional types across two contrasting landscapes	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The validation of plant functional type models across contrasting landscapes is seen as a step towards the claim that plant functional types should recur regionally or even globally. I sampled the vegetation of an urban landscape on a range of sites representing gradients of resource supply and disturbance intensity. A group of plants with similar attributes was considered a 'functional type', if the species significantly co-occurred in a certain segment of the gradient plane of resource supply and disturbance intensity. Vegetative and regeneration traits were considered. A similar study was performed in a nearby agricultural landscape (Kleyer 1999). The logistic regression models from the urban landscape were applied to the data set of the agricultural landscape and vice versa. Although the overall environment of the two landscapes was very different, recurrent patterns of several functional types were found. At high fertility and high disturbance levels, annual species predominated with a persistent seed bank, high seed output, and short vertical expansion. When disturbances changed from below-ground to above-ground, the sexual regeneration mode was replaced by the vegetative mode, while vertical expansion remained low. At medium disturbance intensities, the vertical expansion and vegetative regeneration increased with fertility, while the seed bank remained mostly transient to short-term persistent and lateral expansion and sexual regeneration was intermediate, At low disturbances and low resource supplies, seed bank longevity, and vertical and lateral expansion tended to be long. Diversity of groups of plants with similar attributes was highest at intermediate disturbance levels and low fertility.

Seed densities in the seed rain and seed bank as well as the densities of emerged seedlings in gaps and in closed vegetation were greater in the meadow than in the heath. In the heath, environmental constraints hindered seedling emergence almost completely so seeds accumulated in the seed bank. In the meadow, the decrease in the seed bank was due to high seedling emergence. Within both plant communities, seedling emergence in gaps and in closed vegetation was comparable. In the meadow, the seed rain and seedling emergence in gaps, as well as the seed bank and seedling emergence in gaps were positively correlated. Differences in seed and adult plant sizes were reasons for the low correlation between the standing vegetation and the other phases. In DCA ordination the first axis separated the phase of seedling emergence in closed vegetation and seed bank. The second axis separated the standing vegetation from the other phases. The structure of the seed rain was more heterogeneous than that of other phases. In the heath, the standing vegetation and the seed rain were positively correlated. The ordination of these phases reflected the patchiness of standing vegetation and the ability of the diaspores of Betula nana to disperse over long distances.																	1100-9233					APR	2002	13	2					217	226		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2002.tb02042.x							WOS:000176736400009						
J	Kozlowski, TT				Kozlowski, TT			Physiological ecology of natural regeneration of harvested and disturbed forest stands: implications for forest management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Forests are indispensable as sources of harvested products and a variety of services. Unfortunately forests throughout the world, and especially in the tropics, are threatened by natural and human-induced disturbances. Regeneration of harvested or otherwise severely disturbed forest stands typically occurs in four stages: (1) stand initiation and regeneration stage, (2) thinning or stem exclusion stage, (3) transition or understory regeneration stage, and (4) steady-state or old-growth stage. Blocks to stand regeneration may occur in each of these stages. Revegetation of severely-disturbed forests often is very slow and unpredictable because of complex interactions among propagules as well as site and climatic conditions. Stand regeneration depends on an abundant and viable seed supply, a suitable medium for seed germination, favorable environmental conditions, and capacity for sprouting or layering of some species. Massive losses of seeds in seed banks occur because of seed aging, failure of seed germination, predation, diseases, and death of seeds. Mortality of seedlings also is high, especially in the cotyledon stage of development, because of low reserves of carbohydrates and mineral nutrients. Growth of older seedlings, saplings, and mature trees is inhibited by air and soil pollution, drought, flooding, soil compaction, insect attacks, and diseases. After canopy closure occurs in a developing forest stand changes in species composition are traceable to competition among plants for light, water, and mineral nutrients. Following severe disturbance of a multi-aged, mixed forest, a mixed-species stand of fast growing, generally short-lived trees typically occupies a site and is succeeded by species that dominated the stand before the disturbance occurred. After a minor disturbance gaps form in the canopy and are recolonized. If plant succession in a developing stand runs its full course the resulting old-growth forest is impacted by frequent minor disturbances and is maintained in an oscillating steady-state in which stand establishment, thinning, gap formation, and colonization recur. In some regions frequent fires maintain forest stands in a subclimax stage of development. Natural regeneration of harvested or otherwise severely disturbed stands likely will be too slow and unpredictable to provide all the forest products and services required by increasing population growth. Hence, greater emphasis on several concurrent strategies will be needed, including heavy emphasis on artificial regeneration of disturbed forests; conservation of the remaining tropical forests; expansion of plantations, agroforestry systems, and forest reserves; expansion of tree improvement programs; more intensive and improved forest management; and expanded research with particular emphasis on seed biology, responses of tree species and genotypes to environmental stresses, tradeoffs between beneficial and harmful effects of environmental stresses on tree species and genotypes, genetic engineering, potential effects of global warming on forests, agroforestry systems, models of stand productivity; and appraisal by remote sensing of injury to forest ecosystems.

However, if a study targets at both submerged species and helophytes, submerged conditions are generally not suitable. We tested the emergence of seedlings from sediment samples from a freshwater canal, comparing a waterlogged treatment with a submerged treatment. From the sediment samples 31 species emerged. Eight species germinated in significantly larger numbers from the waterlogged treatment, one being a submerged species and four helophytes. No species germinated better under submerged conditions. The total number of species germinating under waterlogged conditions was significantly higher than under submerged conditions. Germination experiments with Potamogeton species showed no significant differences in germination percentage between a waterlogged and submerged treatment for at least two species. In the study of seed banks of submerged sediments, aimed at both submerged aquatic plants and helophytes, a waterlogged treatment is therefore suitable to detect both groups of plants.

J	Shelton, MG; Cain, MD				Shelton, MG; Cain, MD			Potential carry-over of seeds from 11 common shrub and vine competitors of loblolly and shortleaf pines	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Many of the competitors of the regeneration of loblolly and shortleaf pines (Pinus taeda L. and Pinus echinata Mill., respectively) develop from seed disseminated on the site after reproduction cutting or from the seed bank. To evaluate the potential carry-over of the seeds from 11 shrub and vine competitors of these two important southern pines, we designed packets so that fruits could be deposited on the forest floor and subsequently extracted over a 3-year period. After extraction, repeated cycles of 60 days of germination testing followed by 60 days of stratification were conducted over a maximum of 42 months to determine the potential for seed carry-over and the germination characteristics of the species. Seeds of privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.) showed no viability after the first winter of field storage, while seeds of rattan vine (Berchemia scandens (Hill) K. Koch) and Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) had low viability (1-3%) after the third year. In contrast, seeds of smooth sumac (Rhus glabra L.), devils-walkingstick (Aralia spinosa L.), pepper vine (Ampelopsis arborea (L.) Koehne), and blackberry (Rubus argutus Link) were moderate in viability (7-19%) after the third year of field storage, while seeds of beautyberry (Callicarpa americana L.), common greenbrier (Smilax rotundifolia L.), and summer grape (Vitis aestivalis Michx.) showed a high viability (31-55%). Cumulative germination of seeds of deciduous holly (Ilex decidua Walt.) was greater after 3 years of field storage (8%) than after only 1 year (4%); for the first removal from field storage, no germination occurred until the ninth germination cycle. Results indicate that new seedlings of some species of shrubs and vines rely mostly on seeds dispersed shortly before or after disturbance, while seedlings of other species appear to develop from seeds that have been stored for long periods in the seed bank. Results of this study can be useful in developing ecologically sound strategies for controlling competing vegetation in forest stands of the southeastern United States.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				MAR	2002	32	3					412	419		10.1139/X01-207							WOS:000174559900004						
J	Dinnetz, P; Nilsson, T				Dinnetz, P; Nilsson, T			Population viability analysis of Saxifraga cotyledon, a perennial plant with semelparous rosettes	PLANT ECOLOGY												The aim with this study was to analyse the population dynamics of Saxifraga cotyledon, a rare, long lived herb, with semelparous rosettes. In Sweden, S. cotyledon grows in fragmented habitats at high altitude and is classified as vulnerable according to the IUCN system. From a five year demographical study we estimated population growth rates and extinction risks for one small and one large subpopulation. In the small subpopulation deterministic matrix simulations showed large variation, with two transitions projecting negative and two projecting positive population growth. The large subpopulation also showed large variation, but all yearly transitions projected positive population growth. In both subpopulations survival and growth contributed more than twice as much to population growth rates than did sexual reproduction, vegetative reproduction and the seed bank all taken together. In stochastic simulations the maximum likelihood growth estimator was larger than 1 for both subpopulations. None of the two subpopulations suffer from high extinction rates and although the effect of demographic stochasticity increase extinction risk in small populations it is enough with 70 individuals for a viable population of S. cotyledon. Hence, for the studied population of S. cotyledon, rareness per se is not a good indicator of vulnerability.																	1385-0237					MAR	2002	159	1					61	71		10.1023/A:1015593311183							WOS:000175636400006						
J	Humphrey, LD; Schupp, EW				Humphrey, LD; Schupp, EW			Seedling survival from locally and commercially obtained seeds on two semiarid sites	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Local populations of plants are likely to be better adapted to a site than populations from elsewhere. Thus, local seeds should yield higher survival in restoration attempts than commercial seed stocks. We compared seedling survival from locally and commercially obtained seeds of seven species, Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass), Elymus elymoides (squirrel-tail), Pascopyrum smithii (western wheatgrass), Stipa hymenoides (Indian ricegrass), Stipa comata (needle-and-thread), Chrysothamnus nauseosus (rubber rabbit-brush) and Ephedra nevadensis (Mormon tea) over three years on two sites in Utah (Dugway and Tintic) that were dominated by the introduced annual Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass). At the Dugway site we included burned and unburned seedbed treatments. For all species at Dugway, seedling survival to the first summer was higher on burned plots where B. tectorum densities were greatly reduced. First-year seedling survival was 20-30% for most species on the Dugway burned plots and at Tintic. At the drier Dugway site, only S. hymenoides and Ephedra had substantial third-year survival. Elymus and Pascopyrum survived to the third year only at the moister Tintic site. Survival to the third year was less than 3% for all species except S. comata (6% survival), and densities were low (0.2-1.0 plants/m(2)). However, third-year plants were well established and the grasses flowered. Pseudoroegneria and Ephedra at Dugway (on burned plots) and S. comata and Elymus at Tintic had higher first-year survival or higher survival based on survival curves from local than from commercial seeds. However, final survival was never significantly higher, although such a trend was suggested. Seed dormancy traits could also provide advantages to local populations, and we observed differences in dormancy between local and commercial S. comata and S. hymenoides seeds that may be an example.

J	Dyer, AR				Dyer, AR			Burning and grazing management in a California grassland: Effect on bunchgrass seed viability	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Prescribed fire is an important management tool for reducing the dominance of non-native species in annual grasslands; both annual and perennial native species show strong vegetative responses in the subsequent growing season. However, although the postfire contribution of native species to the seed bank is assumed to be larger than in pretreatment years, the effects on seed quality, particularly viability and longevity, are not well understood. In this study, I germinated Nassella pulchra (purple needlegrass) seed that had been stored for 10 years after collection from target plants receiving treatment combinations of summer burning and grazing by sheep. Seeds from burned plants were larger and had higher germinability than seed from unburned plants. Seeds from plants that were both burned and grazed had the highest germination. The strong relationship between long-term viability and seed size suggests greater maternal provisioning and increased seed quality subsequent to burning and grazing. I conclude that managing for seed quality may be a useful approach for conservation of native species in California's critically endangered grassland habitats.																	1061-2971					MAR	2002	10	1					107	111		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.10111.x							WOS:000174646200012						
J	Smith, SM; McCormick, PV; Leeds, JA; Garrett, PB				Smith, SM; McCormick, PV; Leeds, JA; Garrett, PB			Constraints of seed bank species composition and water depth for restoring vegetation in the Florida Everglades, USA	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area (RWMA) is a northern Everglades marsh, in Florida, U.S.A., that will undergo hydrologic restoration to remedy an artificially shortened hydroperiod. In an effort to predict vegetation responses to the impending changes in hydrology, plant community development from the resident seed bank was observed in response to three different moisture regimes in March and September 1998. Percent cover, species densities, total seedling densities, and percentages of facultative, facultative-upland, and upland indicator species were significantly higher in moist than in saturated soils. Flooding inhibited the germination of all species except Typha domingensis (cattail), which emerged in the highest numbers from saturated soils in both assays. Lythrum alatum (purple loosestrife) was abundant in both saturated and moist conditions. The season of assay affected species densities and the communities. Percent facultative-wetland species increased in saturated soils in the March assay but not in September. In contrast, percent obligate hydrophytes were higher in saturated conditions only in the September assay. In general the assay communities bore little resemblance to vegetation in currently undisturbed or historic wetlands of the northern Everglades. Consequently the RWMA seed bank will contribute little to the development of a restored community. Moreover, rehydration may encourage the spread of undesirable hydrophytes such as T. domingensis. This study supports the contention that hydrologic restoration must be accompanied by some level of active vegetation management and that the reference condition cannot be attained passively.																	1061-2971					MAR	2002	10	1					138	145		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.10115.x							WOS:000174646200016

J	De Villiers, AJ; Van Rooyen, MW; Theron, GK				De Villiers, AJ; Van Rooyen, MW; Theron, GK			Seed bank classification of the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, South Africa	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Laboratory characteristics of seeds of 37 species (41 seed types) from the Strandveld Succulent Karoo were used to predict seed bank types according to a modified key of Grime and Hillier (1981). Five seed bank strategies were recognized for this vegetation type, i.e. two with transient and three with persistent seed bank strategies. Of the 37 species investigated, 32% (all perennial species) had transient seed bank strategies, while 68% had persistent seed bank strategies. Seed dispersal of these 37 species was mainly anemochorous, although antitelechoric elements such as myxospermy, hygrochasy, heterodiaspory and synaptospermy were found among these species. The seed bank alone will not be sufficient to restore the vegetation of damaged land in the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, since many of the dominant species in the vegetation do not produce persistent seed banks. Many of these species may, however, be dispersed by wind into revegetation areas from surrounding vegetation. Topsoil replacement, seeding and transplanting of selected species will be essential for the successful revegetation of mined areas in this part of Namaqualand.				van Rooyen, Margaretha W/K-3559-2019													0960-2585					MAR	2002	12	1					57	67		10.1079/SSR200198							WOS:000174895000006						
J	Limburg, PA; Weider, LJ				Limburg, PA; Weider, LJ			'Ancient' DNA in the resting egg bank of a microcrustacean can serve as a palaeolimnological database	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Recent work on the diapausing egg banks of zooplankton, such as Daphnia (Crustacea: Anomopoda), indicates that these eggs can remain viable for decades while, theoretically, DNA can remain intact for even longer periods (i.e. centuries or millennia). We isolated diapausing eggs of Daphnia from a 30 m long sediment core taken from a hypereutrophic, northern German lake (Belauer See), with some eggs found in dated core material as old as 4500 years. Using microsatellite markers, we analysed the genetic structure of the resting eggs dated as old as ca. 200 years, and found that, although levels of heterozygosity remained remarkably stable, significant genetic differentiation (Nei's D = 0. 36; F-ST = 0. 15) between recent and 'ancient' resting eggs (including allele frequency shifts and private alleles) was detected. These shifts represent either species-level changes in this complex (i.e. species-specific characters of ephippia are not always robust), or intraspecific shifts in genetic variation, or a combination of both. This study demonstrates that the egg banks of aquatic zooplankton can serve as repositories of both genetic (intrapopulational) and ecological (interspecific) information. The use of molecular markers, such as microsatellites, on diapausing egg/seed banks may open new avenues of enquiry related to tracking the long-term genetic (and/or species) shifts that are associated with long-term environmental changes.																	0962-8452					FEB 7	2002	269	1488					281	287		10.1098/rspb.2001.1868							WOS:000173869200009	11839197					
J	Keith, DA				Keith, DA			Population dynamics of an endangered heathland shrub, Epacris stuartii (Epacridaceae): Recruitment, establishment and survival	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The only known population of the endangered shrub Epacris stuartii Stapf was studied from 1994 to 2001 using demographic census techniques. The effects of substrate, a fire and a storm on the emergence and survival of seedlings and the survival of established plants of different sizes were examined using failure-time analyses and logit-linear models. Ninety-five per cent of seedling emergence was delayed until the second post-fire spring, an unusual response among species with persistent soil seed banks. Mortality of seedlings was extreme compared with larger-seeded species, but diminished significantly with age. Seedling mortality varied significantly between substrates: 40% of seedlings persisted for more than 5 years in mineral soil, whereas less than 10% lived more than a year on rock and intermediate substrates. However, seedling numbers and local densities were lower on soils than other substrates. Background mortality of established plants was lower on soil and intermediate substrates (0.5% per year) than on rock (3% per year). Small plants may be more susceptible than large plants on rock, but not on soil. Both the fire and the storm resulted in elevated mortality of established plants. The population exhibited a variable response to fire, with plants on rock and intermediate substrates behaving as obligate seeders, whereas plants in soil resprouted. This appears to be the first report of microhabitat variation in fire response at sympatric scales. The effects of the storm were apparently independent of substrate and plant size. The essentially independent disturbance regimes comprising recurring fires and storms are likely to have a profound effect on the long-term population dynamics of E. stuartii . Over the 7-year census period, recruitment has failed to compensate for mortality, resulting in a 30% net decline in the population. The demographic census has proved to be crucial in the detection and diagnosis of this decline.																	1442-9985					FEB	2002	27	1					67	76		10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01160.x							WOS:000175424500005						
J	Holmes, PM				Holmes, PM			Depth distribution and composition of seed-banks in alien-invaded and uninvaded fynbos vegetation	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												South African fynbos vegetation is threatened on a large scale by invasive woody plants. A major task facing nature conservation managers is to restore invaded areas. The aim of this study was to determine the restoration potential of fynbos following dense invasion by the Australian tree Acacia saligna . The impacts of dense invasion on seed-bank composition and depth distribution were investigated to determine which fynbos guilds and species have the most persistent seed-banks. Soil samples were excavated at three different depths for invaded and uninvaded vegetation at two sand plain and mountain fynbos sites. Seed-banks were determined using the seedling emergence approach. Invasion caused a significant reduction in seed-bank density and richness at all sites. There was a significant, but smaller, reduction in seed-bank density and richness with soil depth at three sites. Seed-bank composition and guild structure changed following invasion. Low persistence of long-lived obligate seeders in sand plain fynbos seed-banks indicates that this vegetation type will be difficult to restore from the seed-bank alone following alien clearance. The dominance of short-lived species, especially graminoids, forbs and ephemeral geophytes, suggests that regenerating vegetation will develop into a herbland rather than a shrubland. It is recommended that seed collecting and sowing form part of the restoration plan for densely invaded sand plain sites. As seed density remained higher towards the soil surface following invasion, there is no general advantage in applying a mechanical soil disturbance treatment. However, if the shallow soil seed-bank becomes depleted, for example following a hot fire through dense alien slash, a soil disturbance treatment should be given to exhume the deeper viable seed-bank and promote recruitment.																	1442-9985					FEB	2002	27	1					110	120		10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01164.x							WOS:000175424500010

This strategy is based on identification of critical transitional stages in the life-cycle of the weed and targeting a complementary group of insect herbivores against these stages. The strategy has both long- and short-term aims and is focussed on the long- lived soil seed bank of these thistles. In the longer term it is considered essential to reduce soil seed reserves to levels at which emergent plant densities are not economically damaging, and in the shorter term it aims to minimize the impact of those plants that do emerge during the period of seed bank decline. From more than 120 insect species found to feed on Onopordum spp. in their native European range, six were selected to form a complementary herbivore guild, targeting the small rosettedouble right arrowlarge rosette, stem elongationdouble right arrowflowering and seed productiondouble right arrowsoil seed reserves transitions of their host plant.

The probability that recently established forest stands develop towards their ecological reference (i.e. ancient forest) depends largely on the possibility of the target species to colonize them. We focused on the colonization ability of forest plant species and particularly on so-called ancient forest plant species. Major constraints for ecological forest restoration are the spatial characteristics of the target site (isolation, shape and area), imposing dispersal limitations, and in the duration and intensity of the historical land use, leading to changes in habitat characteristics influencing recruitment probability. We reviewed the ecological literature with respect to these constraints and conclude that it takes at least a century to restore the understorey layer of recent forests, even when the target stand is adjacent to a well-developed ancient forest. Both recruitment and dispersal limitation of the target species are responsible for this. Newly established forests should therefore be situated at a minimal distance of the ancient forest source. In other cases, forest plant species will not be able to colonize the newly established forest on a measurable time scale and artificial introduction of forest plant species can be taken into consideration. The negative effects of habitat characteristics, and mainly high soil nutrient values in the recent forest stand can be mitigated by soil nutrient lowering measures. Disturbances in the recent forest should be minimized to maintain a high canopy closure level, preventing light demanding, high competitive species from establishing a stable population. An additional negative consequence of soil disturbances is that it stimulates germination of species from the soil seed bank, which is mainly composed of highly competitive or ruderal species.

J	Robinson, RA; Sutherland, WJ				Robinson, RA; Sutherland, WJ			Post-war changes in arable farming and biodiversity in Great Britain	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Agriculture represents the dominant land use throughout much of western Europe. and a significant part of European biodiversity is associated with this habitat. We attempted to quantify the changes in agriculture and biodiversity in Britain since the 1940s. 2. There have been widespread declines in the populations of many groups of organisms associated with farmland in Britain and north-west Europe. The declines have been particularly marked amongst habitat specialists; many of the taxa still common on farmland are habitat generalists. 3. Farming practices have become increasingly intensive in the post-war period. with a dramatic reduction in landscape diversity. Since 1945, there has been a 65% decline in the number of farms, a 77% decline in farm labour and an almost fourfold increase in yield. Farms have become more specialized: the greatly increased use of machinery has made operations quicker and more efficient, but has resulted in the removal of 50% of the hedgerow stock. Autumn sowing of crops has become predominant, with winter stubbles now far less prevalent. The number and extent of chemical applications has increased greatly, but the net amount applied, and their persistence, has decreased in recent years. 4. Intensification has had a wide range of impacts on biodiversity, but data for many taxa are too scarce to permit a detailed assessment of the factors involved. Reduction in habitat diversity was important in the 1950s and 1960s; reduction in habitat quality is probably more important now. 5. As a case study, the declines in populations of seed-eating birds populations were assessed in relation to changing agricultural management. Generally, the declines were likely to be caused by a reduced food supply in the non-breeding season, although other factors may be important for particular species. 6. Agriculture will face a number of challenges in the medium term. While research into the mechanisms underlying species and habitat associations, and their interaction with scale, will be critical in under-pinning management, consideration of farmer attitudes and socio-economic factors is likely to be as important.

J	Luckeydoo, LM; Fausey, NR; Brown, LC; Davis, CB				Luckeydoo, LM; Fausey, NR; Brown, LC; Davis, CB			Early development of vascular vegetation of constructed wetlands in northwest Ohio receiving agricultural waters	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Constructed wetlands are currently being explored for use in reducing non-point source (NPS) pollution. The Wetland Reservoir Subirrigation System (WRSIS) project links water management in agricultural fields, constructed wetlands and water storage reservoirs to enhance crop production and reduce delivery of agrichemicals and sediments to local waterways. Three WRSIS demonstration sites have been developed on prior converted cropland in the Maumee River watershed located in northwest Ohio. Construction of the wetlands was completed in 1996 and they were then allowed to passively revegetate while receiving drainage water from adjacent fields. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the initial development of vegetation, and the availability of propagules within these wetlands. Preliminary vegetation inventories conducted in 1998 identified moderate species richness but low percentage of wetland species. A germination study completed on soils from one location showed additional viable wetland species available in the seed bank. Passive revegetation of these three constructed wetlands associated with WRSIS systems has resulted in good vegetation cover, but it is lacking the desired percentage of wetland species to date. Passive revegetation may prove to be an effective and economical method of revegetating constructed wetlands within agricultural landscapes that have suitable propagule availability.

J	Morris, AB; Baucom, RS; Cruzan, MB				Morris, AB; Baucom, RS; Cruzan, MB			Stratified analysis of the soil seed bank in the cedar glade endemic Astragalus bibullatus: Evidence for historical changes in genetic structure	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Persistent seed banks may provide information on historical changes in the genetic composition of populations. We used stratified sampling of the soil seed bank of Astragalus bibullatus (Pyne's ground plum) to assess levels of temporal variation in population genetic structure and to infer historical changes in the levels of inbreeding and relative gene flow. This species has an extremely limited distribution in the Central Basin of Tennessee, where it is found in open areas and along the edges of cedar glades. Protein electrophoresis was conducted on seedlings grown from seeds that had been recovered from three successive I cm thick layers of soil sampled from six sites. Analyses of seven polymorphic allozyme loci indicated that there were substantial levels of genetic differentiation among soil layers and sites. Higher levels of genetic diversity were found in seed than in vegetative populations that had been sampled in a previous study. Seed populations from the uppermost soil layer had higher heterozygote deficiencies, displayed higher levels of differentiation among sites, and had higher private allele frequencies than seed populations from the lower two layers. The change in heterozygosity and distribution of genetic variation among sites for the youngest soil layer is consistent with a pattern of increased selfing, sib mating, and decreased gene flow among populations. These changes in inbreeding and relative levels of gene flow are corroborated by information on historical land use practices in the region and support the hypothesis that loss of appropriate habitat has led to smaller population sizes and a more fragmented distribution of this cedar glade endemic.

J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM				Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM			Achene germination ecology of the federally threatened floodplain endemic Boltonia decurrens (Asteraceae)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												As a result modification/destruction of its floodplain habitats, Boltonia decurrens (Torr. & Gray) Wood now is listed as federally threatened. We investigated dormancy-breaking and germination requirements of achenes, monitored seasonal changes in germination responses of buried achenes and determined if buried achenes have the potential for long term viability. At maturity in autumn, 70-100% of the achenes germinated in light at high (30/15, 35/20 C), but not at low (15/6 C) alternating temperature regimes. Cold stratification during winter increased germination percentages, especially at low temperatures, and by spring 95-100% of the achenes germinated over a range of temperatures, including those (e.g., 15/6 C) that were inhibitory in autumn. Achenes required light for germination, but exposure to light during stratification did not promote germination in darkness at stimulated spring and/or summer habitat temperatures. Nearly 100% of the achenes buried for 88 mo in a nonheated greenhouse were viable. Thus, achenes have the capacity for long-term viability when buried in soil and subjected to seasonal temperature changes; however, soil seed bank studies have not been clone Lit population sites. In both spring and autumn during the 88-mo burial period, exhumed achenes germinated to high percentages at 20/10, 25/15, 30/15 and 35/20 C, but germination at 1510 C was high ill spring and low in autumn. The implication of these results is that achenes could germinate in the field any time from late March to late October if disturbance resulted in their being exposed to light and soil moisture was not limiting.																	0003-0031					JAN	2002	147	1					16	24		10.1674/0003-0031(2002)147[0016:AGEOTF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000173283500002						
J	Carter, CT; Ungar, IA				Carter, CT; Ungar, IA			Aboveground vegetation, seed bank and soil analysis of a 31-year-old forest restoration on coal mine spoil in southeastern Ohio	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												A 31-y-old forest restoration on coal mine spoil vas studied to assess soil chemical composition, percent change in tree density and percent similarity or the seed bank and ground-story vegetation. Seed bank and soil chemistry results were compared to an adjacent unvegetated spoil bank. Of fifteen tree species planted on a barren, coal, spoil bank in 1966, four increased in density (indicating recruitment since 1966), seven decreased in density to 50% and four decreased in density >50% after 31 y. Nine volunteer tree species were recorded on the reforested site since the plantings in 1966. March and July soil collections in 1997 contained seeds of 18 species each, 13 in both collections. Most of the species found in the seed bank were shade-intolerant. No significant difference was found for total seed density between the March (4257 +/- 490 seeds/m(2)) and July (3589 +/- 365 seeds/m(2)) seed banks. Percent similarity between the seed bank and ground-story vegetation from the March and July seed collections vas 9.8% and 8.2%, respectively. No seeds were found in soil collections from the adjacent unvegetated spoil bank. Soil pH and ionic content between the reforested study area and the unvegetated spoil bank differed significantly. We believe that the 1966 plantings have provided a habitat for other species to establish by reducing erosion and improving edaphic conditions.																	0003-0031					JAN	2002	147	1					44	59		10.1674/0003-0031(2002)147[0044:AVSBAS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000173283500005						
J	Jutila, HM				Jutila, HM			Seed banks of river delta meadows on the west coast of Finland	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The seed banks of two delta meadows were studied on the west coast of Finland (61degrees33-N, 21degrees39-21degrees41'E) to evaluate the possibilities of using seed bank in the restoration of coastal wetland meadows. The objective of the study was to determine the size, composition and species richness of germinable seed bank, estimate the effect of flooding on the seed bank, and describe the similarities and differences between seed bank and the aboveground vegetation. The study areas are conservationally important. A total of 125 samples were taken with a corer of 4.8 cm in diameter to the depth of 10 cm. Altogether 4977 seedlings were observed, yielding an average of 22 005+/-1880 seedlings/m(2). Most seedlings and species in the seed bank were monocotyledons, perennials and hemicryptophytes, similar to the aboveground vegetation. Although 36 species were found in both the seed bank and vegetation, there was a significant lack of similarity overall (Mantel test). The seed bank flora included 24 dicot vs. 25 monocot species and 41 perennial vs. 8 annual species. Many of the species found only in the seed bank were annuals or biennials (13 species, 46% of total) and those growing only in the aboveground vegetation were mainly perennials (52 species, 92% of total). The most abundant species found in the seed bank were Carex nigra, C. aquatilis, Juncus gerardii, Calla palustris, and Potentilla palustris, which together made up 74% of the seed bank. The numbers of species differed significantly between different elevation classes and were highest at middle elevations. Seed bank is an important part of these delta grassland communities and can be utilised in restoration.

J	Tamado, T; Schutz, W; Milberg, P				Tamado, T; Schutz, W; Milberg, P			Germination ecology of the weed Parthenium hysterophorus in eastern Ethiopia	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												Germination ecology of Parthenium hysterophorus, recently introduced to Ethiopia, was studied in a series of experiments. Viability of the seeds was greater than 50% after 26 months of burial in the soil indicating the potential build-up of a substantial persistent soil seed bank. A short period of dry storage was sufficient to overcome a light requirement for germination in a minor fraction of the seeds. Likewise, seeds exhumed from burial showed an increase in germination ability in darkness over time, with a weak tendency for seasonal cyclicity in dormancy level at one of two sites. Germination occurred at the mean minimum (10degreesC) and maximum (25degreesC) temperatures of the collection sites, as well as over a wide range of fluctuating (12/2degreesC-35/25degreesC) temperatures in light. No germination of R hysterophorus seeds occurred at osmotic potentials < -0.52 MPa (at 27 degrees C), the species being less tolerant to moisture stress than sorghum grains. Most seedlings emerged from shallowly buried (< 0.5 cm) seeds and none from more than 5 cm depth. Naturally dispersed seeds required about 60 days, at a hot lowland site, to start emergence despite the presence of adequate rainfall, and higher number of seedlings emerged in undisturbed plots than in hand hoed plots. These experiments and field observations suggest that there are no obvious climatic conditions that may limit the germination of Parthenium hysterophorus in Ethiopia, but a high moisture requirement of the seeds for germination could be the major factor limiting germination during the dry season.

J	Gilbert, GS				Gilbert, GS			Evolutionary ecology of plant diseases in natural ecosystems	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY												Plant pathogens cause mortality and reduce fecundity of individual plants, drive host population dynamics, and affect the structure and composition of natural plant communities. Pathogens are responsible for both numerical changes in host populations and evolutionary changes through selection for resistant genotypes. Linking such ecological and evolutionary dynamics has been the focus of a growing body of literature on the effects of plant diseases in natural ecosystems. A guiding principle is the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which plants and pathogens interact. This review summarizes the effects of diseases on populations of wild plants, focusing in particular on the mediation of plant competition and succession, the maintenance of plant species diversity, as well as the process of rapid evolutionary changes in host-pathogen symbioses.

A three-year study of soil seed bank was conducted in an area infested with Rhazya stricta Decne. The object of the study was to evaluate annual and seasonal variations in the soil seed bank over three degrees of infestation by R. stricta (loss, moderate, and heavy). Soil samples were placed in germination trays in a growth chamber and irrigated. Emerging seedlings were identified and counted by,species. Species were grouped into shrubs, legumes, grasses, and forbs. Results revealed the presence of seeds of 44 species, mostly annuals. Low similarity was observed between above-ground vegetation and soil seed components. Significant annual and seasonal variations were observed among groups of species. Generally, seed bank size and species richness were higher under the lower level of R. stricta infestation. It is concluded drat most of the desirable species that have the potential of growing in the area are disappearing.

J	Street, KA; Abd El Moneim, AM; Cocks, PS				Street, KA; Abd El Moneim, AM; Cocks, PS			The performance of subterranean vetch (Vicia sativa ssp amphicarpa) in a cereal/pasture rotation in north-west Syria	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to determine if subterranean vetch can persist in a cereal-legume ley farming system and to determine when it is most susceptible to grazing. Grazing treatments were applied to a series of plots containing subterranean vetch during the establishment year. Thereafter the plots were alternately sown to barley or left for the vetch to regenerate. Early grazing caused a seed yield reduction of about 75%. Later grazing treatments had no effect on seed yield, which were between 1000 and 1400 kg/ha. The first cereal phase caused a 6-10-fold reduction in seed bank size. During the 2 years following the first barley year, the seed bank increased to about 900 kg/ha. The second barley year caused a 4-fold reduction in the soil seed bank. Although subterranean vetch managed to persist for 5 years, the dramatic reduction in the seed bank after the barley years indicates that subterranean vetch will not persist at a useful density in a system where 2 or more cropping years run successively. However, other studies have shown that there are enough genotypes with the necessary levels of hardseededness to fit the ley system.																	0004-9409						2002	53	5					609	614	UNSP 0004-9409/02/050609	10.1071/AR01126							WOS:000175430600011						
J	Norman, HC; Cocks, PS; Galwey, NW				Norman, HC; Cocks, PS; Galwey, NW			Hardseededness in annual clovers: variation between populations from wet and dry environments	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Annual legumes rely on hardseededness, a form of seed dormancy, to spread the risk of mortality associated with germination and to encourage germination at the optimal time in a season. This paper examines seed softening strategies of a number of clover (Trifolium) species collected over a range of environments. Three hypotheses are tested. The first is that within species, long-term hardseededness increases with aridity due to the greater chance of failure to reproduce in dry environments. It is tested by comparing seed softening patterns of populations of a number of clover species collected from a range of environments. The second hypothesis, that annual legumes from dry environments have a smaller subset of seed softening strategies than legumes from wetter environments, is tested by comparing the range of seed softening patterns from all species found at collection sites. The third hypothesis is that within-year patterns of seed softening that prevent germination after summer rainfall may partially substitute for long-term hardseededness. It is tested by examining the relationship between within-year hardseededness and between-year hardseededness. Accessions of the same species from different collection sites differed in both within-year pattern of seed softening and long-term hardseededness but there was little evidence that these differences were between ecotypes. Different species from the same collection site did not have similar seed softening strategies, and seed softening strategies of clovers from dry sites were as variable as those from wetter environments. Within-year pattern of seed softening does not appear to substitute for between-year hardseededness as a dormancy strategy.

J	Wills, TJ; Read, J				Wills, TJ; Read, J			Effects of heat and smoke on germination of soil-stored seed in a south-eastern Australian sand heathland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Various fire-related agents, including heat, smoke, ash and charred wood, have been shown to break dormancy and promote germination of soil-stored seed in a broad range of species in mediterranean-type systems. However, relatively little work has been conducted in south-eastern Australian heathlands. This study examined the effects of heat and smoked water on germination of the soil seed bank in a mature sand heathland within the Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. in south-eastern Australia. Heat was clearly the most successful treatment for promoting seed germination, followed by smoked water, then controls, with 55% of species present in the germinable soil seed bank requiring a heat or smoke stimulus to promote seed germination. Mean species richness of the germinable soil seed bank was found to be significantly higher in heat-treated soil than in smoke and control treatments. Seedling density of heat-treated soil was almost 10 times that of controls, while smoke-treated soil was almost five times that of controls. Seedling emergence was fastest in heat-treated soil, followed by smoke and control soils. Of the species found in the soil seed bank, 25% were absent from the extant vegetation, suggesting the existence of post-fire colonisers in the soil seed bank. The results have implications for the design of soil seed bank experiments and the use of fire as a tool in vegetation management.																	0067-1924						2002	50	2					197	206	UNSP 0067-1924/02/02197	10.1071/BT01017							WOS:000175752000005						
J	Wooller, SJ; Wooller, RD; Brown, KL				Wooller, SJ; Wooller, RD; Brown, KL			Regeneration by three species of Banksia on the south coast of Western Australia in relation to fire interval	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The regeneration strategies of three Banksia species in relation to fire were studied over 20 years in a mediterranean heathland-shrubland on the south coast of Western Australia. Banksia baueri and B. nutans are both bushes 1-2 m high, while B. baxteri is a shrub 4 m high. All three species regenerated only from seed released from the canopy seed bank after fire. They did not start to flower until 6 years after fire and seed set took even longer. Differences between the species in age-related intensity of flowering were related to the rate at which each species accumulated seed in the canopy. Even plants over 40 years old were still increasing their overall canopy seed bank or replacing seeds that had been released or were no longer viable. The vegetation studied appeared to be little affected by humans historically and to have burnt only at intervals of 30-60 years or more. Consequently, although all three species needed fire to regenerate, management of fire regimes needs to allow adequate intervals between fires for the replacement of their canopy seed banks. Indeed, all three Banksia species studied were extinguished from one area burnt twice at an interval of 9 years. Models developed with Banksia species from the northern sand plains of Western Australia, where fires appear more frequent, may need modification to be applicable to all south-coastal species.																	0067-1924						2002	50	3					311	317	UNSP 0067-1924/02/030311	10.1071/BT01078							WOS:000176169400004						
J	Denham, AJ; Auld, TD				Denham, AJ; Auld, TD			Flowering, seed dispersal, seed predation and seedling recruitment in two pyrogenic flowering resprouters	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A few resprouting plants in fire-prone environments have no local seed bank (soil or canopy) when a fire occurs. These species rely on post-fire flowering and the production of non-dormant seeds to exploit favourable post-fire establishment and growth conditions. For two such pyrogenic flowering species (Doryanthes excelsa Correa and Telopea speciosissima (Smith) R. Br.), we examined the timing of seed release, patterns of fruit production, seed dispersal, seed predation and seedling establishment following a fire in the Sydney region of southeastern Australia. Both species took some 19 months after the fire to flower and the first seeds were released 2 years after the fire. D. excelsa flowered and fruited only once after the fire. For T. speciosissima, plants also flowered at least once more in the subsequent 5 years, but produced seed in only the first three post-fire flowering years. Fruit production differed between species, with fruiting individuals of D. excelsa producing fewer infructescences, similar numbers of follicles, but many more seeds per follicle than fruiting individuals of T. speciosissima. Ultimately, D. excelsa produced approximately six times as many seeds per m 2 and four times as many seeds per adult in one flowering season than T. speciosissima did after four flowering (three successful fruiting) seasons. Seeds were passively dispersed from fruits borne 3-4 m (D. excelsa) or 1-2 m (T. speciosissima) above the ground. Most seeds were found within 5 m (D. excelsa) or 3 m (T. speciosissima) of parent plants. The primary seed shadow of both species was a poor predictor of the distribution of seedlings, with more seedlings occurring further from the adults than expected from the distribution of seeds. Seed loss to predators was high in both species in exclusion experiments where mammals had access to clumps of seeds (77-88%). It was variable and generally lower (8-65%) in experiments where seeds were not locally clumped. However, for T. speciosissima, at one site, some 65% of seeds were lost to mammals and invertebrates in these latter experiments. At this site, these losses appeared to influence subsequent recruitment levels, as very low seedling densities were observed. For both species, germination of seedlings first occurred some 2.5-3 years after the passage of the fire. The percentage of seeds produced to seedlings successfully established was low in D. excelsa (2-3%) and more variable across sites and years in T. speciosissima (0-18%). Resultant post-fire seedling densities of D. excelsa (two sites) and T. speciosissima at one site were similar, but they were much lower at the T. speciosissima site that had high levels of seed predation. Both D. excelsa and T. speciosissima are amongst the slowest woody resprouting species to recruit seedlings after fire in south-eastern Australia and lag years behind species with soil or canopy seed banks.

J	Bebawi, FF; Campbell, SD				Bebawi, FF; Campbell, SD			Impact of early and late dry-season fires on plant mortality and seed banks within riparian and subriparian infestations of rubber vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												This study compared the efficacy of first and second fires applied during the early (August-September) and late dry season (October-November) on mortality of riparian (climbing) and subriparian (freestanding) infestations of rubber vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora R. Br.). The impact of fire treatments on germinable seed banks of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species was also determined. Individually, fire season, habitat type and number of fires significantly affected mortality of rubber vine plants. Late-season fires promoted higher mortality of rubber vine (96%) than early season fires (77%), with rubber vine in subriparian habitats more susceptible (90% mortality) than that growing in riparian areas (68% mortality). On average, fire mortality increased from 32% after the first fire up to 86% following 2 fires. Sensitivity of juvenile, mature, and old rubber vine plants to fire was in the order of mature>juvenile>old. Early fires significantly reduced seed banks of monocotyledonous plants, particularly in riparian habitats. Late fires significantly reduced seed banks of both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. No rubber vine seeds were detected in the germinable seed bank of either burnt or unburnt plots.

J	Lamoureaux, S; Bourdot, G				Lamoureaux, S; Bourdot, G			Fruit viability on grubbed Nassella trichotoma (Nees) tussocks	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												An experiment was conducted to determine the influence of time of grubbing in the late spring-early summer, panicle developmental stage at grubbing, and the presence or absence of roots on grubbed plants, on the initial and post-senescent viability of fruits of Nassella trichotoma in North Canterbury, New Zealand. The percentage of fruits viable, following desiccation of panicles removed from plants grubbed in the field, increased from 1% for panicles just beginning to emerge from the leaf sheath, to 49% for panicles fully extended at the time of grubbing. Similarly, as grubbing date was delayed from late November (late spring) until late December (early summer), fruit viability increased from 0.3 to 47%. Overall, 36% of the fruits were viable on panicles at the time of grubbing, increasing slightly to 47 and 44%, respectively, after a period of desiccation with and without the panicles being attached to the grubbed plant's root system. It was concluded that if recruitment of fruits of N. trichotoma to the soil seed bank is to be prevented in North Canterbury, plants must be uprooted before panicle extension. Delaying grubbing to when panicles are fully extended, while possibly enabling a higher percentage of plants to be detected and therefore destroyed, carries with it a high risk of permitting the recruitment of viable fruits to the soil seed bank.

J	Bebawi, FF; Campbell, SD				Bebawi, FF; Campbell, SD			Effects of fire on germination and viability of bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia) seeds	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												If treatments imposed to control exotic plants also have a deleterious impact on their residual seed bank, the duration and extent of follow-up control may be reduced. Fire is one such technique that has this ability, particularly if seeds are located on or close to the soil surface. Three studies were undertaken in a riparian habitat in the dry tropics of northern Queensland to quantify the effects of spring burning on the seed bank of the exotic weed bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia). The first determined the distribution of seeds within the vertical profile of the trial site. The other 2 studies were experiments that quantified the effects of fire on germination and viability of both dispersed bellyache bush seeds and seeds held in mature capsules. Dispersed seeds of 2 types (intact and ant-discarded) were placed at the following 6 positions in the vertical profile of bellyache bush infestations: 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 cm depth below ground, on bare ground, and below fuel. Seeds held in capsules were located at random on the crown of bellyache bush plants. For both experiments, comparisons of burnt plots were made with unburnt controls. Fire was imposed in spring (September); the season in which burning for weed control in northern Queensland generally occurs. While maximum fire temperatures averaged 590 +/- 46degreesC, the temperatures that seeds or capsules were exposed to depended on their location within the vertical profile, with temperatures decreasing in the following order: below fuel > crown of bellyache bush > 1 cm > 0.5 cm > bare ground > 2 cm > 4 cm below ground. There were negative correlations between seed germination and peak fire temperature and between viability and peak fire temperature. Seed viability was nil for seed under fuel but >80% for seeds placed on bare ground or greater than or equal to2 cm below ground. Fire reduced germination and viability of seeds held in capsules by 31 and 35%, respectively, when compared with unburnt seeds. While ant-discarded seeds generally had a higher germinability than intact seeds, they were more susceptible to fire. This may be attributed to loss of the external protective barrier of the seed coat (exotegmen) caused by the feeding of ants. Bellyache bush seeds were recorded across all soil depths, reaching a peak of 3.8 million seeds per hectare at 1-5 cm soil depth. These results suggest that while bellyache bush seeds are susceptible to fire, many are buried beyond the reach of lethal temperatures. Therefore, viable seeds will be available for post-fire recruitment and other measures, such as chemical control, may need to be employed in conjunction with burning.

We used a PCR-based method (Intersimple Sequence Repeats) to quantify genetic variation in four reintroduced populations of Abronia umbellata ssp. breviflora, an annual forb native to the Pacific Coast that is state-listed endangered in Oregon. The reintroduced populations ranged in size from 18 to 4, 111 individuals in the year they were sampled. Genetic variation was also quantified in the natural population that served as the seed source for the reintroduction efforts. A total of 77 loci (bands) was observed using two ISSR primers, providing 65 polymorphic loci. A significant, positive regression was observed between the log of population size for the five populations and genetic variation when measured as percent polymorphic loci (P), expected heterozygosity (H-e), and with a dissimilarity index (1 - S-xy) based on band sharing. Two of the reintroduced populations maintained approximately 90% of the genetic variation we observed in the source population. Based on these results, we predict that reintroduced populations of A. u. ssp. breviflora that have at least 1, 000 individuals should maintain 90% of the genetic variation of the source population.				kaye, thomas/D-7859-2012	McGlaughlin, Mitchell/0000-0001-6189-2450												1566-0621						2002	3	4					411	420		10.1023/A:1020507416654							WOS:000178529700006

Parasitism by this piercing-sucking insect reduced the resources for the future seedling and affected seed physiology, including dormancy and exudation of allelochemicals of imbibing weds. Seeds attacked by H. tarsatus had reduced mass (20-80% reduction. depending on intensity of attack). Heavy attack led to irregular shape, changes in seed coat color. and disruption of dormancy. While intact seeds did not imbibe during a 48-hour test in water. a high proportion of bug-attacked seeds germinated. from 51 to 94%, depending on intensity of attack. Attack by H. tarsatus also affected accumulation of allelochemicals and their exudation by imbibing seeds, There were no quantitative differences in proanthocyanidin content between exudate, of attacked and unattacked seeds. In contrast. concentrations of total condensed tannins were higher in exudates of attacked seeds on the third day of imbibition. This change may reflect induction of chemical defenses by herbivore attack and/or a mechanism to restore seed coat impermeability. Although difficult to quantify, effects of sublethal attack by this sucking insect on the seed bank are likely to have important consequences for the demography of S. drummondii, a short-lived perennial in habitats where conditions for recruitment are variable and unpredictable among years.

J	Lortie, CJ; Turkington, R				Lortie, CJ; Turkington, R			The facilitative effects by seeds and seedlings on emergence from the seed bank of a desert annual plant community	ECOSCIENCE												Facilitation is important in structuring plant communities in harsh environments although most recent studies have been descriptive and focussed on adult plant interactions. Here, we test for facilitative effects by seeds and seedlings of Erodium laciniatum and Erucaria pinnata on the emergence and subsequent community structure from an annual plant seed bank in the Negev desert, Israel. We specifically test whether (i) the addition of seeds or seedlings of these species increases emergence from the seed bank. (ii) the addition of seeds or seedlings increases final plant community performance, and (iii) the effect of each species is specific. Both Erodium seeds and seedlings acted as a benefactor for the rest of the plant community by increasing density and biomass of the plants germinated from the seed bank. Erodium seedlings, had a stronger positive effect than seeds early in the growing season. Erucaria (seeds and seedlings) did not influence the plant Community. This suggests that species interactions are specific and that interactions between seeds and between plants and seeds can influence community structure.				lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014	lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023												1195-6860						2002	9	1					106	111		10.1080/11956860.2002.11682696							WOS:000174976900013						
J	Lortie, CJ; Turkington, R				Lortie, CJ; Turkington, R			The small-scale spatiotemporal pattern of a seed bank in the Negev Desert, Israel	ECOSCIENCE												Seed banks are generally considered clumped, but few studies document the small-scale horizontal spatial pattern of seeds. We measured the horizontal spatial pattern of a seed bank for an annual plant community (ca 20 species) in the Negev desert, Israel, using geostatistics to test whether the seed bank changes over time or along a natural stress gradient. We also tested for differences between large and small seeds. Seed was collected at three different times and at two locations (high and low stress) on a semi-stabilized sand dune using contiguous 3-cm cores Using sernivariograms to measure the degree of aggregation, we detected a clump size of 85 cm(2) that was consistent across time, stress level, and seed size. This consistency could be extremely important if small-scale clumping of seed banks generates specific associations between species of seeds and the emergent plants Further work with seed bank-based communities would strongly benefit from measures of spatial pattern and species associations of seeds.				lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014	lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023												1195-6860						2002	9	3					407	413		10.1080/11956860.2002.11682728							WOS:000178212500015						
J	Blaney, CS; Kotanen, PM				Blaney, CS; Kotanen, PM			Persistence in the seed bank: The effects of fungi and invertebrates on seeds of native and exotic plants	ECOSCIENCE												Fungal pathogens and invertebrate seed predators both may limit the establishment of persistent seed banks. Exotic plants may be less subject to attack by these natural enemies than are native species; if so, this may provide exotics with an important advantage by reducing seed mortality and enhancing the persistence of colonizing populations. We investigated this idea with a field experiment in which we used fungicides and screening to protect seeds of 39 native and exotic old field plants. The recovery of germinable seeds was improved by fungicide additions, but not by the exclusion of macroinvertebrates. The effects of fungicide varied among species and sampling dates, but the recovery of natives was not consistently improved more than the recovery of exotics. These results suggest that soil fungi have important impacts on the seed banks of many species, but that exotics are not consistently more resistant than natives to attacks by either fungal pathogens or invertebrates. Consequently, it is unlikely that the majority of invaders benefit from reduced pest loads at the seed bank stage.

Regeneration of plant community and changes in the soil was studied. Studies of natural regeneration of Pinus pinaster in the field and density of Pinus seeds in the soil seed bank were carried out. Very high natural regeneration of Pinus pinaster was observed, with a mean of 33.23 seedlings/m(2) being found in the spring following the fire and after the first rains. However, the number decreased to 9.68 seedlings/ m(2) one year after the fire and 8.86 seedlings/m(2) two years after it. This number was sufficiently high to ensure natural regeneration of this species. Density of Pinus pinaster seeds in the soil seed bank were 150 seeds/m(2) in the samples collected in the control area and 200 seed s/m(2) in the burned areas. The great heterogeneity of the fire was reflected in its effects on soil characteristics.

Since spatial heterogeneity may be important in determining post-disturbance community structure and function, a main question to address concerns the resilience of plant spatial pattern to fire disturbance. In this work, vegetation spatial data from Aleppo pine forests of Southeast Spain were analysed. Post-fire plant cover showed a clumped spatial distribution, which may be related to the locations of the burned pine trees. Point pattern analysis revealed a strong resilience of plant pattern after disturbance. Plant-soil interactions may explain the post-fire spatial pattern of plant cover. The results indicate that Aleppo pine forests may promote resource-island patterns that persist after fire disturbance and determine post-fire recovery.				Vallejo, V.

Fires have been described as perturbations that produce the loss of many seeds, decreasing the vegetation response. However, some studies have observed an increase in germination with fire intensity. In our study the effect of temperature on the soil profile at soil depths of 1, 3 and 5 cm was investigated in relation to the germination of Ulex parviflorus seeds buried at these same depths. Experimental burning was carried out in 12-year-old Ulex parviflorus shrublands. The results of this study show that the largest germination was registered in the seeds buried at the I cm depth and that germination maintained an inverse relation with soil depth. Ulex parviflorus germination was low at points with low intensities of heat. There is also a discussion about the interaction between heat intensity and durability in relation to the highest germination of this species.

Although many studies have documented its impact on vegetation, none have focused on the influence of spatial characteristics of the burned area on plant regeneration. In particular, the distance from unburned areas must be considered because (i) it represents the distance that seeds must cover to recolonize the burned area, and (ii) it is also related to the intensity of fire. At four sites, burned in 1998 or in 2000 in the Aix-Marseille region, we examined the effects of spatial characteristics of the fire on the post-fire dynamics. We sampled aboveground vegetation, seed rain, seed bank, and soil, along several transects from unburned/burned limit to the center of burned areas. The present paper describes the vegetation gradients, both at a taxonomic and at a functional level, along the transects. We show that spatial characteristics of the burned areas, specifically the distance from unburned areas, through the distribution of the seed rain and through variation of soil characteristics, may explain certain aspects of the post-fire dynamics.																			90-5782-116-8				2002							303	314									WOS:000177912100026

In this wetland, artificial disturbances (mowing) and natural disturbances (cattle, roebucks, boars, voles...) are very frequent. In order to mime these natural disturbances, experimental disturbances were generated in March 1996 after the end of the winter flooding and the seedlings counted three months later. The seed bank, the undisturbed vegetation and seedlings emerging in disturbed quadrats were sampled. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) of the undisturbed quadrats, disturbed quadrats and seed bank samples showed significant differences of species composition. Similarity between seed bank and undisturbed aboveground vegetation was low and not very different between grassland and oldfield. Very few seedlings emerged in undisturbed vegetation both in grassland and oldfield, which indicates the importance of gaps for seed bank expression. The great majority of seedlings emerging after experimental disturbances were mainly recruited from the soil seed bank. This result contrasts with other studies where the seed bank contributed very little to the seedling flora and vegetative regrowth clearly predominated recolonisation after disturbances. In the seed bank, few species lost after succession from grassland to oldfield vegetation were still present as seeds in the soil, but in most cases, species lost were not recorded in the seed bank. The two hypotheses about changes in the seed bank during secondary succession, predicting decrease in species richness or species diversity and seed density were only confirmed for seed density parameter.

J	Gutterman, Y				Gutterman, Y			Minireview: Survival adaptations and strategies of annuals occurring in the Judean and Negev Deserts of Israel	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The more extreme the desert and the smaller and more unpredictable the annual precipitation and its distribution during the rainy season, the more important the sets of complementary adaptations and survival strategies during the different stages of the life cycle of winter annuals. The history of each seed, from seed development and maturation to seed wetting and germination, may affect the phenotypic plasticity of seed germination. This may be affected by environmental factors such as day length during seed development and maturation. Also involved are maternal influences and the influence of the position of the seeds in the plant inflorescences or capsules, even 30 years after seed maturation. Post-maturation primary or secondary seed dormancy mechanisms and strategies may also be involved. In addition, environmental factors during seed wetting, such as the amount of rain, relative humidity, temperature, light, soil salinity, and germination inhibitors, may play a role in the regulation of the percentage of seeds that are ready to germinate after a particular rainfall. Adaptations and survival strategies in desert annual plant species have also evolved during the stages of seedling development, flowering, and seed dispersal. These include escape or protection mechanisms and strategies of seed dispersal that may decrease seed collection and contribute to the large and long-lasting living aerial or soil seed banks of the species. Many of the common plant species occurring in the Negev, where the average annual rainfall gradient ranges from 25 to 200 mm, produce large quantities of tiny, dust-like seeds. These plant species have developed escape strategies of seed dispersal as well as opportunistic strategies of seed germination. In contrast, other plant species that produce relatively larger seeds in much smaller quantities, have protection strategies of seed dispersal as well as cautious germination strategies. All these adaptations of mechanisms and strategies may affect the chances of these plant species to survive in their desert locations and habitats. The greater the fitness of a plant genotype to its habitat, the greater the chance for the seeds that germinate to complete their life cycles by producing new mature seeds and retaining a large and long-lasting seed bank in such and areas and extreme deserts.																	0792-9978						2002	50	3					165	175		10.1092/CD1L-0NCF-G2JC-1MHV							WOS:000178460400001						
J	Geertsema, W; Opdam, P; Kropff, MJ				Geertsema, W; Opdam, P; Kropff, MJ			Plant strategies and agricultural landscapes: survival in spatially and temporally fragmented habitat	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												In agricultural landscapes many plant species are limited to the network of landscape elements that are not used for agricultural production. This habitat is fragmented in space and time due to anthropogenic, biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, plant populations are spatially sub-divided and their persistence might be dependent on the spatial dynamics in the network of local populations. Dispersal characteristics and seed bank persistence are main determinants of colonization ability which in turn is a key determinant of metapopulation viability. We propose a conceptual model that relates plant population dynamics to habitat quality, configuration and dynamics. In this model, the habitat is arranged as a network of suitable and unsuitable patches, and the distribution of the patches is assumed to be dynamic in time. Based on dispersal and seed bank characteristics four plant strategies are distinguished: species having either long (> 100 m) or short (< 100 m) distance dispersal and either a long (> 5 yr) or short (< 5 yr) term persistent seed bank. We expect that species with contrasting strategies have different survival probabilities in landscapes with contrasting habitat arrangement in space and time. We found few empirical studies for testing the hypotheses based on the model. Therefore the relation between landscapes and plant survival needs to be further explored, especially the quantitative aspects.

Soil was placed in open topped columns of differing heights and the number of seedlings that emerged were counted. A total of 77 different weed species emerged but most were in small numbers. Four summer broadleaf weeds, black nightshade (Solanum nigrum), fathen (Chenopodium album), spurrey (Spergula arvensis) and willow weed (Polygonum persicaria), showed little restriction and emerged freely from depths up to 50 mm. Of the grasses, summer grass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and annual poa (Poa annua) were clearly constrained at depths greater than 20 mm while smooth witchgrass (Panicum dichotomiflorum) was not. Of the other broadleaf weeds, waxweed (Hydrocotyle sp.) and Lotus sp. were constrained at depths greater than 30 mm while two small-seeded species, cudweed (Gnaphalium sp.) and toad rush (Juncus bufonius) did not emerge from depths greater than 10 mm.																	1175-9003						2002	55						213	217		10.30843/nzpp.2002.55.3892							WOS:000177719800042

The seedling emergence technique was employed to determine the species composition and density of the soil seed bank of six sites ranging in fire severity from wooded grassland with frequent fires over woodland with intermediate fire frequency to forest with absence of fires. Species composition and density of seeds in the soil were compared between seasons, depths and sites with different types of standing vegetation. Fourteen plant species were recorded in the soil seed bank from the grassland and woodland sites and 6 from the dry forests; 60 % of the taxa in the soil seed bank were annuals and 40 % were perennials. The soil seed banks were largely dominated by graminoids and 48-97 % of the soil seed bank in the grasslands and woodlands was of a single grass species, Hyparrhenia confinis, which was absent from the dry forests. The soil seed pools ranged from less than 100 to 4700 seeds per m(2) depending upon the season. The soil seed bank of graminoids was nearly empty after the onset of the rainy season whereas seeds of broadleaved herbs and woody species able to germinate were still found after this time. Floristic composition, representation of life forms and density of seeds in soil did not correspond closely with that of the standing vegetation, but within graminoids there was a strong similarity between the soil seed bank and the standing vegetation. The current fire regime of Ethiopian savanna woodlands appears to maintain the dominance of graminoids over broadleaved herbs and woody plants both as seeds in the soil and in the standing vegetation.

The populations studied come from islands and shores created in the 1880s by a drop in the water table of a Swedish lake and from old parts of a large island and of the mainland. The population age is known from five vegetation analyses over a century. We have also analysed the genetic composition of M trinervia derived from seeds in the soil. Mainland populations had a higher genetic diversity than island populations that were little differentiated and differed genetically from the mainland populations. There was no temporal trend in the distribution of genetic variation on the new islands. The presence of alleles in the extant populations was associated with the proportion of that allele in the seed bank, indicating a main recruitment from the seed bank and not by repeated immigrations. We suggest that some of the new islands were colonised by a few early founders from the mainland. Later colonisation has occurred between adjacent islands, which preserves the founder effect and could explain the uniform, low genetic variation in the island populations.

J	Cummings, CL; Alexander, HM				Cummings, CL; Alexander, HM			Population ecology of wild sunflowers: effects of seed density and post-dispersal vertebrate seed predators	OECOLOGIA												Assessing the effects of seed density on the population dynamics of wild plant species with crop relatives will be vital in determining the potential effects of introducing traits into wild populations as a result of crop-to-wild gene flow. We examined experimental sunflower (Helianthus annuus) patches in eastern Kansas to determine the effects of seed density and predation on seedling recruitment and seed production in the next generation. High seed density treatment plots had significantly more seedlings and adult plants than did low seed density treatment plots. Overwinter vertebrate seed predator exclusion treatments resulted in increases in plant density compared to plots in which vertebrates were not excluded. Control patches (no seeds added) contained virtually no plants. Head production and estimated total seed production for a patch were not statistically different among treatments (excluding control plots). Although initial seed density and vertebrate post-dispersal seed predation do appear to have effects on seedling recruitment. neither appear to be limiting seed production of competing adult plants. Therefore, variation in seed densities (over the range examined) may have limited effects on local population dynamics. It is important to note that the choice of seed densities may affect the results obtained: the seed densities used in this study may, in retrospect. be higher than in the small roadside populations typical in eastern Kansas. yet other natural sites have much larger densities. Further. the effects of increased seed density at a local site may have other important effects such as altering metapopulation dynamics through increased long-distance dispersal or increased local seed bank size.																	0029-8549					JAN	2002	130	2					274	280		10.1007/s004420100806							WOS:000173912100014	28547151

The objective of this research was to investigate the suppression of viable seed production by red rice, with the intent of reducing its seed bank in the soil. With this purpose, field and laboratory experiments were carried out during the growing seasons of 1997/98 and 1998/99, utilizing the non-selective herbicides glyphosate, glufosinate, and paraquat, applied at two times and at two rates, and the growth regulator maleic hydrazide, tested at two times. A control without chemical treatment was included. The rice cultivar tested was IRGA-416, grown in the presence of a high red rice infestation. The chemicals were applied at physiological maturity of cultivated rice. Variables evaluated in red rice were: numbers of stems without panicle, with normal panicles, and sterile ones, spikelets sterility, seed production, seed weight and germination. The herbicides glyphosate, glufosinate, and paraquat can be used selectively in order to suppress red rice seed production when applied during maturity phase of cultivated rice. Adoption of this technology depends on existence of difference between maturity of cultivated and weedy rice, through use of early maturity rice cultivars.																	0100-204X					JAN	2002	37	1					57	65		10.1590/S0100-204X2002000100008							WOS:000173492800008

The allozyme data support, to a large extent, population genetic predictions for genetic divergence. The genetic diversity parameters studied demonstrated that the aboveground population of E. algibicum is genetically less diverse than E. ibericum and E. barnadesii. Genetic identity between E. ibericum and E. barnadesii was very high, decreasing to levels considered typical for co-generic taxa between E. ibericum and E. algibicum. With regard to the soil seed bank of E. algibicum, this showed higher genetic variability than the adult population, greater extent or homozygosity, and significantly different allele frequencies at some loci. Despite the small population size, E. algibicum population maintains relatively high levels of genetic diversity both at adult and seed bank stages.

Wats.) Kuntze is a C-3 halophytic plant that grows in the and environment of Western United States where halomorphic soil induces extreme osmotic stress with erratic and low precipitation during the growing period. This perennial species grows well in soils with 6% NaCl. It is one of the most salt tolerant plants in salt playas of the Great Basin in the Western United States. During the hot summer months the salt accumulates in high concentrations on the surface which prevents most plants except A. occidentalis from growing. The highest seed germination was obtained at a thermoperiod of high night (25degreesC) and high day (35degreesC). Most of the seeds were salt tolerant and some could still germinate at 600 mM NaCl. The seeds could recover from high salinity when placed in low salinity solutions. Several compounds, fusicoccin, ethephon, nitrate, thiourea, kinetin and gibberellic acid counteracted the inhibition produced by high salinity. Seeds germinated better in the light and at higher temperatures. Some of the growth regulating compounds could alleviate the effect of darkness. Best growth of A. occidentalis was obtained at a density of 1975 plants per m(2) at 600 mM NaCl. Na+ and Cl- contributed substantially to the dry mass of the plant. Net photosynthesis increased at lower salinity (200 nm NaCl). The pH of the soil in the salt playa of the Great Basin ranged from 7.3 to 8.3. The salinity ranged from 29 to 146 dSm(-1) and soil moisture ranged from 9.2% to drought conditions. When salinity levels become lower, dry matter production increases and tissue water contents decrease. Allenrolfea occidentalis had greater growth and biomass production under saline conditions. Na+ and Cl- ions were accumulated in plant tissue in much greater amounts than K+, Ca++ and Mg++. Good seed production occurred with A. occidentalis and a seed bank was present in the upper layers of the saline soil. The seed bank played a role in maintaining the population of A. occidentalis. Survival of young seedlings was dependant upon the soil moisture level during the hot summer period. The oil content of the seeds of A. occidentalis was about 20%. The fatty acids in the oil was 85% saturated and 15% unsaturated fatty acids. The biomass of A. occidentalis is a potential feed for animals. The wood biomass could be pressed into firewood and particle-board material. The use of halophytes in high salinity soil becomes an appealing choice to obtain some productivity from the land. Many factors are involved in selecting a useful halophyte such as how much salinity can the plant tolerate, can seeds germinate in saline conditions, is there a product of value from the plant? The Great Basin area in the Western United States has no major drainage system and the runoff water tends to accumulate and evaporate in the valleys. Over a long period of time, the soil has become saline with certain areas developing into salt playa. This has provided selection pressure for the development of salt tolerant plants. We have evaluated one of these Great Basin halophytes.

J	De Villiers, AJ; Van Rooyen, MW; Theron, GK				De Villiers, AJ; Van Rooyen, MW; Theron, GK			Germination strategies of Strandveld Succulent Karoo plant species for revegetation purposes: II. dormancy-breaking treatments	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The requirement of an after-ripening period was investigated in 27 plant species from the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, South Africa. The seeds of seven species were examined for the presence of endogenous germination patterns, while the effect of other dormancy-breaking treatments on germination percentage and rate was examined in ten species. The germination of 14 species (including annuals and perennials) was promoted by a summer after-ripening period, indicating that the seeds of these species are characterised by non-deep physiological dormancy. Strong evidence for the presence of a clear endogenous germination rhythm in the species investigated was lacking. Chemical or mechanical scarification of the seeds of several annual and perennial species improved germination percentage and rate. The germination of two annual species increased after a hydration/dehydration treatment, or when seeds were given a cold or a heat+cold treatment. Contrary to what was expected, a heat treatment did not improve germination and only one out of ten species showed an increase in germination percentage after a cold+heat treatment. Leaching improved the germination of only one species. In areas where topsoil replacement and sowing have been completed, irrigation should not be applied prior to the start of the rainy season, as the seeds of most: species present in the seed bank will be in a state of dormancy or conditional dormancy.				van Rooyen, Margaretha W/K-3559-2019													0251-0952						2002	30	1					35	49									WOS:000174274700004						
J	Hanson, DE; Ball, DA; Mallory-Smith, CA				Hanson, DE; Ball, DA; Mallory-Smith, CA			Herbicide resistance in jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica): Simulated responses to agronomic practices	WEED TECHNOLOGY												A population model was constructed to simulate the development of imazamox-resistant jointed goatgrass (AEGCY) in imazamox-resistant (Clearfield(R)) wheat. The model computed changes in the surface and in the buried AEGCY seed banks for both resistant and susceptible biotypes. Simulations started with an initial density of 1,000 susceptible and zero resistant seeds/m(2) in each seed bank. Simulation of continuous, no-till Clearfield wheat production resulted in rapid development of resistant AEGCY without hybridization with wheat and in extremely rapid resistance development with hybridization. In less than 10 yr, the resistant population was growing exponentially in both simulations. Adding a fallow year with tillage into the simulated rotation did not substantially slow down the appearance of resistance but did delay the rate of resistant population increase by several orders of magnitude over 10 yr. Alternating Clearfield and a nonresistant winter wheat in combination with fallowing prevented the establishment of a significant resistant AEGCY population and prevented the susceptible seed population from increasing exponentially. These projections suggest that imazamox-resistant wheat can be a tool for managing AEGCY populations especially if combined with rotations that include fallow and crops other than Clearfield winter wheat.																	0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2002	16	1					156	163		10.1614/0890-037X(2002)016[0156:HRIJGA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000176901100024

Seventy-four percent of the seeds in a disturbed bunchgrass community were found in crevices bordering cryptogamic crust polygons. In a sagebrush/bunchgrass community, 89% of the seeds were found in crevices. In a disturbed bunchgrass community, Bromus tectorum seeds were found in both the seed bank and aboveground vegetation communities. Bromus tectorum seeds were located in the seed bank of a sagebrush/bunchgrass community, although it bad a minor presence in the aboveground community. Seeds of Artemisia tridentata Nutt, were not found in either the bunchgrass or sagebrush/bunchgrass communities. The high number of seeds found in crevices bordering the cryptogamic crust suggests that crevices play a role in determining the small-scale distributional pattern of shrub-steppe plants at the Fitzner-Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology Reserve.

Germinated plants were selfed to produce individuals of the F1-generation for analysis. We tested whether reproductive and genetic traits of individuals differed among four land-use regimes. As reproductive traits we analysed seed weight (of 1000 seeds) and germination rate at different temperatures. Genetic diversity was estimated using AFLP markers and the intraspecific population structure was analysed by microsatellites. We found differences between individuals originating from habitats of the different land-use regimes with respect to reproductive and genetic traits. Especially populations from intensively used crop fields differed from those of the other habitats studied. The former were characterized by lower seed weight, a higher germination rate and a lower heterozygosity. Our results indicate that land-use regimes may be important driving forces with an impact on reproductive traits as well as on genetic diversity of A. thaliana.																	0340-8159						2002					18		57	66									WOS:000202836900004

Seeds of conventionally bred oilseed rape and their herbicide-tolerant transgenic counterparts show similar persistence in the soil under agricultural relevant conditions. The transgenic, herbicide-tolerant cultivar Modul was absent in the soil of former release sites after 6 years. The emergence rates of seedlings of the transgenic lines Modul and Lilly depend highly on the cultivation method, similarly to their non-transgenic counterparts, as known from literature. In the curry-comb variant the amount of seedlings showed an emergence rate of about 57 % of sown seeds. Ploughing diminished the rate of emergence, whereas curry-comb treatment gave the highest rates. The cultivar Lilly showed a higher emergence rate under the plough and cultivator treatment, than Modul, but a lower under curry-comb cultivation. Adequate cultivation and harvesting practices together seem to be tools for reducing the number of seeds persisting in the soil and therefore the probability of dispersal of transgenic seeds over time.																	0340-8159						2002					18		255	260									WOS:000202836900031

The aim of this investigation is to detect relations between the soil seed bank and actual weed vegetation. Such information could be a helpful tool in site specific weed management. On the FAM (Munich Research Association for Agricultural Ecosystems Research) station in Southern Bavaria investigations in the seed bank and seedling emergence were carried out in experimental plots with different tillage systems. The soil seed bank, plant density and species composition of weeds were influenced by crop rotation and tillage system. In winter wheat the experimental plots showed emergence rates from 1 % up to 14.6 % of viable seeds depending on tillage system and crop rotation. Perennial and wind dispersed species were promoted by the minimum tillage system. Annual dicotyledonous weed species were found more frequent under ploughed soils.

The aim of the presented investigations was to estimate numbers of diaspores contained in the transported soil and transport distances. Tillage experiments with five different implements (plough, heavy cultivator, rotary harrow, rotary tiller, curry comb) and a tractor were carried out. Under moist conditions, and when using implements which carry Much soil, numbers of transported seeds increased linearly with soil mass; species numbers increased to a maximum value. Under dry conditions insufficient soil was collected, especially by implements with little Surface area, to come close to a maximum value. The species in the adhering soil had a lower average seed weight than the species of the above ground vegetation on the experimental plots. Examples which took seed bank data and fanning operations into consideration showed that between two fields which are 1.7 km apart a transport of approximately 3,500 seeds could potentially occur during one season.

Two possible explanations for the variability in response to light during soil tillage are the seasonal changes of dormancy and light requirements of seeds. The objective of this field trial was to evaluate the point of time, where nighttime tillage is most efficient in reducing weed germination and emergence of annual weed species. Nighttime tillage was conducted with a rotary harrow. Soil tillage was performed 10 times during November 2000 and October 2001 at the same place. In 4 out of 10 times nighttime tillage resulted in lower seedling emergence compared to daytime tillage, whereas 6 times nighttime tillage failed to reduce weed emergence, although soil seed bank was dominated of light-requiring weed species like Chenopodium album, Matricaria recutita, and Stellaria media. Highest reduction of weed seedling emergence due to nighttime tillage was achieved, when soil tillage was performed beginning of February 2001 (-27.7 %). On the other hand, when nighttime tillage was conducted middle of October 2001, more weeds emerged in nighttime tilled plots than in daytime tilled plots (+ 22.3 %). In both cases Aphanes arvensis and different grasses (mostly Apera spica-venti) were the most abundant weed species, contributing to a very high degree to the final results. It can be concluded, that efficiency of nighttime tillage depends on seasonal changes in light sensitivity of seeds during the season.																	0340-8159						2002					18		639	646									WOS:000202836900078						
J	Zhao, WZ; Liu, ZM; Chang, XL				Zhao, WZ; Liu, ZM; Chang, XL			Influence of grazing intensity on seed bank of a sandy grassland in Horqin Steppe of China	ANNALS OF ARID ZONE												It is well known that grazing influences the quantity and quality of grassland seed banks, and that the magnitude of influence depends on the grazing intensity and the bioclimate zone in which the grassland is located. However, very little is known about seed bank dynamics under different grazing intensities in a sandy grassland of Horqin Steppe. In this study four grazing intensity treatments, i.e., control (ungrazed, CK), light grazing (2 sheep unit ha(-1), L), moderate grazing (4 sheep unit ha(-1), M), and heavy grazing (6 sheep unit ha(-1), H), were imposed on a sandy range site. The results showed that: (i) with the increase of grazing intensity, the number of plant species in the seed bank decreased, but the percentage of annual species increased; (ii) the number of seed bank under both light grazing and moderate grazing tended to increase, but under heavy grazing it tended to decrease; (iii) annual species dominated the seed bank, and with increased grazing intensity, the percentage of the number of seeds of annual species decreased, but that. of leguminous plants increased; (iv) under the ungrazed and light grazing conditions the seed density in soil showed a significant correlation with the corresponding plant frequency in the vegetation, whereas under moderate and heavy grazing conditions such correlation was poor.																	0570-1791					DEC	2001	40	4					397	404									WOS:000183353000001						
J	Chambers, JC; Linnerooth, AR				Chambers, JC; Linnerooth, AR			Restoring riparian meadows currently dominated by Artemisia using alternative state concepts - the establishment component	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												We evaluated the potential fur restoring riparian grass and sedge meadows currently dominated by Artemisia tridentata var. tridentata with an experiment in which we burned sites with low, intermediate, and high water tables, i.e., dry, intermediate, and wet sites. To define the alternative states and thresholds for these ecosystems, we examined burning and water table effects on both abiotic variables and establishment of grasses adapted to relatively high (Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia), intermediate (Leymus triticoides), or low (L. cinercus) water tables. Wet sites had lower soil temperatures and higher soil water contents than dry sites. Burning increased soil temperatures on all sites. Undershrub microsites on control plots had the lowest temperatures, while former undershrub microsites on burn plots had the highest temperatures. Surface soil water was low on burn plots early in the growing season due to desiccation, but higher at deeper depth,, after active plant growth began. Emergence was generally greater on wet sites, but survival was microsite- and species-specific. Undershrub microsites on control plots facilitated emergence and first-year survival, but seedlings that survived initially harsh conditions on burn plots had similar numbers alive at the end. In general, favorable environments and establishment of species adapted to mesic conditions indicate that wet sites represent an alternative state of the naturally occurring dry meadow ecosystem type, and can be restored to grass and sedge meadows. Harsh environments and lack of establishment of species adapted to mesic conditions indicate that dry sites have crossed a threshold and may represent a new ecosystem type. Understory vegetation and seed banks on dry sites have been depleted, arid restoration will require burning and reseeding with species adapted to more xeric conditions.																	1402-2001					DEC	2001	4	2					157	166		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00484.x							WOS:000174291000001						
J	McDonald, AW				McDonald, AW			Succession during the re-creation of a flood-meadow 1985-1999	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												The study site, Somerford. Mead, is located on the river Thames floodplain and was a species-rich flood-meadow in the 1950s, In the 1960s and 1970s it was subjected to intensive grassland management with regular NPK additions and occasional herbicide treatment. In 1981 Somerford Mead was ploughed for the first time and converted to arable land. Seeds of an Alopecurus pratensis-Sanguisorba officinalis flood-meadow community MG4; Rodwell 1992) were sown onto prepared soil in the autumn of 1986, and botanical records were made from 1985 to 1999. From 1989 to 1999, three replicates of three treatments: cow-grazing, sheep-grazing and no-grazing were introduced after hay-cutting. Analysis successfully separated the establishment phase from the experimental phase and showed a significant difference between the grazed and ungrazed treatments. Abiotic and biotic factors which might contribute to successional trends are discussed. A convoluted pattern for each treatment could be attributed in part to intrinsic 'cycles' of perennial hemicryptophytes behaving as short-lived species and in part to the percentage frequency of many species which was reduced in 1990 and 1995/1996, years of drought. After the initial inoculation of MG4 seed and the disappearance of arable therophytes, recruitment of new species was very slow. Coefficients for Somerford Mead matched against MG4 (Rodwell 1992) produced an equilibrium within three years. It subsequently fluctuated over a 10-yr period well below the level of Oxey Mead, the donor site. Land managers should ensure that their proposed site has the right soils and hydrology for MG4 grassland and that traditional management of hay-cutting and aftermath grazing is practised. Only one cut a year in July could lead to a reduction in percentage frequency of most species except Arrhenatherum clatius.																	1402-2001					DEC	2001	4	2					167	176		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00485.x							WOS:000174291000002

The magnesium salt of imazapyr was optimal for seed dressings (drenching, priming, and coating), for preventing field damage from parasitic Striga hermonthica (witchweed) in three seasons. Striga emerged on untreated maize from 6 to 12 weeks after planting. There was almost no Striga emergence for 3 months on imazapyr-dressed homozygous ALS-R 3245IR maize seeds. Occasional Striga that emerged and flowered formed no seed by harvest. Dust or polyvinylpyrrolidone adhesive coatings were safer in maize and as effective in Striga control as priming. Seed dressing coupled with pulling Striga escapes reduces infestation and can be used to deplete the Striga seed bank until genetic crop resistance becomes available. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Brose, U				Brose, U			Relative importance of isolation, area and habitat heterogeneity for vascular plant species richness of temporary wetlands in east-German farmland	ECOGRAPHY												The purpose of this investigation was to explore the determinants of vascular plant species richness for temporary, isolated wetland habitats which are influenced by hydrologic gradients and characterized by variation in habitat area, The dependent variables, total plant species richness and the number of obligate wetland species were analyzed consecutively. In regression analyses habitat area explained between 11 and 15% of the variation in the dependent variables. Habitat area was correlated with the heterogeneity of the hydroperiods between the upper and lower parts of the hydrologic gradients. In multivariate regression analyses, habitat heterogeneity accounted for 70-77% of the variation in the dependent variables, and habitat area did not have a significant impact. The results are most consistent with the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, I therefore concluded that area is a surrogate variable for habitat heterogeneity which directly enhances vascular plant species diversity. There was no significant impact of isolation on species richness. The data suggest that the expanses of agricultural fields are not an effective barrier to the dispersal of the studied plant species. Only 10 of 52 wetland species were negatively influenced by isolation. This group of species did not differ from the other wetland species with respect to dispersal strategies and longevity of seed banks. However, the longevity of the seed banks was generally high, and there was a dominance of species whose propagules are transported with the soil clinging to the feet of birds. The results are discussed in the context of accurate dispersal strategies and remnant populations, which may counteract the effects of isolation.

J	Grandin, U				Grandin, U			Short-term and long-term variation in seed bank/vegetation relations along an environmental and successional gradient	ECOGRAPHY												The seed bank along a successional and environmental gradient was analysed. Soil was collected in 3-cm thick horizons from permanent plots along two transects across a land uplift seashore, spanning several centuries of succession from shoreline to mature forest. Vegetation in the plots was recorded when the soil was sampled and also 9 and 15 yr before that. Within- and between-plot effects on seed bank/vegetation relationships were analysed using estimates of seed longevity, Sorensen's similarity index and mean Ellenberg indicator values. A seed bank longevity index was constructed by using the database by Thompson et al. (1997. The soil seed banks of north west Europe. Methodology, density and longevity. - Cambridge Univ. Press), for all species with more than one entry in the database. For species with one or no entry, an internal index was constructed. The two indices were correlated and it was suggested that the internal index should be used where the Thompson database is insufficient. There were small differences between the upper three soil horizons in seed density, in similarity with the vegetation and in mean Ellenberg values. The highest seed densities and seed bank/vegetation similarities were found at the shoreline, after that the density and the similarity decreased with increasing successional age, with the mature forest having very low seed density and similarity values. Weighted mean Ellenberg indicator values for light, nitrogen, salt and moisture differed between vegetation and seed bank. For the seed bank, the mean Ellenberg values for light, moisture and nitrogen and weighted mean of seed bank longevity indices showed a trend along one of the transects.

J	Kittelson, PM; Maron, JL				Kittelson, PM; Maron, JL			Fine-scale genetically based differentiation of life-history traits in the perennial shrub Lupinus arboreus	EVOLUTION												Across large spatial scales, plants often exhibit genetically based differentiation in traits that allow adaptation to local sites. At smaller spatial scales, sharp boundaries between edaphic conditions also can create strong gradients in selection that counteract gene flow and result in local adaptation. Few studies, however, have examined the degree to which continuous populations of perennial plants exhibit genetically based differentiation in life-history traits over small spatial scales. We quantified the degree of genetically based differentiation in adaptive traits among bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus) from nearby dune and grassland sites (sites separated by <0.75 km) that formed part of a larger continuous population of L. arboreus. We also investigated the spatial genetic structure of bush lupine by examining how genetic structure differed between seeds and juvenile plants that were less than two years old. We calculated F-statistics from gel electrophoresis of 10 polymorphic loci. We then used these values to infer levels of gene flow, To examine differentiation in adaptive traits, we created full-sibling/half-sibling families of lupine within each area and established reciprocal common gardens at each site. Across two years, we measured canopy volume, flowering time, seed set, and mortality of progeny planted in each garden. Spatial genetic structure among seeds was virtually nonexistent (F-ST = 0.002), suggesting that gene flow between the three areas could be quite high. However, genetic structure increased 20-fold among juvenile plants (F-ST = 0.041). We found strong evidence for fine-scale genetically based differentiation and local adaptation in adaptive traits such as plant size. flowering phenology, fecundity, and mortality. Thus, it is likely that strong but differing selection regimes within each area drive spatial differentiation in lupine life-history traits.																	0014-3820					DEC	2001	55	12					2429	2438		10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00758.x							WOS:000173528000006	11831659					
J	Standish, RJ; Robertson, AW; Williams, PA				Standish, RJ; Robertson, AW; Williams, PA			The impact of an invasive weed Tradescantia fluminensis on native forest regeneration	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Tradescantia fluminensis is an invasive weed of New Zealand, eastern Australia and Florida, where it carpets the ground in canopy-depleted native forest remnants and prevents regeneration. The aim of our study was to determine the Tradescantia biomass levels at which this occurs. 2. At two podocarp/broad-leaved forest remnants in New Zealand, we showed that Tradescantia biomass increased logistically with available light, to a maximum at 10-15% full light. The maximum Tradescantia biomass was greater at the wetter site (819 g m(-2)) than at the comparatively dry site (695 g m(-2)). 3. Native forest seedling species richness and abundance decreased exponentially with increasing Tradescantia biomass, for example from 3.4 and 81.5 m(-2), respectively, in the absence of the weed, to 0.37 and 6.28 m(-2) at maximum Tradescantia biomass. We attributed this to decreasing light levels beneath Tradescantia. Under approximately 500 g m(-2) of Tradescantia (c. 100% weed cover), available light was reduced to < 1% full light. 4. The compositions of the extant vegetation, seed rain and seed bank were consistent with our interpretation that light availability drives the differences in seedling species richness and abundance between Tradescantia and non-Tradescantia habitats. 5. We estimated the response of seedlings of six commonly occurring native woody species to Tradescantia biomass. Macropiper excelsum appeared to be the least tolerant, its LD50 (the biomass of Tradescantia at which its abundance is reduced to 50% of the maximum) being approximately 12 g m(-2), whereas Dysoxylum spectabile was the most tolerant, with an LD50 of 40 g m(-2). 6. Dysoxylum spectabile germination and early seedling establishment could occur in dense Tradescantia, but the probability of survival over 20 months decreased logistically with increasing Tradescantia biomass. The probability of survival at 100% weed cover was 6% compared with 84% for seedlings in non-Tradescantia habitat. We estimated that emergence above the weed occurs only where cover of Tradescantia is < 200 g m(-2) (70-90% cover). 7. We predicted that increases in native species richness and abundance will accumulate with increasing suppression of the weed. Imposing shade by planting trees to improve the canopy cover is a potentially useful tool for restoration of Tradescantia-affected forest remnants.

J	Gul, B; Weber, DJ				Gul, B; Weber, DJ			Seed bank dynamics in a Great Basin salt playa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Salt playa are common in the Great Basin area with halophytes as the dominant flora. The relationship between the seed bank flora and existing vegetation was studied. The seed bank flora showed a high degree of similarity with that of perennial and annual halophytic vegetation. Both above and below ground components of the community are dominated by halophyte species like Allenrolfea occidentalis, Holosteum umbellatum, Salicornia rubra and Salicornia utahensis. Seasonal variation in the seed bank was also studied for the 1995-1996 and 1996-1997 growing seasons. The seeds of A. occidentalis persist in the soil of the upper zone in large densities. Salicornia utahensis was much higher in the upper zone throughout the study period. Most species demonstrated the persistent nature of the seed banks with their numbers increasing after seed dispersal and decreasing in subsequent months. The variation illustrates the transient nature of the seed bank. We concluded that A. occidentalis is more dependent on a large seed bank for maintaining its population than the two annual halophytes. The significance of the seed bank and their variation due to environmental conditions for perennial and annual species of the Great Basin salt playa community is discussed.

J	Radford, IJ; Nicholas, DM; Brown, JR				Radford, IJ; Nicholas, DM; Brown, JR			Impact of prescribed burning on Acacia nilotica seed banks and seedlings in the Astrebla grasslands of northern Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Acacia nilotica is a tree of international significance both as a beneficial plant and as a species prone to thicket formation and negative impacts on savannas throughout much of its range. While fire has been identified as a useful tool for controlling negative impacts of some Acacia species in Africa, A. nilotica adult trees are apparently fire tolerant. The effects of fire on seed bank mortality, viability and germination, and on juvenile plants of this species are unknown. We undertook a study to investigate the impacts of fire on seeds and first and second year seedlings in Australian Astrebla savannas. The primary objective was to determine the effects of control burns applied during the early stages of invasion and thicket formation. Because of high rates of seedling dessication post fire in 1997, supplementary watering was undertaken until fire mortality could be measured the following year. High seed mortality occurred for seeds located either in cattle dung (100%) or on the soil surface (c. 80%). Germination of those seeds that survived was enhanced following exposure to fire. Very high fire mortality (99%) was observed among first year seedlings and moderate mortality (60%) for second year seedlings even after a low intensity burn. Negative impacts on major pasture species were minimal. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to A. nilotica fire ecology and to the efficacy of fire as a tool for managing this species.

The analyzed levels were populations, functional types, and total number of individuals in the community. We hypothesized that the number of germinable seeds positively affects the number of emerged seedlings which positively affects the number of reproductive individuals. We hypothesized as well that litter mass, biomass of established adults, and number of non-conspecific emerged seedlings negatively affect the numbers of emerged seedlings and reproductive individuals. The results supported our multivariate causal explanation of plant recruitment, although concordances with the initial hypotheses were more frequent at the community level. The effect of the number of germinable seeds on the number of emerged seedlings was found to be robust only at the community level. At the population level, this relationship did not have a consistent tendency and depended on species identity and range of seed density experienced. Litter had negative effects on total number of individuals in the community, and usually non-significant effects at the population level. Litter effects were found to be inversely related to seed mass, and sharper cotyledons did not improve seedling emergence likely by favoring litter mat penetration. Interactions among plant species appeared not to have any effect on seedling emergence and survival, and had positive effects on certain populations. Biomass of established adult plants exerted no influence on seedling emergence and survival, probably due to their low abundance in this community during the germination period. Results permitted the inference of the main stages in the recruitment process and causal factors. They provided evidence for the greater importance of germination and emergence in comparison with seedling survival to insure reproductive recruitment in this community.

J	Washitani, I				Washitani, I			Plant conservation ecology for management and restoration of riparian habitats of lowland Japan	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Conservation ecology is a new paradigm of ecology that aims at scientific contributions to maintaining earth's biodiversity and is committed to ecosystem management indispensable to intergenerational long-term sustainability. Population ecology plays a central role in conservation ecology. Persistence of the metapopulation rather than that of each local population should be pursued in species conservation management. Biological interactions essential to reproduction and soil seed bank components of the population should be investigated and applied to planning for the conservation of a plant population. Gravelly floodplains and moist tall grasslands are among typical riparian habitats containing many threatened plants in Japan. These riparian habitats are now subjected not only to heavy fragmentation but also to intensive invasion of highly competitive alien (normative) plants. Extreme habitat isolation may result in reproductive failure or fertility selection in a plant population without pollinators, as exemplified by a nature reserve population of Primula sieboldii. Biological invasions, which are facilitated by extensive changes in the river environment including decreased seasonal flooding, abandonment of traditional vegetation management, eutrophication, and extensive clearing of the land for recreational use, threaten endemic riparian species. To preserve safe sites and growing conditions for threatened plants such as Aster kantoensis, active management to suppress the dominance of alien invader plants is necessary. Population management and habitat restoration should be based on sound information on the population ecology of both threatened and alien invader plants, designed as an ecological experiment to clarify effective ways for management.																	1438-3896					DEC	2001	43	3					189	195		10.1007/s10144-001-8182-8							WOS:000173646200001

The seed bank source was abandoned farmland, whose top 10-cm layer of topsoil contained 6,850 +/- 377 seeds/m(2) from 41 species. The seeds in the soil were principally distributed in the upper 0-2 cm, which held 75.8% of total seeds and 92.7% of species composition. The top 2-cm layer of topsoil may be sufficient to serve the purpose of providing a seed source for revegetation on derelict lands, including mined lands. Four different thicknesses of topsoil (1, 2, 4, and 8 cm, redistributed from the total 0-10-cm layer from the farmland) were field-tested on the Pb/Zn mine tailings. There was no significant difference in seedling density among the 4 thickness treatments. Many seeds in the treatments with more than 1-cm of topsoil were unable to emerge from the deeper layer. Seedlings in plots with topsoil of 1-, 2- and 4-cm failed to establish within 1 year due to the extremely high acidity (pH 2.39 to 2.76). A shallow layer of topsoil cannot neutralize the sulfuric acid generated from oxidation of pyrites in the tailings. For establishment of seedlings on metalliferous lands, an insulating layer such as subsoil, building rubble, or domestic refuse is necessary before covering with valuable topsoil. The woody legume Leucaena leucocephala grown on the tailings with a topsoil cover of 8-cm was the most dominant species. Lead was accumulated in root, branch, stem bark, and xylem, which accounted for more than 80% of the total metal concentration in the plant. This portion of Pb will reside in the plant for a long period, while the smaller portion of Pb in the leaf (about 15%) could be returned to the environment as litter during growth. Woody plants may have an advantage in metalphyto-remediation over herbaceous plants.																	1061-2971					DEC	2001	9	4					378	385		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2001.94007.x							WOS:000172926500007

Seeds were collected in the autumn of 1995 and dry-stored in paper bags at 4degreesC until the start of trials in the spring of 1998. For each plant, between 549 and 1000 randomly selected seeds were separated into seven mass fractions based on individual seed mass, with classes ranging from <6.0 to >11.0 mg. Subjecting the seeds to a cold stratification (4degreesC) period for 7 d followed by a 21-d alternating day/night (25/14degreesC) temperature and 14-h photoperiod regime, resulted in 75% overall germination, 24% dormancy and 1% non-viable seeds. The majority of the seeds germinated within 7 d of being exposed to the alternating temperature/light regimes. There was a significant (P < 0.001) difference in mean seed mass between the ten plants, with mean mass ranging from 8.8 to 9.6 mg. For nine of the ten plants, the greatest proportion of seeds occurred in the 9.0-9.9 mg mass fraction, while the lowest proportion of seeds was generally found within the 6.0-6.9 mg mass fraction. Most seeds (96%) having a mass below 6.0 mg were non-viable and, of the viable seeds, none germinated. There was a significant (P < 0.0001) relationship between seed mass and total germination, but not rate of germination. Germination peaked for seed mass fractions comprising the greatest proportion of total seeds (8.0-9.9 mg) and was lowest for seeds with high or low mass. There was a weak trend of lower germinability for heavier seeds (>10.0 mg) compared with lighter seeds. Maternal source had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on total germination and germination rate. Findings from this study suggest that intrapopulation variation in Abutilon theophrasti seed mass and its influence on germinability of seeds may play a significant role in maintaining a variable germination pattern and persistent seed bank in this troublesome annual agricultural weed.																	0960-2585					DEC	2001	11	4					335	343									WOS:000173202200007

The suggested underlying mechanism is predation. Small seeds experience less predation and are more likely to become buried, which itself offers significant protection from predation by vertebrates. The relationship between seed size and shape and persistence in the soil was examined for the flora of the Arasbaran Protected Area in northwest Iran. Seed size was related to persistence in the soil in Iran in the same way as in most other floras examined, but seed shape was not. It is suggested that predation prevents persistence of large seeds in most floras. Where large-seeded persistent species predominate, for example in Australia and (to a lesser extent) in New Zealand, other factors may interfere with the relationship between seed size and predation.

In order to model vertical and lateral seed displacements during ploughing, an existing model describing soil particle movements for different ploughing characteristics (depth and width) and soil structures was adapted to integrate the effect of a skim-coulter, This model was tested in two field trials, in Northern France, using coloured plastic beads to imitate weed seeds, The trial in Dijon was set up on an eutric cambisol and comprised both compacted and uncompacted soil. The second trial was set up at Grignon, on an orthic luvisol which was left uncompacted before ploughing. The model correctly simulated the lateral displacement (LD) and the final vertical co-ordinate of the beads as a function of their initial location, soil structure before ploughing and ploughing parameters (ploughing depth and width skim-coulter depth and width). The model was then used to calculate seed transfer matrixes describing vertical seed movements between seed bank layers and vertical seed distributions for different conditions and plough modes. The results were consistent with those of Cousens and Moss [Weed Res. 30 (1990) 61-70]. Simulations were performed to test the effect of different ploughing modes on the time changes in the vertical distribution of weed seeds and to show how the model can be used to manage weed seed concentration in the top layer by soil tillage. Furthermore. simulations showed that the vertical distribution of the seed bank could be extremely variable, depending on plough characteristics, soil structure or initial seed distribution. Although further studies are needed on the long-term seed movements under the influence of secondary tillage and climate, this model can be useful for evaluating different tillage modes on seed dispersal within the ploughed layers.

J	Holmes, PM; Foden, W				Holmes, PM; Foden, W			The effectiveness of post-fire soil disturbance in restoring fynbos after alien clearance	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The control of invasive alien plants is one of the major tasks facing conservation managers of South African fynbos vegetation. Extensive clearance work currently is underway, but the ultimate success of these operations depends upon good indigenous vegetation recovery. Fynbos species potentially may recruit from persistent seed banks in the soil, but surface seed banks may become depleted under dense aliens and deeper seed banks may fall to germinate. In this study, the effect on fynbos recovery of disturbing the soil mechanically, to a depth of 100-150 mm, following alien clearance, was investigated. It was hypothesised that soil disturbance would promote germination from persistent, soil-stored seed banks. It was further hypothesised that soil disturbance would have a greater effect following high compared to low fire intensities. Soil disturbance had no effect on total plant recruitment. There was a significant negative relationship between fire intensity and plant density two years post-fire. Recruitment levels at the study site were low compared to those at sites invaded for two to three decades. This indicates that fynbos seed persistence may decline rapidly after four decades of burial. Soil disturbance resulted in higher indigenous species richness and projected canopy cover at the final census, two years post-fire, Changes to guild structure following soil disturbance included an increase in the cover of shrubs relative to graminoids and forbs, and small-seeded species relative to larger-seeded myrmecochorous species. Soil disturbance caused similar changes to guild structure in both high and low fire intensity plots. Soil disturbance is not recommended as a universal treatment following the clearance of dense stands of aliens. Used in conjunction with indigenous sowing, it may improve restoration at long-invaded, deep-soil sites, following fires of unnaturally high intensity. Post-fire soil disturbance should promote species richness in seedling recruits, plant growth conditions and the development of vegetation cover, while sowing would increase plant density and re-introduce guilds not present in relict soil seed banks.																	0254-6299					DEC	2001	67	4					533	539		10.1016/S0254-6299(15)31185-6							WOS:000173357200004						
J	Chikoye, D; Ekeleme, F				Chikoye, D; Ekeleme, F			Weed flora and soil seedbanks in fields dominated by Imperata cylindrica in them moist savannah of West Africa	WEED RESEARCH												Imperata cylindrica (L.) Raeuschel is a dominant and infamous grass weed in the savannah of West Africa. Research to reduce the weed to non-damaging levels is a priority activity at many agricultural institutions. The successful development and implementation of long-term I. cylindrica management strategies depend on the ability to predict changes in weed composition after L cylindrica has been controlled effectively. The weed flora and soil seedbank were assessed from 329 fields dominated by this species in the fringes of the humid forest (HFF), coastal/derived savannah (CDS) and in the southern Guinea savannah (SGS) in 1996 and 1997. The objectives of the study were to correlate species composition or the weed flora with that of the soil seedbank and to determine the effect of management factors and Soil properties on the composition of the weed flora. Species richness in the weed flora and in the weed seedbank was higher in the SGS than in the CDS and HFF. Mean weed density per field was generally higher in the HFF (156 +/- 25.0 weeds m(-2)) than in the CDS (108 +/- 8.1 weeds m (2)) and in the SGS (92 +/- 6.3 weeds m(-2)). Weed composition varied with agroecological zone as well as with management factors and soil properties. Sorenson's index of similarity,was low (mean = 0.20) in all zones, indicating poor similarity between the weed flora above-ground and the soil seedbank.																	0043-1737					DEC	2001	41	6					475	490		10.1046/j.1365-3180.2001.00251.x							WOS:000173134500001						
J	Baldwin, AH; Egnotovich, MS; Clarke, E				Baldwin, AH; Egnotovich, MS; Clarke, E			Hydrologic change and vegetation of tidal freshwater marshes: Field, greenhouse, and seed-bank experiments	WETLANDS												Plant communities of tidal freshwater marshes fluctuate in composition seasonally and among years, but the influence of changes in hydrology on vegetation of these systems has not been examined. We investigated the effects of hydrology on vegetation of tidal freshwater marshes along the Patuxent River in Maryland, USA with a two-year field experiment, a one-year greenhouse experiment, and a seed-bank experiment. In the field experiment, sections of marsh soil and vegetation ("sods") were elevated 10 cm, lowered 10 cm, or placed level with the marsh surface to simulate different hydrologic regimes. In the greenhouse experiment, sods were raised 10 cin above water surface (nonflooded) or flooded by 10 cm of water in tanks continuously, and in two other treatments changed from nonflooded to flooded or vice-versa after the first 35 days. For the seed-bank experiment, soil samples were spread in a 1-cm-thick layer in pans subjected to flooding by 3.5-4 cin of water or nonflooded but moist conditions in the greenhouse, and emerging seedlings counted. We found that lowering marsh sods by 10 cm (i.e., wetter conditions) in the field reduced plant species richness by 26% compared to the sods placed level with the marsh surface, while raising sods by 10 cm (drier conditions) increased richness by 42%. Total stem length of a majority of the most common species, as well as for all species combined, was more than twice as great in raised sods as in lowered sods. We observed similar patterns in richness and total stem length in the greenhouse study, where continuously nonflooded sods had almost twice the richness and 55% greater total stein length as continuously flooded sods. Sods that were flooded initially and then shifted to nonflooded conditions had richness and total stein length similar to the continuously flooded sods, while sods that were nonflooded initially and then flooded had richness and total stem length intermediate to continuously nonflooded and continuously flooded sods. In the field and greenhouse studies, species that are annual or annnual/perennial were more inhibited by flooding than were perennials. In the seedbank experiment, flooding reduced the number of species emerging by 50% and total densities of emerging seedlings by 80% compared to nonflooded conditions. Taken together, the results of the field, greenhouse, and seed-bank studies indicate that 3-10 cm of flooding can significantly reduce seedling recruitment and growth in many plant species of tidal freshwater marshes and result in lower plant diversity. The greenhouse study further indicates that shallow flooding early in the growing season can reduce the abundance of certain species, primarily annuals, for the remainder of the growing season, resulting in a less diverse community. These findings suggest that hydrology is a dominant environmental variable controlling interannual variation in plant species composition of tidal freshwater marshes. Additionally, this study suggests that small increases in frequency and duration of inundation, which might occur due to watershed land-use changes, sea-level rise, or land subsidence, will reduce the diversity of these plant communities.

J	Halpern, CB; McKenzie, D				Halpern, CB; McKenzie, D			Disturbance and post-harvest ground conditions in a structural retention experiment	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Federal guidelines now specify retention of live trees on cutting units within the range of the northern spotted owl, but to date there have been no formal tests of the ecological or silvicultural implications of these guidelines, nor of possible tradeoffs associated with different spatial patterns of retention. We examined disturbance patterns and post-harvest ground conditions in mature forests of western Oregon and Washington in a factorial experiment that compared both level (15 vs. 40%) and pattern (dispersed vs. aggregated) of live-tree retention. Ground cover associated with logging disturbance (slash, disturbed soil, and intact forest floor), slash depth, and the difference (pre- vs. post-logging) in coarse woody debris (decay class 1) were quantified on four treatment units (two factors, two levels) at six locations (blocks). Significantly greater disturbance was evident at lower levels of retention (15%) and on aggregated cutting units, but even greater differences were evident among blocks, reflecting the predominant influence of initial site differences and yarding methods (ground-based, suspension cable, or helicopter). Short-term responses of vegetation to varying levels and patterns of structural retention are likely to be shaped by levels of ground disturbance. Thus, we expect that block- and treatment-level effects will have important consequences for tree regeneration and understory composition in these forests. Conventional strategies used to minimize soil disturbance and to manage slash accumulation during clearcut logging should be applicable to variable retention systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Interactions between density-dependent survival, probability of flowering and fecundity were modelled and their impact on the population dynamics were examined. When only fecundity was density-dependent, the dynamics were similar to those observed in the model containing all three density-dependent terms. Density-dependent survival was a stabilizing process when acting in combination with density-dependent fecundity and probability of flowering; removing density-dependent survival from the model produced two-point cycles. The addition of a seed bank was also stabilizing. Simulations of control strategies at different life-history stages indicated that full control would be difficult due to the strong over-compensating density dependence, with severe reductions in fecundity and late season survival necessary in order to reduce equilibrium seed density and biomass.

J	Barnes, ME				Barnes, ME			Seed predation, germination and seedling establishment of Acacia erioloba in northern Botswana	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The low rate of new Acacia erioloba seedling establishment in wildlife areas in northern Botswana may be influenced by seed predation, insufficient rainfall for seed germination and seedling establishment or browsing. Mammal and insect predation on A. erioloba pods, seeds, and seedlings were monitored in three wildlife areas to determine the effects on seed germination and seedling survival during 2 drought years followed by 2 years with average rainfall. Although bruchid beetles infested half of the seeds, removal of unripe pods by chacma baboons Papio cynocephalus and vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops was the primary source of seed predation in areas near perennial water sources. The same number of seeds from pods collected under mature A. erioloba trees germinated as seeds from elephant dung when kept in saturated sand; however, seeds from dung began germinating in three days but those from pods did not start germinating until the tenth day. During the drought years, few seedlings emerged and none survived. New seedlings, identified by their cotyledons, emerged in December 1995 after > 100 mm rain over several days, but by mid January, more than half of the seedlings died from dessication. Only 15% of the seedlings remained in June and none survived through the dry season in 1996. Dispersal of more rapidly germinating seeds in elephant dung would be beneficial in sandy semi-arid savannas where sufficient rainfall for seed germination and seedling establishment appears to be rare. These results suggest that while seed predation reduces the number of seeds in the seed bank, inadequate rainfall limits A. erioloba seedling establishment, even during years with average annual rainfall.

J	Hunt, LP				Hunt, LP			Low seed availability may limit recruitment in grazed Atriplex vesicaria and contribute to its local extinction	PLANT ECOLOGY												Poor recruitment in Atriplex vesicaria Hewd ex Benth (bladder saltbush) under sheep grazing in the chenopod shrublands of southern Australia contributes to a decline in the shrub's population growth rate. This may lead to local extinction of the species over large areas around watering points. This study investigated whether low seed availability may contribute to poor recruitment. It examined the incidence of flowering and seed bank size at sites distributed across a large grazed paddock, and examined the longevity of seed in the soil. Grazing by sheep reduced the incidence of flowering and input to the seed bank. The proportion of shrubs with flowers increased with distance from water, showing the characteristic piosphere response. Shrubs on grazed sites closer to water experienced extended periods when they failed to flower or flowered poorly. The seed bank was negligible at three of the sites within 1650 m of water for all three years of sampling. In contrast, the seed bank at the most distant site sampled (2800 m from water) was small in 1990 (37 +/- 5.1 seeds/m2) but in 1991 and 1992 seed numbers were substantial (626 +/- 315.2 seeds/m2 and 318 +/- 169.0, respectively). Soil seed was short-lived in this study, with only 34% and 17% of the original seed remaining as viable ungerminated seed after 12 months for the under-canopy and exposed treatments respectively. Whilst recruitment may also be limited by altered soil conditions due to grazing and trampling and the availability of safe sites, the results of this study suggest that low seed availability may be an important factor contributing to poor recruitment and may limit the ability of the population to recover from the loss of established plants. Management of grazing must take into account the need for A. vesicaria populations to flower and set seed on a regular basis.

In the first year, the spatial distribution was random, but from 1986 to 1989, crenate broomrape populations were clearly aggregated. The crenate broomrape infection severity (IS: number of emerged broomrape m(-2)) increased every year, from an average of 0.45 in 1985 to 29.4 in 1989, with a slight decrease the following year (IS = 27.4). Spherical functions provided the best fit because the cross-validation criteria were accomplished in all study cases. Kriged estimates were used to draw contour maps of the populations. About 34.3, 43.3, and 74.3% of the field plot surface exhibited an IS greater than or equal to 1 (economic threshold) in 1985, 1986, and 1987, respectively, and nearly 100% of the area exceeded the economic threshold from 1988 to 1990; 1985 and 1986 were key years for control of the parasitic weed population. The percentage of infested area at different IS intervals in each year's map obtained by kriging was used to estimate the percentage of yield losses in each infested area (Y-A) with the equation: Y-A = A * Y-max * (1 - IS * 0.124), where A is the infested area at a given IS interval and Y-max is the expected broomrape-free broad bean yield. Yield losses under different IS intervals were compared with yield loss attributable to a uniform distribution of crenate broomrape. Results showed that yield loss assuming a uniform distribution of crenate broomrape was clearly overestimated, which is important to avoid overuse of herbicides.

J	Tsuyuzaki, S; Goto, M				Tsuyuzaki, S; Goto, M			Persistence of seed bank under thick volcanic deposits twenty years after eruptions of Mount Usu, Hokkaido Island, Japan	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The topsoil that contained the seed bank became buried under thick tephra after the eruptions of Mount Usu during 1977 and 1978. To determine the seed bank potential of the topsoil 20 yr after the eruptions, i.e., in 1998. 408 100-cm(3) samples were excavated under 115-185 cm of volcanic deposits. The topsoil was collected at 10-cm intervals along the horizontal scale and was divided into a 0-5 cm deep upper layer and a 5-10 cm deep lower layer. The seed bank was estimated by both the germination (GM) and flotation (FM) methods. In total, 23 species with an average seed density of 1317 seeds/m(2) were identified by GM, and 30 species with a density of 2986 seeds/m(2) were extracted by FM. The dominant species was Rumex obtusifolius, and perennial herbs. such as Carex oxyandra, Viola grypoceras, and Poa pratensis, were common. For nine species this study provided the first records for field seed longevity > 20 yr. The seed density in the upper layer was double that in the lower layer, and the horizontal distribution was heterogeneous even at 10-cm intervals, We concluded that the seed bank has retained the original structure of the seed bank under the tephra and will persist longer with soil water content between 20 and 40%, no light, and low temperature fluctuations (+/-0.17 degreesC of standard deviation in a day).

J	Bell, DT				Bell, DT			Ecological response syndromes in the flora of southwestern Western Australia: Fire resprouters versus reseeders	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Two fire-response syndromes can be described for species of the vegetation of Mediterranean-climate, southwestern Western Australia. Resprouters survive fires as individuals. Reseeders are killed by fire and must reestablish through germination and establishment of seedlings. Of the Western Australian plant families analyzed for fire-response strategies, 50% of the Proteaceae, 50% of the Restionaceae, 45% of the Orchidaceae, and 25% of the Epacridaceae are resprouter species. Within genera of the Proteaceae, the proportions of resprouters include Adenanthos (56%), Hakea (52%), Dryandra (35%), and Grevillea (31%). Within Banksia, 49% are resprouters, and it appears that the reseeding syndrome is the derived character in this genus. The proportion of resprouters within southwestern Western Australian plant communities ranges from 66% to 80%. These percentages are generally higher than in more and parts of Western Australia and in comparable plant communities from other Mediterranean-type climates of the world. The relatively high proportion of resprouters within plant families and within plant communities probably indicates that the Western Australian vegetation experiences a harsher fire stress regime than do other Mediterranean-type climate areas. Western Australian plant communities have their highest diversity in the early years after fire, when the vegetation contains a higher number of reseeding species and individuals. Seed banks are dominated by the seeds of reseeders. There are no basic differences in mean seed mass, viability, or germinability of seeds between resprouting species and reseeding species, but reseeders tend to have narrower optimum germination temperature regimes. Establishment success is related more to seed mass, seedling size, and leaf ecophysiology and morphology than to fire-response strategy. Reseeder seedlings tend to grow faster than do resprouter seedlings. Basic shrub morphology differs, with reseeders generally being umbrella shaped and resprouters urn shaped. Reseeding species most commonly have a shallow, fibrous root system. Resprouters have a massive, deeply penetrating root system. Shoot:root ratios of first-year seedlings and mature plants are higher for reseeders. Resprouter seedlings store starch in root tissue at a much greater rate than do reseeder seedlings. Although the concentrations of essential nutrients in seedlings are not different between fire-response types, reseeders tend to conserve nutrients to a greater extent through leaf retention. Reseeders tend to produce greater numbers of flowers and greater amounts of floral rewards, but the breeding systems, which lead to the higher seed set in reseeders, can vary between strict outcrossing and considerable selfing. Reseeding species are not likely to be wind pollinated. Species survival in a fire-prone environment can involve a wide range of combinations of attributes. It appears that in Western Australian reseeder species the lack of an ability to resprout is compensated for by a number of other structural and functional features. Knowledge of the fire-response strategies of species of southwestern Western Australia can influence fire-regime management, conservation of rare species, and restoration of vegetation after disturbance. Further knowledge of the fire-response strategies of species of the southwestern Western Australian flora should result in better management of natural and restored plant communities of the region.																	0006-8101					OCT-DEC	2001	67	4					417	440		10.1007/BF02857891							WOS:000174149700001

Walp.) is an important legume crop in subsaharian Africa. However, its cultivation is threatened by the parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides (Willd.) Vatke, which causes considerable yield losses. Striga gesnerioides is an obligate parasite with low photosynthetic activity. Its seeds germinate in response to specific germination stimulants exuded by host roots. After germination, an haustorium is formed through differentiation of the radicular apex. A vascular connection is subsequently established, allowing the parasitic weed to absorb water and nutrients that are essential for its development. Control of S. gesnerioides is difficult to achieve because of the intimate association between the parasitic weed and its host. The use of resistant cowpea cultivars, in combination with appropriate cultural practices, is probably the easiest and most effective method to control S. gesnerioides and achieve long term reduction of its seed bank in the soil.

J	Chmielewski, JG; Semple, JC				Chmielewski, JG; Semple, JC			The biology of Canadian weeds. 114. Symphyotrichum pilosum (Willd.) Nesom (Aster pilosus Willd.)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Symphyotrichum pilosum (Willd.) Nesom, the white heath aster, is a robust, native North American, polyploid, herbaceous perennial. Until recently the species was treated as part of Aster. Its placement in the segregate genus Symphyotrichum follows the revised generic combinations proposed for North American asters. Occurring throughout eastern North America from Nova Scotia and Maine in the northeast, southward to Georgia, westward through southern Quebec and Ontario to Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, and Arkansas in disturbed areas such as fallow land, roadsides, dumps, quarries, arable fields, railroad beds, and embankments, the species is troublesome in the United States but a weed of minor importance in Canada. Two varieties, var. pilosum and var. pringlei are recognized. The former, the hairy variety, is weedier than the latter, the hairless variety. The species commonly occurs in fields following the first year of abandonment and may dominate in the second, or subsequent years. Control may be achieved through the application of selected herbicides. Also, even a moderate amount of grazing by herbivores such as small rodents and rabbits is sufficient to restrict growth in the species. Mildew is chronic and widespread in natural populations but typically neither kills the plants nor prevents seed production. This contribution summarizes the known biological data for the species.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				OCT	2001	81	4					851	865		10.4141/P00-074							WOS:000172470000039						
J	Strand, JA; Weisner, SEB				Strand, JA; Weisner, SEB			Dynamics of submerged macrophyte populations in response to biomanipulation	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A 6-year study (1992-97) of changes in submerged vegetation after biomanipulation was carried out in the eutrophicated Lake Finjasjon, Southern Sweden. Ten sites around the lake were revisited each year. At each site five samples of above-ground biomass were taken at 10 cm water depth intervals. An investigation of the seed bank at the 10 sites, and a grazing experiment where birds and large fish were excluded was also conducted. 2. Between 1992 and 1996, in shallow areas (water depth < 3 m), vegetation cover 2 increased from < 3 to 75% and above-ground biomass from < 1 to 100 g DW m(-2). Mean outer water depth increased from 0.3 to 2.5 m. Elodea canadensis and Myriophyllum spicatum accounted for > 95% of the increase in biomass and plant cover. The following year (1997), however, cover and above-ground biomass decreased, mainly attributable to the total disappearance of E. canadensis. Secchi depth increased after biomanipulation until 1996, but decreased again in 1997. 3. Total and mean number of submerged species increased after biomanipulation, probably as a result of the improved light climate. However, after the initial increase in species number there was a decrease during the following years, possibly attributed to competition from the rapidly expanding E. canadensis and M. spicatum. The lack of increase in species number after the disappearance of E. canadensis in 1997 implies that other factors also affected species richness. 4. A viable seed bank was not necessary for a rapid recolonization of submerged macrophytes, nor did grazing by waterfowl or fish delay the re-colonization of submerged macrophytes. 5. Submerged macrophytes are capable of rapid recolonization if conditions improve, even in large lakes such as Finjasjon (11 km(2)). Species that spread by fragments will increase rapidly and probably outcompete other species. 6. The results indicate that after the initial Secchi depth increase, probably caused by high zooplankton densities, submerged vegetation further improved the light climate. The decrease in macrophyte biomass in 1997 may have caused the observed increase in phosphorus and chlorophyll a, and the decrease in Secchi depth. We suggest that nutrient competition from periphyton, attached to the macrophytes, may be an important factor in limiting phytoplankton production, although other factors (e.g. zooplankton grazing) are also of importance, especially as triggers for the shift to a clear-water state.

J	Blaney, CS; Kotanen, PM				Blaney, CS; Kotanen, PM			Effects of fungal pathogens on seeds of native and exotic plants: a test using congeneric pairs	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. It has previously been hypothesized that low rates of attack by natural enemies may contribute to the invasiveness of exotic plants. 2. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the influence of pathogens on survival during a critical life-history stage: the seed bank. We used fungicide treatments to estimate the impacts of soil fungi on buried seeds of a taxonomically broad suite of congeneric natives and exotics, in both upland and wetland meadows. 3. Seeds of both natives and exotics were recovered at lower rates in wetlands than in uplands. Fungicide addition reduced this difference by improving recovery in wetlands, indicating that the lower recovery was largely attributable to a higher level of fungal mortality. This suggests that fungal pathogens may contribute to the exclusion of upland species from wetlands. 4. The effects of fungicide on the recovery of buried seeds did not differ between natives and exotics. Seeds of exotics were recovered at a higher rate than seeds of natives in uplands, but this effect was not attributable to fungal pathogens. 5. Fungal seed pathogens may offer poor prospects for the management of most exotic species. The lack of consistent differences in the responses of natives vs. exotics to fungicide suggests few aliens owe their success to low seed pathogen loads, while impacts of seed-pathogenic biocontrol agents on non-target species would be frequent.

J	Anderson, CJ; MacMahon, JA				Anderson, CJ; MacMahon, JA			Granivores, exclosures, and seed banks: harvester ants and rodents in sagebrush-steppe	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Experiments were conducted to assess the influences of granivores on the seed bank in sagebrush-steppe. Rodent and/or ant exclosures were established at two distances from five harvester ant mounds. Monthly soil samples were collected from the exclosures, and from open access areas at two distances to ascertain changes in the seed bank. Seed dish experiments were conducted monthly to establish a maximum seed removal rate. Rodents were trapped monthly, More seeds were recovered from rodent exclosures than from ant exclosures. Seed banks changed temporally and spatially, with more seeds recovered in September and at 6 m from mounds. Rodents removed seeds more rapidly from seed dishes than did ants. Ants removed more seeds from dishes closest to the nests. Rodents may have a larger impact on the local seed bank than harvester ants. Ant activities, other than seed consumption, may have more influence on vegetation.

In sufficiently wet years, the grass Stipa capensis forms extensive stands, and is accompanied by a limited number of other annuals. Closer inspection revealed a distinct patterning of the vegetation. Species density and richness were much greater in slight depressions caused by the single passage of a vehicle than away from the tracks. This is attributed to changes in key soil attributes to provide a more favourable growth medium for plants in the tracks, as well as an increased influx of diaspores.

J	Walck, JL; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC				Walck, JL; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC			Why is Solidago shortii narrowly endemic and S-altissima geographically widespread? A comprehensive comparative study of biological traits	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim and location Solidago shortii T. and G. occurs in a small area of north-central Kentucky (USA), whereas S. altissima L. is geographically widespread in North America and is naturalized in Europe, Asia and Australia. Solidago shortii grows in a variety of habitats, but primarily in rocky/shallow soil areas, and S. altissima occurs in adjacent old fields/pastures. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the biology of these two species that might contribute to an explanation for differences in their geographical distribution and habitat. Methods Results of an extensive literature review and of original research by the authors were used in a detailed comparison of the two species. The most ecologically relevant aspects of the biology investigated were morphology, genetics, geography, life cycle, life history, reproductive biology, physiology, biotic interactions and response to disturbance. Results Although S. shortii and S. altissima are quite similar in many aspects of their biology, there are some important differences. Solidago altissima is a better competitor than S. shortii via its greater height, larger leaf area and more extensive clonal growth. On the other hand, S. shortii is a better drought-stress tolerator than S. altissima via allocation of a higher percentage of biomass to roots, higher root/shoot ratio and (seemingly) greater capacity to maintain leaf turgor (i.e. not wilt as readily) under xeric conditions. Moreover, higher seed production in S. altissima and its capacity to form a larger- and longer-lived soil seed bank than S. shortii probably contribute to differences in colonization abilities. Landscape disturbances and metapopulation dynamics are important factors in maintenance of the species population of S. shortii, and in prevention of its extinction. Main conclusions Solidago shortii probably is a relatively young species that as had insufficient time to expand its range. Furthermore, it is not well suited for migration to, or colonization of, habitats outside its range due to poor competitive and colonization abilities.																	0305-0270					OCT	2001	28	10					1221	1237		10.1046/j.1365-2699.2001.00620.x							WOS:000173246200004

Torrey Bot. Soc. 128:400-406. 2001.-White campion (Silene latifolia) is a dioecious perennial that is the focus of an on-going meta population study in southwestern Virginia. In order to determine if a population in this study region maintained a dormant seed bank we collected soil cores, placed them in a greenhouse, and monitored emergence of white campion seedlings. The timing of soil core collection ensured that all white campion seeds in the soil were greater than or equal to10 mo old. We compared the genetic composition of the seed bank with that of the above ground plants and the seed crop produced that year by scoring individuals from each cohort for sex and genotype at 7 polymorphic isozyme loci. A total of 99 white campion seedlings emerged froth the 70 cores collected (mean density of seedlings per core = 1.41 +/- 4.37, n = 70 cores; 535.29 seedlings/m(2)). The frequency distribution for seedling density per core deviated significantly from that predicted by a Poisson distribution, and the results of this analysis indicate a clumped dispersion pattern. The observed genotype frequencies in each cohort did not differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg predictions, and allele frequencies did not differ significantly between the above and below ground cohorts. Sex ratios in each cohort did not deviate significantly from 1:1. The results indicate that this white campion population maintains a dormant seed hank that provides an unbiased reservoir of genetic variation for the characters we investigated.																	0040-9618					OCT-DEC	2001	128	4					400	406		10.2307/3088672							WOS:000173284100008						
J	Jutila, HM				Jutila, HM			Effect of flooding and draw-down disturbance on germination from a seashore meadow seed bank	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of flooding and draw-down on the germination from the coastal grassland seed banks and to determine whether the effect of flooding varies between the delta and the seashore. Seed bank samples were collected from three shore transects in SW Finland, two on the shore of the Baltic Sea and one on the delta of River Kokemaenjoki. Samples were germinated in non-flooded and flooded conditions for over a month. after which both treatments were maintained in non-flooded conditions, A total of 9267 seedlings of 47 species germinated and mean density of seeds in the soil was cu. 84 000/m(2). Most of the seedlings were monocots (98%) and perennials (98%). Ca. 30-40% of the species found in the above-ground vegetation had a seed bank including the majority of the most abundant species. The number of seeds and species richness increased as the organic layer became thicker. The organic layer was thicker in the seashore samples and the seed bank was significantly larger than in the delta. The flooding and draw-down treatment significantly increased the number of germinating seedlings in the seashore and also increased species richness in two transects, one in the delta and the other in the seashore. Two species. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and Typha latifolia, had significantly higher germination in the flooded treatment than in the non-flooded. Apparently, many species in these coastal grasslands have adapted to flood disturbance and for seeds of some species flooding may work as a positive signal, possibly breaking dormancy.

J	Rogers, WE; Hartnett, DC				Rogers, WE; Hartnett, DC			Temporal vegetation dynamics and recolonization mechanisms on different-sized soil disturbances in tallgrass prairie	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Assessing the various mechanisms by which plants revegetate disturbances is important for understanding the effects of disturbances on plant population dynamics, plant community structure, community assembly processes, and ecosystem function. We initiated a 2-yr experiment examining temporal vegetation dynamics and mechanisms of recolonization on different-sized soil disturbances created to simulate pocket gopher mounds in North American tallgrass prairie. Treatments were designed to assess potential contributions of the seed rain, soil seed bank, clonal propagation from the edges of a soil mound, and regrowth of buried plants. Small mounds were more rapidly recolonized than large mounds. Vegetative regrowth strategies were the dominant recolonization mechanisms, while the seed rain was considerably less important in maintaining the diversity of forbs and annuals than previously believed. All recolonization mechanisms influenced plant succession, but stem densities and plant mass on soil mounds remained significantly lower than undisturbed controls after two growing seasons. Because natural pocket gopher mounds are indistinguishable from undisturbed areas after two seasons, these results suggest that multiple modes of recruitment concurrently, albeit differentially, contribute to the recolonization of soil disturbances and influence tallgrass prairie plant community structure and successional dynamics.																	0002-9122					SEP	2001	88	9					1634	1642		10.2307/3558408							WOS:000171069600013	21669697					
J	Combroux, I; Bornette, G; Willby, NJ; Amoros, C				Combroux, I; Bornette, G; Willby, NJ; Amoros, C			Regenerative strategies of aquatic plants in disturbed habitats: the role of the propagule bank	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Recovery of plants from disturbance is frequently associated with the presence of an extensive seed bank. In a cut-off channel of the Rhone River subjected to fluctuating water levels and scouring forces during flash floods, regenerative strategies of aquatic plants were investigated through the study of the sediment propagule bank and its comparison with the established vegetation. Within this channel, the zone disturbed only by scouring floods (zone F) had a small propagule bank (as assessed by greenhouse germination trials), whereas more propagules regrew in zone FE which was subjected to both scouring floods and episodic sediment emersion. There, regrowth was mostly from sexual propagules, with the stonewort Chara vulgaris being the dominant component. In zone F, no relationship between propagule bank composition and established vegetation was demonstrated. In zone FE, a strong positive relationship between vegetative propagules (buds + rhizomes + fragments) and the established vegetation occurred. The disturbance history of the site indicated that the flowering and seed production of most species was disrupted by the flood regime, the result being that only one third of the hydrophyte species present in the established vegetation were present in the seed bank. Consequently, in this habitat, resistance type regenerative strategies, involving fragments and rhizomes, were adopted by most species. Resilience regenerative strategies involving seed- or bud-banks, together with resistance strategies involving the development of a terrestrial growth form, were adopted by plants that had to face both floods and sediment emersions. The precise nature of disturbance appears to affect regenerative strategies of aquatic plants and merits greater attention in studies of trait-environment relationship. The diversity of regenerative strategies within and between aquatic plant species is likely to contribute significantly to the underlying stability of vegetation in flood disturbed habitats.

J	Perez, EM; Santiago, ET				Perez, EM; Santiago, ET			Seasonal dynamics of the seed bank is a Savanna on the Central Eastern Plains of Venezuela	BIOTROPICA												Little is known about seed bank dynamics in Neotropical savannas. We studied temporal variation in seed density, species richness, species composition, seed mass, and seed number in the topsoil seed bank of a savanna on "La Iguana" Experimental Station, Guarico State, Venezuela. Total soil surface sampled was 57,600 cm(2), in 400 cm(2) units, at four times of the year. Seeds from 124 plants from 20 families were encountered. Species composition varied seasonally, but grass seeds dominated almost all the year, both numerically and in species number. Seed density and species richness were highest in the dry season and declined to a minimum in early wet season. Mean density was 1702 seeds/m(2), with a range of temporal variation from 235 to 4624 seeds/m(2). Average seed mass across species by date ranged from 0.97 to 2.53 mg, but because tiny seeds were most numerous throughout the year, the abundance-weighted averages only varied from 0.8 to 1.19 mg. We found a high spatial variability in the seed distribution in the soil throughout the year. There were also substantial changes in the topsoil seed bank among seasons, as a consequence of herbaceous plant phenology and germination strategies, which are rightly coupled with hydroperiodism in Venezuelan savannas. Based on the species-area curves, we concluded that the minimal sampling effort needed to adequately estimate the species richness in the topsoil of this savanna is 11 fold higher than that used in most seed bank studies in tropical environments.																	0006-3606					SEP	2001	33	3					435	446		10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0435:DMEDBD]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000171709800006						
J	Tomback, DF; Anderies, AJ; Carsey, KS; Powell, ML; Mellmann-Brown, S				Tomback, DF; Anderies, AJ; Carsey, KS; Powell, ML; Mellmann-Brown, S			Delayed seed germination in whitebark pine and regeneration patterns following the yellowstone fires	ECOLOGY												Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seeds are dispersed by Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), a bird that makes caches under 2-3 cm of soil. Cached seeds may delay germination for one or more years in part because of underdeveloped embryos at the time of seed dispersal. Consequently, whitebark pine may show a soil seed bank strategy that is unique among pines (Pinaceae, Pinus). From 1990 to 1995 we studied natural whitebark pine regeneration following the 1988 Yellowstone fires to determine: (1) whether whitebark pine typically exhibits delayed seed germination and, if so, (2) how this affects patterns of regeneration over time, and (3) whether germination is the result of seed maturation or is stimulated by high levels of moisture availability. We established 275 permanent plots, each 20 m(2) in area, divided between Henderson Mountain, Gallatin National Forest, Montana, and Mt. Washburn, Yellowstone National Park. In the, Henderson Mountain study area, the ecological conditions or "treatments" included: dry, burned; moist, burned; dry, unburned; and moist, unburned. In the Mt. Washburn study area, the ecological treatments were dry, burned; moist, burned; and moist, moderately burned. Synchronous delayed seed germination occurred throughout both study areas. The greatest densities of new seedlings appeared in the summers of 1991 and 1993, but the greatest cone crops were produced in 1989 and 1991, Most germination followed two winters of seed dormancy. Regeneration densities were consistently highest on the Mt. Washburn moist treatments. High correlation between weighted means for new regeneration and March-plus-April precipitation, as well as the results of residual and multiple regression analyses, suggests that cone production two years prior and March-plus-April precipitation together account for the regeneration patterns in the Mt. Washburn study area. The role of precipitation requires further study. Delayed seed germination, producing a soil seed bank, may be an ecological strategy in whitebark pine that is the product of selection. Although underdeveloped embryos may be a consequence of both a short growing season and premature seed dispersal by nutcrackers, seed caching may further select for slow embryo maturation, as well as moisture-resistant seed coats to reduce nonadaptive germination.

J	Grant, CD; MacGregor, CM				Grant, CD; MacGregor, CM			Topsoil seed banks in grazed and ungrazed eucalypt woodlands at Newholme, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Germinable soil seed stores were estimated in grazed and ungrazed woodlands at Newhohne (Armidale, New South Wales) to establish whether there is a store in the topsoil of shrub species that are no longer present in the extant vegetation. Soils were subjected to combinations of smoke and heat treatments before the germination procedure was commenced. The mean germinable topsoil seed reserve to a depth of 10 cm was 10 855 seeds m(-2). Of this, 72% of seed was found in the upper 5 cm of soil. Two rush species (Juncus filicaulis and J. homalocaulis, 3185 and 1197 seeds m(-2), respectively) and the perennial herb Gnaphalium gymnocepahalum (1728 seeds m(-2)) were the most abundant species in the topsoil. Almost half (46%) of the topsoil seed reserve was composed of rushes or sedges, while perennial herbs composed a further 30%. Shrub species were almost absent from the topsoil seed store. Soils collected from grazed plots (12 360 +/- 2673 seeds m(-2)) did not have significantly different densities of topsoil seed to ungrazed plots (9351 +/- 2588 seeds m(-2)). However, four species showed a significantly greater seed store in the grazed than the ungrazed plots (Asperula conferta, Eragrostis trachycarpa, Plantago lanceolata, and Sporobolus creber), while Elymus scaber (a native grass) exhibited a significantly higher topsoil seed store in the ungrazed plots. Of the 69 species identified, 4 species showed sic, nificantly higher germination in smoked treatments (Centaurium tenuiflorum, Crassula sieberiana, Hypericum gramineum, and Plantago lanceolata), while 10 species exhibited significantly higher germination in unsmoked treatments. Five species exhibited significantly higher germination in heated trays (Desmodium. varians, Dichondra repens, Geranium potentilloides, Trifolium campestre, and Trifolium repens), while 49 species showed significantly higher levels of germination in unheated trays. Species responding to the smoke treatment were native and non-native annuals, while those responding to the heat treatment were mainly perennial legume species. Those species that showed increased germination with smoking were killed by the heat treatment, while those species that required heat to germinate showed no response to smoke. Comparison of the topsoil seed reserve and the vegetation present in these areas using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) showed that there was a large difference in both composition and abundance between the topsoil and the extant vegetation. Only two shrub species were relatively abundant (> 10% frequency) in the extant vegetation (Bursaria spinosa and Lissanthe strigosa). The implications of these findings to the management of woodlands at Newholme are discussed.																	0028-825X					SEP	2001	39	3					471	481									WOS:000172336100008

C. Koch (Syn: Arthrocnemum Indicum (Willd.) Moq.; Chenopodiaceae;) near Karachi, Pakistan. The distance from the Avicennia marina edge to mean high tide line (110 m) was divided into five zones. Density and height of the plants were higher in the middle marsh than in other areas. Plant cover and number of branches were lowest in the lower marsh and increased substantially in the next zone and there was no significant difference among other zones. Dry weight accumulation was highest in the lower-middle marsh. The size and composition of the seed bank was determined by monthly counting and identifying the seeds extracted from soil samples. A persistent seed bank flora was dominated species viz., Atriplex stocksii Boiss., Suaeda fruticosa (L.) Forssk., Halopyrum mucronatum (L.) Stapf., Aeluropus lagopoides (L.) Trin. Ex Thwaites, Urochondra setulosa (Trin.) C.E. Hobbard and Cressa cretica L. from adjacent communities. Seed bank size was one of the largest in the samples collected immediately following dispersal ranging from 40,760 +/- 123 seeds m(-2) in March to 917,135 +/- 567 seeds m(-2) in July. Seed density the declined rapidly over two to three months. Size and diversity of the seed bank progressively increased from the lower to the upper salt marsh.				Khan, M.

Seeds (true seed plus fibrous endocarp) are dormant at maturity, and they have a small, linear embryo that is underdeveloped. In contrast it) previous reports, the endocarp and seed coat of S. orbiculatus are permeable to water; thus, seeds do not have physical dormancy. No fresh seeds germinated during 2 wk of incubation over a 15 degrees /6 degrees -35 degrees /20 degreesC range of thermoperiods in light (14-h photoperiod); gibberellic acid and warm or cold stratification alone did not overcome dormancy. One hundred percent of the seeds incubated in a simulated summer --> autumn --> winter --> spring sequence of temperature regimes germinated, whereas none of those subjected to a winter --> spring sequence did so. That is, cold stratification is effective in breaking dormancy only after seeds first are exposed to a period of warm temperatures. Likewise, embryos grew at cold temperatures only after seeds were exposed to warm temperatures. Thus, the seeds of S. orbiculatus have nondeep complex morphophysiological dormancy. As a result of dispersal phenology and dormancy-breaking requirements, in nature most seeds that germinate do so the second spring following maturity; a low to moderate percentage of the seeds may germinate the third spring. Seeds can germinate to high percentages under Quercus leaf litter and while buried in soils they have little or no potential to form a long-lived soil seed bank.																	0002-9122					AUG	2001	88	8					1444	1451		10.2307/3558452							WOS:000170368900012	21669677					
J	Arseneault, D				Arseneault, D			Impact of fire behavior on postfire forest development in a homogeneous boreal landscape	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												Although behavior of stand-replacing wildfire has significant impacts on initial tree regeneration in the fire-prone boreal landscape, the unknown behavior of most past wildfires has precluded any evaluation of these impacts on the progressive development of late-successional forest ecosystems. In this study, the effects of fire behavior on longterm ecosystem development were evaluated by linking the banding pattern of tree density in a jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) - black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forest on a flat and homogeneous landform in northern Quebec to a similar, previously documented pattern of unburned strips of tree crowns. Complex wildfire-atmosphere interactions during the spread of a 1941 stand-replacing wildfire created this pattern in stem density, most likely by differentially damaging the canopy-stored seed bank between areas of contrasting fire severity. Sites with initial differences in seedling densities have followed different recovery pathways and developed markedly different forest structures, as well as differences in species abundance. Compared with areas of severe crown fire, the present-day vegetation in areas of low crown fire severity shows a higher density of living pines in the canopy layer, higher spruce and dead pine densities in the subcanopy layer, a lower pine density in the understory layer, and a higher abundance of Cladina rangiferina (L.) and Cladina stellaris Opiz (Brodo) in the lichen mat. This close spatial connection between crown fire severity and the ecological processes driving ecosystem recovery may explain large differences in vegetation among sites in the boreal landscape.																	0045-5067					AUG	2001	31	8					1367	1374		10.1139/cjfr-31-8-1367							WOS:000170813900008

The species has ephemeral, modular and coppiced life-cycles and may shift from a r- to a K-selected strategy. The germinable seed bank represented 15.6%, of the total seed rain, out of which only 0.03% established as adult plants. About 72.7% of the adult plants were ephemeral. 27.0% modular and 0.3% coppiced plants. The highest contribution of the seed rain came from modular plants and the lowest contribution from coppiced plants. The survivorship curve of the coppiced plants exhibited a combination of Deevey type I and III curves. The ephemeral and modular plants showed steep curves. In contrast to ephemeral plants, the coppiced plants attained the highest reproductive value and the lowest reproductive effort, while the modular plants demonstrated intermediate values. The active phenological cycle started earlier in coppiced plants than in the modular and ephemeral plants, The period from the start of vegetative growth to shoot-die back extends from mid-December to early June in coppiced plants, from February to May in modular plants, and from late February to early May in ephemeral plants. The living stumps of the coppiced plants remained dormant during summer and autumn months. Seeds collected from coppiced plants attained high germinabiltiy and viability, while those from ephemeral and modular plants attained low values. Seed longevity was higher in the modular plants ( > 10 yr) than in seeds of ephemeral and coppiced plants (7-8 yr). The high energy content of the seeds produced from different cohorts over ten years of storage enabled the population to maximize the germinability, viability and longevity of seeds despite the unpredictable environment. The potential annual behaviour of D. harra is mainly attained by the persistence of viable seed bank and root-shoot stock. The ability to shift from a r- to a K-selected life-cycle, phenological variations among the different cohorts of the population, variations in seed longevity and energy content strengthen intra-population interactions.																	0906-7590					AUG	2001	24	4					403	412		10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.d01-196.x							WOS:000171753300004						
J	DeSimone, SA; Zedler, PH				DeSimone, SA; Zedler, PH			Do shrub colonizers of southern Californian grassland fit generalities for other woody colonizers?	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Grasslands are subject to woody plant invasions worldwide. To retain landscape mosaics of woody and grassland vegetation, preserve managers need to understand how vegetation boundaries shift. Woody plant colonization of grasslands without fire is widely known in mediterranean-climate regions, yet few generalities have emerged for woody colonizer traits or colonization processes. Here we report on our research into processes of grassland colonization by summer deciduous coastal sage scrub species of semiarid southern California. We used four coastal sage shrub dominants to elucidate dynamics of grassland colonization and within-stand replacement. We measured seed production, dispersal, and storage; seedling numbers; and growth and flowering for two years in three grassland-scrub sites. Traits of our four species matched those of native woody colonizers as described in other systems and included: recruitment over a range of site conditions, annual production of large seed crops, long-distance dispersal (into grassland), presence in grassland seed banks, seedling recruitment in gaps, rapid seedling growth, and low susceptibility to seedling herbivory. In a factorial experiment, we used our study species to test a set of hypotheses that explain grassland colonization by a northern Californian shrub species and found overall greater importance of biotic disturbances but less influence of water availability. Although generalities can be made about some native woody colonizer traits, to maintain mediterranean grassland-shrubland mosaics we encourage land managers to devise monitoring and management plans that sufficiently address local shrub species traits and environmental factors.																	1051-0761					AUG	2001	11	4					1101	1111		10.2307/3061015							WOS:000170209200013						
J	Seabloom, EW; Moloney, KA; van der Valk, AG				Seabloom, EW; Moloney, KA; van der Valk, AG			Constraints on the establishment of plants along a fluctuating water-depth gradient	ECOLOGY												We used simulation modeling to investigate the relative importance of current environmental conditions and factors affecting establishment of different plant species on the formation of vegetative zonation patterns. We compared the results from a series of six models that incorporated increasing amounts of information about key factors affecting species' ability to adjust to water-level fluctuations. We assessed model accuracy using aerial photographs taken of a 10-yr field experiment. in which 10 wetlands were flooded to 1 in above normal water level for 2 yr, drawn down for or 2 yr, and reflooded for 5 yr to three different water levels (normal, +0.3 in. +0.6 m). We compared each model's ability to predict relative areal cover of five dominant emergent species and to recreate the spatial structure of the landscape as measured by mean area of monospecific stands of vegetation and the degree to which the species were intermixed. The simplest model predicted post-treatment species distributions using logistic regressions based on initial species distributions along the water-depth gradient in the experimental wetlands. Subsequent models were based on germination, rhizomatous dispersal, and mortality functions implemented in each cell of a spatial grid. We tested the effect on model accuracy of incrementally adding data on five factors that can alter the composition and distribution of vegetative zones following a shift in environmental conditions: (1) spatial relationships between areas of suitable habitat (landscape geometry), (2) initial spatial distribution of adults, (3) the presence of ruderal species in the seed bank, (4) the distribution of seed densities in the seed bank, and (5) differential seedling survivorship. Because replicated, long-term data are generally not available, the evaluation of these models represents the first experimental test, of which we are aware, of the ability of a cellular-automaton-type model to predict changes in plant species' distributions. Establishment constraints, such as recruitment from the seed bank, were most important during low-water periods and immediately following a change in water depth. Subsequent to a drop in water level, the most detailed models made the most accurate predictions. The accuracy of all the models converged in 1-2 years after an increase in water level, indicating that current environmental conditions became more important under stable conditions than the effects of historical recruitment events.

J	Maron, JL; Simms, EL				Maron, JL; Simms, EL			Rodent-limited establishment of bush lupine: field experiments on the cumulative effect of granivory	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Plants often suffer substantial loss of seeds to consumers. However, because the seed-to-seedling transition is frequently ignored, quantitative estimates of the effects of seed consumers on plant population dynamics are rare. 2 We examined how post-dispersal seed predation by rodents affected seedling emergence and subsequent adult plant abundance of bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), a large N-fixing shrub common to coastal dunes in California. We monitored patterns of seedling emergence and survival over 3 years for seeds sown into exclosed and control plots. 3 We sowed additional cohorts of seeds in the second and third years and compared interannual variation in emergence patterns. 4 Rodent exclusion substantially reduced seedling emergence, with an average of 109 seedlings emerging over 3 years from 476 seeds sown in rodent exclusion plots vs. 26 from control plots. The intensity of granivory, however, varied between years, with rodent exclusion increasing emergence from seeds sown in year one, but not in year two. 5 Winter seedling mortality, due to cutworm herbivory, was similarly high in rodent-free and control plots, and its net impact was to reduce the difference in seedling abundance. Thus. by mid-summer in each of the three years, there were only marginally more seedlings in rodent-excluded vs. control plots. 6 The cumulative effect of protecting seeds, was, however, large. After 3 years, an average of four adult lupines were established in rodent-free plots, whereas only 0.5 were found in control plots and lupine biomass was more than 5-fold higher in exclusion plots. 7 Taken together, the results indicate that rodents play a critical role by limiting the abundance and biomass of a large N-fixing shrub in dunes.																	0022-0477					AUG	2001	89	4					578	588		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00560.x							WOS:000170666800007

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Canopy seed banks were analysed in post-fire stands of Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster, P. nigra, and P. pinea. We determined age when flowering begins, age of first cone bearing, presence of serotinous cones and cone-opening temperatures. 2 By 15 years after the fire, P. halepensis had developed a large canopy seed bank (3-100 x 10(4) seeds ha(-1)). Fruiting started at 5 years of age. More than 86% of the cones were serotinous and had opening temperatures from 49.3 to 51.3 degreesC. Cones from adult trees opened at lower temperatures than those from young trees. 3 A 16-year-old P. pinaster stand had a smaller seed bank (12 000 viable seeds ha(-1)) and a lower percentage of serotinous cones (66.7%), with lower cone-opening temperature (45.8 0.8 degreesC) and later first fruiting (12 years) than any of our three P halepensis populations. 4 Populations of P. nigra and P. pinea did not show any fire adaptations: flowering was insignificant even 15 years after fire, and none of the cones produced were serotinous. 5 Serotinous cones represent a fire-survival strategy for P. halepensis and P. pinaster. Early flowering is also necessary for successful post-fire colonization in species or populations where crown fires are frequent. Late flowering and non-serotinous cones of P. nigra and P. pinea suggest that they may have evolved where ignition leads only to low intensity ground fires.

J	Rice, KJ; Dyer, AR				Rice, KJ; Dyer, AR			Seed aging, delayed germination and reduced competitive ability in Bromus tectorum	PLANT ECOLOGY												In annual plants, increased competitive advantage has often been attributed to rapid germination and early establishment. In contrast, many annual species exhibit some degree of delayed germination (i.e., seed dormancy) that results in the formation of age structure within the seed population. Delayed germination can be an effective bet-hedging strategy in variable or unpredictable environments as a seed bank can buffer against years with reproductive failures and reduce the probability of local extinction. However, there has been little consideration of the direct effects of aging within the seed pool although the potential demographic costs of such a strategy (e.g., mortality in the seed bank or delayed reproduction) are well known. We used aged (4 year-old) and freshly produced seed from meadow steppe and sagebrush steppe populations of an annual grass (Bromus tectorum)to investigate the importance of seed age on seedling vigor and competitive ability. Aged seed from the meadow steppe population exhibited delays in germination that reduced plant growth and final biomass when the plants were grown with competition. Aged seed from the sagebrush steppe population did not exhibit delays in germination. By including a treatment that experimentally delayed the germination of freshly produced meadow steppe seed, we also examined the effects of delayed germination alone. A comparison of results from this delay treatment with those from the aged seed treatment suggested that the reduced competitive ability of meadow steppe plants produced from aged seed, although largely a result of the temporal delay in germination, was partly due to reduced seed vigor. Together these results indicate that physiological costs associated with seed age may affect aboveground competitive interactions and, in turn, the relative fitness of older cohorts in the soil seed bank.																	1385-0237					AUG	2001	155	2					237	243		10.1023/A:1013257407909							WOS:000172719500010						
J	Parrotta, JA; Knowles, OH				Parrotta, JA; Knowles, OH			Restoring tropical forests on lands mined for bauxite: Examples from the Brazilian Amazon	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns. Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species. Many of the: lessons learned at this site an applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and forest restoration programs worldwide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Turelli, M; Schemske, DW; Bierzychudek, P				Turelli, M; Schemske, DW; Bierzychudek, P			Stable two-allele polymorphisms maintained by fluctuating fitnesses and seed banks: Protecting the blues in Linanthus parryae	EVOLUTION												Motivated by data demonstrating fluctuating relative and absolute fitnesses for white- versus blue-flowered morphs of the desert annual Linanthus parryae, we present conditions under which temporally fluctuating selection and fluctuating contributions to a persistent seed bank will maintain a stable single-locus polymorphism. In L. parryae, blue flower color is determined by a single dominant allele. To disentangle the underlying diversity-maintaining mechanism from the mathematical complications associated with departures from Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies and dominance, we successively analyze a haploid model, a diploid model with three distinguishable genotypes, and a diploid model with complete dominance. For each model, we present conditions for the maintenance of a stable polymorphism, then use a diffusion approximation to describe the long-term fluctuations associated with these polymorphisms. Our protected polymorphism analyses show that a genotype whose arithmetic and geometric mean relative fitnesses are both less than one can persist if its relative fitness exceeds one in years that produce the most offspring. This condition is met by data from a population of L. parryae whose white morph has higher fitness (seed set) only in years of relatively heavy rain fall. The data suggest that the observed polymorphism may be explained by fluctuating selection. However, the yearly variation in flower color frequencies cannot be fully explained by our simple models, which ignore age structure and possible selection in the seed bank, We address two additional questions-one mathematical, the other biological-concerning the applicability of diffusion approximations to intense selection and the applicability of long-term predictions to datasets spanning decades for populations with long-lived seed banks.																	0014-3820					JUL	2001	55	7					1283	1298									WOS:000170699300002	11525453					
J	Guariguata, MR; Ostertag, R				Guariguata, MR; Ostertag, R			Neotropical secondary forest succession: changes in structural and functional characteristics	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In this review we highlight the main biotic and abiotic factors that influence the patterns of Neotropical secondary forest successions, referred as the woody vegetation that regrows after complete forest clearance due to human activities. We focus on both patterns of specie replacement and various processes that occur during succession, and suggest that the sequence of processes may be predictable even if species composition is not. We describe forest recovery with respect to old-growth conditions, which we define as the structure, function, and composition of the original forest before conversion, and we examine this recovery process within the context of type and intensity of past land use. The various phases of the recovery process are described in derail: from factors affecting early colonization, changes in light and soil properties, soil-vegetation feedbacks at initial and later successional stages, biomass accumulation, forest productivity, rates of species accumulation, and species composition. The consensus of these analyses is that the regenerative power of Neotropical forest vegetation is high, if propagule sources are close by and land use intensity before abandonment has not been severe. Nevertheless, the recovery of biophysical properties and vegetation is heavily dependent on the interactions between site-specific factors and land use, which makes it extremely difficult to predict successional trajectories in anthropogenic settings. We attempt, throughout this review, to integrate the structural and functional characteristics of secondary succession as a way to enhance our ability both to predict and manage successional forest ecosystems due to their increasing importance as timber sources, providers of environmental services, and templates for restoration purposes.

J	Garcia-Nunez, C; Azocar, A; Silva, JF				Garcia-Nunez, C; Azocar, A; Silva, JF			Seed production and soil seed bank in three evergreen woody species from a neotropical savanna	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Results of a 3-y study on the populations of three evergreen woody species (Byrsonima crassifolia, Palicourea rigida and Bowdichia virgilioides), from a regularly burnt savanna, in Venezuela, are reported. Tree density, size structure, fruit-seed production per tree of different size classes and soil seed bank were estimated. Viable seed production was one order of magnitude higher in B. crassifolia, which was also the only species with a permanent soil seed bank. Seeds of B. virgilioides germinated readily after dispersal, whilst seeds of P. rigida showed an innate dormancy synchronously released after a year. Both of the latter species seemed to maximize the first growth season by germinating at the beginning of the favourable season. In B. crassifolia, germination proceeds with an early small burst of germination, possibly followed by a second peak at the beginning of the next rainy season and little or no germination thereafter. The results showed that despite the high fire frequency, the studied species produce a substantial number of viable propagules, and have the capacity to germinate in field conditions (readiness depending on the species). Sexual reproduction is expected, therefore, to play an important role, as suggested by their reproductive investment, in longterm population maintenance.																	0266-4674	1469-7831				JUL	2001	17		4				563	576		10.1017/S0266467401001420							WOS:000170112400007						
J	Meerts, P; Grommesch, C				Meerts, P; Grommesch, C			Soil seed banks in a heavy-metal polluted grassland at Prayon (Belgium)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seed banks were investigated in a grassland dominated by Agrostis capillaris and Thlaspi caerulescens, established on soils polluted by atmospheric deposits of SO2 and heavy-metal rich dust (Zn, Pb, Cd) from an ore-smelter in Prayon (E Belgium). A total of 155 soil cores (0-7 depth) distributed among 10 plots were sampled in November and March. Each sampling plot was characterised for the botanical composition and standing biomass of the established vegetation as well as for four environmental parameters (soil pH and extractable zinc, volume percentage of stones, relative altitude within the site). Very high densities of germinable seeds were found (grand mean +/- SE, pooled over dates and plots: 28,950 +/- 6830 ). Agrostis capillaris represented 95% of the seeds, followed by Thlaspi caerulescens (3%); the remaining 2% were shared among 24 other species. Two thirds of the seeds were concentrated in the upper 3 of the soil. The high seed density might be due to a low rate of microbial decay of seeds due to heavy metal toxicity. The seed bank is almost entirely derived from those few heavy-metal tolerant species that have re-colonised the polluted area in the last three decades. Only two species (Anagallis arvensis and Urtica dioica) not represented in the established vegetation and with seeds concentrated in the lower soil layer are probably derived from seed buried prior to the onset of heavy-metal pollution. This study provides the first data suggesting that the heavy-metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens possesses persistent seed banks. Seed densities of Agrostis capillaris, Thlaspi caerulescens and Rumex acetosa were positively correlated with the standing biomass of grasses and negatively correlated with the volume percentage occupied by stones in the soil. It is argued that small-scale variation in microclimatic factors that cue germination (fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture) can account for the observed pattern of spatial variation in seed density. From the standpoint of restoration management, the results indicate that little change in the floristic composition of the heavy-metal tolerant grasslands of Prayon can be expected from the recruitment of buried seeds.																	1385-0237					JUL	2001	155	1					35	45		10.1023/A:1013234418314							WOS:000172718700004

These works have disconnected the largest part of the riparian forest from the river and interrupted the flooding. This study aims at assessing the effects of the flood interruption on woody regeneration in three hardwood stands: one still liable to flooding, the second one unflooded for 30 years and the third one unflooded for 130 years. Fieldwork was carried out to determine the species richness of seed rain, seed bank and extant vegetation of the regeneration understorey. The potential species richness was calculated using the first-order jackknife estimator. In addition, floristic composition and diversity indices of extant vegetation were calculated. Results show that species richness of the seed bank is lower than seed rain and extant vegetation. The species richness of the extant vegetation increases with the duration of interruption of the floods in the Rhine forest as a result of introduction of flood-intolerant species in the unflooded forest. Although species richness of the extant vegetation was the lowest in the flooded site, Shannon-Weaver diversity and equitability were found to be the highest, because the disturbance caused by floods allows a more equal coexistence of several species. Conversely, in the unflooded sites, a small number of species represent most of the woody individuals of the regeneration phase. Implications of flood restoration on species richness and diversity of the regeneration compartment are discussed.

J	Benvenuti, S; Macchia, M; Miele, S				Benvenuti, S; Macchia, M; Miele, S			Quantitative analysis of emergence of seedlings from buried weed seeds with increasing soil depth	WEED SCIENCE												Trials were carried out to investigate the effects of seed burial depth on seedling emergence rate of 20 weed species. Marked depth-mediated variation in emergence ability of different species was observed, together with a general pattern of decreasing emergence with increasing soil depth. At 10 cm, only johnsongrass, velvetleaf, catchweed bedstraw, and cutleaf geranium emerged, albeit only, in limited numbers. Species most severely inhibited by burial depth were buckhorn plantain, large crabgrass, common purslane, chickweed, and corn spurry, none of which emerged from beyond 6 cm. In all species, depth-mediated inhibition was found to be sigmoidal (polynomial regression). In addition, the number of seedlings and rate of the number of emerged seedlings was halved varied by species and ranged from 3.6 cm for common purslane and chickweed to 7 cm for velvetleaf and catchweed bedstraw. Excessive burial depth generally induced dormancy (in roughly 85% of cases) rather than suicide germination. A close inverse relation (second-degree equation) between seed unit weight and depth-mediated inhibition was observed. The physiological involvement of depth inhibition in seed bank ecology is discussed.																	0043-1745					JUL-AUG	2001	49	4					528	535		10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0528:QAOEOS]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000175241900014

Velvetleaf survival ranged from 46 to 81% when treated with 420 g ae/ha glyphosate, whereas survival ranged from 13 to 37% at the 840 g/ha rate. At two locations, velvetleaf survival was greater when treated at the 12- to 17-cm height compared with application to either 8- to 10- or 20- to 30-cm-tall plants. Growth of plants surviving glyphosate application was greatly reduced, with the high glyphosate rate reducing velvetleaf aboveground biomass by over 90% compared to untreated plants. A linear relationship between biomass and capsule number was observed for both control plants and plants surviving glyphosate, both having slopes of approximately one. Velvetleaf surviving glyphosate treatment should have minimal impact on soybean yield due to reduced growth; however, surviving plants may replenish the seed bank, leading to future management problems.																	0890-037X					JUL-SEP	2001	15	3					492	496		10.1614/0890-037X(2001)015[0492:RFOVAT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000175240900016						
J	Kirmer, A; Mahn, EG				Kirmer, A; Mahn, EG			Spontaneous and initiated succession on unvegetated slopes in the abandoned lignite-mining area of Goitsche, Germany	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												In this study, we examined the colonization of unvegetated, dry slopes in the lignite-mining area of Goitsche, Germany. The plots, characterized by different habitat conditions, were studied from 1994-2000. The vegetation development on treated plots was compared to untreated plots showing spontaneous succession. For initial treatments we used fresh plant clippings from a species-rich sandy grassland (Armerion elongatae) mowed at the end of July. Soil seed bank samples, taken at the beginning of the experiments and cultivated for 18 months, confirmed that the vegetation development on the slopes started with primary succession. Because seed rain is considered to be an important factor in primary succession, we also studied the diaspore input during the First year. The hospitable Quaternary substrate of Site I (pH = 4.1-4.7, 92% sand) supports fast vegetation development on treated and untreated plots. On treated plots, we have identified plant assemblages similar to initial stages of the Armerion elongatae community. On control plots, Coryne-phorion communities have established spontaneously. At Site 11 (mixed Quaternary and Tertiary substrate, pH = 3.0-3.5, 40% sand) the total cover and number of psammophytic species was low. Treated plots showed development towards ruderal sandy grassland, but the establishment of Calamagrostis epigejos would eventually lead to monodominant stands. Untreated control plots showed basically the same pattern, however the development was slower. At Site III (pH = 1.8-2.8, 34% sand), the hostile Tertiary substrate impeded the succession on both treated and untreated plots because low pH and therefore high amounts of Al3+ produced elemental toxicity to plants. The application of plant clippings accelerated the vegetation development in sites with a pH exceeding 3. On plots with the initial treatment, vegetation cover and total number of species were higher than on untreated plots. The application of fresh plant clippings from areas with similar habitat conditions appears to be a viable alternative to traditional restoration methods.

The colonization and establishment of target species in permanent plots was recorded during the first nine years after restoration measures were taken. For each permanent plot abiotic site conditions were used to determine which of the vegetation types could persist there. A comparison of the actual vegetation in the permanent plots with reference releves of the selected vegetation type revealed a gradually increasing similarity during consecutive years for five vegetation types. This was due to the occurrence of an increasing number of target species and the number of permanent plots they occurred in. However, nine years after top-soil removal a large number of the target species were still lacking from the vegetation in the permanent plots, although most were present in the local species pool. Seed dispersal therefore seems to be a major limiting factor for restoration of these low-production vegetation types on formerly agricultural soils.					van Diggelen, Rudy/0000-0001-8053-945X												1402-2001					JUN	2001	4	1					75	82		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00236.x							WOS:000174290900009						
J	Cubina, A; Aide, TM				Cubina, A; Aide, TM			The effect of distance from forest edge on seed rain and soil seed bank in a tropical pasture	BIOTROPICA												Although lack of seeds can limit forest recovery in abandoned agricultural lands, few studies have documented the patterns of seed rain and soil seed bank in active pastures. To determine if lack of seeds is a limiting factor, we studied the woody species composition of the seed rain and soil seed bank in an active pasture in Barranquitas, puerto Rico. In addition, fruit production of 45 common shrub and tree species was monitored in the surrounding secondary forest. Seed rain was monitored for one year at -2, 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 m from the forest edge along six transects. The soil seed bank was sampled in January/February 1995 and October/November 1995 at the same distances from the forest edge along ten transects. Of the 35 species that produced fruits in the forest, 14 species were detected in the seed rain study and only 0.3 percent: of the seeds and 3 species dispersed ro more man 4 m from the forest: edge. Two of the three species were dispersed by wind. The seed bank study showed a similar pattern with a dramatic decrease in seedling density and species richness with distance from the forest edge. More than 50 percent of the seedlings in the seed bank study were Trema lamarckianum. This study demonstrated that few seeds disperse into the pastures and even when a rare dispersal event occurs, species do not accumulate because of short-term seed viability and, possibly, high seed predation. Studies of early secondary forest regeneration have shown that in some cases, forest can recover rapidly in abandoned agricultural lands; bur our results suggest that only a small subset of the forest species will contribute to the initial recovery process.																	0006-3606					JUN	2001	33	2					260	267		10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0260:TEODFF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000169772000005						
J	Touzard, B; Clement, B				Touzard, B; Clement, B			Plant diversity dynamics in an eutrophic alluvial reed bed after experimental small-scale disturbances	BOTANICA HELVETICA												In an eutrophic alluvial reed bed in western France, artificial disturbances (mowing) and natural disturbances (cattle, roebucks, boars, voles...) are very frequent. In order to mime these disturbances, experimental small-scale disturbances of various intensities were generated in April 1996 after the end of the winter flooding. The two first intensities of disturbances (I1 and I2) were created by herbicide contact (Round-up (R)) associated (I2) or not (I1) with litter removal. Intensity 3 (I3) corresponded to the mechanic removal of the top of the soil. In intensity 4 (I4), seed bank was removed by exporting the top 10 cm of the soil. The size of disturbances (1 m(2)) was chosen to mime natural disturbances. Subsequent changes in cover, species composition and some diversity indexes (species richness, species diversity, spatial heterogeneity, evenness, dominance) were observed over one following vegetation cycle from May 1996 to August 1996 and compared to undisturbed vegetation. After four months of recolonisation, disturbances removed significantly species composition in disturbed areas. Plant recolonisation and plant diversity dynamics depended on the intensity of disturbances. The results showed the role of disturbances in plant diversity dynamics and in particular in the maintenance of biological diversity at the scale of the marsh. In the context of a gradient of disturbances intensities, the results confirmed the framework of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978, Grime 1979, Huston 1979) which shows that species richness or diversity is maximum at an intermediate intensity of disturbances.

J	Dhileepan, K				Dhileepan, K			Effectiveness of introduced biocontrol insects on the weed Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae) in Australia	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Six species of insects and a rust fungus have been successfully established for biocontrol of the weed Parthenicum hysterophorus L. in Queensland, Australia. Effectiveness of biocontrol insects was evaluated at two properties in Queensland during 1996-97 based on an exclusion experiment using insecticides. Parthenium-infested plots with and without biocontrol insects were sampled at monthly intervals and the impact of biocontrol insects on parthenium at individual plant and whole population levels monitored. Biocontrol insects were more effective at Mt Panorama (central Queensland) than at Plain Creek (north Queensland). At Mt Panorama, the leaf-feeding beetle Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister caused 96% defoliation and the stem-galling moth Epiblema strenuana Walker affected 100% of the plants, resulting in reductions of 90% in weed density, 40% in plant height, and 82% in flower production. Exclusion of biocontrol insects resulted in a 52% increase in seedling emergence and a seven-fold increase in the soil seed bank in the following season. At Plain Creek, E. strenuana was the only prominent agent. It affected 92% of the plants and prevented 32% of plants from producing any flowers, reduced plant height by 40% and flower production by 49%, but did not reduce the plant biomass, weed density or soil seed bank. However, exclusion of biocontrol insects resulted in an eight-fold increase in the soil seed bank in the following season.

J	Jaksic, FM				Jaksic, FM			Ecological effects of El Nino in terrestrial ecosystems of western South America	ECOGRAPHY												I make a summary review of how El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) determines peculiar atmospheric and oceanographic conditions in western South America, thus affecting precipitation patterns in adjacent land masses, with cascading effects on marine and terrestrial plants, on sea and land birds, and on marine and terrestrial mammals. With regard to terrestrial ecosystems, I discuss the following biotic responses to El Nino-driven precipitation: 1) aboveground vegetation flushes immediately among herbs but not among shrubs. 2) The seed bank is quickly replenished of ephemeral seeds, but perennial seeds recover one year later. 3) Small rodents irrupt within months of El Nino arrival, but larger ones take a full year to increase. 4) Predator numbers lag one year behind their mammal prey, with smaller predators responding more: quickly. Considering these responses, I offer a simplified model of El Nino-driven bottom-up control in terrestrial ecosystems of western South America. Apart from the direct links already described, there is a weak feedback loop between the plant compartments (vegetation and seeds) and their herbivores: primary productivity is the driving force, and is little affected by herbivory. Another weak Feedback loop links herbivores and their predators: the latter seem to just "surf" over prey levels, skimming excess prey.				jaksic, Fabian m/G-1705-2014													0906-7590	1600-0587				JUN	2001	24	3					241	250		10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.240301.x							WOS:000169881400001						
J	Dupre, C; Diekmann, M				Dupre, C; Diekmann, M			Differences in species richness and life-history traits between grazed and abandoned grasslands in southern Sweden	ECOGRAPHY												Disturbance has profound effects on plant community composition. This paper deals with the influence of grazing on species richness and proportions of life-history attributes of grassland vegetation at six spatial scales (0.001-1000 m(2)) in two provinces of southern Sweden. The study comprised 33 dry grassland sites, including 22 grazed and 11 abandoned localities, and 28 sites of coastal brackish meadows, divided into five management types (From "heavily grazed" to "abandoned since long time"). In general grazed sites were species-richer than abandoned sites; especially at small plot sizes. However, there was a steeper increase in species number rewards larger plot sizes in the abandoned sites. Heavy grazing in the coastal meadows resulted in a comparatively low number of species, corroborating the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The analysis of life-history traits indicated the importance of taxonomic group, canopy structure, height, regenerative strategy and, in particular, life form. Leaf anatomy and seed dispersal seemed to be less important. The responses to grazing as regards species traits differed somewhat between grassland types. Grazed sites generally had high proportions of legumes, therophytes, species with basal position of leaves and with regeneration by means of a persistent seed bank. Abandonment of grazing favoured monocots, geophytes, species with vegetative regeneration and (partly) leafy canopy structure. Some differences between grazed and abandoned sites were confined to either the smallest or largest plot sizes, indicating different responses of matrix and interstitial species. Various positive associations (attribute syndromes) or negative associations between individual traits were identified. There was, for example, a positive link between the attributes "geophytes" and "ability of vegetative regeneration". The recognition of such links is important to avoid misinterpreting certain attributes as functional adaptations to grazing while they are only positively correlated to other attributes of larger significance.

J	Kaj, I; Krone, SM; Lascoux, M				Kaj, I; Krone, SM; Lascoux, M			Coalescent theory for seed bank models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY												We study the genealogical structure of samples from a population for which any given generation is made up of direct descendants from several previous generations. These occur in nature when there are seed banks or egg banks allowing an individual to leave offspring several generations in the future. We show how this temporal structure in the reproduction mechanism causes a decrease in the coalescence rate. We also investigate the effects of age-dependent neutral mutations. Our main result gives weak convergence of the scaled ancestral process, with the usual diffusion scaling, to a coalescent process which is equivalent to a time-changed version of Kingman's coalescent.

J	Chang, ER; Jefferies, RL; Carleton, TJ				Chang, ER; Jefferies, RL; Carleton, TJ			Relationship between vegetation and soil seed banks in an arctic coastal marsh	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The effects of habitat degradation on the soil seed bank at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba are described. Foraging by lesser snow geese leads to loss of vegetation, coupled with changes in soil abiotic conditions and an increase in salinity. 2 The density of seeds and the relative abundance in the seed bank of species characteristic of undisturbed sites decrease following degradation, while the relative abundance of invasive species increases. Vegetation loss had the greatest impact on seed banks of stress-tolerant species and the least impact on species with many widely dispersed seeds. 3 The above-ground vegetation and below-ground seed bank were less similar in undamaged plots than in disturbed plots. In spite of the low degree of similarity, redundancy analysis of the data indicated that approximately half of the variation in the soil seed bank could be explained by the vegetation data and vice versa. 4 More recently degraded soils had richer soil seed banks than those from older disturbances. Site-specific factors not only influenced the species present but also the time lag between loss of vegetation and loss of the seed bank. Seed banks in these impacted and fragmented sites do not recover quickly. 5 Seed banks in sandy beach-ridges were less affected by degradation due to the greater proportion of ruderals present in the original vegetation and the absence of the high soil salinities that are characteristic of degraded salt-marsh soils.																	0022-0477					JUN	2001	89	3					367	384		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00549.x							WOS:000169689900005						
J	Lennartsson, T; Oostermeijer, JGB				Lennartsson, T; Oostermeijer, JGB			Demographic variation and population viability in Gentianella campestris: effects of grassland management and environmental stochasticity	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Transition matrix models were used to evaluate the effects of environmental stochasticity and four different methods of grassland management on dynamics and viability of a population of the biennial Gentianella campestris (Gentianaceae) in species-rich grassland. Data were collected between 1990 and 1995. 2 Continuous summer grazing, the prevailing management strategy in Scandinavian grasslands, resulted in high recruitment of new plants, mainly because litter accumulation was prevented and gaps were created by trampling. Trampling and repeated grazing, however, caused damage which reduced seed production. Lambda for the average matrix was c. 0.77, and a stochastic matrix model yielded an extinction probability for the total population of c. 0.08 within 50 years. 3 Mowing in mid-July (used as a conservation tool) increased seed production, but litter accumulation following re-growth of the vegetation prevented establishment. Lambda and extinction risk were similar to continuous grazing. 4 Mowing in October (another conservation tool) promoted recruitment because of low litter accumulation, but the seed output decreased because plant growth was impaired by tall vegetation. Lambda was 0.64, while the extinction probability was very high (c. 0.98 within 50 years), 5 Mid-July mowing followed by autumn grazing (the historical management regime) yielded high values for both seed production and establishment of rosettes. Lambda was 0.94 and the probability of extinction within 50 years was below detection level. 6 Log-linear analysis showed that the matrices differed significantly both between treatments and between years. The latter indicates environmental stochasticity, here caused by summer drought that increased the extinction risk. Lambda may be slightly underestimated because drought occurred in one out of five summers during the study period, which is high compared with the natural frequency. 7 We conclude that traditional grassland management is more favourable for G. campestris than the methods that prevail in Scandinavia today. This indicates a serious conservation problem, because grazing has replaced traditional management in many of the remaining semi-natural grasslands throughout Europe.
