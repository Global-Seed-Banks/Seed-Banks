J	Egawa, C; Tsuyuzaki, S				Egawa, Chika; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro			The effects of litter accumulation through succession on seed bank formation for small- and large-seeded species	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsHow does litter accumulation through succession affect secondary seed dispersal and buried seed viability and consequently control seed bank formation for small- and large-seeded species? LocationA post-mined peatland in northern Japan (45 degrees 06N, 141 degrees 42E) where the chronological sequence of plant community succession is known. MethodsThe movements of seeds after reaching the ground surface and the availability of viable seeds potentially contributing to seed bank formation at various depths were experimentally investigated for 1yr in four species that produce different-sized seeds: Drosera rotundifolia (seed mass 0.01mg), Lobelia sessilifolia (0.25mg), Rhynchospora alba (0.87mg) and Moliniopsis japonica (1.82mg). The experiments were conducted in three successional stages with 0-, 4- and 9-cm thick litter layers. ResultsSeed emigration decreased and seed retention increased with an increase in litter thickness. Large seeds were retained within the litter throughout the experimental period, and fewer seeds were buried in peat compared to small seeds trapped by thick litter, which had shifted downward by the following early spring. Litter contributed to increasing the number of viable and ungerminated seeds. The number of viable seeds for all species was nearly zero on the bare peat surface. The numbers of viable seeds on and beneath the peat surface increased with increases in litter cover thickness. ConclusionsThe patterns of secondary seed dispersal and the availability of viable seeds were altered by litter accumulation through the progress of succession. Moreover, the effects of litter on seeds varied among species for which seed size differed. Overall, our results suggest that temporal changes in litter thickness through the progress of succession can play an important role in seed bank formation, which has potential impacts on the long-term dynamics of plant populations and the whole community.

DNA barcoding for conservation, seed banking and ecological restoration of Acacia in the Midwest of Western Australia	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												We used DNA barcoding to address an important conservation issue in the Midwest of Western Australia, working on Australia's largest genus of flowering plant. We tested whether or not currently recommended plant DNA barcoding regions (matK and rbcL) were able to discriminate Acacia taxa of varying phylogenetic distances, and ultimately identify an ambiguously labelled seed collection from a mine-site restoration project. Although matK successfully identified the unknown seed as the rare and conservation priority listed A. karina, and was able to resolve six of the eleven study species, this region was difficult to amplify and sequence. In contrast, rbcL was straightforward to recover and align, but could not determine the origin of the seed and only resolved 3 of the 11 species. Other chloroplast regions (rpl32-trnL, psbA-trnH, trnL-F and trnK) had mixed success resolving the studied taxa. In general, species were better resolved in multilocus data sets compared to single-locus data sets. We recommend using the formal barcoding regions supplemented with data from other plastid regions, particularly rpl32-trnL, for barcoding in Acacia. Our study demonstrates the novel use of DNA barcoding for seed identification and illustrates the practical potential of DNA barcoding for the growing discipline of restoration ecology.

J	Ge, XL; Wang, RQ; Zhang, YR; Song, BM; Liu, J				Ge, Xiuli; Wang, Renqing; Zhang, Yiran; Song, Baimin; Liu, Jian			The soil seed banks of typical communities in wetlands converted from farmlands by different restoration methods in Nansi Lake, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Converting farmlands into wetlands is a widely used restoration engineering technique in China. To elucidate the ecological succession in restored wetlands, the background characteristics and the effects of the restoration method on seed banks should be analyzed. On the basis of seedling emergence method, we examined the seed banks of typical plant communities in wetlands that were converted from farmlands from the mouth of the Xinxue River to the Nansi Lake in China. The effects of the restoration methods on the seed banks of the typical communities were analyzed over three seasons. Results show that 43 species exist in the germinable seed banks of the wetlands converted from farmlands in the Nansi Lake area. The average seed density is 2822 seed/m(2) (0-12,499 seed/m(2)), and some species have persistent seed banks. Species abundance and seed density vary among different communities. The Populus nigra community has the most abundant species in the seed bank, followed by the Phragmites australis, Potamogeton crispus, and Nelumbo nucifera communities. The restoration method, season, community type, and their interaction are found to exert varying effects on the characteristics of the seed bank. Findings suggest the presence of a particular quantity of seed reserves in the seed banks of the wetlands; i. e., certain species with persistent seed banks can be used to restore wetland vegetation. Restoration methods significantly influence different seed banks. The restoration mechanism might be attributed to the differences in seed resource and seed loss. The diverse strategies of propagation by various species and the emerging characteristics lead to the differences among the seed banks of different communities and the seed banks in different seasons. Thus, the effects of the restoration method on the soil seed banks in the restoration of wetland vegetation need further investigation. c 2013 Elsevier B. V.

However, there are still significant gaps between the concept and its application. We selected nine proxy indicators (plant species, soil seed banks, soil microbes, soil animals, birds, soil age, soil pollen, soil mineral distribution, and light environment) and developed a method to quantify ecological memory and succession in a subtropical forest succession in South China. Taking the climax-monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest as the reference ecosystem, we found that ecological memory increased nonlinearly and accumulated following a specific assembly rule during succession. Memory concerning major soil microbes and soil animals, which improve the soil substrate, mainly accumulated from the initial to the early successional stage. Memory concerning the number of bird species and the availability of light, which ensure a source of regenerative seeds and the survival of understory seedlings, mainly accumulated from the early to middle successional stages. Memory concerning vegetation and soil seed banks mainly accumulated late in succession, guaranteeing that the ecosystem would reach the regional climax stage. Prospective memory was greater than retrospective memory in every successional stage except the late stage, which indicated that all stages but the late stage were undergoing progressive succession. Our study demonstrates that the concept of ecological memory and the proposed evaluation framework are useful for guiding research on succession and restoration, and especially for assessing how "far" a restored ecosystem is from a reference ecosystem or how far a restored ecosystem has deviated from its natural succession trajectory.

Effects of light/darkness, thermal shocks and inhibitory components on germination of Pinus canariensis, Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinea	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Knowledge of the germination characteristics of Pinus species can help in the understanding, prediction and management of the regeneration of pine forests. In the Canary Islands, several exotic pines (Pinus halepensis L. and Pinus pinea L.) were planted with Pinus canariensis Chr. Sm. Ex DC, the only native pine species, and there is now an interest in controlling these exotic species to restore the original forest. The main objective of the present study is to determine the germination response of P. canariensis, P. halepensis and P. pinea to different light regimes (darkness and light/darkness), thermal shocks and the presence of inhibitory substances from the leaves and litter of P. canariensis. P. halepensis seeds showed the highest viability and germination rate. Darkness accelerated P. halepensis germination, while exudates accelerated P. canariensis germination. Only treatments of 200 A degrees C for 5 min and 300 A degrees C for 5 min significantly decreased the germination of all three pine species. In the absence of strong differences in germination among species after treatments, the key for fire management or prescribed burning in this case may be the sprouting ability of P. canariensis. A possible management strategy to control the two obligate seeder exotic species could be to use one intense prescribed fire followed by a low-intensity prescribed fire after seed bank germination in the field, so in this way, only P. canariensis could resprout after fire and it would eliminate only the exotic pines in a mixed stand.

J	Lippok, D; Walter, F; Hensen, I; Beck, SG; Schleuning, M				Lippok, Denis; Walter, Florian; Hensen, Isabell; Beck, Stephan G.; Schleuning, Matthias			Effects of disturbance and altitude on soil seed banks of tropical montane forests	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Vast areas of tropical forests have been deforested by human activities, resulting in landscapes comprising forest fragments in matrices of deforested habitats. Soil seed banks (SSB) are essential sources for the regeneration of tropical forests after disturbance. In a fragmented montane landscape in the Bolivian Andes, we investigated SSB in three different habitat types that were associated with different degrees of disturbance, i.e. in forest interior, at forest edges and in deforested habitats. Sampling of habitats was replicated at six sites ranging in altitude from 1950 to 2450 m asl. We extracted seeds from dried soil samples by sieving, classified seeds into morphospecies and size classes, and characterized SSB in terms of density, species richness and composition. We tested effects of disturbance (i.e. habitat type) and altitude on SSB characteristics. Overall, small seeds (<1 mm) dominated SSB (81% of sampled seeds). Seed density and species richness were lowest in deforested habitats, especially in large seeds and distant from adjacent forests (>= 20 m), while small-seeded species were most numerous near forest margins. Species turnover between habitats was high. Altitude altered the composition of SSB, but had no effects on seed density and species richness. We conclude that the potential of SSB for natural regeneration of deforested habitats is low and decreases with increasing distance from forest remnants and that forest edges may be eventually invaded by small-seeded species from deforested habitats.

(2) Does herbivory modulate climate effects on soil seed banks? (3) Is this effect mediated by changes in the above-ground vegetation? (4) To what extent do environmental conditions affect similarity between the total and persistent seed banks, and between above-ground (vegetation) vs below-ground (seed bank) community compartments? LocationEcuadorian Dry Mountain Scrub Ecosystem. MethodsOur study was conducted along a climatic gradient (altitude) under two different management conditions: undisturbed and grazed. The effect of grazing, altitude and their interaction on seed abundance and richness of the total and persistent soil seed banks were evaluated with non-linear mixed models. ResultsAltitude, grazing and their interaction exerted a significant effect on richness and abundance of the total seed bank, but not on the persistent seed bank. At highly stressful climate conditions, differences in species richness between the total and persistent seed banks were small or absent, while at milder environmental conditions the total seed bank showed greater seed species richness and abundance than the persistent one. However, under grazing conditions, species richness in both seed banks was rather similar along the climatic gradient. Relationships in terms of species richness between above-ground vs below-ground compartments, shifted from being dominated by the above-ground component at low altitudes (more stress) to being dominated by the seed bank component at higher elevations (milder conditions). In grazed locations, vegetation and seed bank showed similar species richness throughout the altitudinal gradient. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that not only climate acted as a key environmental filter on soil seed bank properties, but also that grazing greatly modulated the primary effect of climate. Nevertheless, the effect of climate and grazing was restricted to the total seed bank (the fertility compartment) and no effect was observed in the persistent seed bank (longevity compartment). In this tropical dry scrub, richness and abundance of seeds increased upwards along the altitudinal gradient, most likely because at higher altitudes environmental conditions improve and become more benign for plant development.

The classical methods for detecting seed viability are time consuming and frequently cause seed damage and unwanted germination. We have established a novel micro-optrode technique (MOT) to measure seed viability in a quick and non-invasive manner by measuring the oxygen influxes of intact seeds, approximately 10 seconds to screen one seed. Here, we used soybean, wheat, and oilseed rape as models to test our method. After 3-hour imbibition, oxygen influxes were recorded in real-time with the total measurement taking less than 5 minutes. The results indicated a significantly positive correlation between oxygen influxes and viability in all 3 seed types. We also established a linear equation between oxygen influxes and seed viability for each seed type. For measurements, seeds were kept in the early imbibition stage without germination. Thus, MOT is a reliable, quick, and low-cost seed viability detecting technique.

These alterations can negatively affect native wetland plant communities. Our objective was to determine if restored wetlands are developing plant communities similar to reference wetland conditions following hydrologic restoration. For this study, hydrology was restored via sediment removal. Thirty-four playa wetlands in reference, restored, and agricultural condition within the Rainwater Basin Region of Nebraska were sampled in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, reference and restored wetlands had higher species richness and more native, annual, and perennial species than agricultural wetlands. Restored wetlands had similar exotic species richness compared to reference and agricultural wetlands; however, reference wetlands contained more than agricultural wetlands. Restored wetlands proportion of exotics was 3.5 and 2 times less than agricultural wetlands and reference wetlands respectively. In 2009, reference and restored wetlands had higher species richness, more perennial species, and more native species than agricultural wetlands. Restored wetlands contained a greater number and proportion of annuals than reference and agricultural wetlands. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that reference, restored, and agricultural wetlands are dominated by different plant species and guilds. Restored wetland plant communities do not appear to be acting as intermediates between reference and agricultural wetland conditions or on a trajectory to reach reference conditions. This may be attributed to differing seed bank communities between reference and restored wetlands, dispersal limitations of perennial plant guilds associated with reference wetland conditions, and/or management activities may be preventing restored wetlands from reaching reference status.

The study was conducted in the National Forest of Sao Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil, using six conglomerates (I ha), with 16 plots (20 x 20 m) each, disregarding 10 m surround. The sampling of the seed rain (SR) was carried out in 96 circular collectors (1 m(2)), distributed in the center of each plot. The soil seed bank (SB) was sampled randomly in a distance of 3 m of each SR collector and the seedling bank (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2 x 2 m, located 4 m from SR collectors, counting the number of individuals (height >= 30 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1 cm) for each species. The regeneration mechanisms were evaluated through the floristic composition and horizontal structure. In SR, were sampled 81 species, 46 genera and 28 families, in SB, 103, 65 and 41, and in SeB, 88, 57 and 36, respectively The richness found and the presence of species with abundant fruiting and seed dispersal by animals, indicate the importance of seed rain as a strategic mechanism for the balance of flora and fauna in the ecosystem. The soil seed bank demonstrates potential for colonization and immediate restoration of vegetation after disturbances and the seedling bank is the main strategy for regeneration of many tree species that make up the current structure of the forest.

Hand Pulling Following Mowing and Herbicide Treatments Increases Control of Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Extensive areas in the upper Midwest have been invaded by spotted knapweed, and effective management strategies are required to reestablish native plant communities. We examined effects of mowing, mowing plus clopyralid, or mowing plus glyphosate in factorial combination with hand pulling and burning on knapweed abundances on a knapweed-infested site in western Michigan. We applied mowing and herbicide treatments in summer 2008, and seeded all plots with native grasses and forbs in spring 2009. We conducted the knapweed pulling treatment from 2009 to 2012 in July. The prescribed burn was conducted in April 2012. By 2012, hand pulling reduced adult lmapweed densities to 0.57 +/- 0.12 m(-2) (0.053 +/- 0.011 ft(-2)) (mean +/- SE), which was 5.8% of nonpulled treatments, juvenile densities to 0.29 +/- 0.07 m(-2) (2.1% of nonpulled treatments), and seedling densities to 0.07 +/- 0.06 m(-2) (2.6% of nonpulled treatments). After 3 yr, hand pulling reduced seed bank densities to 68 +/- 26 m(-2) as compared to 524 +/- 254 m(-2) in nonpulled treatments and 369 +/- 66 m(-2) in adjacent untreated areas of the study site. Without hand pulling, effects of mowing or mowing plus glyphosate were short-lived and allowed knapweed to rapidly resurge. In comparison, although a single mowing plus clopyralid treatment maintained significantly reduced densities of knapweed for 4 yr, by 2012 knapweed biomass in the nonpulled clopyralid treatment was approximately 60% of that in the other nonpulled treatments. Burning had minimal impacts on knapweed densities regardless of treatment combination, probably as a result of low fire intensity. Results demonstrated that persistent hand pulling used as a follow-up to single mowing or mowing plus herbicide treatments can be an effective practice for treating isolated spotted knapweed infestations or for removing small numbers of knapweed that survive herbicide applications.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT-DEC	2013	6	4					470	479		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00063.1							WOS:000328803000002

Effectiveness and Cost of Downy Brome (Bromus tectorum) Control at High Elevation	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Downy brome (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive, annual grass that has spread through much of the Great Basin desert but remains patchy at high elevation. This study evaluates control options for outlier infestations in the eastern Sierra Nevada, CA, based on their ecological effectiveness and their economic and practical feasibility. I tested the efficacy of hand-pulling, sheet-mulching, and soil solarization followed by broadcast and seedball seeding of native forbs and grasses. Downy brome cover, density, and dominance in the seed bank decreased with all removal treatments. Soil solarization and sheet mulching were most successful at eliminating downy brome (decreasing density by 99% after just 1 yr of treatment in both cases), but they had negative nontarget impacts on other herbaceous species. Germination of native seeds was low with both broadcast and seedball seeding, probably because of dry conditions. Each of the methods tested has potential for decreasing or eliminating small-scale, outlier infestations of downy brome along roadsides and in disturbed sites and thereby helping to contain the invasion.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT-DEC	2013	6	4					502	511		10.1614/IPSM-D-13-00008.1							WOS:000328803000005

Treatment Alternatives and Timing Affect Seeds of African Mustard (Brassica tournefortii), an Invasive Forb in American Southwest Arid Lands	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Developing management strategies for invasive plant species requires identifying effective treatment methods (e.g., physical or chemical treatments) and optimally timing their application. For invasive annual plants, effects of treatments on seed production and germinability are paramount to reduce seed banks and subsequent plant establishment. We compared effects of a range of physical and chemical treatments applied to plants containing seeds at different developmental stages at field sites in the Mojave Desert (Nevada and Arizona) for managing the exotic annual forb, African mustard. Effectiveness of physical treatments (hand pulling entire plants, breaking plants, or separating siliques from plants) for reducing African mustard seed size and germination varied by treatment and seed maturity stage at which treatments were applied. With all treated plant material remaining in the field (i.e., not bagged and transported off site), hand pulling or breaking plants resulted in 90 to 100% of developing and developed seeds still able to germinate. Separating siliques from plants, however, resulted in 0% germination of undeveloped and developing seeds. All three tested herbicides (glyphosate, 2,4-D, and metsulfuron) reduced germination to zero or near zero across all seed development stages. Results suggest that physical treatments are most effective at early stages of seed development, whereas several different herbicides are effective across seed developmental stages. Results also highlight the importance of considering the potential for continued seed development and germinability on treated plant material when choosing invasive plant treatment types and timing.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT-DEC	2013	6	4					559	567		10.1614/IPSM-D-13-00022.1							WOS:000328803000011

Response of Four Summer Annual Weed Species to Mowing Frequency and Height	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Greenhouse experiments were conducted in 2011 to evaluate the effect of mowing frequency and mowing height on four summer annual weed species (large crabgrass, barnyardgrass, giant ragweed, and common lambsquarters). Plants were clipped at three heights (5, 10, or 20 cm) and at two frequencies (single clipping or repeated clippings at the same height) to simulate mowing. A nonclipped control was also grown for each species. When clipped once, large crabgrass, barnyardgrass, and giant ragweed produced at least 90 % of the total dry weight (DW) of the nonclipped plants, and common lambsquarters produced at least 75 %. A single cut was generally not sufficient to prevent weed seed production or kill any of the weeds in this study. Repeated clipping reduced large crabgrass, giant ragweed, and common lambsquarters reproductive DW to 46, 27, and 10 % respectively, of the nonclipped control. Barnyardgrass plants that were repeatedly clipped produced between 0 and 8% of the seed DW of nonclipped plants, depending on clipping height. Repeated clipping reduced weed total DW to below 40 % for all species compared to nonclipped plants. Our results suggest that, unless combined with other weed management practices, repeated mowing may be necessary to limit the growth and seed production of these weed species.

Samples were collected during two periods: February/March and June/July, 2010. SSB presented the greatest number of species per vegetation evaluated in the two sampling periods. Clay content had a positive effect leading to greater weed density in all areas (UCO, USC and UPA) in at least one of the densities (0-10 and 10-20 cm). On the other hand, sand content, when significant, presented a negative correlation with plant density in all the SSB areas analyzed. The pH negatively influenced the density of the species found through the phyto-sociological survey at USC and UPA. Cyperus rotundus, dominant in all areas, correlated positively with phosphorus, potassium, and clay content and negatively with pH and high sand content.

EFFECT OF DESICCATION AND SALINITY STRESS ON SEED GERMINATION AND INITIAL PLANT GROWTH OF Cucumis melo	PLANTA DANINHA												Smellmelon, an annual invasive weed of soybean production fields in the north of Iran, reproduces and spreads predominately through seed production. This makes seed bank survival and successful germination essential steps in the invasive process. To evaluate the potential of Smellmelon to invade water-stressed environments, laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the effect of desiccation and salinity at different temperatures on seed germination and seedling growth of Cucumis melo. Seeds were incubated at 25, 30, 35 and 40 degrees C in the darkness in a solution (0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, 1 and 1.2 MPa) of a salt (NaCl), and in a solution (0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12 bar) of PEG-6000 (Polyethylene glycol), in two separate experiments. The results showed that the highest percentage and rate of germination occurred at 35 degrees C in salt concentrations of 0, -0.2, -0.4 MPa and PEG concentrations of 0, -2, -4 bar. Increasing the concentration of salt (NaCl) and PEG limited germination, seedling growth and water uptake but increased the sodium content in the seedlings. No significant difference was observed among 0, -0.2 and -0.4 MPa of NaCl and among 0, -2 and -4 bar of PEG concentration at 35 degrees C. The negative effects of PEG were more than those of NaCl on germination percentage and germination rate. Increased stress levels lead to reduction of root and shoot length, and SVL of seedlings. Na+ content of seedling decreased with limited seedling growth of C. melo.

In the piedmont of South Carolina, during extreme drought conditions in August 2008, I. rufipes was found on redroot flatsedge, C. erythrorhizos, which had colonized mudflats on exposed shorelines of Hartwell Lake in Clemson. Surveys to determine the host-plant range of I. rufipes were conducted from 2008 to 2012 in the Blue Ridge ecoregion of Georgia and North Carolina and coastal plain and piedmont of Georgia and South Carolina. The blissid exploits the short (floriferous) growth form of C. erythrorhizos, an annual sedge of unpredictable availability in ephemeral mudflats, while maintaining populations mainly on a perennial sedge, Scirpus cyperinus, in more persistent habitats. The blissid also develops on the generally taller C. erythrorhizos plants in more permanent wetlands. Only one generation of I. rufipes might be possible on annual sedges of inconstant occurrence, but the blissid is bivoltine on woolly sedge (woolgrass), S. cyperinus. Adults overwintered not only on host sedges (mainly S. cyperinus), but also on nonhost sedges and other graminoids, beginning as early as September. A mating pair was observed on S. cyperinus in mid-May, early instars in late May, and first-generation adults by mid-July. Early instars of a second generation (and a mating pair) were observed in mid-August. The late instars found sparingly on woolly sedge in late fall and early winter probably attain adulthood or die during winter; only adults were observed after January. New state records for I. rufipes are Arkansas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina.																	0013-8797					OCT	2013	115	4					295	310		10.4289/0013-8797.115.4.295							WOS:000326904300001						
J	Henne, K; Kahlisch, L; Hofle, MG; Brettar, I				Henne, Karsten; Kahlisch, Leila; Hoefle, Manfred G.; Brettar, Ingrid			Seasonal dynamics of bacterial community structure and composition in cold and hot drinking water derived from surface water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												In temperate regions, seasonal variability of environmental factors affects the bacterial community in source water and finished drinking water. Therefore, the bacterial core community and its seasonal variability in cold and the respective hot drinking water was investigated. The bacterial core community was studied by 16S rRNA-based SSCP fingerprint analyses and band sequencing of DNA and RNA extracts of cold and hot water (60 degrees C). The bacterial communities of cold and hot drinking water showed a highly different structure and phylogenetic composition both for RNA and DNA extracts. For cold drinking water substantial seasonal dynamics of the bacterial community was observed related to environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation affecting source and drinking water. Phylogenetic analyses of the cold water community indicated that the majority of phylotypes were very closely affiliated with those detected in former studies of the same drinking water supply system (DWSS) in the preceding 6 years, indicating a high stability over time. The hot water community was very stable over time and seasons and highly distinct from the cold water with respect to structure and composition. The hot water community displayed a lower diversity and its phylotypes were mostly affiliated with bacteria of high temperature habitats with high growth rates indicated by their high RNA content. The conversion of the cold to the hot water bacterial community is considered as occurring within a few hours by the following two processes, i) by decay of most of the cold water bacteria due to heating, and ii) rapid growth of the high temperature adapted bacteria present in the hot water (co-heated with the cold water in the same device) using the nutrients released from the decaying cold water bacteria. The high temperature adapted bacteria originated partially from low abundant but beforehand detected members of the cold water; additionally, the rare members ("seed bank") of the cold water are considered as a source.

Soil, Vegetation, and Seed Bank of a Sonoran Desert Ecosystem Along an Exotic Plant (Pennisetum ciliare) Treatment Gradient	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Ecological conditions following removal of exotic plants are a key part of comprehensive environmental management strategies to combat exotic plant invasions. We examined ecological conditions following removal of the management-priority buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) in Saguaro National Park of the North American Sonoran Desert. We assessed soil, vegetation, and soil seed banks on seven buffelgrass site types: five different frequencies of buffelgrass herbicide plus hand removal treatments (ranging from 5 years of annual treatment to a single year of treatment), untreated sites, and non-invaded sites, with three replicates for each of the seven site types. The 22 measured soil properties (e.g., pH) differed little among sites. Regarding vegetation, buffelgrass cover was low (a parts per thousand currency sign1 % median cover), or absent, across all treated sites but was high (10-70 %) in untreated sites. Native vegetation cover, diversity, and composition were indistinguishable across site types. Species composition was dominated by native species (> 93 % relative cover) across all sites except untreated buffelgrass sites. Most (38 species, 93 %) of the 41 species detected in soil seed banks were native, and native seed density did not differ significantly across sites. Results suggest that: (1) buffelgrass cover was minimal across treated sites; (2) aside from high buffelgrass cover in untreated sites, ecological conditions were largely indistinguishable across sites; (3) soil seed banks harbored a parts per thousand yen12 species that were frequent in the aboveground vegetation; and (4) native species dominated post-treatment vegetation composition, and removing buffelgrass did not result in replacement by other exotic species.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2013	52	4					946	957		10.1007/s00267-013-0104-y							WOS:000324633900015	23771285					
J	Barsberg, S; Rasmussen, HN; Kodahl, N				Barsberg, Soren; Rasmussen, Hanne N.; Kodahl, Nete			COMPOSITION OF CYPRIPEDIUM CALCEOLUS (ORCHIDACEAE) SEEDS ANALYZED BY ATTENUATED TOTAL REFLECTANCE IR SPECTROSCOPY: IN SEARCH OF UNDERSTANDING LONGEVITY IN THE GROUND	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: Orchid seeds are minute and covered with a thin coat, yet they often have a long life after dispersal. They are notorious for low and irregular germination, in nature as well as in vitro. Since orchids are often rare species of conservational and commercial interest, reproduction by seeds is an important concern. The purpose of this study was to learn more about the resilience of these highly specialized seeds and stimulatory processes toward germination. Methods: We studied testa and embryos of Cypripedium calceolus to identify natural components in intact seeds and the impact of 7 yr in soil in its natural habitat. We also analyzed the effects of Ca(OCl)(2), used technically to enhance germination for cultivation in vitro. For the first time with this kind of plant material, we used attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, an ideal method for minute sample sizes and surface selectivity. Thus, we could link treatments with changes in seed surface chemistry. Key results: A lignin-like polymer is an essential testa component that undergoes degradation by soil or hypochlorite processes. In both cases, we found a build-up of CaCO3 on the testa, which could interact with lignin to enhance germination. Very minor changes occurred in embryo reserve nutrient content after a long sojourn underground, which supports their continued viability. Conclusions: We suggest that degradation of lignin and enrichment of the testa surface with CaCO3 are important stimulants of germination both in the habitat and during laboratory sowing.

Seed bank potential of moist-soil managed wetlands in east-central Texas	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Proper management techniques on moist-soil wetlands provide methods for enhancement of established wetlands, restoration of former wetlands, and creation of new wetland habitat. These techniques also create suitable wetland habitat for non-breeding waterfowl and other wetland dependent species during winter. To understand moist-soil managed wetland vegetative patterns, aspects such as plant species distribution, reproductive strategy, seed bank composition and viability should be thoroughly characterized. We investigated soil seed bank potential of moist-soil managed wetlands on Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area, Texas to determine which treatment (i.e., drawdown or flooded) produced the most desirable moist-soil plants. A total of 27 species germinated, producing 3,731 and 3,031 seedlings in drawdown and flooded treatments, respectively. There were also differences in stem densities between treatments of desirable and non-desirable species. Drawdown treatments had more seedlings germinate than flooded treatments, validating the notion that drawdown treatments provide favorable conditions for seed germination. Drawdown and flooding techniques, when properly timed, will allow managers to drive and directly influence managed wetland plant communities based on seed bank composition and response to presence or absence of water during the germination period.																	0923-4861					OCT	2013	21	5					353	366		10.1007/s11273-013-9307-5							WOS:000325011100005

The phenology of Ruppia cirrhosa (Petagna) Grande and Chara sp in a small temporarily open/closed estuary, South Africa	AQUATIC BOTANY												Kleinemonde Estuary, a warm temperate temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) along the southeastern coastline of South Africa. Monthly growth and sexual reproduction were monitored over a 17 month period, including environmental conditions. The estuary was closed to the sea for the duration of the study and inundation of the submerged habitat ranged from 6 to 86 cm. Both species began to germinate in Autumn 2009 (April and May) once the submerged habitat had been flooded for one month. R. cirrhosa began to produce viable seed after five months and production occurred over a four month Spring-Summer period. Maximum seed production occurred in late Spring (26,242 3401 seeds m(-2)). It took C sp. three months to start producing viable oogonia with production taking place over seven months, from late winter late Summer with a maximum of 196,998 48,004 oogonia m(-2) produced. Peak biomass was attained during Spring to mid-Summer when R. cirrhosa reached 2248 388 g DW m(-2) and C. sp. 142 34 g OW m(-2), eight and six months after germination, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that both biomass and reproductive output increased as water level and pH did. In conclusion, the high biomass and reproductive output of both submerged species under continued water permanence maintains large seed banks for habitat persistence during open mouth states when submerged beds are lost through exposure. This is an important survival strategy in small estuaries where water level fluctuates in response to unpredictable mouth breaching and mouth closure events. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The short-term impact of wetland restoration on the genetic diversity of a predominantly clonal plant species	AQUATIC BOTANY												Genetic diversity plays a major role in ensuring the adaptive capacity and long-term viability of populations. Recent studies have shown that evaluations of the ecological benefits of ecosystem restoration should incorporate the impact of restoration on population genetic variability to accurately guide restoration priorities. This study aimed to analyse the population genetic diversity of an aquatic plant, Berula erecta, in wetlands restored by sediment dredging using natural local wetlands as a reference to assess the impact of ecological restoration on genetic diversity. The analyses were performed using microsatellite markers. Restoration led to a considerable increase in the open water surface area at the site, and the restored areas were efficiently colonised by B. erecta. The populations exhibited a high level of genetic diversity, even though clonal propagation is the major reproductive mode of this species. Two years after restoration, population genetic diversity (AR allelic richness, Fis and PG) was very similar between the restored and natural wetlands. For one restored wetland, the individuals in the restored area of the wetland showed greater allelic richness than those in the unrestored areas of the same wetland. In addition, most of the multilocus genotypes observed in the restored wetlands only occurred as single individuals, suggesting that clonal propagation is not the only mode of recolonisation after restoration. The source of the new genotypes that appeared after restoration may have been a local relict population, seeds remaining in the seed bank after restoration (cryptic genetic diversity), or propagules (seed or vegetative fragments) that migrated into the wetland. These results suggest that the benefits of restoration may depend strongly on the genetic diversity of established relict and dormant populations. Population diversity, in turn, may partly depend on the ecological characteristics of the site (i.e., connectivity of the water body to the surrounding wetlands, successional stage and site history).

Linking restoration ecology with coastal dune restoration	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Restoration and preservation of coastal dunes is urgently needed because of the increasingly rapid loss and degradation of these ecosystems because of many human activities. These activities alter natural processes and coastal dynamics, eliminate topographic variability, fragment degrade or eliminate habitats, reduce diversity and threaten endemic species. The actions of coastal dune restoration that are already taking place span contrasting activities that range from revegetating and stabilizing the mobile substrate, to removing plant cover and increasing substrate mobility. Our goal was to review how the relative progress of the actions of coastal dune restoration has been assessed, according to the ecosystem attributes outlined by the Society of Ecological Restoration: namely, integrity, health and sustainability and that are derived from the ecological theory of succession. We reviewed the peer reviewed literature published since 1988 that is listed in the ISI Web of Science journals as well as additional references, such as key books. We exclusively focused on large coastal dune systems (such as transgressive and parabolic dunefields) located on natural or seminatural coasts. We found 150 articles that included "coastal dune", "restoration" and "revegetation" in areas such as title, keywords and abstract From these, 67 dealt specifically with coastal dune restoration. Most of the studies were performed in the USA, The Netherlands and South Africa, during the last two decades. Restoration success has been assessed directly and indirectly by measuring one or a few ecosystem variables. Some ecosystem attributes have been monitored more frequently (ecosystem integrity) than others (ecosystem health and sustainability). Finally, it is important to consider that ecological succession is a desirable approach in restoration actions. Natural dynamics and disturbances should be considered as part of the restored system, to improve ecosystem integrity, health and sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Edges, exotics and deer: the seed bank of a suburban secondary successional temperate deciduous forest	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: (1) What is the utility of the soil seed bank in passive restoration of a suburban secondary successional temperate deciduous forest? (2) What is the composition and structure of the seed bank? (3) How abundant are woody and exotic species and how are they distributed in the seed bank? (4) Are edge effects evident in seed bank composition? (5) What is the influence of a suite of abiotic and biotic variables, including deer browse, on seed bank richness and abundance? Location: A 413-ha suburban forest near Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Methods: We sampled the seed bank and vegetation of 100 permanent plots in a Liriodendron-Fagus-Acer-Quercus dominated secondary successional forest. Information on soil chemistry, canopy cover, leaf litter cover and depth, deer browse severity and distance to the nearest urban edge and path was also collected for each plot. Seedling emergence was monitored in a greenhouse over 2yr. Results: A total of 76 species emerged from the seed bank, including 16 woody species and 22 exotic species. Compositional similarity between the seed bank and vegetation was low. Woody species were under-represented and exotic species were over-represented, with exotic species found in the seed bank of 94 of 100 plots. Species composition and exotic species richness and abundance were similar between edge or path and interior plots. Leaf litter cover, vegetation cover, browse severity and variables related to soil fertility were included in top models explaining patterns in seed bank richness and abundance. Conclusions: Reliance on the soil seed bank as a passive restoration strategy will be insufficient for restoring a mature secondary successional suburban forest community. However, a suite of shade-tolerant exotic shrubs and vines that are of concern to management do not appear to use the seed bank, indicating that targeted removal of these species may be successful. Increased deer browse was associated with decreased seed bank abundance and richness, suggesting that deer may directly reduce inputs to the seed bank. If deer are impacting seed bank composition, active restoration will need to include understorey herbs in addition to overstorey species.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				OCT	2013	16	4					571	584		10.1111/avsc.12036							WOS:000324090800004

We assess whether first generation plantation impacts on soil and biodiversity are reversible. The study was carried out in western Norway and we compared species composition, alpha and beta diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes, and soil conditions on five sites of 4-year old wind-felled clearings and adjacent, remnant Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations. Local native birch (Betula pubescens) forests provided a reference point for assessing the restoration potential of the Norway spruce plantations. We found that species composition in the wind-felled clearings quickly developed similarities to the local birch forests. A rise in humus pH, calcium concentrations and available nitrogen (total N in percentage of loss on ignition), indicates that one rotation of Norway spruce plantations has not imposed long-term impairment of soil conditions. After removal of the plantation tree layer, mean species number per plot (alpha diversity) increased for vascular plants but remained unchanged for bryophytes. Heterogeneity, in terms of beta diversity, and the variance of some soil elements (calcium and magnesium) increased, and beta diversity trends were similar for both vascular plants and bryophytes. During the course of succession, we predict that species composition and vascular plant alpha and beta diversity in wind-felled clearings of Norway spruce plantations may stabilise at levels similar to native birch forests.

Composition of the soil seed bank in remnant patches of grassy woodland along an urbanization gradient in Melbourne, Australia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Urban areas around the world are rapidly expanding, with flow-on consequences for the native plants and animals that inhabit these areas. The impacts of this urban growth are not always immediate, and in the case of the local extinction of plant species may take up to 100-150 years. Understanding how urbanization affects ecological patterns and processes may allow us to minimize the loss of species from these areas through better planning and conservation decisions. This study examined the composition of the soil seed bank in remnant patches of grassy woodland along an urbanization gradient in northern Melbourne, Australia, using an ex-situ glasshouse germination trial. A total of 108 species emerged from the soil seed bank, although a majority of the seedlings were seeds from 19 non-indigenous monocot species. Species richness per plot of emergent seedlings was best explained by average annual rainfall, rather than the degree of urbanization in the surrounding landscape. This indicates that the existing plant community may be responding to a natural productivity gradient. The persistence of 123 indigenous plant species in the existing vegetation, even when the soil seed bank is dominated by non-indigenous monocot species, suggests that these plant communities can exist within urban areas, particularly in combination with appropriate management activities that ensure the continuation of previously occurring natural processes.

The means of judging viability is thus crucial to the comprehension of seed vigour. We selected seeds of three species and one hybrid in the Salicaceae likely to have variation in tolerance to drying, processing and storage, including in relation to cryobanking, and compared survival growth as radicle emergence (germination) and normal seedling production. With three seed lots of Salix gracilistyla, air-drying to 8-10 % WC enhanced seed survival after 40 days' storage at 5 A degrees C as compared with non-treated seeds at 14-20 % WC. Four seed lots of Populus alba x P. glandulosa showed equally high germination (88-100 %) and proportions of normal seedlings (81-99 %) when stored at 5 A degrees C for 7-10 weeks. Among seven seed lots of S. gracilistyla, two groups with different storage behaviour could be statistically distinguished with normal seedling production ranging from 0 to 45 % after storage at 5 A degrees C for 13 weeks. Seed tolerance to WC manipulation and cryopreservation was very variable among species and seed lots. Seed lots of S. hallaisanensis and S. gracilistyla with similar to 80 % germination survived cryopreservation at 10 % WC, but were sensitive to lower WCs. In contrast, Populus seeds had greater desiccation tolerance combined with cryopreservation capability. With seed lots of all species and hybrids, cryopreservation had little effect on viability unless the high moisture freezing limit had been exceeded (similar to 10-20 % WC, depending on seed lot). However, under all conditions of handling (drying, rehydration, storage at 5 A degrees C or cryopreservation) using germination as the only indicator of viability over-estimated survival compared with normal seedling production.

In this paper, we assessed the effect of fire on the occurrence of euri- and steno-Mediterranean (ESM) species in Pinus sylvestris forests of Aosta Valley (Italy), by analyzing vegetation in a chronosequence of six stand-replacing fires (1962-2006). We analyzed species richness along the chronosequence, and modeled it as a function of time since fire, environment, and stand structure. We observed a strong positive association between ESM and total species richness. Temporal vegetation dynamics did not follow the direct succession pattern that is commonly observed in Mediterranean ecosystems. Two distinct maxima of ESM species richness were observed: (1) short lived, ruderal species (32 % of all ESM species) in the early post-fire stages, and (2) dry grassland species (54 %) in intermediate stages. The first were facilitated by the consumption of canopy and litter during fire, while the second by delayed tree canopy closure. In multivariate models of ESM species richness, light and elevation were the only significant predictors. Contrary to expectations, time since fire was not significant. Our study suggests that stand-replacing fires play an important role in preserving Mediterranean species in the study area by maintaining an open canopy, and promote local species diversity.

What is the contribution of the soil seed bank to restoring renosterveld vegetation after degradation through agriculture or afforestation? Location: Tygerberg Nature Reserve - one of the largest remaining fragments of Swartland Shale Renosterveld, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Methods: Assessment of vegetation, soil parameters and soil seed banks in three renosterveld sites, two adjacent abandoned fields, one pine plantation and one pine plantation clear-cut site. Smoke primer (i.e. fire surrogate) was applied to soil seed bank samples to evaluate fire as a possible management and restoration tool. Results: Abandoned agricultural fields adjacent to renosterveld remnants are characterized by alien grass cover, nutrient enrichment of the soil and depletion of the indigenous soil seed bank. In contrast, pine plantations show less alien species infestation, soil nutrient alteration and have a viable soil seed bank as well as re-development of indigenous renosterveld vegetation after clearance. Seedling recruitment was not significantly influenced by application of a smoke primer compared to the magnitude of fire response in fynbos. Conclusion: Abandoned agricultural fields (previously renosterveld) at Tygerberg have a very low restoration potential. In contrast, pine plantation sites should be given priority in restoration, because soil chemistry is less significantly altered and a viable indigenous soil seed bank is still present, which can be successfully activated through clearance management.

J	Yang, D; Li, W				Yang, Dong; Li, Wei			Soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation along a successional gradient on the shores of an oxbow	AQUATIC BOTANY												The soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation were investigated on the shores of the Tian-e-zhou oxbow in China along a successional gradient (i.e. mud flat, sedge and graminoid marsh, sedge and reed meadow, and willow shrub). We expected to explore the following questions: (1) Does seed density and species richness of the soil seed banks decline during succession? (2) Does the similarity between the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation decrease during succession? (3) Can soil seed banks be considered as a potential source of material for wetland restoration? Results fevealed that 19 species (about 61% of the species in the mud flat stage) were found in all successional stages. Both seed density and species richness increased with succession. Species of the soil seed bank showed greater compositional similarity (Sorensen's index) across four stages than did the aboveground vegetation. The similarity between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation increased as succession proceeds. In conclusion, the seed bank of Tian-e-zhou oxbow wetland contains a relatively abundant seed density and species richness. The soil seed bank could thus play an important role in the restoration management of oxbow wetlands. However, the high dominance of mudflat annuals and the absence of most dominant perennials in the soil seed bank suggest that target species may require active introduction for further restoration (C) 2013 The Authors.

The isolates served to understand spatio-temporal community changes at the soil-litter interface, which had been detected using alkB as a functional marker gene for bacterial alkane degraders. To obtain a large spectrum of isolates, liquid subcultivation was combined with a matrix-assisted enrichment (Teflon membranes, litter). Elevated cell numbers of alkane degraders were detected by most probable number counting indicating enhanced alkane degradation potential in soil in response to litter treatment. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 395isolates revealed forty different phylogenetic groups [operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] and spatio-temporal shifts in community composition. TenOTUs comprised so far unknown alkane degraders, and five OTUs represented putative new bacterial genera. The combination of enrichment methods yielded a higher diversity of isolates than liquid subcultivation alone. Comparison of 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiles indicated that many alkane degraders present in the enrichments were not detectable in the DNA extracts from soil microcosms. These possibly rare specialists might represent a seed bank for the alkane degradation capacity in uncontaminated soil. This relevant ecosystem function can be fostered by the formation of the soil-litter interface.

O.			Climatic control of forest herb seed banks along a latitudinal gradient	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Seed banks are central to the regeneration strategy of many plant species. Any factor altering seed bank density thus affects plant regeneration and population dynamics. Although seed banks are dynamic entities controlled by multiple environmental drivers, climatic factors are the most comprehensive, but still poorly understood. This study investigates how climatic variation structures seed production and resulting seed bank patterns. Location Temperate forests along a 1900km latitudinal gradient in north-western (NW) Europe. Methods Seed production and seed bank density were quantified in 153 plots along the gradient for four forest herbs with different seed longevity: Geum urbanum, Milium effusum, Poa nemoralis and Stachys sylvatica. We tested the importance of climatic and local environmental factors in shaping seed production and seed bank density. Results Seed production was determined by population size, and not by climatic factors. G.urbanum and M.effusum seed bank density declined with decreasing temperature (growing degree days) and/or increasing temperature range (maximum-minimum temperature). P.nemoralis and S.sylvatica seed bank density were limited by population size and not by climatic variables. Seed bank density was also influenced by other, local environmental factors such as soil pH or light availability. Different seed bank patterns emerged due to differential seed longevities. Species with long-lived seeds maintained constant seed bank densities by counteracting the reduced chance of regular years with high seed production at colder northern latitudes. Main conclusions Seed bank patterns show clear interspecific variation in response to climate across the distribution range. Not all seed banking species may be as well equipped to buffer climate change via their seed bank, notably in short-term persistent species. Since the buffering capacity of seed banks is key to species persistence, these results provide crucial information to advance climatic change predictions on range shifts, community and biodiversity responses.

Fallen logs as sources of patchiness in chenopod shrublands of South Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												While numerous studies focus on heterogeneity created by living plants and animal diggings in arid lands, little information exists on the pattern and role of heterogeneity created by large woody debris. We studied soil nutrient content, volumetric water content, and vegetation associated with the presence of logs in sites subject to different grazing intensity in a chenopod shrubland of South Australia. Soil volumetric water content was lower close to logs, and the soil there dried faster after rains. Organic carbon was higher, but available phosphorus was lower in soil associated with logs. We documented greater seedling emergence, species richness and diversity, and greater annual plant biomass next to logs. Our results were similar in the sites with high and low grazing pressure, the latter having higher numbers of seeds and species in the germinable soil seed bank. Logs in this system create patches that differ in properties from other patches in the system (i.e. those created by perennial plants, depressions, or diggings). Logs constitute a unique microenvironment which affects the plant community structure and may enhance the diversity of the system, and should be considered in management schemes.

Ozone Exposure of a Weed Community Produces Adaptive Changes in Seed Populations of Spergula arvensis	PLOS ONE												Tropospheric ozone is one of the major drivers of global change. This stress factor alters plant growth and development. Ozone could act as a selection pressure on species communities composition, but also on population genetic background, thus affecting life history traits. Our objective was to evaluate the consequences of prolonged ozone exposure of a weed community on phenotypic traits of Spergula arvensis linked to persistence. Specifically, we predicted that the selection pressure exerted by high ozone concentrations as well as the concomitant changes in the weed community would drive population adaptive changes which will be reflected on seed germination, dormancy and longevity. In order to test seed viability and dormancy level, we conducted germination experiments for which we used seeds produced by S. arvensis plants grown within a weed community exposed to three ozone treatments during four years (0, 90 and 120 ppb). We also performed a soil seed bank experiment to test seed longevity with seeds coming from both the four-year ozone exposure experiment and from a short-term treatment conducted at ambient and added ozone concentrations. We found that prolonged ozone exposure produced changes in seed germination, dormancy and longevity, resulting in three S. arvensis populations. Seeds from the 90 ppb ozone selection treatment had the highest level of germination when stored at 75% RH and 25 degrees C and then scarified. These seeds showed the lowest dormancy level when being subjected to 5 degrees C/5% RH and 25 degrees C/75% followed by 5% RH storage conditions. Furthermore, ozone exposure increased seed persistence in the soil through a maternal effect. Given that tropospheric ozone is an important pollutant in rural areas, changes in seed traits due to ozone exposure could increase weed persistence in fields, thus affecting weed-crop interactions, which could ultimately reduce crop production.

This plant establishes perennial seed banks, with seeds remaining dormant and viable for several years. This study aimed to enhance the germination and early growth of this plant by adopting a new medium, a nutrient-enriched agar solution, also added with humic acid (HA) and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) fractions isolated from a green compost (GC) and a mixed compost (MC). The germination percentage of slickspot peppergrass in this new medium was much greater than that obtained in previous studies. Further, the addition of GC-HA in the medium enhanced significantly the germination and early growth of this plant. The addition of GC-WEOM and MC-WEOM were beneficial only on plant growth for at least 7 months.

Stratification Requirements for Seed Dormancy Alleviation in a Wetland Weed	PLOS ONE												Echinochloaoryzicola(syn.E. phyllopogon) is an exotic weed of California rice paddies that has evolved resistance to multiple herbicides. Elimination of seedlingsthroughcertain weed control methods can limit the spread of this weed, but is contingent on accurate predictions of germination and emergence timing, which are influenced by seed dormancy levels. In summer annuals, dormancy can often be relieved through stratification, a period of prolonged exposure to cold and moist conditions. We used population-based threshold models to quantify the effects of stratification on seed germination of four E. Oryzicola populations at a range of water potential (Psi) and oxygen levels. We also determined how stratification temperatures, moisture levels and durations contributed to dormancy release. Stratification released dormancy by decreasing base Psi and hydrotimerequired for germination and by eliminating any germination sensitivity to oxygen. Stratification also increased average germination rates (GR), which were used as a proxy for relative dormancy levels. Alternating temperatures nearly doubled GR in all populations, indicating that seeds could be partially dormant despite achieving high final germination percentages. Stratification at Psi=0 MPa increased GR compared to stratification at lower water potentials, demonstrating that Psi contributed to regulating dormancy release. Maximum GR occurred after 2-4 weeks of stratification at 0 MPa; GR were often more rapid for herbicide-resistant than for herbicide-susceptible seeds, implying greater dormancy in the latter. Manipulation of field conditions to promote dormancy alleviation of E. oryzicola seeds might improve the rate and uniformity of germination for seed bank depletion through seedling weed control. Our results suggest field soil saturation in winter would contribute towards E. oryzicola dormancy release and decrease the time to seedling emergence.																	1932-6203					SEP 5	2013	8	9							e71457	10.1371/journal.pone.0071457							WOS:000324481600010	24039714

The short-term germination and establishment success of deer-dispersed seeds in mesic temperate forests	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, Zimmerman 1780) are known to disperse seeds through endozoochory, but the fates of these seeds are largely unknown. In both field and greenhouse studies, we examined the importance of fecal pellet decay to seed germination success and compared natural plant communities in microsites with and without deer pellets to determine the effects of deer endozoochory on short-term plant species composition. Pellets were collected in Delaware County, Ohio. After cold stratification, pellets were either crumbled or planted intact in the greenhouse to estimate numbers and species of viable seed present. These plantings produced germinants of 40+ taxa, 48% of which are non-native. Significantly more individuals germinated from crumbled than from intact pellets (P, 0.001), suggesting that pellet decay is crucial for germination success. In the field, feces deposited in the fall and spring decayed at rates that would allow seeds to escape the pellets in time for spring germination. Plant species diversity was also compared between forest microsites containing pellets and adjacent sites without pellets. Late spring plant diversity in pellet plots was similar to that of control sites, suggesting that the presence of deer pellets does not result in short-term compositional changes to the understory plant community. Our data support other studies that have also found deer to be capable of dispersing seeds of many plant species. Our study indicates that pellet decay facilitates germination for many of these species. However, given the similarity of plants found in microsites with and without pellets, seeds dispersed by deer did not become significant components of forest understories over a one year time period. It may be that seeds contained in pellets will enter the seed bank and germinate with a change in environment (such as a gap opening), but further field work must be done to determine the fates of seeds dispersed by deer in forest habitats.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				SEP	2013	140	3					334	348		10.3159/TORREY-D-13-00006.1							WOS:000339655700009						
J	Baum, S; Weih, M; Bolte, A				Baum, Sarah; Weih, Martin; Bolte, Andreas			Floristic diversity in Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) plantations: Comparison between soil seed bank and recent vegetation	LANDBAUFORSCHUNG												In the near future an increase in Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) plantations is to be expected. The objective was to compare the recent vegetation and the soil seed bank in SRC plantations to reveal the functioning of the soil seed bank for phytodiversity and vegetation structure after reconversion of SRC plantations into arable land. For the analyses, above-ground vegetation surveys and soil seed bank samples of six German and four Swedish SRC plantations were used. Similarity in composition of soil seed banks and recent vegetation was low in terms of species, plant strategy types, species habitat preferences and seed longevity. On average, the proportion of common species of recent vegetation and soil seed bank was 8.4% (+/- 6.7% SD). The recent vegetation was dominated by competitive (c) plant species while in the soil seed banks highest proportions were detected for ruderals (r) and competitors (c). Species with long-term persistent seeds had the highest contribution to both the recent vegetation and the soil seed banks. Grassland species had highest species habitat preference proportion in the recent vegetation. The soil seed banks contained predominantly ruderal species and woodland species were almost absent. Due to the poor coherence of seed bank vs. recent vegetation, we conclude that the site history has only a minor influence on phytodiversity in SRC plantations, suggesting that recent vegetation composition is mainly due to the species pool of the adjacent vegetation and site conditions like below-canopy irradiance and site nutrition.

By using 20 plots with 25 x 25 cm and 5 cm deep, samples of soils from different environmental situations, identified in a rural property in Caranda, MG, were collected (clean pasture, dirty pasture, coppice, eucalyptus and forest). The collected material was put to be germinated in a greenhouse and analyzed for eight months, where composition and the density of the species (herbaceous, sub-shrubby, shrubby and arboreal) were evaluated. The environmental situations presented different expressions of natural regeneration. The dirty pasture was the situation that presented the largest number of regenerating herbaceous trees, what makes it more problematic for forest restoration. All the environmental situations presented bank of seeds of arboreal and shrubby seedlings, which may help the restoration process. However, the success of this activity will be directly linked to the activities of competitor control, mainly of Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster, an aggressive grass that germinates in every environmental situation. Due to the absence of species in final succession stage in the seed bank in the soil, there might have been other complementary interventions such as planting of seedlings, direct sowing of tree species and/or implantation of artificial galleries to accelerate the vegetable succession.																	0100-6762					SEP-OCT	2013	37	5					871	880		10.1590/S0100-67622013000500009							WOS:000329052000009

The effectiveness of active and passive restoration on recovery of indigenous vegetation in riparian zones in the Western Cape, South Africa: A preliminary assessment	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Riparian ecosystems in South Africa's fynbos biome are heavily invaded by alien woody plants. Although large-scale clearing of these species is underway, the assumption that native vegetation will self-repair after clearing has not been thoroughly tested. Understanding the processes that mediate the recruitment of native species following clearing of invasive species is crucial for optimising restoration techniques. This study aimed to determine native species recovery patterns following implementation of different management interventions. We tested the influence of two clearing treatments ("fell & remove" and "fell & stack burn") on the outcomes of passive restoration (natural recovery of native riparian species) and active restoration (seed sowing and planting of cuttings) along the Berg River in the Western Cape. Under greenhouse conditions we investigated seed viability and germination pre-treatments of selected native species. There was no recruitment of native species in sites that were not seeded (passive restoration sites), possibly because of the dominance of alien herbaceous species and graminoids or the lack of native species in the soil-stored seed bank. Germination of our targeted native species in the field was low in both "fell & remove" and "fell & stack burn" treatments. However, "fell & stack burn" gave better germination for the species Searsia angustifolia, Leonotis leonurus and Melianthus major. Seedling survival in the field was significantly reduced in summer, with drought stress being the main cause for seedling mortality. Germination rates in the greenhouse were high, an indication that harvested seeds were viable. Most seeds germinated without germination pre-treatments. We conclude that failure of native seeds to germinate under field conditions, secondary invasion of alien herbs and graminoids. the lack of native species in the soil-stored seed bank, and dry summer conditions hamper seedling establishment and recovery on sites cleared of dense stands of alien trees. For active restoration to achieve its goals, effective recruitment and propagation strategies need to be established. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Karrikinolide residues in grassland soils following fire: Implications on germination activity	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Smoke plays a positive role in promoting seed germination and enhancing post-germination processes. The compound in smoke is 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one (KAR(1)). Recently a structurally related butenolide [3,4,5-trimethylfuran-2(5H)-one, (trimethylbutenolide, TMB)], which inhibits germination and reduces the effect of KAR(1), was isolated. The mechanisms of action and interaction of these karrikins are unknown. In addition, the ecological significance of fires in altering soil-smoke-chemistry and the spatial dimensions of the influence on burnt sites and neighbouring areas are undetermined. This study quantified KAR(1) and TMB residues in soils following fire and assessed the germination activity of burnt soil extracts. Soil samples from 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 cm depths were extracted using dichloromethane and bioassayed using Lactuca sativa L. achenes (seeds). At all soil depths, L sativa seeds exhibited significantly greater percentage germination when treated with burnt soil extracts compared to the no-burn soil (control). The L sativa seeds also showed significantly greater percentage germination when treated with soil extracts from the adjacent plots. Compared to the no-burn soil, higher concentrations of KAR(1) and TMB were detected in the surface layers of the burnt soils. Considerable concentrations of KAR(1) and TMB were also detected in no-burn soil indicating that sources other than fire may also generate karrikins. Findings of this study imply that post-fire increases in KAR(1) residues in the soil may influence soil seed bank stimulation of certain smoke-responsive plant communities in both burnt and adjacent non-burnt areas.

FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												The species richness of grasslands generally cannot be fully restored after changes in management. Some species with small statures and basal leaf rosettes can be lost forever. The same species, however, seem to possess the traits necessary for successful re-colonization - they produce small, easily dispersable seeds, numerous seedlings and have lasting seed banks. We tested the hypothesis that plants in species-rich grasslands can be characterized by a negative correlation between their competitive ability and potential for generative regeneration, i.e. by a competition-colonization trade-off. An analysis of the traits of 95 grassland species supported this hypothesis. We then conducted a manipulative experiment in three different meadow communities in the Bil, Karpaty Mts. The experiment involved characterizing species traits during periods of different grassland management regimes in the years 1997-2000 and comparing these with the original management regime, which was restored between 2000 and 2003. We found out that the hypothesis only holds true for the pooled dataset for all three communities. When the individual meadow communities were analyzed separately, plant traits other than those responsible for the competition-colonization trade-off appear to be characteristic of responsive species, e.g. shoot lifespan or phenology. Our results imply that despite the general trade-offs found in large comparative studies, the plant response in a specific community is constrained by the local species pool.

Management of a Population of the Federally Endangered Xyris tennesseensis (Tennessee Yellow-Eyed Grass)	CASTANEA												A 3-yr study was conducted to determine effects from cutting shrubs that were shading a population of Xyris tennesseensis Kral inhabiting a calcareous seepage fen of the Ridge and Valley Ecoregion. Shrubs were cut to ground level on small plots and Xyris flowering, ramet numbers (a ramet is defined as a leaf-producing stem) and seedling numbers were monitored during three post-treatment seasons. Floral visitation was also documented to determine if shrub cutting increased the likelihood of floral visits by insects that might pollinate flowers. In addition, the seed bank of the site was described and quantified. Shrub cutting significantly increased flowering of Xyris on the site, but only for the first two seasons: by the third season flowering declined, likely caused by competition from other herbaceous species responding to the increased light levels. Shrub cutting also significantly increased seedling production, but no significant increase in the number of Xyris ramets was found. Floral visits were significantly more frequent to Xyris flowers located on cut plots. There was no Xyris seed bank. We conclude that cutting shrubs can stimulate Xyris reproduction for a short period but that long term management must balance this benefit with the resulting increased competition from other non-Xyris graminoids. Management of the fen should strive for a mosaic of microhabitats with varying degrees of woody vegetative cover and exposed mineral soil.																	0008-7475					SEP	2013	78	3					198	212		10.2179/12-034							WOS:000325387600003

Soil seed banks can be used to predict the composition of new plant recruitment. Species overcome periods of unfavorable weather conditions by building up a large seed bank. With this strategy, the species diversity is preserved and information on their dynamics and structure is retained. The research on soil seed bank has received wide interest because of its important role in plantation renovation and restoration, biological diversity preservation, vegetation succession and diffusion processes and other aspects. This paper reviews the relationship between soil seed bank and disturbance, geographic factor, vegetation and seed size and is aimed at providing some useful reference for future research.																	1995-4255	1995-4263				SEP	2013	6	5					520	524		10.1134/S1995425513050181							WOS:000325009100009

The classical Wright-Fisher model, as well as a seed bank model with bounded age distribution considered in Kaj, Krone and Lascoux (2001) are special cases of our model. We discern three parameter regimes of the seed bank age distribution, which lead to substantially different behaviour in terms of genetic variability, in particular with respect to fixation of types and time to the most recent common ancestor. We prove that, for age distributions with finite mean, the ancestral process converges to a time-changed Kingman coalescent, while in the case of infinite mean, ancestral lineages might not merge at all with positive probability. Furthermore, we present a construction of the forward-in-time process in equilibrium. The mathematical methods are based on renewal theory, the urn process introduced in Kaj, Krone and Lascoux (2001) as well as on a paper by Hammond and Sheffield (2013).

In order to explore the relative importance of clonal growth and sexual reproduction within populations and also to reveal the origin of the commonly occurring one style morph populations in China, we studied the clonal diversity and population genetic structure of this species. By using seven single sequence repeat primer pairs, a total of 192 multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were identified among the 472 samples from the 21 populations analyzed; each population had two or more MLGs. The number of MLGs was lower for the one style morph populations than distylous populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed that a smaller proportion of genetic variation resided among populations (36.8%). A neighbor-joining tree indicated that there was no significant geographical structure of the genetic variation among populations of N. peltata. The Bottleneck tests indicated that there had been significant bottlenecks in most of the studied populations. The successful sexual recruitment from seeds may have contributed to the high clonal diversity in distylous populations of N. peltata in China. Demographic stochasticity or bottleneck should account for the one style morph population with several MLGs. And also the bottleneck effects or demographic changes caused by human activities occurring randomly in populations should account for the finding of no significant geographical structure of the genetic variation among the investigated populations of N. peltata.																	1674-4918	1759-6831				SEP	2013	51	5					536	544		10.1111/jse.12023							WOS:000324105600004

Change in propagule banks during prescribed burning: A tale of two contrasting moorlands	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Moorlands on blanket bog are high-priority ecosystems from a conservation viewpoint in the British Isles; they are often managed through using prescribed burning to increase their productivity for sheep and Red grouse. However, there is an increasing demand to conserve these moorlands for other environmental services, e.g. carbon sequestration and water supplies. There is, therefore, a need for experimental evidence on the role that fire and fire-rotation intervals have on these moorlands ecosystems for the development of ecologically-sound management plans. Here, the impact of prescribed burning on the propagule banks was evaluated at two contrasting geographical moorland locations differing in productivity, climate and past pollution history. Two different approaches were used; chronosequences of elapsed time since burning and a long-term replicated grazing and burning experiment (1954-2010) where different burning rotations were applied. The propagule banks in both moorlands were very species-poor and the species present were mainly common ones. The chronosequences showed that few species had significant effects with elapsed time since burning; the dominant Calluna vulgaris increased in the above-ground litter fraction which acted as a barrier to seed transfer to the underlying peat. Within the experiment, the seed bank of C vulgaris and the frequency of occurrence of Sphagnum species increased as rotation-interval increased. It is suggested that prescribed burning rotations simultaneously at two temporal scales within a moorland landscape may be needed to conserve Sphagnum species, short-rotation burns (every 10-years) to enhance its abundance in the vegetation and long-rotations (>55 years) to maintain Sphagnum propagules in the surface peat.

J	Ge, ZM; Cao, HB; Zhang, LQ				Ge, Zhenming; Cao, Haobin; Zhang, Liquan			A process-based grid model for the simulation of range expansion of Spartina alterniflora on the coastal saltmarshes in the Yangtze Estuary	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Spartina alterniflora has been widely introduced to many coastal and estuarine regions of the world as a species for ecological engineering and this species has been spreading rapidly and widely along the Chinese coastline for the past 30 years. Based on four years of field measurements at the Chongming Dongtan wetland in the Yangtze Estuary, a process-based grid model of spatio-temporal range expansion for S. alterniflora was developed. The model incorporated the seasonal patterns of seed bank dynamics, seedling establishment, clonal propagation and vegetative growth, while also considering the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on the range expansion of S. alterniflora in the coastal saltmarshes. Modelling of a survey strip over a single year on the Dongtan wetland showed that the simulated spread pattern agreed with the actual pattern recorded during the growing season (March-September) with an accuracy of 90-95%, based on the estimations of seed bank dynamics and seedling establishment. On a wider spatio-temporal scale, an 8 year simulation showed that the patterns of range expansion of S. alterniflora are amenable to spatially-explicit modelling that takes spatio-temporal processes into account, mainly due to the aggregation effects of clonal integration in patches. Hydrodynamic conditions and niche availability were the most important factors controlling the expansion rate of S. alterniflora on the seaward expansion front. However, the actual expansion rate of S. alterniflora has slowed down in recent years due to the reduction in the sediment load of the Yangtze River following the completion of the Three Gorges Dam Project. There remain several uncertain issues relating to the model setup and its predictive capacity in terms of environmental variability and the stochasticity that is inherent in the modelling of the reproduction, dispersal and survival of S. alterniflora. Furthermore, an update of the model is needed linked to the sediment dynamics seasonality of hydrodynamic conditions in the Yangtze Estuary. In conclusion, this modelling approach provided valuable insights into the life-cycle mechanisms and range expansion processes of S. alterniflora under the current conditions. We suggest the potential application of this model in comparing various control strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yan, DM; Zhao, FY; Sun, OJ				Yan, Demin; Zhao, Fangying; Sun, Osbert Jianxin			Assessment of Vegetation Establishment on Tailings Dam at an Iron Ore Mining Site of Suburban Beijing, China, 7 Years After Reclamation with Contrasting Site Treatment Methods	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Strip-mining operations greatly disturb soil, vegetation and landscape elements, causing many ecological and environmental problems. Establishment of vegetation is a critical step in achieving the goal of ecosystem restoration in mining areas. At the Shouyun Iron Ore Mine in suburban Beijing, China, we investigated selective vegetation and soil traits on a tailings dam 7 years after site treatments with three contrasting approaches: (1) soil covering (designated as SC), (2) application of a straw mat, known as "vegetation carpet", which contains prescribed plant seed mix and water retaining agent (designated as VC), on top of sand piles, and (3) combination of soil covering and application of vegetation carpet (designated as SC+VC). We found that after 7 years of reclamation, the SC+VC site had twice the number of plant species and greater biomass than the SC and VC sites, and that the VC site had a comparable plant abundance with the SC+VC site but much less biodiversity and plant coverage. The VC site did not differ with the SC site in the vegetation traits, albeit low soil fertility. It is suggested that application of vegetation carpet can be an alternative to introduction of topsoil for treatment of tailings dam with fine-structured substrate of ore sands. However, combination of topsoil treatment and application of vegetation carpet greatly increases vegetation coverage and plant biodiversity, and is therefore a much better approach for assisting vegetation establishment on the tailings dam of strip-mining operations. While application of vegetation carpet helps to stabilize the loose surface of fine-structured mine wastes and to introduce seed bank, introduction of fertile soil is necessary for supplying nutrients to plant growth in the efforts of ecosystem restoration of mining areas.

Changes in sex ratios of a dioecious grass with grazing intensity: the interplay between gender traits, neighbour interactions and spatial patterns	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Dioecious plants frequently face sex-related resource allocation trade-offs. Differential traits of male and female plants can have important consequences that influence their direct and indirect interactions with neighbours and herbivores. 2. Gender differences in traits have been considered to be inherently linked to sex-biased ratios along environmental stress gradients. However, the mechanisms behind the variation in sex ratios with increasing biotic stress remain elusive. 3. We linked the results of process-based field experiments with fine-scale spatial patterns of naturally established plants (both sexes) at different grazing intensities. We demonstrated that slow-growing females were better defended against insects and small mammals but were more susceptible than males to competition from neighbours. 4. In large-herbivore exclosures, we found that sex-biased spatial patterns at the microsite scale can be predicted from gender-specific traits, with females more segregated from competitors (unpalatable grasses) than males. Traits related to growth/defence trade-off in females, coupled with their higher competition costs than males, suggest that gender dimorphism in traits can directly influence species interactions and spatial organization. 5. In the presence of large herbivores, female individuals were preferentially browsed despite their larger investment in antiherbivore compounds. The greater distance of females from unpalatable competitors was the main determinant of female-biased consumption by domestic herbivores. Females growing close to neighbours successfully eluded browsing but also faced competition. Scaling up to a population level, population sex ratios drift from female- to male-bias with increasing domestic grazing intensity. 6. Synthesis: The sexual dimorphism in traits of a dioecious bunchgrass results in differential herbivory by natural enemies, differential competitive ability and differential spatial distribution of sexes. Domestic grazers disrupt this balance by shifting species interactions and their spatial organization. Changes in dioecious plant populations towards male-biased sex ratios with grazing intensity could not be predicted solely by gender-specific traits.

WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Silverleaf nightshade is one of the worst agricultural weeds on a worldwide basis. Improved understanding of its life cycle will be useful for weed management. This research showed that the growth and reproduction of silverleaf nightshade were affected significantly by the time of emergence. Plants (both root- and seed-generated) that emerged early in the growing season, such as in September or November (spring), were significantly taller and produced more biomass and fruit than plants that emerged in January (summer) and March (autumn). Delayed emergence resulted in a shorter vegetative phase and less fruit production. As a result, the silverleaf nightshade plants that emerged in September produced a large amount of seeds, while the plants that emerged later in the season did not flower. Thus, control of early-emerging plants is important. The dynamics of fruit production indicated that silverleaf nightshade fruit formed in December and peaked in March, which suggests that a control action is required before December to control the soil seed bank.

Seed germination of the carnivorous plant Byblis gigantea (Byblidaceae) is cued by warm stratification and karrikinolide	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Byblidaceae is one of the most poorly studied carnivorous plant families, with seed dormancy and germination biology remaining unresolved. This knowledge deficit has significant conservation and management implications, particularly as the most southerly distributed species, the south-west Western Australian endemic Byblis gigantea, is listed as critically endangered. This study examined the ecophysiology of seed dormancy and germination in B.gigantea in concert with a study of the population dynamics of a single plant community. Mass seedling emergence and plant establishment were observed after a wildfire in 2007 in the natural population, followed by a rapid decline in mature individuals (91%) over a 4-year monitoring period, with almost no inter-fire recruitment (1.4% of all emergence) observed. Seeds possessed a fully developed embryo, and the germination characteristics of fresh seeds classified them as showing physiological dormancy. Seed dormancy was partially alleviated by warm stratification (30 degrees C) for 8weeks prior to incubation at 15 degrees C, with c. 40% germination observed. With the additional exposure of seeds to the germination-active chemical in smoke, karrikinolide, the germination of warm-stratified seeds increased to 89%. Seeds also displayed orthodox storage behaviour and appeared to be amenable to long-term seed banking for conservation. These results present the first observation of the stimulation of the germination of a carnivorous plant by a smoke-derived compound.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Merritt, David J/G-9376-2011; Cross, Adam/S-2710-2019	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; Merritt, David J/0000-0002-3250-6861; 												0024-4074					SEP	2013	173	1					143	152		10.1111/boj.12075							WOS:000323322900009

Transient Seed Bank of Camelina Contributes to a Low Weedy Propensity in Western Canadian Cropping Systems	CROP SCIENCE												Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz.] is an oilseed currently being developed for production of industrial bioproducts. To determine whether camelina is persistent or weedy in agricultural areas experiments were conducted in 2008 through 2011. A three-part study quantified camelina seed loss at the time of harvest, persistence of seed in the soil, and density and persistence of volunteer populations in subsequent crops. In this small-seeded crop, seed losses at harvest ranged from 1202 to 43,430 viable seeds m(-2) (12.0 to 434.3 kg ha(-1)). Viable seed persisted less than 15 mo at all depths, sites, and years. Seeds persisted longer on the soil surface while seed buried at 3 and 10 cm depleted more rapidly. The days to 50% seed extinction (EX50) ranged from 25 d for all burial depths at one site in 2009 to 66 d for surface seeds in 2008. Eleven commercial fields planted to camelina in 2009 were surveyed for the presence and persistence of volunteer populations throughout the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Initial surveys showed variable densities (9 to 4839 plants m(-2)); however, populations sharply declined over time and were nearly extinct after 2 yr under conventional production practices. While camelina has high fecundity and large seed losses at harvest, it has limited seed bank persistence and is unlikely to become a weed of agricultural areas.																	0011-183X					SEP-OCT	2013	53	5					2176	2185		10.2135/cropsci2013.03.0142							WOS:000323116900036

M.; Cadol, Dan			Evaluating physical and biological influences on sedimentation in a tidal freshwater marsh with Be-7	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Key differences exist between tidal fresh- and saltwater marshes, such as the relative importance of mineral versus organic sedimentation and plant species diversity, that likely result in different drivers of sedimentation. In tidal freshwater marshes, we hypothesize that vegetation composition, along with physical marsh features (i.e., elevation and tidal channels), play a critical role in sedimentation. This hypothesis is evaluated in Dyke Marsh Preserve (Potomac River, VA, USA) by examining sediment character (grain size, organic content) and deposition rates across the marsh in spring and summer 2010 and 2011. Be-7 is especially well suited to capture seasonal sedimentation patterns owing to its short half-life (53.3 d) and ability to assess both sediment deposition and erosion. However, its use in marshes can be challenging, especially due the presence of vegetation. In this study, Be-7-derived sedimentation rates are compared with sediment deposition observed on ceramic tiles to assess its utility in tidal freshwater marshes, and biophysical influences on sediment deposition are examined through statistical models. Be-7- and tile-derived sedimentation rates show similar spatial and temporal patterns, with highest rates occurring at sites closer to tidal channels, highlighting the importance of sediment availability. In addition, complex feedbacks between sedimentation and the plant community are discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Density and nitrogen effects on interference and economic threshold of common lambsquarters in wheat	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE												Common lambsquarters (CL) constitutes about 50 % of the total weed population in many wheat fields of the northern and central India. It causes considerable wheat yield losses. Its interference is highly influenced by nitrogen (N). Information on its density effect in response to N, and economic threshold (ET) will be useful for its effective management. This experiment was designed to evaluate and compare the interference of CL in response to N with that of natural weed infestations; and to determine its ET in wheat. It was observed that the natural weed infestation including CL, and a pure stand of 128 CL plants/m(2) were more competitive, causing greater reductions in wheat growth and yield than other CL densities. In the absence of CL, the natural weed infestation was less competitive. The natural weed infestation including CL, and the pure stand densities of 128 and 64 CL/m(2) inflicted more yield losses at 120 than 60 kg N/ha. But, at lower densities up to 32 CL/m(2), increasing N levels favoured wheat more, resulting in greater crop-weed balance at 120 than at 60 kg N/ha. The ET, 6-7 CL/m(2), would help in making decisions for CL management and fitting models. It can be approximated for other similar locations. This ET takes several production factors into account and would be more economical than what was determined based on only yield losses. The ET-based control would reduce future CL/weed populations by preventing seed bank build-up in soil, and rationalize herbicide use through tailoring of doses.																	1612-4758					SEP	2013	86	3					611	619		10.1007/s10340-013-0478-x							WOS:000323434200025						
J	Craig, M; Buckley, GP				Craig, Marja; Buckley, G. Peter			Responses of two woodland geophytes to disturbance caused by soil translocation	PLANT ECOLOGY												Topsoil transfer is an important tool in ecological restoration, but as a technique for re-locating woodland habitats displaced by development works it would appear highly damaging to geophytes present in the field layer. The effect of moving soil using different handling techniques was simulated in pot experiments with two common geophytes, Hyacinthoides non-scripta (L.) Chouard ex Rothm. and Anemone nemorosa L., while longer term changes in Hyacinthoides populations were also followed at an active woodland translocation field site in South East England, UK. In the pot experiment, artificially damaging Hyacinthoides bulbs restricted their performance, as did planting at sub-optimal depths and orientations, but Anemone rhizomes were little affected either by damage or displacement. Provided that they were able to produce leaves and thus re-allocate biomass to their perennating organs, recovery of both species was rapid in the following season. In the field, Hyacinthoides bulb densities also eventually recovered to levels reported in semi-natural woodlands in autumn-translocated soil profiles, although bulb biomass was still significantly lower in spring-moved treatments after three growing seasons. The parent bulbs rapidly adjusted their orientation and depth in the soil profile and were enhanced by natural seedling recruitment. The results suggest that, provided careful soil handling protocols are followed, these woodland geophytes have the capacity to recover if soil translocation is restricted to their dormant period. In the longer term, the sudden change from woodland to open conditions may be detrimental and may increase competition from non-woodland species.																	1385-0237					SEP	2013	214	9					1091	1103		10.1007/s11258-013-0233-7							WOS:000322886300001

Temporal dynamics of plant community regeneration sources during tallgrass prairie restoration	PLANT ECOLOGY												Ecological restoration aims to augment and steer the composition and contribution of propagules for community regeneration in degraded environments. We quantified patterns in the abundance, richness, and diversity of seed and bud banks across an 11-year chronosequence of restored prairies and in prairie remnants to elucidate the degree to which the germinable seed bank, emerged seedlings, belowground buds, and emerged ramets were related to community regeneration. There were no directional patterns in the abundance, richness, or diversity of the germinable seed bank across the chronosequence. Emerged seedling abundance of sown species decreased during restoration. Richness and diversity of all emerged seedlings and non-sown emerged seedling species decreased across the chronosequence. Conversely, abundance and richness of belowground buds increased with restoration age and belowground bud diversity of sown species increased across the chronosequence. Numbers of emerged ramets also increased across the chronosequence and was driven primarily by the number of graminoid ramets. There were no temporal changes in abundance and richness of sown and non-sown emerged ramets, but diversity of sown emerged ramets increased across the chronosequence. This study demonstrates that after initial seeding, plant community structure in restored prairies increasingly reflects the composition of the bud bank.

Do functional diversity differences exist between the vegetation and seed bank and are the differences modulated by productivity and disturbance. Location: An area of diverse land use on the west coast of Scotland. Methods: Parallel vegetation and seed bank surveys were carried out across 30 sites contrasting in land use, and hence productivity and disturbance regime. Data were analysed to assess overall differences between the seed bank and vegetation in community-weighted mean for selected functional traits and to test if the difference was affected by productivity or disturbance. Three functional diversity indices were calculated for each seed bank and vegetation sample functional richness, functional divergence and functional evenness - and each index was assessed for overall differences between the seed bank, the vegetation and differences modulated by disturbance and productivity. Results: There were clear differences in many community-weighted mean traits between the seed bank and the vegetation. Plants in the vegetation were characterized by increased stature, more conservative leaf traits, wind pollination and by being perennial, whereas plants in the seed bank had higher seed longevity, higher seed masses and were more frequently insect- or self-pollinated. There was no difference in functional richness between the seed bank and the vegetation, and while both the seed bank and the vegetation functional richness were significantly lower than expected, the vegetation showed a bigger deviation from expectations compared to the seed bank. The functional diversity indices revealed different relationships between seed bank and vegetation against productivity and disturbance. Functional divergence (and its standardized effect size) indicated stronger habitat filtering for the vegetation at high levels of productivity or disturbance, while the effect size of functional richness and functional evenness suggested stronger filtering on the seed bank at high levels of productivity and disturbance. Conclusions: The significant difference in traits between the seed bank and vegetation mean that following disturbance this is likely to have a considerable impact (at least in the short term) on ecosystem function. Functional diversity patterns were less clear, with conflicting evidence on habitat filtering, depending on the metric chosen.

J	de Jong, TJ; Isanta, MT; Hesse, E				de Jong, Tom J.; Isanta, Maria Tudela; Hesse, Elze			Comparison of the crop species Brassica napus and wild B. rapa: characteristics relevant for building up a persistent seed bank in the soil	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Can seed characters be used for predicting the presence of a persistent seed bank in the field? We address this question using ten cultivars of the crop Brassica napus, ten feral B. napus accessions originating from seeds collected in the field and nine accessions of the closely related ruderal species Brassica rapa. When buried for a year in the field, seeds of the wild B. rapa displayed, as expected, much higher survival fractions than those of domesticated B. napus at two different locations in The Netherlands. Compared to B. napus, B. rapa produces relatively small seeds with high levels of aliphatic glucosinolates and a thick seed coat. However, within each species none of these characters correlated with seed survival in the soil. At low temperatures, B. rapa seeds had lower and more variable germination fractions than those of B. napus; a small fraction (4.6%) of the B. rapa seeds showed primary dormancy. Rather surprisingly, B. napus displayed genetic differences in germination at low temperature, and germination fractions at 5 degrees C correlated negatively with seed survival in the soil. Our comparisons between and within the two species suggest that foregoing germination at low temperatures is an important character for developing a persistent seed bank. We discuss our results in light of environmental risk assessment of genetically modified B. napus.																	0960-2585					SEP	2013	23	3					169	179		10.1017/S0960258513000159							WOS:000322738700002

Using a deterministic population model to evaluate population stability and the effects of fruit harvesting and livestock on baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) populations in five land-use types	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The subsistence and commercial use of baobab (Adansonia digitata) fruit is important to many thousands of marginalized people in the arid tropics of Africa, yet sustainable harvest levels have not previously been studied. Size-class distributions of baobab populations tend to be stable, suggesting high tolerance to fruit harvesting. However, environmental conditions have changed substantially over the last 100 years. Increasing livestock numbers, land modification and climate change are new threats which may affect tolerance to fruit harvesting. To investigate this, a deterministic stage-based population projection matrix model was developed using (a) long term baobab monitoring data from 2 sites, (b) radiocarbon age calculations, (c) extensive field surveys of population structure and fruit (and seed) production, and (d) experimental field trials on seed banks and seedling and sapling survival in relation to the presence of livestock. Projected population growth (2) was then evaluated for five land-use types (nature reserves, rocky outcrops, plains, fields, and villages) under three levels of livestock (none, moderate and high stocking rates). Response to fruit harvest intensity was tested for each scenario by decreasing seed availability by 10% from 100%. High livestock numbers resulted in baobab population declines, with lambda < 1 in all land-use types. Under moderate and zero livestock numbers, baobab populations in plains, rocky outcrops, villages and fields were able to tolerate between 33% and 90% fruit harvest rates. In nature reserves there was already high predation on immature fruit by baboons, another cause of population decline, with the model showing no tolerance whatsoever to fruit harvesting. These results show that fruit harvesting can be sustainable in production landscapes under moderate livestock levels. However the future is uncertain, as a predicted lowering of rainfall due to climate change is a further concern, with likely negative impacts on fruit yields and recruitment and consequently population projections. Thus active planting and protection of seedlings should take place to mitigate current and future negative impacts facing baobab populations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Leal, N; Sena, JD; dos Santos, GR				Leal Filho, Niwton; Sena, Juliana dos Santos; dos Santos, Gisele Rodrigues			Space-time variations in soil seed stock in an amazon rainforest	ACTA AMAZONICA												The dispersion efficiency, longevity and the ability of seeds to remain latent waiting for suitable conditions for germination in the forest soil seed bank ensures the presence of pioneer tree species in disturbed areas. The seasonal and spatial variations in the density and floristic composition of the seed bank in tropical rainforests is a subject still little understood. This work verified the existence of spatio-temporal changes of the seed bank present in areas of humid tropical rain forest located near Manaus, Amazonas. In each of the six study areas, 40 circular samples of topsoil (10 cm in diameter and 2 cm deep) were randomly collected every two months, from August 2004 to June/2005. Inside a greenhouse, the collected soil samples were distributed in trays and the emergence of seeds present in the soil was accompanied during four months. There was a significant reduction (H: 14.09112, p <0.05) in the mean density of seeds presents in the soil in June (early dry season) compared to February (middle of the rainy season). There was also a significant difference (H: 188.7245, p <0.05) in the mean density of soil seeds present in the different samples areas. Similar to other tropical forest areas, the permanent seed bank in the forest was dominated by pioneer species, mainly from the family Melastomataceae, while typical tropical forest species were rare in the forest soil.																	0044-5967	1809-4392				SEP	2013	43	3					305	314		10.1590/S0044-59672013000300006							WOS:000321726600006						
J	Yamada, S; Kitagawa, Y; Okubo, S				Yamada, S.; Kitagawa, Y.; Okubo, S.			A comparative study of the seed banks of abandoned paddy fields along a chronosequence in Japan	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Since paddy weed communities are declining with intensification and abandonment of agricultural activities, protecting these species has become important. Seed banks of paddy weeds may decline with increasing duration of abandonment. To determine the potential role of seed banks in the restoration of paddy weeds, we aimed to clarify whether the germinable seed bank of paddy weeds changes with increasing successional age. We investigated the established vegetation and soil seed banks of 25 abandoned plots between 6 and 37 years old, and of four cultivated plots. The target species were defined as specialist rice-paddy species, which are observed only in cultivated paddies and have not been reported in other habitats. A statistical description of the species response along environmental gradients was obtained by using linear mixed-effects models. Duration of abandonment is a major factor influencing the pattern of specialist rice-paddy species from soil seed banks. Both the species richness and the number of viable seeds in specialist rice-paddy species decreased significantly with time, with the number of species declining by ca. 50% over 40 years. Although seed banks of paddy weeds have relatively high resilience for maintaining populations after abandonment, our results indicated that younger abandoned sites were more beneficial for the restoration of paddy weed communities. Nevertheless, several threatened species persisted in seed banks in longer-abandoned sites, which are thus available to conserve specific species of paddy weeds. The number of viable seeds from non-specialist species remained large throughout the 40-year chronosequence. If paddies with longer periods of abandonment are selected as restoration sites, management practices should be carried out to prevent the dominance of non-specialist species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It was documented that annual bluegrass can reproduce sexually and produce a functional seed bank of close to 5000 seeds/m(2) under maritime Antarctic conditions. Comparison of germination between Poa annua and two native plant species revealed that Poa annua seeds can germinate as fast or even faster than native species, and are more vigorous. Our studies show that in the Antarctic Poa annua can successfully reproduce sexually and produce fully developed, viable caryopses that are able to survive the maritime Antarctic winter, not only in a soil bank, but also directly in the previous year's inflorescences.

There has been no test for warm temperate rain forests (WTRFs), but they offer a promising testing ground because they differ widely in the extent of disturbance. WTRF is dominated by microphylls sensu Raunkiaer and has a simpler structure and range of physiognomy than tropical or subtropical rain forests. It occurs in six parts of the world: eastern Asia, New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, SE Australia and the Azores. On the Azores it has been mostly destroyed, so we studied instead the subtropical montane rain forest (STMRF) on the Canary Islands which also represents a relict of the kind of WTRF that once stretched across southern Eurasia. We sought to find whether in these six regions the proportion of tree species needing canopy gaps for establishment reflects the frequency and/or extent of canopy disturbance by wind, landslide, volcanic eruptions (lava flow and ash fall), flood or fire. We used standard floras and ecological accounts to draw up lists of core tree species commonly reaching 5m height. We excluded species which are very rare, very localized in distribution, or confined to special habitats, e.g. coastal forests or rocky sites. We used published accounts and our own experience to classify species into three groups: (1) needing canopy gaps for establishment; (2) needing either light shade throughout or a canopy gap relatively soon (a few months or years) after establishment; and (3) variously more shade-tolerant. Group 1 species were divided according the kind of canopy opening needed: tree-fall gap, landslide, lava flow, flood or fire. Only some of the significant differences in proportion of Group 1 species were consistent with differences in the extent of disturbance; even in some of those cases other factors seem likely to have had a major determining influence during evolution. We also sought to determine whether the species that are at least short-term persistent' in the soil seed bank (lasting 2-4years) are all species needing canopy gaps for establishment. The answer was negative; large numbers of seeds of some shade-tolerants accumulate in the soil, and these species are able to benefit from soil disturbance in deep shade. We found a significant and strong positive relationship in Japan between mean seed mass and mature tree height, a weak positive relationship in New Zealand and no relationship in any of the other four regions. When comparing the seed mass values of Group 1 and Group 3 species we obtained different answers depending on whether or not we confined ourselves to taxonomically controlled contrasts. In only two of the four regions with an appreciable number of species in Group 1 is the mean seed mass of such species significantly lower than that of Group 3 species when taxonomic relatedness is ignored.

Ernesto Tornquist Provincial Park (Sierra de la Ventana, Buenos Aires, Argentina) protects a remnant of pampean grasslands and is seriously threatened by the spread of alien woody plants, among them by Pinus halepensis. The effect that this species has on the structure and functioning of the ecosystem lead to the implementation of control actions aimed to reduce invasion. This work presents the results of monitoring the recovery of native grasslands after two control strategies: complete and partial removal of invasive trees, with and without complementary restoration actions (removal of needles, soil disturbance, addition of top-soil from non-invaded grasslands). Changes in vegetation following management actions were analyzed. Two years after removing the pines cleared areas showed increases in vegetation cover and species richness, with no detectable differences associated to complementary restoration actions. Percentage cover of alien plants showed a peak after felling the trees but this was later reverted by an increase in the abundance of native plants. These results highlight the capacity of spontaneous recovery of grasslands after controlling pines and the importance of early interventions in order to prevent changes that could be hard to revert.																	1851-2372					AUG	2013	48	2					315	329									WOS:000324610600012						
J	Bell, TJ; Powell, KI; Bowles, ML				Bell, Timothy J.; Powell, Kristin I.; Bowles, Marlin L.			Viability Model Choice Affects Projection Accuracy and Reintroduction Decisions	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Matrix model population viability analyses (PVAs) are commonly used to assess extinction risk, but their accuracy is rarely tested, especially using long-term data sets. Because the few studies that have assessed matrix models indicate that PVAs can have limited predictive power and are sensitive to model choice and assumptions, model choice can affect management decisions. We used 12 years of demographic data (1997-2009) from an introduction of a federally listed, threatened dune thistle, Cirsium pitcheri, to parameterize and test the accuracy of 5 matrix models. Models differed in their method of incorporating environmental stochasticity (matrix selection vs. element selection) as well as their correlation structure of vital rates. We compared 5-year model projections to observed population growth rate, size, and persistence in 2009. We found that all models tended to over-project population growth, size, and stage distributions, but median projections were rarely significantly different from observed values. Projected population growth simulated from the matrix selection model differed significantly from observed, likely because of greater precision compared to large variances in projections produced by element selection models. Incorporating within-year correlations or eliminating correlation structure among vital rates were modeling strategies that correctly predicted the probability of persistence of the restored population. Element selection models incorporating between-year correlations consistently underestimated persistence. Since precision was low for all models, projections should be interpreted qualitatively rather than quantitatively. Differences in PVA model projections can affect management and restoration decisions when estimating reintroduction success and determining the required number of individuals to transplant to obtain a viable population.

Although actions have been promoted to eliminate it, these efforts have failed to restore dunes to the natural, preinvasion stage. We tested, by means of field and laboratory experiments, how C edulis alters soil chemistry by causing residual effects on soil, and examined whether these effects decrease germination, survival and growth of a common native chamaephyte dune species Malcolmia littorea. We also recorded species diversity to find out which species can establish after the removal of the invasive C edulis. To link both measures, we monitored changes in soil characteristics over 1 year after the removal of the invader, by analyzing both soil chemical properties and extracellular enzymes. C edulis lowers soil pH, Ca and Na content and increases organic content, salinity and nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. The effects of the invader on the growth of M. littorea during the first growing season were very weak, despite strong negative effects in the early stages of this species' population development that decreased total germination and survival. Overall, the soil characteristics and activity of the microbial community tend to recover back to preinvasion conditions in plots from which C edulis is removed. In contrast, the establishment of native dune vegetation is constrained, as indicated by lower species diversity in restored compared to non-invaded areas. This is because regenerating dunes are occupied by opportunistic ruderal species that compete with native dune plants of conservation value and restrict their establishment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fernandez, C; Vega, JA; Fonturbel, T				Fernandez, Cristina; Vega, Jose A.; Fonturbel, Teresa			Effects of fuel reduction treatments on a gorse shrubland soil seed bank in the north of Spain: Comparing mastication and prescribed burning	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Fuel reduction treatments are commonly used to decrease the risk of severe wildfire in shrubland areas in the North of Spain. Information about the associated environmental effects is required to help forest managers select the most appropriate treatment. Although the soil seed bank plays an important role in post-disturbance recovery and resilience of frequently disturbed shrubland communities, little is known about how it is affected by fuel reduction treatments. We carried out a combined greenhouse and field study to evaluate the effects of two fuel reduction methods (prescribed burning and mastication) on the size and composition of the soil seed bank in a fire-prone gorse shrubland area in northern Spain. Total seedling density, species richness and similarity index were the variables analyzed. We also determine the effect of the depth of the soil organic cover remaining after mastication on the soil seed bank composition. In the greenhouse experiment, significantly more seedlings emerged from the samples of the soil seed bank obtained after burning (810.6 seedlings m(-2)) than in those obtained before burning (608.3 seedlings m(-2)) and after mastication (610.1 seedlings m(-2)). This contrasted with the lack of differences observed before and after mastication. Species richness in the soil seed bank was not altered by either prescribed burning or mastication. The observed high degree of similarity between soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation in both pre and post-treated soils was attributed to the dominance of resprouting species. Post-burning seedling density was not significantly related to any of the soil thermal regime parameters during burning. The depth of the soil organic cover after mastication apparently did not affect the composition of the soil seed bank. The field study revealed a low rate of seed germination of all species, which along with the rapid recovery of cover by the resprouting woody species in the community, suggests that the soil seed bank makes little contribution to the recovery of shrubland communities after fuel reduction treatments. There was little opportunity to enhance vegetation recovery through the soil seed bank after prescribed burning and mastication. Mastication seems to be a more conservative technique although low intensity burnings as those conducted in the present study did not stimulate seed germination nor reduce seed bank size. In summary, prescribed burning and mastication can be considered feasible techniques for fuel management in these shubland areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Disturbance and seed depth affect the survival and germination probability of seeds in the seed bank, which in turn affect population dynamics. We develop a density-dependent stochastic integral projection model to evaluate the effect of stochastic soil disturbances on plant population dynamics with an emphasis on mimicking how disturbances vertically redistribute seeds within the seed bank. We perform a simulation analysis of the effect of the frequency and mean depth of disturbances on the population's quasi-extinction probability, as well as the long-term mean and variance of the total density of seeds in the seed bank. We show that increasing the frequency of disturbances increases the long-term viability of the population, but the relationship between the mean depth of disturbance and the long-term viability of the population are not necessarily monotonic for all parameter combinations. Specifically, an increase in the probability of disturbance increases the long-term viability of the total seed bank population. However, if the probability of disturbance is too low, a shallower mean depth of disturbance can increase long-term viability, a relationship that switches as the probability of disturbance increases. However, a shallow disturbance depth is beneficial only in scenarios with low survival in the seed bank.																	0003-0147	1537-5323				AUG	2013	182	2					180	190		10.1086/670987							WOS:000321703400008	23852353

A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				AUG	2013	27	4					690	700		10.1111/cobi.12087							WOS:000321980800007	23773124					
J	Ma, MJ; Zhou, XH; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Zhou, Xianhui; Du, Guozhen			Effects of disturbance intensity on seasonal dynamics of alpine meadow soil seed banks on the Tibetan Plateau	PLANT AND SOIL												Information on soil seed bank processes is crucial for understanding vegetation dynamics. Despite the documented importance of soil seed banks in many ecosystems, their role is not fully understood in some sensitive habitats, such as the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau. We studied the seasonal dynamics of the germinable soil seed bank under four disturbance intensities in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau as well as seed size distribution relative to disturbance intensity. Composition of the seed bank was compared with that of the standing vegetation. Density of buried seeds increased with disturbance intensity, but species richness and species diversity decreased. Seed density and species richness of the seed bank varied seasonally in all layers (0-2, 2-7, 7-12 cm) and the whole (0-12 cm). The species composition of seed bank was not significantly influenced by season. There was no trend in seed size distribution as disturbance increased. Seasonal seed bank turnover rates increased with increase in disturbance. The result of the NMDS showed that species composition of seed bank and vegetation exhibited a fairly uniform pattern in each season. Although as a whole the species composition of the vegetation and seed bank showed a relatively low degree of similarity in each season, similarity was highest in the most disturbed habitat. There was no alteration in species composition of seed bank regardless of disturbance intensity, but seed density decreased as disturbance increased. Disturbances in alpine plant communities might increase persistence of regeneration niches. Regeneration from the seed bank together with vegetative reproduction contributed to aboveground vegetation in highly disturbed habitats. Clonal species played an important role in regeneration of vegetation in slightly disturbed areas, where there was little contribution of ruderals from soil seed banks.

J	Rodriguez-Buritica, S; Suding, K				Rodriguez-Buritica, Susana; Suding, Katharine			Interactive effects of temporal and spatial fire characteristics on the population dynamics of a fire-dependent Cypress species	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Current predictions about climate change and its impact on fire regimes have spurred research on how increasing fire frequencies will affect the population dynamics of fire-dependent species. There has been less consideration of changes in the spatial characteristics of fire regimes, despite recognition of the importance of spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in population dynamics. 2. Here, we test the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity in fire regimes may not benefit obligate seeders with canopy seed bank, due to regeneration constraints into non-burned areas. We develop a size-structured population model for a population of Tecate cypress Callitropsis forbesii (Jeps.) Little, a rare obligate seeder of conservation concern, across a complex landscape in the Santa Ana Mountains (Orange, CA, USA). Combining the population model with field measurements of stand structure and fire history, we test the roles of heterogeneity in fire regime and dispersal among patches with differing fire history on population persistence. 3. The model predicts population persistence at fire return intervals >17years, the approximate fire return interval at the site over the last century. However, population growth and population persistence increase when subpopulations are connected by dispersal and, within a small window of fire return intervals, when subpopulations have uncorrelated fire dynamics. Contrary to our expectations, spatial heterogeneity in fire regime increased population growth rates at intermediate (15-25year) fire return intervals. 4. Synthesis and applications. Conservation efforts focused on isolated populations of fire-dependent species should focus on both the temporal (fire return interval) and spatial (heterogeneity in fire occurrence) aspects of fire regimes. For one threatened Cypress species, we find that the interaction between temporal and spatial characteristics of a fire regime can increase the risks of population extinction, particularly under fire regimes characterized by more frequent, larger and more spatially homogenous fire. Species with fragmented subpopulations not well connected by dispersal also have a greater risk of extinction under these fire regimes.																	0021-8901					AUG	2013	50	4					929	938		10.1111/1365-2664.12109							WOS:000321762900013

In a rice field in the county of Bacabal, located in the state of Maranhao, thirty 25-m(2) plots were laid out. From 15 plots, soil samples (6/plot; n = 90) were taken with a soil probe (25 x 16 x 3 cm) and placed in aluminum trays in the greenhouse. From the remaining 15 plots, weed samples (6/plot; n = 90) were taken with the same soil probe. The number of seeds was estimated by germination. We evaluated the numbers of species and individuals, as well as the density, frequency, abundance and importance value (IV) for each species. Diversity was computed by the Shannon index (H'). We recorded 13,892 individuals (among 20 families, 40 genera and 60 species), of which 11,530 (among 50 species) germinated ex situ and 2,362 (among 34 species) germinated in situ. The family Cyperaceae had the highest number of species (16), followed by Poaceae (10). The dominant species, in situ and ex situ, were Schoenoplectus juncoides (IV=47.4%) and Ludwigia octovalvis (IV=34.8%), respectively. Floristic diversity was higher ex situ (H'-2.66). The information obtained here could help determine the infestation potential of these species, which could lead to improved management strategies.

The traditional planting of tree seedlings in these remote degraded areas uses air and river transport of machinery and supplies resulting in a very expensive restoration process. To develop low cost nucleation techniques based on the application of locally available natural elements, allowing the natural regeneration of pioneer tree species, 5 treatments with 5 replicates, distributed in a 25 x 25 m Latin square, were tested, in the region of Urucu, Amazonas: T0 (control), T1 (application of topsoil on fertilized seedbeds of manually scarified soil with sides protected using Cecropia logs), T2 (application of topsoil on fertilized seedbeds without lateral protection), T3 (application of topsoil directly on the fertilized surface of the degraded area) and T4 (application of topsoil by hydroseeding on seedbed). The effects on apparent density and soil fertility, as well as on the density and growth of emerged seedlings, were evaluated. After 18 months, the T1, T2 and T3 treatments resulted in the establishment of 3, 1 and 1 individuals m(-2), respectively, with similar heights, originating from the topsoil. The T0 and T4 treatments had no seedling emergence. The soil density was higher in treatments (>1.3 g cm(-3)) compared to the forest (0.95 cm(-3)). While the application of fertilizer and limestone promoted an increase in the soil fertility in the treatments, the levels of nitrogen and organic matter were higher in the forest.																	0100-6762					JUL-AUG	2013	37	4					587	597		10.1590/S0100-67622013000400002							WOS:000326656500002

Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia esula) Affects Vegetation More Than Seed Banks in Mixed-Grass Prairies of the Northern Great Plains	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Exotic plants have the ability to modify soil seed banks in habitats they invade, but little is known about the legacy of invasion on seed banks once an exotic plant has successfully been controlled. Natural areas previously invaded by leafy spurge in the northern Great Plains typically have one of two fates following its removal: a return of native plants, or a secondary invasion of other exotic plants. It is unknown, however, if this difference in plant communities following leafy spurge control is due to seed bank differences. To answer this question, we monitored seed banks and standing vegetation for 2 yr in mixed-grass prairies that were previously invaded by leafy spurge but controlled within 5 yr of our study. We found that native plant seed banks were largely intact in areas previously invaded by leafy spurge, regardless of the current living plant community, and leafy spurge invasion history had a larger impact on cover and diversity of the vegetation than on the seed banks. Differences in plant communities following leafy spurge control do not appear to be related to the seed banks, and soil conditions may be more important in determining trajectories of these postinvasion communities.

EFFECTS OF IRRIGATED RICE SOWING SEASON AND IMAZAPYR plus IMAZAPIC TIME OF APPLICATION ON RICE GRAIN YIELD AND RED RICE MANAGEMENT	PLANTA DANINHA												Irrigated rice sowing season and red rice competition are among the main factors affecting grain yield. The objective of this work was to evaluate the sowing date of irrigated rice and moments of application of the herbicide imazapyr + imazapic to control red rice management and irrigated rice grain yield. Eight experiments were performed at the following dates (09/30, 10/19, 11/08 and 12/01) for the 2010/2011 harvest season and (09/27, 10/17, 11/08 and 12/05) for the 2011/2012 harvest season. The treatments were: application of the herbicide imazapyr + imazapic at doses of 105+35 g ha(-1) in pre-emergence (PRE); 52.5+17.5 g ha(-1) in pre-emergence and 52.5+17.5 g ha(-1) in post-emergence (PRE + POST); and 105+35 g ha(-1) in post-emergence (POST), and a control without application and no weeding. The cultivar Puita Inta CL was used and a randomized block design with four replicates. A joint analysis of the experiments was carried out. There was less emergence of red rice and higher grain yield of the irrigated rice at the early periods (09/30/10 and 09/27/11), with 10,578 and 8,653 kg ha(-1), respectively. At the end of the season (12/01/10 and 12/05/11), there was greater reduction of the red rice seed bank. Sowing at the beginning of the recommended period provided more irrigated rice grain yield. The application of imazapyr + imazapic at a dose of 52.5+17.5 g ha(-1) in PRE + 52.5+17.5 g ha(-1) POST, and 105+35 g ha(-1) only in PRE and POST was effective in the control of red rice.																	0100-8358	1806-9681				JUL-SEP	2013	31	3					631	644		10.1590/S0100-83582013000300015							WOS:000322738400015

SOIL SEED BANKS IN PLANTATIONS AND TROPICAL SEASONAL RAINFORESTS OF XISHUANGBANNA, SOUTH-WEST CHINA	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE												The impacts of land conversion from forests to plantations on seed availability are poorly appraised in terms of future restoration potentials. Seed storage and species composition of soil seed banks were characterised in five natural forests and three plantations. Mean soil seed storage differed significantly between study sites, ranging from 2444 seeds/m(2) in a selectively logged forest to 17,946 seeds/m(2) in a pomelo orchard. For all sites except for secondary forest 2, herb seeds dominated the soil seed bank. More seeds of pioneer tree species were found in the soil seed banks of secondary forests than in primary rainforests. This suggests that secondary forests have higher seed availability and stronger potential for forest restoration than primary forests. Anthropogenic management activities resulted in abundant but less diverse soil seed bank due to the dominance of a few herbaceous species in the pomelo orchards and rubber plantations. Low tree seed storage was found in soil seed banks of pomelo orchards and rubber plantations and might decelerate forest succession. Thus, the seeds of pioneer trees in soil seed banks of secondary forests could promote natural forest regeneration in abandoned plantations.																	0128-1283					JUL	2013	25	3					375	386									WOS:000324006600011						
J	Cueto, VR; Milesi, FA; Marone, L				Cueto, Victor R.; Milesi, Fernando A.; Marone, Luis			Litter and seed burying alter food availability and foraging efficiency of granivorous birds in the Monte desert	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												We assessed experimentally if the main granivorous bird species that feed on the ground in the central Monte desert are able to detect and consume seeds buried in the soil or trapped within litter. Understanding seed vulnerability to birds allows 1) a better understanding of how seed abundance translates into seed availability, a necessary step to assess seed limitation scenarios, and 2) whether birds alter the distribution of soil seeds through their consumption. Rufous-collared sparrows found and consumed high proportions of buried seeds, though less seeds were eaten at increasing depths. In contrast, many-colored chaco-finches, common diuca-finches and cinnamon warbling-finches did not find buried seeds. All bird species fed on every substrate offered but, as a whole, birds reduced by 50% their seed consumption in Prosopis litter, and by 30% in Larrea litter, compared to consumption in bare soil. This effect was less notable for rufous-collared sparrows, whose double scratch' foraging method would contribute to its great diet breath and abundance in the Monte desert. As birds do not reach a fraction of seeds buried and trapped by litter, seeds readily available for them may be scarcer than previously estimated through soil seed bank studies. Furthermore, since the four bird species detect and consume seeds from littered microhabitats, seed consumption by them surely affects the seasonal dynamics of the soil seed bank in all microhabitat types of the Monte desert.																	0908-8857					JUL	2013	44	4					339	346		10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00042.x							WOS:000321327700005

Reproductive ecology of Aloe plicatilis, a fynbos tree aloe endemic to the Cape Winelands, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												While the pollination ecology of many Aloe species is well-documented, knowledge on aloe seed ecology, and hence aloe reproductive ecology in its entirety is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the reproductive ecology of Aloe plicatilis, a Cape fynbos tree aloe endemic to the Cape Winelands, South Africa. Results from a pollinator exclusion experiment conducted at an A. plicatilis population on Paarl mountain suggests pollination primarily by insects, although bird visitation significantly increased seed set/fruit indicating possible co-pollination with insects. The species' long-tubed flowers and production of concentrated nectar, with observations of malachite sunbirds as the most common avian visitors to A. plicatilis flowers indicate the importance of long-billed specialist avian nectarivores as floral visitors. Analysis of the relationship between plant size and inflorescence production for five populations combined revealed a significant, positive linear relationship between plant size and the logarithm of the number of inflorescences/plant. Natural fruit and seed set determined for three populations (1325, 27,930 and 251,616 seeds/population) suggests low reproductive output compared to several other Aloe species. The smallest (31 individuals) and least dense (75 plants/ha) A. plicatilis population produced the lowest seed set/plant (128 seeds) and per population (1325 seeds), suggesting an Allee effect. Evaluation of seed dispersal potential showed that potential dispersal distances were approximately three times the canopy height; however, the occurrence of A. plicatilis on mountains isolated from more continuous mountain ranges on which the species also occurs suggests the possibility of long-distance dispersal by strong, gusty, summer winds. Soil seed bank samples collected from 13 populations yielded close to zero seedling emergence, indicating the absence of persistent seed banks. A. plicatilis seeds stored under ambient laboratory conditions for 3, 18 and 24 months were germinated in an environmental control chamber and a laboratory. High percentage germination was recorded for 18- and 24-month-seed (86 and 80%, respectively), while germination of 3-month-old seeds was three times lower, suggesting the need for after-ripening. Germination of fresh and one-year-old seed under ambient nursery conditions at the Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden in Worcester yielded emergence percentages of 67 and 44%, respectively, and were therefore less successful than germination under more controlled conditions. This is the first known study to investigate the reproductive ecology of a tree aloe species and that of a Cape fynbos aloe. The study highlights the importance of further studies on aloe seed ecology, particularly for rare and threatened species. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Montpellier broom (Genista monspessulana) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum) in South Africa: An assessment of invasiveness and options for management	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The legumes (Fabaceae) Genista monspessulana and Spartium junceum are major invaders in several other parts of the world, but not yet so in South Africa. We determine their current distributions in South Africa at different spatial scales, assess population structure (soil seed banks and size at reproduction) evaluate current management activities, and provide recommendations for control (including assessing the feasibility of nation-wide eradication). G. monspessulana occurs at nine localities in three quarter-degree cells, covering a total of 22.7 ha. S. junceum is much more widespread, occurring in 33 quarter-degree cells and is frequently cultivated in private gardens. All naturalised or invasive populations are in disturbed areas, mostly along roadsides. Once established, G. monspessulana and S. junceum accumulate large, persistent soil-stored seed banks, ranging in size between 909 and 22,727 (median 1970) seeds/m(2) and 0 and 21,364 (median 455) seeds/m(2) for the two species respectively. Both species resprout vigorously after cutting and stump herbicide application (60% of G. monspessulana and 43% of S. junceum plants resprouted) which necessitates regular follow-ups. We estimate that over 10 years, at a cost of about ZAR 81,000 (1 ZAR = 0.114 US$ as on 6 October 2012), G. monspessulana could be extirpated from South Africa. S. junceum is far more widespread and coupled with low effectiveness of control, abundance of seeds and seed longevity, eradication is unfeasible. We recommend that control methods used for S. junceum be improved to prevent resprouting, and that areas are managed to limit the movement of seeds and avoid further spread and establishment. Further studies are required to understand why these two species have failed to replicate the invasiveness shown in other parts of the world. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Crop Seeding Level: Implications for Weed Management in Sweet Corn	WEED SCIENCE												Sweet corn is seeded under a wide range of population densities; however, the extent to which variable population density influences weed suppression is unknown. Therefore, field studies were undertaken to quantify the influence of sweet corn seeding level on growth, seed production, and post-harvest seed germination of wild-proso millet, one of the most problematic weeds in the crop. As crop seeding level increased, path analysis results indicated the crop canopy became taller and thicker, resulting in less wild-proso millet biomass, seed production, and germinability. However, at the level of individual fields, reductions in wild-proso millet growth and seed production were modest, at best, between a crop population currently used by growers and a higher crop population known to optimize yield of certain hybrids. These results indicate near-future increases in sweet corn seeding levels may play a minor role in improving weed management in individual sweet corn fields. Nonetheless, a reduction in crop populations, via weather- or management-driven phenomenon, increases risk of greater wild-proso millet seed production.																	0043-1745					JUL-SEP	2013	61	3					437	442		10.1614/WS-D-12-00205.1							WOS:000321320300014

Our objective was to determine how supplementation of grazing beef cattle (Bos taurus) with corn (Zea mays L.) dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) in unfertilized pasture (SUPP) affects annual herbage accumulation and presence of plant species and functional groups relative to unsupplemented beef cattle on unfertilized (CONT) and N-fertilized (FERT) smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) pasture. We addressed this objective in the sixth (2010) and seventh (2011) years of a long-term experiment in eastern Nebraska, where N input from DDGS supplementation and urea fertilizer averaged 0, 43, and 90 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) within CONT, SUPP, and FERT, respectively. For these years, annual herbage accumulation averaged 6.87, 6.80, and 10.58 Mg ha(-1) (LSD = 1.49) and 66.5, 66.2, and 76.0% of herbage accumulated by 25 June (LSD = 5.3) in CONT, SUPP, and FERT, respectively. Smooth bromegrass occurred in 99.8% of 0.1-m(2) pasture quadrats regardless of treatment. Cessation of N fertilizer input, however, increased presence of annual foxtail (Setaria spp.), annual graminoids, and annuals among quadrats in CONT relative to FERT. Supplementation of DDGS, while shown in previous studies to improve weight gains and N use efficiency in cattle, supplied enough N through excretion to provide an intermediate level of resistance to annual weeds. Nitrogen excreted from cattle supplemented with DDGS, however, did not affect herbage accumulation in subsequent years.																	0002-1962					JUL-AUG	2013	105	4					915	921		10.2134/agronj2012.0458							WOS:000320855100002

AQUATIC BOTANY												Sedimentation and alterations of natural hydroperiods from watershed cultivation have affected most depressional wetlands in the Great Plains. This can result in altered plant community structure through changes in water availability and depth as well as burial of seed banks. The vegetation and seed banks of 15 wetlands were sampled within the Rainwater Basin Region of Nebraska. Our objectives were to: (1) compare wetland seed bank communities among wetlands with different watershed land uses (reference, restored and impacted by watershed cultivation); (2) determine the available seed bank following sediment removal and establish if wetland zonation occurs in the deeper sediment layer of pre-scraped agricultural wetlands; and (3) determine the similarity between extant vegetation and the seed banks for each wetland land use treatment. There were no significant differences in seed bank species richness and the number and composition of annual, perennial, native, or exotic species among reference, restored, and agricultural playas. Restored wetlands had a greater number of upland species germinate from the surface soil seed bank compared to reference and agricultural playas. Availability of seeds after 30 cm of soil was removed (to simulate available seed bank if the wetland was to be restored) in crop land use wetlands was low (2-52 seeds/wetland) making determination of wetland zonation difficult. There was no difference in the similarity between the seed bank and extant vegetation among the three land use treatments. Sediment removal appears to be successful in removing weedy and exotic species from the seed bank; however, the seed bank is not the primary source for playa wetland revegetation. Restored and reference wetlands have similar seed bank community characteristics (i.e., richness) however, each wetland land use treatment was associated with differing plant species and plant guilds.

J	Xiao, C; Liu, GH				Xiao, Chan; Liu, Guihua			The relationship of seed banks to historical dynamics and reestablishment of standing vegetation in an aquaculture lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												We analyzed the development of submerged macrophytes and seed banks under an intense pen culture since the 1980s in Lake Honghu, China. We determined the relationship between depth distribution of seed banks and the historical dynamics of standing vegetation and evaluated the restoration potential of persistent soil seed banks at an abandoned pen-culture area. Eleven submerged macrophytes were recorded in the standing vegetation during 5 survey years, and mean wet biomass increased from 2760 g m(-2) in 1961 to a maximum of 5269 g m(-2) in 1992, and then declined to 1157 g m(-2) in 2010. Seeds of 8 macrophytes were found in the seed banks in 28 of the 32 sampling sites, with a mean density of 1936 seeds m(-2) over the entire sediment profile of 0-40 cm. Significantly more total seeds and viable seeds were present in the non-pen-culture area (2729 and 914 seeds m(-2), respectively) than in the pen-culture area (902 and 255 seeds m(-2), respectively). Our results showed a straightforward but small quantitative relationship between depth distribution of seed banks and historical variation of standing vegetation, suggesting that the depth distribution of the seed bank was a significant but relatively weak predictor of historical vegetation. The soil seed bank can potentially play an important role in vegetative restoration in the abandoned pen-culture area. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Disturbance and recovery in semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Aims (1) To investigate the temporal response of semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands to multiple disturbances as well as P fertilization and irrigation; and (2) to determine the reaction of single species or groups of species as well as the extent of recovery of the grassland community following cessation of the above interventions. Location North Greece. Methods In a fenced area, six treatments (burning, irrigation, digging, cutting, P fertilization and control) were applied, for three growing seasons, in a completely randomized block design with four blocks. Biomass was sampled in five (0.5x0.5m) quadrats per plot at the end of the growing season and sorted into the following functional groups: annual grasses, perennial grasses, annual legumes and forbs (that included all the other species). Measurements were repeated 1 and 7yr after cessation of the treatments. Results Annual grasses and legumes were positively favoured by cutting, burning and digging, which produced changes in vegetation composition over time. P fertilization had a positive influence on total legume biomass. Effects on individual species were not uniform. Plant composition after cessation of the disturbance treatments was quite different. Total legume biomass remained high 1yr after the cessation of P fertilization but declined thereafter. Annual grasses and legumes constituted the largest portion of the total biomass in the first year of the experiment. Disturbance (burning, cutting and digging) gradually reduced their biomass in favour of forbs. Seven years after cessation of the treatments, the tall annual, as well as perennial grasses constituted more than 80% of the total biomass. Under conditions of disturbance, short annual species had an advantage over perennials, while cessation of disturbance enables perennial grasses to dominate. Conclusions Disturbance promotes the dominance of annuals, especially species with a persistent seed bank. Repeated disturbance encourages an increase of small or prostrate species. Cessation of disturbance leads to the rapid recovery of biomass production. Tall annuals are promoted. P fertilization clearly favours legumes in the short term.

Stochastic and deterministic processes regulate spatio-temporal variation in seed bank diversity	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Seed banks often serve as reservoirs of taxonomic and genetic diversity that buffer plant populations and influence post-disturbance vegetation trajectories; yet evaluating their importance requires understanding how their composition varies within and across spatial and temporal scales (- and -diversity). Shifts in seed bank diversity are strongly governed by the deterministic role of differential seed longevities. Nevertheless, spatio-temporal variability in propagule depletion from and recruitment into seed banks may alter both - and -diversity. Here, we ask to what degree deterministic seed exhaustion, stochasticity in recruitment and mortality, or both, shape - and -diversity? Location Temperate hardwood forest stands of varying ages in northern Pennsylvania, USA. Methods We surveyed the seed bank and herbaceous vegetation communities at 39 sites and examined whether the species richness, abundance and composition of either community differs among and within sites of increasing age ranging from 43 to 106yr old. We explored how -diversity (species richness) and abundance (percentage cover, seed density) varied across the chronosequence age using regression analyses. We analysed differences in -diversity (community composition) using permutational multivariate analyses (i.e. PERMANOVA, PERMDISP). Finally, we tested whether community composition of the herbaceous layer and seed bank communities exhibited nestedness, where nestedness refers to the degree to which less species-rich sites are a non-random subset of more species-rich sites. Results We found seed bank -diversity and abundance consistently declined across a gradient of increasingly older sites. Moreover, nestedness analyses indicated species composition at older sites represented a subset of the species found at younger sites characterized by species with persistent seeds. Nevertheless, seed bank communities demonstrated divergent compositional trajectories, whereby older sites were increasingly dissimilar, not only from younger sites, but also from each other. Conclusions Our results suggest that even in assemblages strongly structured by deterministic forces, such as seed banks, minor stochastic differences in colonization and extinction events may increase -diversity over time. Therefore, we argue deterministic and stochastic processes are complementary factors governing post-disturbance turnover in species assemblages, and suggest that seed banks contribute to species persistence and overall forest community diversity across space and time.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				JUL	2013	24	4					724	734		10.1111/jvs.12011							WOS:000320114600014

Soil seed bank longevity of the exotic annual grass Bromus rubens in the Mojave Desert, USA	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Although arid environments are often considered among the least invaded terrestrial biomes, the impacts of exotic plant species can be severe and long lasting. Bromus rubens (red brome) is an exotic annual grass species in the Mojave Desert known to outcompete native plant species, alter habitat, and promote accumulation of fuel that contributes to increasing fire frequency and severity. We assessed longevity of the exotic B. rubens seeds in the soil by burying seeds at four depths (0, 2, 5, and 10 cm) and recovering seeds 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after burial. Seed viability was reduced with greater burial depth and greater time since burial. A relatively small proportion of seeds retained viability for two years, suggesting that while the B. rubens seed bank can be large, it is relatively short-lived. Although B. rubens apparently relies more on the annual production, dispersal, and germination of seeds than on a long-lived seed bank for its annual recruitment, the numerous seeds produced by individual plants indicate that even a small proportion of seeds remaining viable for more than a year can aid recruitment from the seed bank and is an important factor in understanding population dynamics.

Studies on their natural regeneration are crucial in order to understand the changes in species composition and for their restoration. The composition and abundance of seed rain and seed bank was analyzed during a year (dry and rainy seasons included), with the objective to evaluate their contribution to natural regeneration in temperate forests (Quercus spp., Abies religiosa and Pinus hartwegii forests) in the Magdalena river basin (MRB). Particularly, richness and quantity of diaspores in the seed rain, and the richness and quantity of seedlings in the seed bank were quantified. Comparison was carried out between them and also with respect to the extant vegetation. Richness resulted higher in the seed rain, with an important fraction of herbaceous, shrub and tree species characteristic of temperate forests. In the seed bank, two of the three main tree species in the area were absent, and there was a high abundance of herbaceous species characteristic of the early succession. The smallest similarity of species was found between the seed bank and the extant vegetation. Knowledge of the natural regeneration potential in the seed rain and in the seed bank allows for the consideration of certain species to be prescribed in management plans, with the aim to produce vegetation conditions similar to those of the original temperate forests.																	0378-1844					JUN	2013	38	6					400	409									WOS:000325911400002

Landscape-scale eco-evolutionary dynamics: Selection by seed predators and fire determine a major reproductive strategy	ECOLOGY												Recent work in model systems has demonstrated significant effects of rapid evolutionary change on ecological processes (eco-evolutionary dynamics). Fewer studies have addressed whether eco-evolutionary dynamics structure natural ecosystems. We investigated variation in the frequency of serotiny in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), a widespread species in which postfire seedling density and ecosystem structure are largely determined by serotiny. Serotiny, the retention of mature seeds in cones in a canopy seed bank, is thought to be an adaptation for stand-replacing fire, but less attention has been paid to the potential selective effects of seed predation on serotiny. We hypothesized that spatial variation in percentage serotiny in lodgepole pine forests results from an eco-evolutionary dynamic where the local level of serotiny depends on the relative strengths of conflicting directional selection from fire (favoring serotiny) and seed predation (favoring cones that open at maturity). We measured percentage serotiny, the abundance of American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus; the primary pre-dispersal seed predator of lodgepole pine), and several measures of forest structure in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Fire frequency strongly predicted the frequency of serotiny, a pattern that is well-supported in the literature. At sites with high fire frequency (return intervals of; similar to 135-185 years) where fire favors increased serotiny, squirrel abundance was negatively associated with serotiny, suggesting that selection from predation can overwhelm selection from fire when squirrels are abundant. At sites with low fire frequency (return intervals of; similar to 280-310 years), serotiny was nearly universally uncommon (<10%). Finally, forest structure strongly predicted squirrel density independently of serotiny, and serotiny provided no additional explanatory power, suggesting that the correlation is caused by selection against serotiny exerted by squirrels, rather than squirrels responding to variation in percentage serotiny.

One approach to preserve the genetic and species diversity for the future is to store propagules in seed vaults. However, germinability of seeds is assumed to be low for Arctic species. We evaluated ex situ storage potential of 113 of the 161 native angiosperms of Svalbard by studying seed ripening and germination. Seeds or bulbils were collected, and germinability was tested after one winter of storage in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Twenty-six of the species did not produce ripe propagules, 8 produced bulbils, and 79 produced seeds. Bulbils sprouted to high percentages. Seeds of 10 species did not germinate, 22 had low germination (< 20 %), 34 had germination of 21-70 %, and 13 had high germination percentages (> 70 %). More than 70 % of the species belonging to Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Juncaceae, Rosaceae, and Saxifragaceae germinated. Cold tolerant, common species had higher germination percentages than relatively thermophilous, rare species. Germination percentages were six times higher than observed in 1969 (n = 51) and 0.7 times that observed in 2008 (n = 22), indicating that recent climate warming improves germination in the Arctic. While in situ conservation is of vital importance, ex situ conservation in seed banks is a potential complementary conservation strategy for the majority of Arctic vascular plant species. For species that did not germinate, other methods for ex situ conservation should be sought, for example, growing in botanical gardens.

J	Ge, XL; Liu, J; Wang, RQ				Ge, Xiuli; Liu, Jian; Wang, Renqing			Effects of flooding on the germination of seed banks in the Nansi Lake wetlands, China	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The soil seed bank potentially is one of the important components of the regeneration of a wetland. To understand the effects of flooding on the germination of seed banks in wetlands, we simulated three hydrologic regimes in a seed bank germination experiment. Soil samples were collected from four communities in the Nansi Lake wetlands in Shandong Province, China. The temporal dynamics, species abundance, and number of seedlings were determined and analyzed statistically at the species and community levels. The results showed that flooding can delay seed emergence and suppress terrestrial plant emergence. Soil seed banks from different communities exhibited different responses to flooding, highlighting the role of species-specific flooding tolerance. These results also suggest that the species composition of emergent community types in shallow lake shore and humidogene forest characterized by shallow water tables would change drastically after Nansi Lake was impounded as a reservoir for China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project. Finally, based on the temporal dynamics of seed emergence, we suggest that emergence experiments be conducted over a longer period to avoid missing some species in the wetland soil seed bank.																	0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN 1	2013	28	2					225	237		10.1080/02705060.2012.729494							WOS:000318775300006						
J	Zhang, H; Chu, LM				Zhang, Hao; Chu, L. M.			Changes in soil seed bank composition during early succession of rehabilitated quarries	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												To evaluate the contribution of seed bank to natural revegetation, a soil seed bank study was carried out at different phases on three quarries in Hong Kong. A total of 2188 seedlings from 57 species were found, among which 36 species were herbaceous and graminoid plants while 21 were woody species. The soil seed banks were dominated by a few annual species, i.e. Ageratum conyzoides, A. houstonianum, Cynodon dactylon, Digitaria longiflora and Kyllinga brevifolia, which accounted for more than 35% of the total abundance. With ecological development, greater species number as well as seed density and diversity were recorded at older rehabilitated sites, which indicated that the process favors the increase in species richness. However, non-woody species predominated in all phases including those that were even more than 10 years after rehabilitation. The result of DCA showed that only 21 woody species which included 15 native species were better represented on the older quarry sites, which may still be insufficient to initiate natural succession at the later successional stage. As most native species in the soil seed banks were dispersed by birds, management strategies should take into account the possibility of enrichment planting with native species in the early stage and sowing some late successional species in the later stage for quarry rehabilitation.

Modelling population dynamics of Sinapis arvensis in organically grown spring wheat production systems	WEED RESEARCH												Although we know that alterations in crop density, crop spatial pattern and inclusion of more selective weed control can improve weed suppression for organic growers, it is unknown whether these result in changes to the weed seedbank that increase cropping system profitability over time. Data collected from field trials conducted in 2009 and 2010 in Maine, USA, comparing regional grower practices (Standard) with management that aimed to (i) facilitate better physical weed control through the use of wide row spacing and inter-row cultivation (Wide) or (ii) enhance cropweed competition through increased seeding rate and narrow inter-row spacing (Narrow HD), were used to construct a matrix population model with an economic sub-model. Using field measurements of grain yield and weed survival and fecundity, we investigated the lasting implications of employing alternative organic spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) production practices on Sinapis arvensis population dynamics. In most scenarios, the model indicated that regional production practices were not sufficient to prevent an increase in the weed seedbank, even with excellent weed control. The two alternative methods, on the other hand, were able to limit weed population growth when initial densities were low or cultivation efficacy was >80%. Due to higher seed costs in the Narrow HD system, net returns were still lower after 10years of simulation in this system compared with wide rows with cultivation, despite a lower weed seedbank.

J	Fleischer, K; Streitberger, M; Fartmann, T				Fleischer, Kristin; Streitberger, Merle; Fartmann, Thomas			The importance of disturbance for the conservation of a low-competitive herb in mesotrophic grasslands	BIOLOGIA												For the protection or re-establishment of species-rich grasslands, the limiting factors controlling species richness have increasingly become of scientific interest. This study aims to analyze the role of disturbance for the occurrence of a low-competitive herb, Centaurium erythraea Rafn, in mesotrophic, lowland grasslands in NW Germany. We sampled a total of 38 plots with presence of C. erythraea and 24 control (random) plots in semi-natural grasslands. As a proxy for disturbance, we estimated the cover of bare ground and Ellenberg flooding indicator species and measured the distance between the plot and the nearest path. Moreover, we counted the number of C. erythraea individuals within each plot. In the GLM analyses the distance from path was the only predictor; both the presence of the species and the number of individuals decreased with the distance from path. The grasslands at the path edges had the highest disturbance intensity. Here horse riding, military-vehicle traffic and regular sod-cutting directly create bare ground. In general, disturbance creating bare ground seems to be the key factor enabling germination and growth of C. erythraea in mesotrophic grasslands and other low-competitive short-lived species. Disturbance enhances the expression of the seed bank, favours the development of the shade-avoiding and low-growing rosettes and oppresses tall-growing competitors. Therefore we suggest grazing as the best management method.																	0006-3088	1336-9563				JUN	2013	68	3					398	403		10.2478/s11756-013-0164-8							WOS:000317645900006						
J	Stubbington, R; Datry, T				Stubbington, Rachel; Datry, Thibault			The macroinvertebrate seedbank promotes community persistence in temporary rivers across climate zones	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Aquatic macroinvertebrates inhabiting temporary rivers are typically described as having low resistance to riverbed drying. However, little research has examined the seedbank' within dry riverbed sediments, which comprises aquatic life stages that survive in dewatered sediments and from which active organisms may develop only after surface water returns. We synthesised published and unpublished data from studies that had experimentally rehydrated sediments collected from dry riverbeds, to establish the importance of the seedbank in promoting macroinvertebrate community resistance. Studies from across climate zones were included, to examine seedbank importance in relation to environmental harshness and, in particular, sediment moisture. We also assessed the importance of the seedbank relative to alternative habitats promoting persistence of the flowing river (FR) assemblage. We predicted that the proportion of the FR assemblage present in rehydrated sediments (RS) would decrease with environmental harshness, due to conditions within the sediments becoming less conducive to the survival of biota. A negative relationship between the proportion of FR taxa present in RS and harshness was observed, and this contributed to a reduction in the compositional similarity of FR and RS assemblages as harshness increased. Significant positive correlations were identified between sediment moisture content and macroinvertebrate community metrics (density and taxon richness) in some systems. Habitats external to the dry reach, which contribute to community resilience, were invariably inhabited by a greater number of FR taxa than rehydrated sediments. However, rehydrated sediments included several FR taxa that were not found in any other habitats during the dry phase, including families of Coleoptera and Diptera. Our results indicate the importance of the seedbank as a resistance mechanism for temporary river macroinvertebrates. With climate change scenarios predicting an increase in riverbed drying, maintaining habitats that facilitate the persistence of instream communities during dry phases is an increasing priority. We identified strong relationships between sediment moisture and taxon richness, and river management and rehabilitation activities should therefore aim to retain moisture in drying sediments, by manipulating parameters such as riparian shading.

We provide an overview of the potential bottlenecks for restoration of submerged macrophyte vegetation with a high biodiversity and focus on the biotic factors, including the availability of propagules, herbivory, plant competition and the role of remnant populations. We found that the potential for restoration in many lakes is large when clear water conditions are met, even though the macrophyte community composition of the early 1900s, the start of human-induced large-scale eutrophication in Northwestern Europe, could not be restored. However, emerging charophytes and species rich vegetation are often lost due to competition with eutrophic species. Disturbances such as herbivory can limit dominance by eutrophic species and improve macrophyte diversity. We conclude that it is imperative to study the role of propagule availability more closely as well as the biotic interactions including herbivory and plant competition. After abiotic conditions are met, these will further determine macrophyte diversity and define what exactly can be restored and what not.				van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; sarneel, judith/G-5248-2010; Gulati, Ramesh D/F-4943-2013; Bakker, Elisabeth S/B-7185-2008; Gulati, Ramesh D./A-3155-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; sarneel, judith/0000-0001-6187-499X; Bakker, Elisabeth S/0000-0002-5900-9136; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X												0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2013	710	1					23	37		10.1007/s10750-012-1142-9							WOS:000318170200003

Development of DArT Marker Platforms and Genetic Diversity Assessment of the US Collection of the New Oilseed Crop Lesquerella and Related Species	PLOS ONE												The advantages of using molecular markers in modern genebanks are well documented. They are commonly used to understand the distribution of genetic diversity in populations and among species which is crucial for efficient management and effective utilization of germplasm collections. We describe the development of two types of DArT molecular marker platforms for the new oilseed crop lesquerella (Physaria spp.), a member of the Brassicaceae family, to characterize a collection in the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) with relatively little known in regards to the genetic diversity and traits. The two types of platforms were developed using a subset of the germplasm conserved ex situ consisting of 87 Physaria and 2 Paysonia accessions. The microarray DArT revealed a total of 2,833 polymorphic markers with an average genotype call rate of 98.4% and a scoring reproducibility of 99.7%. On the other hand, the DArTseq platform developed for SNP and DArT markers from short sequence reads showed a total of 27,748 high quality markers. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis indicated that the different accessions were successfully classified by both systems based on species, by geographical source, and breeding status. In the germplasm set analyzed, which represented more than 80% of the P. fendleri collection, we observed that a substantial amount of variation exists in the species collection. These markers will be valuable in germplasm management studies and lesquerella breeding, and augment the microsatellite markers previously developed on the taxa.																	1932-6203					MAY 28	2013	8	5							UNSP e64062	10.1371/journal.pone.0064062							WOS:000319733000038	23724020

The Power to Detect Recent Fragmentation Events Using Genetic Differentiation Methods	PLOS ONE												Habitat loss and fragmentation are imminent threats to biological diversity worldwide and thus are fundamental issues in conservation biology. Increased isolation alone has been implicated as a driver of negative impacts in populations associated with fragmented landscapes. Genetic monitoring and the use of measures of genetic divergence have been proposed as means to detect changes in landscape connectivity. Our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity of Wright's F-st, Hedrick' G'(st), Sherwin's MI, and Jost's D to recent fragmentation events across a range of population sizes and sampling regimes. We constructed an individual-based model, which used a factorial design to compare effects of varying population size, presence or absence of overlapping generations, and presence or absence of population sub-structuring. Increases in population size, overlapping generations, and population sub-structuring each reduced F-st, G'(st), MI, and D. The signal of fragmentation was detected within two generations for all metrics. However, the magnitude of the change in each was small in all cases, and when Ne was >100 individuals it was extremely small. Multi-generational sampling and population estimates are required to differentiate the signal of background divergence from changes in F-st, G'(st), MI, and D associated with fragmentation. Finally, the window during which rapid change in F-st, G'(st), MI, and D between generations occurs can be small, and if missed would lead to inconclusive results. For these reasons, use of F-st, G'(st), MI, or D for detecting and monitoring changes in connectivity is likely to prove difficult in real-world scenarios. We advocate use of genetic monitoring only in conjunction with estimates of actual movement among patches such that one could compare current movement with the genetic signature of past movement to determine there has been a change.

The role of increasing nutrient concentrations in driving those blooms is well-established, but the source population that initiates them is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the front of Taiwan Warm Current (TWC) may serve as a 'seed bank' that initiates P. donghaiense blooms in the ECS, as the physiochemical conditions in the TWC are suitable for the growth of P. donghaiense. In order to test this hypothesis, two surveys at different spatio-temporal scales were conducted in 2010 and 2011. We found a strong correlation in space and time between the abundance of P. donghaiense and the TWC. The spatial extent of the P. donghaiense bloom coincided with the TWC front in both 2010 and 2011. During the early development of the blooms, P. donghaiense concentration was highest at the TWC front, and then the bloom mass shifted inshore over the course of our 2011 survey. The TWC also moved inshore, albeit after the appearance of P. donghaiense. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that P. donghaiense blooms develop from the population at the TWC front in the ECS, suggesting the role of the ocean current front as a seed bank to dinoflagellate blooms.																	1932-6203					MAY 9	2013	8	5							e64188	10.1371/journal.pone.0064188							WOS:000319737700067	23671709					
J	Auffret, AG; Cousins, SAO				Auffret, Alistair G.; Cousins, Sara A. O.			Humans as Long-Distance Dispersers of Rural Plant Communities	PLOS ONE												Humans are known for their capacity to disperse organisms long distances. Long-distance dispersal can be important for species threatened by habitat destruction, but research into human-mediated dispersal is often focused upon few and/or invasive species. Here we use citizen science to identify the capacity for humans to disperse seeds on their clothes and footwear from a known species pool in a valuable habitat, allowing for an assessment of the fraction and types of species dispersed by humans in an alternative context. We collected material from volunteers cutting 48 species-rich meadows throughout Sweden. We counted 24 354 seeds of 197 species, representing 34% of the available species pool, including several rare and protected species. However, 71 species (36%) are considered invasive elsewhere in the world. Trait analysis showed that seeds with hooks or other appendages were more likely to be dispersed by humans, as well as those with a persistent seed bank. More activity in a meadow resulted in more dispersal, both in terms of species and representation of the source communities. Average potential dispersal distances were measured at 13 km. We consider humans capable seed dispersers, transporting a significant proportion of the plant communities in which they are active, just like more traditional vectors such as livestock. When rural populations were larger, people might have been regular and effective seed dispersers, and the net rural-urban migration resulting in a reduction in humans in the landscape may have exacerbated the dispersal failure evident in declining plant populations today. With the fragmentation of habitat and changes in land use resulting from agricultural change, and the increased mobility of humans worldwide, the dispersal role of humans may have shifted from providers of regular local and landscape dispersal to providers of much rarer long-distance and regional dispersal, and international invasion.

The seed viability remained to be 100%. The optimal temperature for germination was changed from 25/15 degrees C (28.00 +/- 2.31%) to 25/5 degrees C (82.67 +/- 7.05%%) with the storage length increased from 2 to 5-years. and FGP at 5-year storage were higher than those at 2-year storage, but the differences were significant only at 25 degrees C and 25/5 degrees C. Difference between light treatments were not significant All the germination values in PEG-6000 and NaCl concentrations at 5-year storage were higher than those at 2-year storage. The maximum of IGP and FGP were obtained at 10.6% PEG-6000 or 50mM NaCl concentrations at 5-year storage, the RGP in seed storage were increased with the increased PEG-6000 and NaCl concentrations. A 5-year storage at room temperature significantly enhanced the germination percentage of selected species by breaking dormancy and improved the germinability in moisture and salinity stress. This is beneficial to understand the formation mechanism of persistent soil seed-bank and establishing the artificial vegetation in desert areas.																	0556-3321					MAY	2013	45	3					737	742									WOS:000320305400004

Sea salt and NaCl both inhibited seed germination but NaCl prevented more seed from germination. Optimal germination was obtained at temperature regime of 25:35 degrees C for both grasses. Seeds of D. annulatum had similar germination both in light and dark at cooler temperatures in distilled water while addition of salinity in dark inhibited more seed germination compared to light treated seeds. No seeds of E. ciliaris germinated in dark and this positive photoblastic response was associated with temperature irrespective of salinity treatment. All seeds recovered from salts stress when returned to distilled water. Most of the un-germinated seeds were dormant and viable at the end of experiment indicating that they could form a viable seed bank to ensure the continuity of the population in saline habitat.

J	Zeiter, M; Preukschas, J; Stampfli, A				Zeiter, Michaela; Preukschas, Juliane; Stampfli, Andres			Seed availability in hay meadows: Land-use intensification promotes seed rain but not the persistent seed bank	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Intensification of land use in semi-natural hay meadows has resulted in a decrease in species diversity. This is often thought to be caused by the reduced establishment of plant species due to high competition for light under conditions of increased productivity. Sowing experiments in grasslands have found reliable evidence that diversity can also be constrained by seed availability, implying that processes influencing the production and persistence of seeds may be important for the functioning of ecosystems. So far, the effects of land-use intensification on the seed rain and the persistence of seeds in the soil have been unclear. We selected six pairs of extensively managed (Festuco-Brometea) and intensively managed (Arrhenatheretalia) grassland with traditional late cutting regimes across Switzerland and covering an annual productivity gradient in the range 176-1211 gm(-2). In each grassland community, we estimated seed rain and seed bank using eight pooled seed-trap or topsoil samples of 89 cm(2) in each of six plots representing an area of c. 150 m(2). The seed traps were established in spring 2010 and collected simultaneously with soil cores after an exposure of c. three months. We applied the emergence method in a cold frame over eight months to estimate density of viable seeds. With community productivity reflecting land-use intensification, the density and species richness in the seed rain increased, while mean seed size diminished and the proportions of persistent seeds and of species with persistent seeds in the topsoil declined. Stronger limitation of seeds in extensively managed semi-natural grasslands can explain the fact that such grasslands are not always richer in species than more intensively managed ones.

Soil Texture and Planting Depth Affect Large Crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), Virginia buttonweed (Diodia virginiana), and Cock's-comb Kyllinga (Kyllinga squamulata) Emergence	HORTSCIENCE												Greenhouse studies were conducted to explore soil texture and planting depth effects on emergence of large crabgrass, Virginia buttonweed, and cock's-comb kyllinga. Soil textures examined were sand, loamy sand, and clay loam with planting depths of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 cm. Percent emergence was standardized relative to surface emergence to allow comparisons among tested weed species. The three-way interaction of weed species, planting depth, and soil texture was never significant for emergence. Significant interactions occurred between weed species and soil texture, weed species and planting depth, and soil texture and planting depth. For all weed species and soil textures, emergence decreased as planting depth increased with the greatest percent emergence at the soil surface. The planting depth at which weed emergence was decreased 50% [relative to surface emergence (D-50)] was predicted by regression analysis. Large crabgrass emerged from deepest depths (8 cm) followed by Virginia buttonweed (6 cm) and cock's-comb kyllinga (2 cm). Large crabgrass, Virginia buttonweed, and cock's-comb kyllinga D-50 occurred at 3.9, 1.1, and 0.8 cm, respectively. Sand, loamy sand, and clay loam D-50 occurred at 0.9, 2.3, and 1.9 cm, respectively, with D-50 higher in the soils with greater water-holding capacity.																	0018-5345					MAY	2013	48	5					633	636		10.21273/HORTSCI.48.5.633							WOS:000319795600018

(Verbenaceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) is a weed of great significance in Australia and worldwide, but little is known about connections among components of its life history. We document over a 3-year period, the links between L. camara seed-bank dynamics and its above-ground growth, including size asymmetry in four land-use types (a farm, a hoop pine plantation and two open eucalypt forests) invaded by the weed near Brisbane, Queensland Australia. Seed-bank populations varied appreciably across sites and in response to rainfall and control measures, and they were higher (similar to 1,000 seeds/m(2)) when annual rainfall was 15-30 % below the long-term yearly average. Fire reduced seed-bank populations but not the proportion germinating (6-8 %). Nearly a quarter of fresh seeds remain germinable after 3 years of soil burial. For small seedlings (< 10 cm high), the expected trade-offs in two life-history traits-survival and growth-did not apply; rather the observed positive association between these two traits, coupled with a persistent seed-bank population could contribute to the invasiveness of the plant. Relationships between absolute growth rate and initial plant size (crown volume) were positively linear, suggesting that most populations are still at varying stages of the exponential phase of the sigmoid growth; this trend also suggests that at most sites and despite increasing stand density and limiting environmental resources of light and soil moisture, lantana growth is inversely size asymmetric. From the observed changes in measures of plant size inequality, asymmetric competition appeared limited in all the infestations surveyed.

Greater sexual reproduction contributes to differences in demography of invasive plants and their noninvasive relatives	ECOLOGY												An understanding of the demographic processes contributing to invasions would improve our mechanistic understanding of the invasion process and improve the efficiency of prevention and control efforts. However, field comparisons of the demography of invasive and noninvasive species have not previously been conducted. We compared the in situ demography of 17 introduced plant species in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, to contrast the demographic patterns of invasive species with their less invasive relatives across a broad sample of angiosperms. Using herbarium records to estimate spread rates, we found higher maximum spread rates in the landscape for species classified a priori as invasive than for noninvasive introduced species, suggesting that expert classifications are an accurate reflection of invasion rate. Across 17 species, projected population growth was not significantly greater in invasive than in noninvasive introduced species. Among five taxonomic pairs of close relatives, however, four of the invasive species had higher projected population growth rates compared with their noninvasive relative. A Life Table Response Experiment suggested that the greater projected population growth rate of some invasive species relative to their noninvasive relatives was primarily a result of sexual reproduction. The greater sexual reproduction of invasive species is consistent with invaders having a life history strategy more reliant on fecundity than survival and is consistent with a large role of propagule pressure in invasion. Sexual reproduction is a key demographic correlate of invasiveness, suggesting that local processes influencing sexual reproduction, such as enemy escape, might be of general importance. However, the weak correlation of projected population growth with spread rates in the landscape suggests that regional processes, such as dispersal, may be equally important in determining invasion rate.																	0012-9658					MAY	2013	94	5					995	1004		10.1890/12-1310.1							WOS:000318969800002	23858640

Complex restoration challenges: Weeds, seeds, and roads in a forested Wildland Urban Interface	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Federal policies in the US strongly emphasize reducing hazardous fuels at the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). However, these areas present restoration challenges as they often have exotic weeds, frequent human disturbance, and the presence of roads. Understanding seed banks is important in planning for desirable post-disturbance community conditions, developing integrated weed management programs, and complying with State and Federal regulations. We characterized the aboveground vegetation and seed bank in a WUI composed of mixed age dry-mixed conifer forest stands in central Washington State, and examined patterns and relationships between aboveground vegetation and seed bank germinant abundance in relation to distance to road, seed bank layer, and herbicide treatments. Noxious weed frequency, as well as exotic weed and annual native forb cover, significantly decreased with distance from road, while native graminoid cover increased, declining beyond 20 m. Herbicides did not affect composition of the aboveground community in the short term. Six hundred and thirty seeds germinated from litter and mineral soil samples over a 5 month trial, and 43 species were identified. Most germinants (77%) and species (36 species) emerged from the litter layer compared to mineral soil, and the majority were annual forbs, followed by perennial forbs, native graminoids and exotic species. Little similarity was found between the extant vegetation and seed bank floras. Fourteen percent of germinants were exotic species, and were found in similar abundances regardless of proximity to road or herbicide treatment. Findings from our study suggest that (1) roads strongly influenced aboveground vegetative cover and species composition; (2) seed bank contributions to desirable post-disturbance understory development may be relatively low, especially if activities remove the litter layer; (3) weed populations were largely confined to near road environments, but the weed seed bank, which is a substantial part of the total seed bank, was not; and (4) herbicide treatments were ineffective and did not impact seed banks in the short term.

This study aimed to demonstrate the occurrence of plasticity of reproductive allocation in a pioneer woody species (Ulex europaeus). We studied seed production in 144 plants under different irradiance and population densities. We measured their basal area, their whole shoot biomass and photosynthetic biomass, and their reproductive output (number of fruits per individual and number of seeds per fruit). We found that newly produced photosynthetic biomass was influenced by environmental variation, which in turn determined its reproductive output. In addition, in low light conditions investment in reproduction was more reduced than investment in growth indicating plasticity of reproductive allocation. These results provide the first evidence for plasticity of reproductive allocation of a woody plant. It may lead to the ability of this pioneer species to survive and to continue to reproduce even at low rates in non-optimal shady habitats and to maintain a non-empty seed bank in forest systems with long unfavourable periods between two disturbances.

J	Rodrigo, MA; Rojo, C; Alonso-Guillen, JL; Vera, P				Rodrigo, Maria A.; Rojo, Carmen; Alonso-Guillen, Jose L.; Vera, Pablo			Restoration of two small Mediterranean lagoons: The dynamics of submerged macrophytes and factors that affect the success of revegetation	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Two small, shallow lagoons newly created from former rice fields in the Mediterranean coast (Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, Spain) were restored by planting several species of submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton spp., Zannichellia peltata and Ranunculus peltatus) in 2008. Charophytes also appeared spontaneously. M. spicatum was the species that dominated both lagoons and almost completely covered their surface. M. spicatum reached a high biomass and displayed a seasonal pattern, declining during the cold season and reappearing in the spring. No submerged vegetation was observed in the lagoons from 2011 onward. The major purpose of the present study was to elucidate the factors that caused the total disappearance and prevented the regeneration of submerged vegetation cover in both lagoons. Such factors may include negative biotic relationships such as those related to the presence of fish and crayfish, waterfowl grazing, phytoplankton and epiphytic development that causes shading and abiotic factors such as water nutrient concentration. Three different types (treatments) of 1-m(2). exclosures were set up and planted with macrophyte cultures that formed 3 different assemblages: Chara hispida alone, a mixture of C vulgaris, C baltica and Nitella hyalina and a mixture of higher plants (M. spicatum, C demersum and Potamogeton pectinatus). The "Open" type of exclosure permitted the entrance of fish, crayfish, and birds. The "Lateral" exclosure prevented the entry of fish. The "Closed" exclosure also prevented bird grazing. To determine the potential of the seed sediment bank to regenerate submerged vegetation, we investigated lagoon sediments (i) to quantify seeds and (ii) to examine seed germination. The results indicate that there is not a sufficiently large reservoir of phanerogam seeds in the lagoon sediments to recover vegetation by germination. The "Closed" exclosures allowed the growth of all species in spite of the intense development of periphyton on macrophyte tissues and filamentous algae, which reduced light availability by up to 45%. The "Lateral" exclosures had a lower development of macrophytes. In the "Open" exclosures, almost no macrophytes were detected 3 weeks after planting. Water chemistry (P and N content) did not limit the development of the tested macrophyte species but did appear to negatively affect charophytes in one of the lagoons. The deleterious effect of exotic fauna (particularly carps and crayfish) in combination with the high herbivory pressure by waterfowl, primarily during the periods when the rice fields surrounding the lagoons were dry, were the major factors that acted in a negative synergistic manner to prevent the recolonisation of the vegetation currently in the lagoons. A procedure to eradicate exotic fish and crayfish is required prior to any type of restoration effort involving the plantation of submerged macrophytes. More areas with permanent submerged vegetation in the Natural Park are required to decrease herbivory pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vegetation Dynamics in a Tidal Freshwater Wetland: A Long-Term Study at Differing Scales	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Tidal freshwater wetlands are complex, species-rich ecosystems located at the interface between tidal estuaries and nontidal rivers. This study conducted on the Patuxent River estuary in Maryland was designed to assess vegetation dynamics over several decades to determine if there were directional changes in the dominant communities. Aerial photographs (1970, 1989, and 2007) documented broad-scale spatial changes in major plant communities. The coverage of areas dominated by Nuphar lutea and Phragmites australis expanded; mixed vegetation and scrub-shrub habitats were essentially unchanged; and Typha and Zizania aquatica communities fluctuated in coverage. Data collected between 1988 and 2010 from permanent plots and transects were used to examine fine-scale changes. Shifts in the importance of some species through time were observed, but there were no directional changes in community species composition. The lack of directional change as measured at a fine scale is characteristic of tidal freshwater wetlands in which variations in the abundance of individual species, especially annuals, are responsible for most short-term change in species composition. Changes in the composition of plant communities are interpreted as responses to variations in vertical accretion, stability of habitat types, invasive plant species, and herbivores. In the future, vegetation changes are likely to occur as a result of the intrusion of brackish water and increased flooding associated with global climate change and sea level rise. This long-term study establishes a baseline from which potential future changes to tidal freshwater wetlands can be better understood.

J	Jaroszewicz, B				Jaroszewicz, Bogdan			Endozoochory by European bison influences the build-up of the soil seed bank in subcontinental coniferous forest	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The faeces of large herbivores include viable seeds of many plant species. With dung decomposition, some seeds migrate into the soil and influence seed bank build-up. However, only a few papers report evidence of this process, and only from grasslands. In forest studies, this subject has so far been neglected. Therefore, I ask in this paper whether seeds present in the dung of European bison migrate to the forest soil seed bank and influence its build-up. I sampled soil from underneath European bison dung pats and from surrounding areas (control samples). Samples were divided into shallow (0-5 cm) and deep (5-10 cm) series. Soil seed bank content was studied in the greenhouse for 2 years. The shallow seed bank under dung pats was characterized by the highest species richness (49 species) and seed density (> 2,000 m(-2)). Urtica dioica, Juncus effusus and Carex remota showed a demonstrable increase in seed density in the shallow seed bank underneath dung. Three years after dung deposition, seeds of endozoochoric origin influenced the soil seed bank of coniferous forest. U. dioica, J. effusus, C. remota and other species of deciduous forests and grasslands (Agrostis capillaris, Milium effusum, Polygonum hydropiper, Polygonum mite, Scrophularia nodosa, Stachys sylvatica, Veronica chamaedrys) caused an increase in seed density (by 61 %) and species richness (by 33 %) of the shallow soil seed bank underneath dung in comparison with the control soil seed bank.

Seed size and photoblastism in species belonging to tribe Cacteae (Cactaceae)	JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH												The response of seed germination towards light and the relationship to seed traits has been studied particularly well in tropical forests. Several authors have shown a clear adaptive response of seed size and photoblastism, however, the evolutionary significance of this relationship for species inhabiting arid environments has not been fully understood and only some studies have considered the response in a phylogenetic context. We collected seeds from 54 cacti species spread throughout the tribe Cacteae to test whether there was correlated evolution of photoblastism, seed traits and germination using a reconstructed phylogeny of the tribe. For each species we determined the photoblastic response under controlled conditions, and seed traits, and analyzed the results using phylogenetically independent contrasts. All studied species were positive photoblastic contrasting with the basal Pereskia suggesting an early evolution of this trait. Seeds from basal species were mostly medium-sized, diverging into two groups. Seeds tend to get smaller and lighter suggesting an evolution to smaller sizes. No evidence exists of a relationship between seed size and photoblastic response suggesting that the photoblastic response within members of this tribe is not adaptive though it is phylogenetically fixed and that is coupled with environmental cues that fine tune the germination response.

Parent tree effects on reestablishment of Acacia koa in abandoned pasture and the influence of initial density on stand development	NEW FORESTS												Increasingly private landholders in Hawaii are considering native forest restoration for their lands, and some public agencies have already started such work. Initial efforts have focused on reestablishing Acacia koa to recover alien-grass-dominated sites. This study was done in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Island of Hawaii, to determine the efficacy of disk plowing to stimulate natural regeneration of koa from buried seeds. Sites with four different koa parent tree configurations were treated-single live overhead koa canopy, multiple live canopies, downed snags, and no parent koa tree. Tree growth and survival were assessed periodically over 21 years. Average initial stand densities ranged from 100 to 1,500 trees ha(-1) of scarified land, although some open areas had as few as 20 trees ha(-1). The distributions of seedlings with increasing distance from plot center were variable within and between parent tree configurations. Initial seedling density was significantly greater for the multiple-live-parent than for the no-parent configuration. Densities for the single-live and dead configurations differed from the no-parent configuration only when densities were based on the entire scarified area of each plot. Stand densities declined 10-67 % during the next 20 years. Survival was a negative, non-linear function of initial stand density. Initial stand density exerted strong control over stem diameter and crown size at age 21-years, but had little effect on the proportion of trees with single-stems. The relationships between stand basal area and density at 21 years conformed to the existing koa stocking guidelines. While moderate to high densities of natural regeneration can be expected from scarifying around live and dead koa trees, single trees or low density stands are likely in open areas.																	0169-4286	1573-5095				MAY	2013	44	3					409	426		10.1007/s11056-012-9352-6							WOS:000318003500008

Factors affecting regeneration of Adansonia digitata L. in a communally managed region of southern Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Large baobabs are prominent in many African savannas, but the apparent lack of young trees suggests that recruitment is limited and possibly episodic. This study aims to determine if recruitment was seed or establishment (rnicrosite) limited. From five annual seed crops, baobab seed consistently exhibits high viability (>89%) and a field trial shows they form persistent soil seed banks. Seed production is substantial (5500 +/- 2334 seed/ha) and thus recruitment does not appear to be seed limited. In closed plots (excluding livestock) 6.33% of seeds emerged after 328 +/- 28 (mean +/- SE) days and of these 94.4% died within 21 +/- 5 days of moisture stress and insect browsing. In open plots (exposed to livestock) 2% of seeds emerged after 377 +/- 5 days and all died within 12 +/- 5 days from goat browsing. Planted sapling survival in closed plots (65%) was much higher than in open plots (10%), with an average time to death of 10.45 +/- 0.97 and 4.33 +/- 0.45 months respectively. Hence seedling establishment is poor in response to infrequent rainfall and survival of seedlings and saplings, that do manage to persist, is further hampered by high livestock numbers. Recruitment is thus microsite limited in communal lands. Planting and protection from livestock is required to overcome the recruitment bottleneck. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seed germination requirements of Trembleya laniflora (Melastomataceae), an endemic species from neotropical montane rocky savannas	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Trembleya laniflora is an endemic shrub from neotropical montane rocky savannas of southeastern Brazil. It has been indicated as a potential candidate for ecological restoration of abandoned iron-ore mines due to heavy metal accumulation. Here, we evaluated the seed germination requirements of T. laniflora. Seeds collected in 2005 and 2008 were set to germinate under a broad range of temperature and light conditions. Seed viability was estimated by dissecting seeds under a dissecting microscope for embryo presence/absence. Seeds were photoblastic and optimum temperature range was 20-25 degrees C, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. Seeds were viable after 42 months of storage, which together with small seeds that easily get buried and light requirement for germination suggest formation of soil seed banks. Except the large fraction of embryoless seeds, almost all tested seeds germinated when incubated under light conditions; therefore, T. laniflora should be regarded to have nondormant seeds. Easiness of burial resulting from small seed size and positive photoblastism may both contribute to incorporation into soil seed banks. Our data suggest that the long-term storage of T. laniflora seeds provides a useful strategy for plant reintroduction.

What processes prevail during recruit establishment? At what spatio-temporal scales do they operate? Location A wet meadow in South Bohemia, a region of the Czech Republic. Methods We studied spatio-temporal dynamics in pattern of recruits (seedlings and vegetative sprouts) to characterize development and underlying ecological processes during gap colonization. We established four types of artificial gaps laid out in ten replicated blocks. To distinguish the effects of generative vs vegetative reproduction we used gaps with sterilized and non-sterilized soil (manipulating the seed bank), and manipulated the possibility of clonal spread by inserting mesh or felting along the borders of the gaps. Results The majority of recruits appeared during July and August. Recruits were surrounded by empty spaces of 59mm, and formed clumps of 20mm or more. Clumping of even-aged seedlings and a lower number of vegetative recruits were observed in the gaps with non-sterilized soil. Overall, clonal spread was limited to the gap borders, being far less common than recruit establishment from seeds. The recruits emerged preferentially close to the gap centre where the temperature was highest as was the red to farred ratio (R:FR). However, during the season, the majority of late recruits were observed in the southern, coolest parts of the gaps, reflecting the increasing importance of the facilitative effect of the surrounding vegetation. Conclusions Gaps were colonized predominantly from seeds; vegetative propagation was very slow and appeared at the end of the season. The presence of a seed bank enabled earlier gap colonization; the effect of seed rain became increasingly important during the season. The recruits were clumped, which further supports environmentally driven establishment, although other factors (e.g. facilitation) cannot be excluded. For the shortest distances, recruits were absent close neighbours due to the strongest competition. We therefore suggest that there was a spatial continuum between competition and facilitative effects among individual recruits.

Soil warming increases plant species richness but decreases germination from the alpine soil seed bank	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global warming is occurring more rapidly above the treeline than at lower elevations and alpine areas are predicted to experience above average warming in the future. Temperature is a primary factor in stimulating seed germination and regulating changes in seed dormancy status. Thus, plant regeneration from seed will be crucial to the persistence, migration and post disturbance recruitment of alpine plants in future climates. Here, we present the first assessment of the impact of soil warming on germination from the persistent alpine soil seed bank. Contrary to expectations, soil warming lead to reduced overall germination from the soil seed bank. However, germination response to soil temperature was species specific such that total species richness actually increased by nine with soil warming. We further explored the system by assessing the prevalence of seed dormancy and germination response to soil disturbance, the frequency of which is predicted to increase under climate change. Seeds of a significant proportion of species demonstrated physiological dormancy mechanisms and germination of several species appeared to be intrinsically linked to soil disturbance. In addition, we found no evidence of subalpine species and little evidence of exotic weed species in the soil, suggesting that the soil seed bank will not facilitate their invasion of the alpine zone. In conclusion, changes in recruitment via the alpine soil seed bank can be expected under climate change, as a result of altered dormancy alleviation and germination cues. Furthermore, the alpine soil seed bank, and the species richness therein, has the potential to help maintain local species diversity, support species range shift and moderate species dominance. Implications for alpine management and areas for further study are also discussed.

An objective method based on assemblages of subfossil plant macro-remains to reconstruct past natural vegetation: a case study at Swifterbant, The Netherlands	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												We present a new method of identifying past plant communities based on a palaeobotanical dataset. The dataset used as a case study consists of plant macro-remains retrieved from the Neolithic settlement Swifterbant S4, The Netherlands. Taxa were grouped based on their present-day concurrence values. Subsequently, phytosociological analysis was performed on the subfossil taxon groups using the software package PALAEOASSOCIA, adjusted for this type of research. Results show that syntaxonomic knowledge on the concurrence of plant species can be used to reconstruct parts of the past vegetation. We further discuss the theory behind the reconstruction of syntaxa, with special emphasis on actualism.

Tidal Freshwater Wetlands: Variation and Changes	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Tidal freshwater wetlands (TFW) are situated in the upper estuary in a zone bordered upstream by the nontidal river and downstream by the oligohaline region. Here, discharge of freshwater from the river and the daily tidal pulse from the sea combine to create conditions where TFW develop. TFW are often located where human population density is high, which has led to wetland degradation or destruction. Globally, TFW are largely restricted to the temperate zone where the magnitude of annual river discharge prevents saline waters from penetrating too far inland. The constant input of river water delivers high loads of sediments, dissolved nutrients, and other suspended matter leading to high sedimentation rates and high nutrient levels. Prominent biogeochemical processes include the transformation of nitrogen by bacteria and immobilization of phosphate. A diverse, characteristic vegetation community develops which supports a rich fauna. Biotic diversity is highest in the high marsh areas and decreases in the lower levels where tidal inundation is greatest. Benthic fauna is rather poor in diversity but high in biomass compared to other regions of the estuary. Global climate change is a threat for this system directly by sea level rise, which will cause brackish water to intrude into the fresh system, and indirectly during droughts, which reduce river discharge. Salinity will affect the presence of flora and fauna and facilitates sulfate reduction of organic matter in the soil. Increased decomposition of organic matter following saltwater intrusion can result in a lowering of wetland surface elevation. The papers assembled in this issue focus on how these tidal freshwater wetlands have changed over recent time and how they may respond to new impacts in the future.

J	Neubauer, SC				Neubauer, Scott C.			Ecosystem Responses of a Tidal Freshwater Marsh Experiencing Saltwater Intrusion and Altered Hydrology	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Tidal freshwater marshes exist in a dynamic environment where plant productivity, subsurface biogeochemical processes, and soil elevation respond to hydrological fluctuations over tidal to multi-decadal time scales. The objective of this study was to determine ecosystem responses to elevated salinity and increased water inputs, which are likely as sea level rise accelerates and saltwater intrudes into freshwater habitats. Since June 2008, in situ manipulations in a Zizaniopsis miliacea (giant cutgrass)-dominated tidal freshwater marsh in South Carolina have raised porewater salinities from freshwater to oligohaline levels and/or subtly increased the amount of water flowing through the system. Ecosystem-level fluxes of CO2 and CH4 have been measured to quantify rates of production and respiration. During the first 20 months of the experiment, the major impact of elevated salinity was a depression of plant productivity, whereas increasing freshwater inputs had a greater effect on rates of ecosystem CO2 emissions, primarily due to changes in soil processes. Net ecosystem production, the balance between gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration, decreased by 55% due to elevated salinity, increased by 75% when freshwater inputs were increased, and did not change when salinity and hydrology were both manipulated. These changes in net ecosystem production may impact the ability of marshes to keep up with rising sea levels since the accumulation of organic matter is critical in allowing tidal freshwater marshes to build soil volume. Thus, it is necessary to have regional-scale predictions of saltwater intrusion and water level changes relative to the marsh surface in order to accurately forecast the long-term sustainability of tidal freshwater marshes to future environmental change.

Characterizing soil seed banks and relationships to plant communities	PLANT ECOLOGY												Estimates of soil seed banks are important to many ecological investigations and plant conservation, yet seed banks are among the most difficult plant community attributes to accurately quantify. To compare extraction and emergence seed bank characterization methods, we collected 0- to 5-cm soil seed bank samples and measured plant community composition in six microsite types (below different perennial plant species and interspaces) at 10 field sites in the Mojave Desert, USA. Extraction detected five times more species sample(-1) and orders of magnitude greater seed density than emergence, though evaluating viability of extracted seed was not straightforward. Only 13 % of 847 tested seeds from extraction emerged in follow-up assays. Considering all sites, species detection was more similar between methods: 21 taxa for emergence and 28 for extraction. Results suggest that: (i) capturing microsite variation is critical for efficiently estimating site-level desert seed banks; (ii) method comparisons hinged on the scale of analysis for species richness, as differences in species detection between methods diminished when increasing resolution from the sample to the regional scale; (iii) combining data from all seed bank methods provided the strongest correlation with vegetation; and (iv) improving knowledge of seed germinability is important for advancing both seed bank methods, including for extraction to evaluate the proportion of extracted seeds that are viable. Multifactor approaches that balance several effectiveness measures (e.g., both seed density and species detection at multiple scales) and procedural challenges are most likely to accurately represent complexity in tradeoffs for choosing methods to quantify soil seed banks.

Bot. Fennici 50: 1-12. The white stork can affect plant population and community dynamics and structure in an agricultural landscape. It is a vector transporting large numbers of seeds along with nest material, and it is an ecosystem engineer which builds nests that function as specific habitats for plants. The following questions were asked: (i) What is the structure of the seed pool in the nest material? (ii) Can nests be treated as a habitat enabling plants to complete their life cycle? (iii) What is the probability that seeds produced in the nests reach suitable habitats in the nests' closest vicinity? Seed pools of ten white-stork nests were analysed using the seedling germination method. The average number of seedlings detected in the nest material was 9937 per one nest (870 per 10 000 g of dry weight); they belonged to 97 taxa. Majority of the species present in the nests created persistent seed banks (62.5%); 62.2% of the seedlings represented annual species. Significantly higher percentage of weeds and significantly lower of woodland and peat-bog species in the nests as compared with the respective percentages of these species groups in the regional pool, indicated arable fields and ruderal sites as the main sources of seeds as well as the nest material. Since ruderal species and weeds dominated in the seed pool found in the nests, and such habitat types were most common in the vicinity of the nests, the probability that seeds produced in the nests would disperse into a suitable habitat was high.																	0003-3847					APR 12	2013	50	1-2					1	12									WOS:000317443900001

Structure of the rare archaeal biosphere and seasonal dynamics of active ecotypes in surface coastal waters	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Marine Archaea are important players among microbial plankton and significantly contribute to biogeochemical cycles, but details regarding their community structure and long-term seasonal activity and dynamics remain largely unexplored. In this study, we monitored the interannual archaeal community composition of abundant and rare biospheres in northwestern Mediterranean Sea surface waters by pyrosequencing 165 rDNA and rRNA. A detailed analysis of the rare biosphere structure showed that the rare archaeal community was composed of three distinct fractions. One contained the rare Archaea that became abundant at different times within the same ecosystem; these cells were typically not dormant, and we hypothesize that they represent a local seed bank that is specific and essential for ecosystem functioning through cycling seasonal environmental conditions. The second fraction contained cells that were uncommon in public databases and not active, consisting of aliens to the studied ecosystem and representing a nonlocal seed bank of potential colonizers. The third fraction contained Archaea that were always rare but actively growing; their affiliation and seasonal dynamics were similar to the abundant microbes and could not be considered a seed bank. We also showed that the major archaeal groups, Thaumarchaeota marine group I and Euryarchaeota group II.B in winter and Euryarchaeota group II.A in summer, contained different ecotypes with varying activities. Our findings suggest that archaeal diversity could be associated with distinct metabolisms or life strategies, and that the rare archaeal biosphere is composed of a complex assortment of organisms with distinct histories that affect their potential for growth.

Bacterial communities and species-specific associations with the mucus of Brazilian coral species	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												We investigated the existence of species-specific associations between Brazilian coral species and bacteria. Pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rDNA was used to analyze the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities associated with the mucus of four coral species (Madracis decactis, Mussismilia hispida, Palythoa caribaeorum, and Tubastraea coccinea) in two seasons (winter and summer), which were compared with the surrounding water and sediment. The microbial communities found in samples of mucus, water, and sediment differed according to the composition and relative frequency of OTUs. The coral mucus community seemed to be more stable and resistant to seasonal variations, compared to the water and sediment communities. There was no influence of geographic location on the composition of the communities. The sediment community was extremely diverse and might act as a "seed bank" for the entire environment. Species-specific OTUs were found in P. caribaeorum, T. coccinea, and M. hispida.

Temporal dispersal in fragmented landscapes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Despite a good understanding on how dispersal in space structures plant communities in fragmented landscapes, we know little about dispersal in time. Empirical evidence on temporal dispersal - the soil seed bank - is lacking, with only trait-based evidence on the seed banks' importance for species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Therefore, seed banks of remnant grassland fragments were analyzed in how they changed compared to semi-natural grasslands following fragmentation. We studied the historical trajectories in time since fragmentation, fragment size and habitat quality of 134 grassland plots, linking these to their seed bank and plant community to understand how seed banks temporally connect grassland fragments, potentially conserving the flora of historically large semi-natural grasslands. Seed-banking grassland species were present in similar proportions in all remnant grassland fragments. The seed bank composition changed with time since fragmentation started, triggered by the deterministic loss of grassland species, generating nested subsets of the seed banks of semi-natural grasslands. The spatial heterogeneity in seed bank composition among grassland fragments limited the loss of grassland species at the landscape scale. The seed bank became an increasingly important constituent of total plant diversity with time since fragmentation started, as grassland species stored an increasingly larger proportion of their local diversity in the seed bank. Temporal dispersal enables the prolonged presence and persistence of numerous typical grassland species in fragmented landscapes. The seed banks' storage effect of plant diversity is of considerable significance to efforts aimed at conserving and restoring plant diversity in fragmented landscapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

After one month of burial, seed viability decreased to 39%, with a slope of 2.03% per day, and subsequently decreased with a lower slope of 0.01 until 365 days following burial in the soil. Germinability remained at its highest value in autumn and winter and decreased from spring to the last month of summer. Non-dormant seeds of volunteer oilseed rape did not germinate at temperatures lower than 3.8 degrees C and a water potential of -1.4 MPa degrees d. The hydrothermal values were 36.2 and 42.9 MPa degrees d for sub-and supra-optimal temperatures, respectively. Quantification of seed emergence as influenced by burial depth was performed satisfactorily (R-2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 5.03).

Evaluation of the Seed Bank in a Campestre Cerrado Area under Recovery	PLANTA DANINHA												Studies dealing with the interference of weeds in agro-ecosystems have obtained abundant results for grain production fields and pastures. However, few studies have reported the effect of the presence of such a group of isolated plants on degraded areas under recovery. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the soil seed bank on the process of environmental restoration of a representative area of campestre cerrado due to the presence of weed grasses. To assess the seed bank, three environments were selected: two degraded environments and one reference-environment (preserved) of campestre cerrado. Soil samples were collected in two seasons (dry and wet), and evaluated in three hundred days. During the evaluation, only six native species and only two species with a habit of arboreal life were found. Most of the seeds which were germinated for the degraded environments in both collections were identified as invasive in the study area. In this sense, the local soil seed bank is not considered sufficient for recovery through ecological succession in these areas, and the use of techniques to accelerate the restoration of these environments is strongly recommended.

Soil seed bank and among-years genetic diversity in arid populations of Eruca sativa Miller (Brassicaceae)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Populations of Eruca sativa from arid environments exhibit greater physiological dormancy than those that originated in more favorable ones. We tested the possible relative contribution of the soil seed bank (SSB) to the aboveground cohorts in desert and semiarid populations. Seedlings that emerged from the SSB under controlled irrigation were distinguished from those that emerged after exposure of the remaining ungerminated SSB to gibberellic acid as constituting non-dormant and dormant SSBs, respectively. On average, the total SSB was significantly larger in the semiarid than in the desert population. In both sites, the aboveground and SSB cohorts exhibited closely similar genetic diversity, and in the aboveground cohorts similar year-to-year genetic diversity was found. These results indicate continuous recruitment from the SSB to the aboveground cohorts. Nevertheless, Ne estimates indicated that the SSB can contribute to enlarging the aboveground effective populations in both habitats. Furthermore, Nei's genetic distances suggested that the non-dormant SSB contributed more than the dormant SSB to the aboveground cohorts. These results highlight the potential of the SSB to maintain a genotype reservoir that protects annual populations in arid environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining Cultural Practices with Herbicides Reduces Wild Oat (Avena fatua) Seed in the Soil Seed Bank and Improves Barley Yield	WEED SCIENCE												A study was initiated in 2001 at four locations in western Canada to investigate an integrated approach to managing wild oat, the region's worst weed. The study examined the effects of combining semidwarf or tall barley cultivars with normal or twice-normal barley seeding rates in either continuous barley or a barley canola barley field pea barley rotation. Herbicides were applied at 25, 50, and 100% of recommended rates. The first phase of the study was completed in 2005. This paper reports on the second phase, which was continued for four more years at two of the locations, Beaverlodge and Fort Vermilion, AB, Canada. The objective was to determine the long-term impact of the treatments on wild oat seed in the soil seed bank. In 2009 (final year), the diverse rotation combined with the higher barley seeding rate (optimal cultural practice) resulted in higher barley yields and reduced wild oat biomass compared to continuous barley and lower barley seeding rate (suboptimal cultural practice). In contrast to the first phase, barley yield was higher with the semidwarf cultivar, and cultivar had no effect on wild oat management. Wild oat seed in the soil seed bank decreased with increasing herbicide rate, but amounts were often lower with the optimal cultural practice. For example, at the recommended herbicide rate at Beaverlodge, an approximate 40-fold reduction in wild oat seed occurred with the optimal compared to the suboptimal cultural practice. The results indicate that combining optimal cultural practices with herbicides will reduce the amount of wild oat seed in the soil seed bank, and result in higher barley yields. Optimal cultural practices may also compensate for reduced herbicidal effects in terms of reducing wild oat seed accumulation in the soil seed bank and increasing barley yield. The results have implications for mitigating the evolution of herbicide resistance in wild oat.																	0043-1745					APR-JUN	2013	61	2					328	333		10.1614/WS-D-12-00168.1							WOS:000317885400021

In this study, we conducted a germination experiment and a vegetation survey to evaluate the effects of different sediment loads on the seed banks of three wetland communities (dominated by Glyceria spiculosa, Zizania latifolia and Pycreus korshinskyi, respectively) under two hydrological regimes (0 and 10 cm water depth). Results revealed significant differences in seed germination rates among the three plant communities and significant effects of sediment load on the germination rates. Species richness and seedling emergence decreased significantly at 0.5-0.75 cm of sediment addition. Species responded differently to the addition of sediment. The number of seedlings of P. korshinskyi, Sagittaria trifolia. Alisma orientale, Monochoria vaginalis, Carpesium macrocephalum decreased gradually as the sediment addition increased from 0 to 2 cm, while the number of seedlings of Fimbristylis dichotoma, Eleocharis ovata, Bidens bipinnata decreased to zero at 0.5 cm of sediment addition. The number of species germinated under the non-flooded conditions was significantly higher than that under flooded condition. All plant communities showed a similar response to the sediment load under the two water regimes. Despite low similarity, the number of species germinated from seed banks was higher than the original number of species present in each plant community. To protect and restore the wetland vegetation community in the Sanjiang Plain, irrigation and land management strategies will need to be implemented to reduce the sediment load from the paddy fields to the wetlands.

Difficulties particularly arise in species that possess unobservable resistance forms that bias the estimation of colonization and persistence rates. Here, we develop a general multistate occupancy model that allows estimation of species persistence for both normal and resistant forms, even when the latter are not detectable. We apply this model to an 11-year data set on the tropical freshwater snail Drepanotrema depressissimum in a network of 229 ponds. These ponds frequently dry out, and the snails can persist by aestivating in the ground, where they are not detected. Our model adequately captures this feature because it infers a high persistence rate for the resistant form, while models ignoring aestivation tend to overestimate extinction and colonization. In addition, we find that, surprisingly, colonization and persistence are even higher in sites prone to desiccation and during years with low rainfall than in more humid sites and years, suggesting that D. depressissimum favors unstable sites where competitors are rare and where it can rely on aestivation to persist. Our model has the potential to provide valuable insights into the metapopulation dynamics of many species that otherwise could hardly be studied because of the existence of undetectable life forms.

Ecological importance of sedges: a survey of the Australasian Cyperaceae genus Lepidosperma	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Sedges (Cyperaceae) form an important ecological component of many ecosystems around the world. Sword and rapier sedges (genus Lepidosperma) are common and widespread components of the southern Australian and New Zealand floras, also occurring in New Caledonia, West Papua, Borneo, Malaysia and southern China. Sedge ecology is seldom studied and no comprehensive review of sedge ecology exists. Lepidosperma is unusual in the Cyperaceae with the majority of species occurring in dryland habitats. Extensive review of ecological literature and field observations shows Lepidosperma species to be important components of many ecosystems, often dominating understorey and sedge-rich communities. For the first time, a detailed ecological review of a Cyperaceae genus is presented. species are long-lived perennials with significant abundance and persistence in the landscape. Speciation patterns in the genus are of considerable interest due to complex biogeographical patterns and a high degree of habitat specificity. Potential benefits exist for medicinal products identified from several Lepidosperma species. Over 178 organisms, including 26 mammals, 42 birds, six reptiles, five amphibians, eight arachnids, 75 insects, three crustaceans and 13 fungi, are found to be dependent on, or making use of, Lepidosperma species. A significant relationship exists between Lepidosperma species and the moth genus Elachista. Implications for the conservation and ecology of both sedges and associated species are discussed.

Consequently, surviving examples consist mostly of small remnants which are thought to be senescent due to the exclusion of fire. This senescence is associated with the loss of many native understory species. Prescribed burns have been suggested as a management tool to stimulate the restoration of native plants from the soil seed bank; however, no seed bank studies have previously been conducted on Kangaroo Island and the seed bank literature usually focuses on particular species rather than on plant communities. We conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of the fire-related cues heat and smoke on the germination of plants from the seed bank in soil sampled from 10 long-ungrazed narrow-leaved mallee sites on Kangaroo Island. Eighty trays of soil were monitored in a controlled glasshouse for five months after being subjected to heat and/or smoke treatments. The overall number of native, but not exotic, plant species germinating from the soil seed bank was significantly increased by all three fire-related treatments (heat, smoke and heat plus smoke) compared with the control (no fire-related treatment). Different plant life forms exhibited varying responses to heat and smoke treatments. The results of this study illustrate that the application of fire-related treatments to soil seed banks in controlled glasshouse conditions can stimulate the recruitment of native species, including several species of conservation concern. These findings also indicate the potential of using these treatments for the ex situ germination of fire dependent species for revegetation purposes and indicate aspects of prescribed burns that may be important for restoring different components of native vegetation.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Which plant traits characterize successful and failed target species in urban grassland restoration? Do traits of successful target species differ from those of resident species? How do plant traits relate to environmental constraints? Location In-situ experimental sites on wastelands in shrinking residential areas in Berlin, Germany. Methods We established grassland restoration treatments and explored plant traits of successful and failed target species (plant height, specific leaf area, seed mass, seed shape, seed longevity index, CSR strategy type, plant life form). To shed light on mechanisms that shape restoration success, we also analysed the same traits of species originating from the soil seed bank and species immigrating from the surroundings. We compared both trait sets to those of resident species. With RLQ analyses we related the trait data to abundance data of species and to variables describing the environmental setting of the sites. Results In the third year after treatment, several plant traits differed between the successful or failed target species and the resident vegetation, e.g. successful target species tended to be as tall as resident species, whereas failed target species were smaller, suggesting insufficient competitive ability of the latter. Species that successfully recruited from the soil seed bank were taller than resident species. Small specific leaf area was important for the establishment success of target species. Trait composition of the species assemblage clearly related to the environmental setting: mean specific leaf area and the proportion of annuals increased and the proportion of C-strategists decreased with increasing human-mediated impacts on the restoration sites. Conclusions Our results reveal clear trait differences between successful and failed target species in grassland restoration on urban wasteland sites, demonstrating that high competitive ability is crucial for success in target species. Grassland species that are successfully integrated into urban wasteland vegetation may thus fill well-defined vacant niches, while resembling the traits of the resident species in other ways. Our results may allow generalizations and transfer to similar urban settings, as the analysed trait states were assessed as relative values compared to resident species.					von der Lippe, Moritz/0000-0003-4760-1420												1402-2001					APR	2013	16	2					272	285		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2012.01216.x							WOS:000315690500012

The influence of rainfall, competition and predation on seed production, germination and establishment of an encroaching Acacia in an arid Namibian savanna	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Seed production and seedling survival are under-researched in savannas. We investigated these in a population of a major thickening species, Acacia mellifera, in an arid Namibian savanna over a nine year period (late 1998-early 2007) We asked the following questions: (i) How does viable seed production vary with rainfall and tree size, (ii) when does seed germination occur, (iii) is the seed bank of A. mellifera persistent, and (iv) how do competitive interactions with established trees influence recruitment of A. mellifera seedlings? Seed production was highly correlated with annual rainfall. In dry years, there was no viable seed production. En masse seed production only occurred in exceptionally high rainfall years, and was strongly correlated with size among trees >2 m tall. Seed predation was low. Seedlings only emerged directly after en masse seed production, suggesting ephemeral seed banks. Three times more seedlings emerged per m(2), but seedling survival was five times less, under trees than away from trees, indicating strong competition for water with established trees. Seed production is a recruitment bottleneck in this species. Recruitment requires at least two consecutive seasons of favourable rainfall, and is highly episodic in arid savannas.

In addition, we analyse soil chemical properties, biomass tannin content and energetic value to find out how grazing abandonment affects soil fertility and forage quality of these agroecosystems. Grazing exclusion effects on plant species and functional composition, as well as on soil fertility depended on the productivity of the studied pasture. Erect forbs and shrubs (endemic to Macaronesian region and native) were favoured by grazing removal in the most productive pasture, while soil fertility decreased in the driest and least productive site. An increase in NPP after exclusion was consistent among study sites. Although we consider goat grazing as necessary for maintaining traditional agroecosystems, we also suggest controlling it over time, allowing some periods of rest to give endemic shrub species time to recover from near propagule sources.

Individual and interactive effects of crop type and management on weed and seed bank composition in an organic rotation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												We investigated the effects of organic and conventional pest and fertility management on weed cover and the seed bank community in an organic rotation. The study was conducted during the 4th and 5th years of an organic rotation on part of a long term organic-conventional comparison trial. Results showed that although crop type (potato vs. cabbage) in a single year significantly affected weed functional group and cover of individual species, it did not change weed functional group and composition in the seed bank in the following year. Five years of organic crop protection management increased weed species that depend on regeneration from seed and increased Ellenberg light, reaction and nitrogen values and a seed bank persistence index in comparison with conventional crop protection management. Three species (Chenopodium album L., Poa spp. L. and Stellaria media (L.) Villars) that is important for biodiversity of arable fields were more prevalent in organic protection plots. Fertility management had no significant effects on weed seed bank composition and functional group. The additive effect of organic practices on perennial ratio and competitor radius value was an important finding. Organic fertility management and crop protection acted together to increase these two aspects of the soil seed bank in comparison with other treatment combinations and a similar effect was seen on Poa spp. L.

Because the costs of maintaining low-temperature storage can be prohibitively expensive in developing countries, this study explored alternatives to low-temperature storage at the Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization (ECHO) Asia Impact Center Seed Bank in Northern Thailand. Specifically, this research compared the effects of vacuum sealing and refrigeration on stored seed viability in both laboratory and field settings. While seed species was an influential factor in determining seed longevity, the relative importance of vacuum sealing and refrigeration differed for the dependent variables of seed moisture content, germination rate, mean time to 50% germination and field emergence. Although the combination of vacuum sealing and refrigeration was most effective at conserving seed quality as measured by each of these variables, the storage of seeds in vacuum-sealed packages at ambient temperatures was more effective than unsealed but refrigerated packets at conserving low moisture content and high germination and field emergence rates across species. This suggests that for resource-constrained seed banks in the tropics, vacuum sealing with or without refrigeration may represent a viable alternative to other expensive and energy-intensive storage techniques.																	0014-4797	1469-4441				APR	2013	49	2					279	294		10.1017/S0014479712001251							WOS:000315162900009

Evidence for a persistent microbial seed bank throughout the global ocean	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Do bacterial taxa demonstrate clear endemism, like macroorganisms, or can one site's bacterial community recapture the total phylogenetic diversity of the world's oceans? Here we compare a deep bacterial community characterization from one site in the English Channel (L4-DeepSeq) with 356 datasets from the International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) taken from around the globe (ranging from marine pelagic and sediment samples to sponge-associated environments). At the L4-DeepSeq site, increasing sequencing depth uncovers greater phylogenetic overlap with the global ICoMM data. This site contained 31.7-66.2% of operational taxonomic units identified in a given ICoMM biome. Extrapolation of this overlap suggests that 1.93 x 10(11) sequences from the L4 site would capture all ICoMM bacterial phylogenetic diversity. Current technology trends suggest this limit may be attainable within 3 y. These results strongly suggest the marine biosphere maintains a previously undetected, persistent microbial seed bank.

Rebuilding Soils on Mined Land for Native Forests in Appalachia	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The eastern U.S. Appalachian region supports the world's most extensive temperate forests, but surface mining for coal has caused forest loss. New reclamation methods are being employed with the intent of restoring native forest on Appalachian mined lands. Mine soil construction is essential to the reforestation process. Here, we review scientific literature concerning selection of mining materials for mine soil construction where forest ecosystem restoration is the reclamation goal. Successful establishment and productive growth of native Appalachian trees has been documented on mine soils with coarse fragment contents as great as 60% but with low soluble salt levels and slightly to moderately acidic pHs, properties characteristic of the region's native soils. Native tree productivity on some Appalachian mined lands where weathered rock spoils were used to reconstruct soils was found comparable to productivity on native forest sites. Weathered rock spoils, however, are lower in bioavailable N and P than native Appalachian soils and they lack live seed banks which native soils contain. The body of scientific research suggests use of salvaged native soils for mine soil construction when forest ecosystem restoration is the reclamation goal, and that weathered rock spoils are generally superior to unweathered rock spoils when constructing mine soils for this purpose.

We also surveyed the vegetation communities at the eight study sites to explore the role of soil seed banks in vegetation restoration. The storage capacity of soil seed banks at the eight sites ranked from 766.26 to 2461.92 seeds.m(-2). A total of 23 plant species were found in soil seed banks, of which 63-80% of seeds were herbs in various soil layers and 60% of seeds were located in the soil layer at 0-5 cm depth. Biodiversity indices indicated clear differences in species diversity of soil seed banks among different plant communities. The species composition of aboveground vegetation showed low similarity with that based on soil seed banks. In the aboveground plant community, the afforestation tree species showed high importance values. The plant species originating from soil seed banks represented natural regeneration, which also showed relatively high importance values. This study suggests that in the rocky mountain region of Beijing the soil seed banks played a key role in the transformation from pure plantation forest to near-natural forest, promoting natural ecological processes, and the role of the seed banks in vegetation restoration was important to the improvement of ecological restoration methods.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				MAR	2013	24	1					91	97		10.1007/s11676-013-0328-y							WOS:000321257900012

Soil seed banks are the origin of the revegetation process. Seed banks are an important component of ecosystem resilience and represent the regeneration potential for many plant assemblages. Species overcome periods of unfavorable weather conditions by building up a large seed bank. With this strategy, species diversity is preserved, and information on their dynamics and structure is retained. Research on soil seed banks has gained broad interest because of the important role seed banks play in plantation renovation and restoration, preservation of biological diversity, vegetation succession and diffusion processes and other aspects of vegetation. This paper reviewed research methods, basic features of soil seed banks and the relationship between soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation and seed size in desert regions. Some suggestions have been made for future work. This paper is aimed at providing a useful framework for future research.																	0974-262X	2278-4543				MAR	2013	6				1		315	322									WOS:000317246200041

Because most snowbed species are weak competitors, it is important to study the dissemination and persistence of their seeds to better understand their population dynamics. This study analyzed the snowbed flora of the Central Pyrenees using 11 morpho-functional traits, mostly related to seed function. The seeds of most plants found in snowbeds are small or very small, they have ovoid to elliptical shapes, and have no attributes related to dispersal. When only snowbed specialists (i.e., with a phytosociological optimum in snowbed habitats) are considered, three strategy groups become apparent: i) annuals or pauciennials producing abundant small seeds prone to accumulate in the soil; ii) chamaephytes or hemicryptophytes that produce anemochorous seeds; and iii) other perennials - mainly hemicryptophytes - with no specific seed traits. In the first two groups, the extant populations are maintained either by permanent soil seed banks or by means of vegetative persistence and dispersal. The lack of specific traits in the third group suggests that these plants could be more sensitive to direct competitive exclusion from non-chionophilous species under a changing climatic scenario in which snowbeds tend to disappear.

Transition matrix models were used to examine population dynamics of the species. Results show that populations in the Slovak Karst are performing better than populations in the Czech Karst. The transitions contributing most to the population growth rates were those of stasis in the small and large adult plant stage. These transitions are, however, stable between populations and years, suggesting that they are not very sensitive to the ongoing changes. Transitions that contribute most to variations in population growth rate include seed and seedling production by large adult plants, seed germination and stasis and growth of small adult plants. These transitions seem to be affected by habitat conditions (soil depth and bare rock cover), genetic parameters of the populations, climate fluctuations (especially severe droughts), and shrub expansion. The transitions contributing most to the population growth rates are very similar between the regions except for contributions of seedling growth and stasis of large adults. These differences need to be considered before using information about the most important life cycle transitions in other regions. We suggest that similar results would be found for other species with narrow habitat requirements occupying very similar habitats, even in very distant regions.

J	Snyman, HA				Snyman, H. A.			Disturbances Impact on Longevity of Grass Seeds, Semi-Arid South African Rangeland	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												The effect of plant and soil disturbances on seed density, species richness, and seed longevity of the soil seed bank was quantified for a semi-arid rangeland, over a 5-yr period (2002/2003-2006/2007 growing seasons). The different soil and plant treatments included fire, tillage (intended as a trampling surrogate), and blocked seed rain (simulating heavy grazing). These three experimental factors were combined in a factorial arrangement. Seed responses were evaluated in the soil seed bank before the new seed set, after the first seed production event, and after the second seed production event. Before disturbance (physical impact on the plant and soil), soil seed bank was dominated by early successional species: conversely, aboveground vegetation was mainly dominated by perennial grasses. After only 4 yr of blocked seed rain, seedling emergence of Decreaser grass species ceased totally both in the field and seed bank, with lower effect on Increaser grass species. Emergence of both Decreaser and Increaser grass species decreased in the seed bank with tillage, whereas the opposite occurred in the field. By contrast, tillage increased the emergence of weeds in the seed bank. The decrease in emergence of Decreaser grass species in both seed bank and field was still evident 4 yr after the rangeland was burnt. The grass species Themeda triandra was the most sensitive to fire in terms of seedling emergence. Blocked seed rain treatment significantly decreased (P < 0.05) species richness. Regardless of treatments applied, there was poor similarity between aboveground vegetation and the associated seed bank. Differences in the soil seed bank are likely to reflect manifested properties rather than short-term changes. Several characteristics of seed banks (species composition, seed abundance, and longevity) must be considered in order to understand the dynamics of plant communities following disturbances.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				MAR	2013	66	2					143	156		10.2111/REM-D-11-00145.1							WOS:000316643000005						
J	Jurand, BS; Abella, SR				Jurand, Benjamin S.; Abella, Scott R.			Soil Seed Banks of the Exotic Annual Grass Bromus rubens on a Burned Desert Landscape	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Red brome (Bromus rubens), an exotic annual grass, can dominate soil seed banks and poses serious threats to mature native plant communities in the Mojave Desert by competing with native species and providing fine fuels that facilitate widespread wildfire. By exploring how seed bank density and composition in burned areas change over time since fire (TSF), we can improve our understanding of how the seed banks are affected by fire. Samples of the 5-cm-deep soil seed bank were collected from two microsites (under shrubs, in open interspaces) within paired burned and unburned areas on 12 fires ranging from 5-31 yr TSF. Seed bank samples were assayed using the emergence method and seed densities were compared among TSFs, burn status (burned, unburned), and microsites for the species that emerged. Red brome soil seed bank density was spatially variable and TSF rarely predicted abundance. Overall, undershrub seed densities did not differ between burned and unburned areas. However, at some fire sites, seed densities in interspaces were greater in burned than unburned areas. Although native seed densities were low overall, they did not appear to differ according to burn status. Studies have shown that red brome plant and seed bank densities can be greatly reduced immediately after fire. Management efforts that focus on this initial colonization window may be able to take advantage of diminished red brome seed densities to limit its reestablishment while facilitating the establishment of native species. However, this window is brief, as our findings indicate that once reestablished, red brome soil seed densities in burned areas can be similar to those in unburned areas within 5 yr.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				MAR	2013	66	2					157	163		10.2111/REM-D-12-00106.1							WOS:000316643000006

Festuca gracillima Hook. f. was studied as a model because it is a perennial tussock-forming grass that produces abundant seed but rarely regenerates through seedlings. The Study area was the Magellanic Steppe, Patagonia, Argentina (182 mm rainfall), managed with sheep-grazing regimes of 0.65 (high), 0.21 (low), and 0 (exclosure) ewe equivalents ha(-1) . yr(-1). Tussock size and spikelet production of 358 individuals were recorded over 5 yr. Yearly models of reproductive effort in relation to plant size were tested using a maximum likelihood procedure. Seed was collected and soil cores were tested for germination and viability. Survival and growth of cohorts of seedlings sown in nylon bags were recorded. Eighteen experimental plots were cleared, and seed establishment under protected and grazed conditions was registered. Reproductive effort varied with years and plant size, with a mean of 2.41%. Florets were produced at mean density of 544 +/- 217 . m(-2). Predispersal losses reduced viable seed production to 187 +/- 48 seeds . m(-2). Seed weighed 2-2.5 mg, with 65-95% germination. Postdispersal losses reduced the seed bank in spring to 33 +/- 1.3 seeds . m(-2). Seedling survival curves were negatively exponential, with 95% mortality in the first year. Up to 5% of resources were used for sexual reproduction in favorable years and a recruitment of 1-3 new seedlings . m(-2) yr(-1) was expected. These new plants were not observed in undisturbed plots, but established naturally in cleared plots and reached a density of 1 plant . m(-2) after 10 yr, together with 44 plants . m(-2) of other species. Competition might block the final establishment in these grasslands. Grazing does not appear to interfere in any stage of seed reproduction. Seed production may not maintain population numbers but could enhance genetic variation in these clonal plant populations and enable dispersal and recolonization of disturbed areas.																	1550-7424					MAR	2013	66	2					164	173		10.2111/REM-D-11-00121.1							WOS:000316643000007

Interactions between Ants and Non-myrmecochorous Fruits in Miconia (Melastomataceae) in a Neotropical Savanna	BIOTROPICA												The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ants as secondary seed dispersers of six primarily bird-dispersed Miconia species in the cerrados of southeastern Brazil. Vertebrate exclosure and seed germination experiments were performed for M. albicans, M. alborufescens, M. corallina, M. ferruginata, M. ibaguensis, and M. irwinii. Excluding vertebrates did not significantly alter fruit removal rate for any of the Miconia species relative to open controls. Fruits on stalks and fallen fruits were removed and transported to nests mainly by species of Atta, Acromyrmex, and Ectatomma (dispersal distance ranging from 0.1 to 45.2m), while Camponotus ants tended to be observed removing the fruit pulp (seed cleaning) where the fruits were found. Seed manipulation by Atta decreased germination of M. irwinii, but not M. ferruginata. Germination did not occur in intact fruits, and thus seed cleaning was an important service provided by the ants. Ant nest soils did not inhibit germination of any of the Miconia species, suggesting they are a good substrate for long-lived Miconia seeds. We conclude that ant activity could have important effects on the fate of Miconia seeds adapted for bird dispersal.

Seed Treatment Optimizes Benefits of Seed Bank Storage for Restoration-Ready Seeds: The Feasibility of Prestorage Dormancy Alleviation for Mine-Site Revegetation	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Dormant seeds of 18 species from 9 families covering a diverse range of seed dormancy syndromes and life histories from the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot were assessed for germinability following storage at 1525 degrees C for 36 months. A total of 10 species with physical dormancy (PY) and 8 with either physiological dormancy (PD) or morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) were assessed as part of the study. Prior to storage, germination from dormant seeds was 127%, rising to 41100% following specific dormancy-breaking treatments. When seed dormancy was removed prior to storage for 36 months seeds from all species were found to maintain a nondormant state and germinate to a similar level to that observed at the beginning of the experiment (44100%). Likewise, seeds that did not receive a prestorage dormancy-breaking treatment maintained a dormant state (050% germination) and subsequently responded well to a dormancy-breaking treatment immediately prior to germination assessment (4999%). There were minimal differences in response to dormancy-breaking treatments before and after 36 months storage (average 46% difference) and in the germination responses observed between both storage environments assessed (15 degrees C/15% eRH or 1525 degrees C air dried). Based on these findings, storing seeds in a nondormant state does not alter germinability and this approach provides significant benefits to current seed-based restoration programs through reduction of double handling and improved seed use efficiency.

Seed Persistence in Soil of Five Medic Cultivars in Southeastern Wyoming	CROP SCIENCE												The success of annual medic pastures in ley farming systems is largely due to their ability to establish and maintain a viable seed bank from which these pastures can annually regenerate. A medic pod burial study was conducted to evaluate seed bank persistence of a range of commercially available and experimental annual medic lines under field conditions in southeastern Wyoming. The Medicago rigidula (L.) All. (tifton burclover) cultivar Laramie had the highest proportion of hard seed throughout the study period (1997-2001). After 5 yr of pod burial, this cultivar retained 56% of the original seed bank as hard seed within 5 cm of the soil profile depth. In contrast, the best of the Australian-developed cultivars Santiago (burr medic [Medicago polymorpha L.]) maintained 48% hard seeds within 5 cm soil depth after 3 yr of pod burial. The remaining Australia developed cultivars maintained at least half the seed bank for just 1 yr at either the surface or 5 cm depth. Our results demonstrated that Laramie annual medic has the ability to produce a large and viable seed bank capable of persisting for an extended period in southeastern Wyoming ley farming systems.

To better understand the relationships between the environmental factors and recovered plant communities for reconstructing floristically diverse riparian zone, we conducted a field survey in 11 sites in the WLFZ in June 2010, and vegetation composition, flooding characteristics, heavy metals, and soil major nutrients were determined. Consequently, the canonical correspondence analysis was used to investigate the relationships between plant species composition and flooding characteristics, heavy metal contamination, and soil nutrients. Results demonstrated that vegetation in the WLFZ was dominated by annuals, i.e., Echinochloa crusgalli and Bidens tripartita, and perennials including Cynodon dactylon, and plant species richness and diversity were negatively associated with flooding duration, heavy metal contamination, and nutrients including total phosphorus, available phosphorus, available potassium, and nitrate. Our results suggest that plant species, recovering mainly through soil seed bank and regeneration of remnant individuals, have been influenced by the combined effects of environmental factors.

Switchgrass Biomass and Nitrogen Yield with Over-Seeded Cool-season Forages in the Southern Great Plains	BIOENERGY RESEARCH												In dry climates with long, hot summers and freezing winters, such as that of the southern Great Plains of North America, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has proven potential as a cellulosic bioenergy feedstock. This trial looked at dry matter (DM) and N yield dynamics of switchgrass overseeded with cool-season legumes and rye (Secale cereale L.), compared to switchgrass fertilized with 0, 56 and 112 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at an infertile and a fertile location. Optimal N fertilizer rate on switchgrass was 56 kg N ha(-1) at the infertile location. Legume yield was greater in the first season after planting, compared to subsequent years where annual legumes were allowed to reseed and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was allowed to grow. This suggests that the reseeding model for annual legumes will not work in switchgrass swards grown for biomass unless soil seed banks are built up for more than one year, and that overseeding with alfalfa may have to be repeated in subsequent years to build up plant populations. Overseeding rye and legumes generally did not suppress or enhance switchgrass biomass production compared to unfertilized switchgrass. However, cumulative spring and fall biomass yields were generally greater due to winter and spring legume production, which could be beneficial for grazing or soil conservation systems, but not necessarily for once-yearly late autumn harvest biofuel production systems.

Factors controlling regeneration in a rare desert tree Acacia peuce: Limits to soil seed bank accumulation in time and space	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We assessed reasons for rare recruitment in Acacia peuce, an Australian arid zone tree, by testing recruitment-limitation hypotheses relating to seed bank inputs and losses. Viable seed occurred in low density in the soil (<1 seed m(2)) whereas freshly produced seed was non-dormant and germination was high and fast, indicating small rain events can deplete seed banks without providing sufficient moisture for seedling survival. Seed bank seed had lower viability than fresh seed. Insect predation of seed was negligible but seed pod production and seed number/pod were low. Thus, seed bank accumulation is limited by low inputs and continual high seed losses through germination and potentially seed death. No seed shadow effect under adult canopies was found, but dispersal beyond existing stands was negligible. Seed dispersal from parent plants occurred by wind movement of unopened pods whereas the resident ant fauna did not transport seed. Microsite parameters strongly influenced horizontal distribution of buried seed, with all seed being retrieved from vegetated sandy mounds. Overall, we found that seedling recruitment is likely to be confined to large above average rainfall events because the species is unlikely to maintain a seed bank in below-average and average rainfall phases.

Hall			Community-level consequences of cattle grazing for an invaded grassland: variable responses of native and exotic vegetation	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Does grazing by cattle mediate the composition of a coastal grassland community and do native and exotic taxa from different plant groups, based on life-history and life-form characteristics, vary in their response to grazing? To what degree does grazing impact the growth and fecundity of Bromus diandrus, the most dominant exotic grass invader in this system? Location Coastal grassland/prairie near Carmel, central California, USA. Methods Using a 3-yr exclosure experiment, we evaluated the effects of light winter/spring grazing by cattle (average of 0.75 cow-calf pairs center dot ha-1) on species richness and percentage cover of native and exotic plants from different life-history and life-form groups. Results We found that cattle grazing reduced total vegetative cover by 25% and increased bare ground by 40%. Grazing also caused a 70% reduction in above-ground plant biomass and a 40% reduction in the cover of exotic annual grasses, which were by far the most dominant group in this system. Grazing also reduced the height and spikelet production of the exotic annual grass B. diandrus. In contrast, grazing increased the cover of exotic annual forbs by 15%. Contrary to our expectations, grazing did not affect the cover of native forbs and grasses, and we hypothesize that these taxa possess life-history characteristics and/or depleted seed banks that prevented them from responding to grazing during our experiment. Grazing also did not affect the species richness of any native or exotic plant group. Conclusions Our 3-yr exclosure experiment has shown that grazing by cattle caused major changes in a coastal grassland community, with the responses of native and exotic taxa having different life-history and life-form characteristics varying markedly. Understanding the responses of these divergent groups is not only important for basic research evaluating the effects of mammalian herbivores on plant communities, but is also critical for developing science-based approaches for sustainably managing invaded grasslands.

Germination patterns and ecological characteristics of Vellozia seeds from high-altitude sites in south-eastern Brazil	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The present work aims to determine whether there are patterns of seed and germination characteristics in Vellozia due to the phylogenetic proximity among the species examined and if these characteristics explain their restricted geographical distributions. We evaluated the germination characteristics of freshly collected seeds from 13 species of the genus Vellozia (Velloziaceae) that show different degrees of endemism, collected at various locations in the Espinhaco Mountain Range in Minas Gerais State, south-eastern Brazil. The size and mass of the seeds, as well as the influence of light and temperature on their germination, were measured. Experiments were performed in germination chambers under constant temperatures of 10-40 degrees C (intervals of 5 degrees C), with a 12-h photoperiod, as well as in continuous darkness. All species studied had small seeds with mass varying from 0.06 to 1.21 mg. Most species required light for germination, displaying high germinability in the range of 15-40 degrees C; some species, however, germinated in the absence of light at the highest temperatures (35 and 40 degrees C). The sizes and masses of the seeds showed significant linear correlations, but light sensitivity was not related to these seed characteristics. The responses observed suggest that light requirement for germination, associated with the small sizes of Vellozia spp. seeds, contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks. The observed tolerance of these seeds to a wide range of germination temperatures is consistent with the large daily temperature fluctuations experienced in campos rupestres sites, although these seed characteristics cannot by themselves explain the high degree of endemism or the restricted distributions observed among the species examined.

In the hill-gully Loess Plateau region, it remains unclear whether a rich diversity of species persists in the fragmented landscape in spite of intensive human activities and whether the distribution of the soil seed bank and the establishment of seedlings are threatened by serious soil erosion. We investigated vegetation composition in a series of plots with different slope aspects and degrees in a watershed of 8.26 km(2) in Shaanxi Provence, China to determine the local species pool. The soil seed bank and seedling recruitment on typical eroded slopes over varied erosion zones were simultaneously studied to characterize soil seed bank resources and seedling establishment. In this study, 133 species were identified in the local species pool. The species' frequency within the soil seed bank, seedling and standing vegetation was positively correlated with the frequency of matched species in the local species pool. The soil seed bank density and species richness had no significantly decreasing with the soil erosion intensity increasing on the hill slope. However, the seedling density and species composition showed significant difference among the investigative times and different erosion zones. Furthermore, the species frequency declined with increasing seed mass. Results of this study indicate that the seeds of widely distributed species always have small size, persist in soil under eroded conditions and have stable seedling density over the growing season. Therefore, these species can successfully recolonize in abandoned slope land. However, late-successional species with large seeds that lack dispersal vectors are less able to disperse and recolonize in areas that need to be restored. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is one of the most valuable medicinal plants in Indian system of medicine. No information is available on seed morphology, dormancy and seed storage behavior of the species which is required for conserving the seeds in seed banks. Therefore an experiment was conducted with seed lot collected from Almora, Uttarakhand. Studies were conducted on seed germinability (using germination tests) and seed viability (using topographical tetrazolium chloride test) in relation to desiccation and chilling tolerance using a factorial combination of four moisture content (5, 7, 10 and 12% moisture content in seeds on fresh weight basis), three storage temperatures (seeds stored in ambient condition, at 15 degrees C and at -20 degrees C) and five storage periods (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). Perusal of data revealed that no significant loss in germination was observed in seeds with 5 and 7% moisture content under ambient as well as other storage conditions, suggesting that seeds of Berberis aristata are desiccation as well as chilling tolerant and exhibited orthodox seed storage behavior. The seeds are ideal for ex situ conservation in seed banks/gene banks for a longer period.																	0019-5022					MAR	2013	83	3					304	309									WOS:000343571300008

An investigation was conducted into the effects of enclosure for 3 years on the soil seed banks of degraded natural and sown grasslands at eight study sites. Species composition, soil seed bank density and the relationships with above-ground vegetation were analysed based on 4800 soil core samples and counting of seeds extracted from soil samples. After 3 years of fencing enclosure, soil seed banks differed between the different communities across the study sites. Species numbers and seed density in soil seed banks decreased from natural grassland to sown grassland, with most seeds occurring in the upper 5 cm soil layer. In these alpine grasslands, relatively few species produced high numbers of seeds, although their occurrence across the eight study sites was variable. Total vegetation cover increased with enclosure due to the colonization capacity of the vegetation rather than soil seed banks. This study provided evidence that soil seed banks do not play an important role in the restoration of degraded alpine grassland when using fencing enclosures. Further studies conducted over longer periods are needed to address this subject.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				MAR	2013	364	1-2					229	244		10.1007/s11104-012-1362-9							WOS:000314722800020						
J	Noel, F; Machon, N; Robert, A				Noel, Florence; Machon, Nathalie; Robert, Alexandre			Integrating demographic and genetic effects of connections on the viability of an endangered plant in a highly fragmented habitat	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Classical ecological theories state that the viability of small metapopulations is critically related to: (1) the correlation of local population dynamics, (2) the possibility of extinct patch re-colonisation, and (3) the effects of genetic deterioration. Recent works suggested that these factors are not independent because dispersal might affect both re-colonisation and genetic rescue processes and because connectivity between habitat patches may be related to their environmental synchrony. Close patches may exhibit both high connectivity and synchronisation of their environments. Here, we examined these effects in the endangered plant Ranunculus nodiflorus that inhabits temporary water puddles, where water corridors constitute the vector (1) allowing seed dispersal throughout puddle networks and (2) leading to synchrony of local environmental factors. We utilised a demo-genetic metapopulation model to show how the antagonistic effects of connectivity and synchrony lead to complex interactions between the species' biology and network configuration. We specifically demonstrated that (1) when an effective seed bank occurs, viability is maximised either for systems of numerous small independent networks (not connected and not synchronised), or for one single large network, while intermediate situations lead to a dramatic increase of the extinction risk; (2) genetic deterioration has notable negative effects on viability only in situations where environmentally driven extinction is buffered by the presence of a seed bank and network configuration; and (3) temporary connections among networks lead to a dramatic reduction of the extinction risk. The implementation of such connections is an efficient management option for the species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Soil collected from 38 sites on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, containing small remnants of senescent Eucalyptus cneorifolia-dominated mallee, was subject ex situ to both smoke aerosol and heat treatment to simulate burning. Further soil from a subset of 29 of the sites was left untreated as a control. A total of 113 native plant species and 50 introduced species germinated across all sites. Fifty-three of the native plant species that germinated were absent in the above-ground vegetation, including twelve rare or threatened species, and three species previously unrecorded from Kangaroo Island. Fourteen native species and six introduced species germinated in heat plus smoke treated soil but not in untreated soil from the same sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination indicated differences in native species composition between sites with a long history of sustained livestock grazing ("grazed" sites) and largely ungrazed sites ("ungrazed" sites). On average, significantly more native species germinated from treated soil sampled from "ungrazed" sites than were found in the standing vegetation, while for "grazed" sites this difference was not significant. This indicates the greater potential for post-fire regeneration of native vegetation from the soil seed bank of ungrazed sites than from that of long grazed sites. Both "ungrazed" and "grazed" sites contained weeds in their soil seed banks, including some species which were stimulated by heat plus smoke. This indicated that competition from weeds is potentially a problem when fire is used as a management tool to regenerate senescent understoreys. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sensitivity of soil respiration and microbial communities to altered snowfall	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Winter respiration is a quantitatively important, yet variable flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from soils to the atmosphere. Variability in winter soil respiration may be influenced by the effects of snowfall on microbial communities and their metabolic activities. In this study, we evaluated the importance of snowpack depth on soil respiration and microbial communities in a temperate deciduous forest. Snow removal created relatively dry, frequently frozen, and carbon substrate-poor soils, while snow additions led to wetter, warmer, and relatively carbon substrate-rich soils. Using time-series multiple regression, we observed enhanced sensitivity of respiration to moisture under ambient snow and snow removal; however, this effect was accompanied by a temporal lag suggesting that microorganisms had a delayed response to increases in free-water during soil thawing events. Conversely, soil respiration was only sensitive to temperature in the snow addition treatment when soil temperatures were consistently above 0 degrees C. The snow-induced respiration dynamics were accompanied by shifts in the structure of wintertime fungal and bacterial communities. We detected an impact of altered snowpack on bacterial richness during the growing season, but our manipulation did not have legacy effects on other features of the soil microbial community at spring thaw. Our results suggest that microbial communities may be "reset" during seasonal transitions from winter to spring, and that soil microorganisms are likely adapted to annual fluctuations in snowpack depth.. As snowpack becomes more variable in mid-latitude systems due to climate change, our findings suggest that soil moisture and temperature will co-regulate wintertime respiration through a non-linear relationship surrounding soil freeze-thaw cycles, with snow-mediated changes in microbial community structure likely influencing wintertime respiration dynamics.

Hull in an eight-year grazing experiment on upland acid grassland	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Upland heathland is an internationally important habitat but a large area in the UK has been degraded to acid grassland by intensive livestock grazing. Re-establishment of dwarf shrubs, particularly Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull, is a key objective for restoring heathland on these sites. A replicated plot-scale experiment was set up to examine effects of disturbance and seed addition on C. vulgaris establishment in a Nardus stricta L. grassland under three grazing regimes: sheep only (1.5 ewes ha(-1) for 10 months per year); cattle only (0.5 heifers ha(-1) in summer only); and, the cattle regime combined with sheep (1.0 ewes ha(-1) for 10 months per year). Early results of the experiment have been reported previously but it was not known if these results were an indication of the longer-term restoration success. Here we evaluate the success of the restoration methods (disturbance, seeding treatments and grazing regime) eight years after the treatments began. In seeded plots, young C. vulgaris plants had greatest above-ground height, dry weight and shoot length if grazing was excluded or the cattle-only regime was applied. C. vulgaris cover was greatest, and increased most, in plots that had been disturbed, seeded and ungrazed or subjected to the cattle-only regime. The vegetation in these plots also became more similar to reference sites with 50% or more cover of C. vulgaris. The invasive Juncus effusus L. was more frequent in disturbed and grazed plots but less frequent in plots with C. vulgaris established from added seed. Previous results that showed the benefits of disturbance and seeding treatments were still valid but changes in the vegetation composition were still occurring and longer-term studies will be needed to determine when grazing regimes including sheep might be reintroduced.

J	Suzuki, M				Suzuki, Maki			Succession of abandoned coppice woodlands weakens tolerance of ground-layer vegetation to ungulate herbivory: A test involving a field experiment	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Ground-layer vegetation of abandoned woodlands is threatened by excessive shading and increasing pressure from ungulate herbivores. Although these issues are studied separately, they are presumed to be interactive because decreasing energy input into ground layer seems to limit herbivory tolerance in plants. To separately estimate impacts of succession, herbivory, and their interactions, I conducted a 2-by-2 factorial experiment (creating canopy gaps, setting deer exclosures, their combinations and controls) in abandoned woodlands, where ground-layer vegetation had nearly vanished from deer herbivory. Changes of plant community were monitored three times since half a year before the start of experiment. Rapid increases in foliar cover, plant height, and species richness were found in plots under gaps within half a year from the beginning of the experiment. The major cause of this rapid increase was reestablishment of light-demanding and fast-growing species, whose compensation growth exceeded consumption by deer. In contrast, no significant change was found in ground-layer vegetation under a closed canopy, where only shade-tolerant and slow-growing species existed. These results suggested that limits in light resulting from the progress of forest succession is a primary factor inhibiting recovery of ground-layer vegetation from herbivory damage. In the short term, a combination of gap creation and the removal of herbivores is necessary to restore ground-layer plants in abandoned woodlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Santini, BA; Martorell, C				Santini, Bianca A.; Martorell, Carlos			DOES RETAINED-SEED PRIMING DRIVE THE EVOLUTION OF SEROTINY IN DRYLANDS? AN ASSESSMENT USING THE CACTUS MAMMILLARIA HERNANDEZII	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: Serotinous plants retain their seeds for a long time. In deserts, retained seeds undergo hydration-dehydration cycles and thus may become primed. Priming enhances germination and seedling vigor. We test the hypothesis that serotiny evolves because it provides a site protected from predators in which seeds can become primed. Rainfall-cued dispersal of primed seeds may enhance this effect. Methods: We tested this hypothesis with Mammillaria hernandezii through protein-content analyses; field and laboratory germination experiments with primed, unprimed, and retained seeds; and fitness estimations from demographic models. Key results: Hydration-dehydration cycles induced priming, enhancing germination. Artificial priming and retention in the parent plant for 1 yr induced similar changes in seed protein patterns, suggesting that priming occurs naturally while seeds are retained. Under field conditions, germination of seeds retained for 1 yr more than doubled that of seeds of the same cohort that were not primed or that remained buried for 1 yr. The first seeds to germinate died rapidly. Serotinous plants whose seeds underwent priming had higher fitness than those whose seeds were in the soil seed bank or that did not experience priming. Conclusions: Priming in soil seed banks may be costly because of high predation, so seed protection during priming is sufficient to promote the evolution of serotiny. Bet hedging contributes to this process. Rapid germination of primed seeds that respond to brief rainfall events is disadvantageous because such rainfall is insufficient for seedling survival. Serotinous species counteract this cost by cueing dispersal with heavy precipitation.

Jessica E.; McMahon, Sean M.; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto; Jongejans, Eelke			IPMpack: an R package for integral projection models	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Structured demographic models offer powerful methods for addressing important questions in ecology and evolution. Integral Projection Models (IPMs) are related to classic matrix models, but are more appropriate for modelling structured populations when the variable describing individuals' demography is continuous (e.g. size, weight, etc.). We present IPMpack, a free open-source software (R) package for building IPMs. The package estimates key population characteristics from IPMs, such as population growth rate in both deterministic and stochastic environments, age-specific trajectories of survival and reproduction, and sensitivities and elasticities to changes in underlying vital rates. IPMpack can be used for species across a range of life cycle complexity and can include continuous and discrete (e.g. seed bank, hibernation) state variables, as well as environmental covariates of interest. Methods for diagnostics, sensitivity analyses, plotting, model comparison and many other features allow users to move from data input through analysis to inference using an array of internal functions. IPMpack fills a need for readily usable tools for constructing and analysing IPMs and is designed to facilitate their use for experts and open up their use for those researchers who have little experience in the details of population models. A standardized IPM modelling framework will also facilitate cross-study and cross-species comparative demography, encouraging the exploration of broader ecological and evolutionary questions that can be addressed by population models.

The recruitment by seeds is feasible in suitable vegetation gaps from the seed rain and/or by establishment from persistent soil seed banks. Cessation of grassland management results in litter accumulation, which leads to the decline of species diversity by the decreased availability of open patches. Low amounts of litter is often beneficial, while high amounts of litter is detrimental for seed germination and seedling establishment of short-lived species. In a designed indoor experiment, we explored the effect of litter on seedling establishment by germinating six short-lived Brassicaceae species with both increasing seed mass and litter cover. We found that both seed mass and litter had significant effect on germination and establishment of the sown species. Small-seeded species were significantly negatively affected by the 300 and/or 600 g/m(2) litter layers. No negative litter effect was detected for species with high seed masses (Lepidium spp.). No overall significant positive litter effect was found, although for most of the species cumulative seedling numbers were not the highest at the bare soil pots. Our results suggest that the negative effects of litter are less feasible on the large-seeded short-lived species than on that of small-seeded ones.

Comparative seed dormancy and germination of eight annual species of ephemeral wetland vegetation in a Mediterranean climate	PLANT ECOLOGY												Ephemeral wetland vegetation (EWV) in the Mediterranean Basin appears in temporary wetlands where favourable hydrological conditions exist only for a short time and year-to-year variability is high. Here, we report results of the seed germination, dormancy and desiccation tolerance of eight annual species living in this vulnerable habitat. Experiments were performed in laboratory conditions under constant and alternating temperatures and using a 12-h daily photoperiod or continuous darkness. Whilst germination and dormancy differed between the species, seeds demonstrated an absolute light requirement and prefer cool temperatures to germinate (mean a parts per thousand currency sign15 A degrees C). Logistic regression analysis showed significant effects of alternating temperature in all the species except in Tillaea vaillantii whose germination was stimulated by constant temperature. Mean temperature was a significant term in the logistic models for the dormant species Cicendia filiformis, Linum radiola and T. vaillantii for which after-ripening was an effective dormancy-breaking treatment. From these results we infer three strategies of regeneration by seeds: (1) species germinating during the whole vegetative season (2) species germinating in a narrow temperature niche and (3) species requiring flooding (T. vaillantii). Seeds possessed orthodox storage behaviour (tolerating drying to 15 % relative humidity) and may be amenable to seed banking as a means of ex-situ conservation. We conclude that EWV species are adapted to the irregular presence of water with characteristics that are typical of neither truly aquatic nor wetland plants. These EWV species showed a more plastic germination response based on alternating and constant temperature sensitivity and a low proportion of dormant seeds.

J	van der Valk, AG				van der Valk, Arnold G.			Seed Banks of Drained Floodplain, Drained Palustrine, and Undrained Wetlands in Iowa, USA	WETLANDS												In the prairie pothole region, it is often assumed that relict seed banks in restored wetlands contain the seeds needed to re-establish their predrainage vegetation. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the composition of the seed banks of drained wetlands with those previously reported in undrained wetlands. Most of the species whose seeds were found in drained wetlands were annual or perennial herbs that are also found in undrained wetlands, primarily on exposed mudflats during drawdowns. Very few seeds of the emergent, free-floating or submersed species that dominate the seed banks and vegetation of undrained wetlands were found in the seed banks of drained wetlands. A second hypothesis was tested: the seed banks of drained floodplain wetlands have more species and seeds than those of drained palustrine wetlands. The seed banks of drained floodplain wetlands were significantly larger (mean total 1,660 seeds per sample, n = 10) than those in the drained palustrine wetlands (460 seeds per sample, n = 10). There was, however, no significant difference in the mean total number of species (26 and 29) or mean number of wetland species (18 and 18). The species composition of seed banks varied significantly among drained floodplain wetlands and among drained palustrine wetlands.																	0277-5212					FEB	2013	33	1					183	190		10.1007/s13157-012-0366-9							WOS:000314728600014

Because vegetation aggregation effects are a by-product of shrub presence, beneficiary species may not only be native, but also exotic. However, despite the high risk that exotic invasive species pose to ecosystem services, little is known of the role of desert shrubs on plant invasions. We assessed the influence of two shrub species on the non-dormant soil seed bank (i.e. the number of seeds that readily germinate with sufficient water availability) of an invasive annual grass (Schismus barbatus) and of coexisting native species in a central-northern Monte Desert (Argentina). Soil samples were collected beneath the canopies of two dominant shrub species (Bulnesia retama and Larrea divaricata) and in open spaces (i.e. intercanopies) in May 2001. Overall, the density of germinated seedlings of Schismus and that of the native species were negatively associated across microsite types. Schismus density was similar to that of all native species pooled together (mostly annuals), and was highest in Larrea samples (with no significant differences between Bulnesia and intercanopies). On the contrary, the density of all native species pooled together was highest in Bulnesia samples. Our results suggest that shrubs may contribute to plant invasions in our study system but, most importantly, they further illustrate that this influence can be species specific. Further research is needed to assess the relative importance of in situ seed production (and survival) and seed redistribution on soil seed bank spatial patterns.

Seed bank of Cu-contaminated topsoils at a wood preservation site: impacts of copper and compost on seed germination	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Is identification of seed bank (SB) species useful for sustainable management of vegetation restoration on Cu-contaminated soils? How does Cu contamination of the soil affect the SB and can incorporating compost into Cu-contaminated soils counter the effects of Cu? The topsoil SB was investigated at seven contaminated sub-sites of a wood preservation site. The germination parameters of the seeds were recorded using three substrates: a washed river sand (Sand), the same sand spiked with CuSO4 to reach the same Cu concentrations as in the soil pore water (0.3 to 3.2 mg Cu/L) (Cu), and the same Cu-spiked sand amended with compost (CPM). The total number of germinated seeds (NGS) was 1,081. The whole seedling dataset enabled 12 plant species and eight families to be identified in the SB. Species richness and Shannon indexes were low. The addition of Cu in the germination substrate enhanced total NGS at one sub-site and the addition of CPM increased plant diversity at three sub-sites. SB composition varied with the sub-site but did not correlate with total soil Cu or with the Cu concentration in the soil pore water. Three species belonging to the Poaceae family dominated. In terms of total NGS, the dominant species were Portulaca oleracea and Agrostis capillaris. Similarities between SB and established vegetation were low but increased when the soil bulk density was reduced. The Cu-tolerant species P. oleracea and A. capillaris dominated in both the SB and the established vegetation. However, the pattern of SB and established vegetation differed and consequently SB was not a sufficient indicator to predict the future vegetation.

Weed seeds in exogenous organic matter and their contribution to weed dynamics in cropping systems. A simulation approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Nitrogen fertilizers are crucial for ensuring crop production. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer are often complemented or replaced (e.g. in organic agriculture) by exogenous organic matter (EOM) to limit environmental impacts of mineral fertilization (e.g. reduced carbon storage, nitrate leaching to groundwater, biodiversity erosion). EOM can though cause new problems as it comprises pest propagules, particularly weed seeds. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the impact of EOM on grass weed dynamics, combining EOM analyses and model simulations. The first step analyzed seven EOM types for their chemical properties (e.g. nitrogen, carbon) and weed seed contents (using germination tests). The tested EOMs were of agricultural or urban origin (e.g. co-compost of green waste and sewage sludge or organic fraction of municipal waste). The most infested EOMs were composted farmyard manure and cattle slurry while fresh manure contained few weed seeds. Urban and green waste composts were nearly seed-free. In total, nineteen weed species and one crop species (Triticum aestivum) were identified with cattle slurry comprising the highest species number (thirteen). Weeds were mostly grass species (Lolium sp., Bromus sterilis, Echinochloa crus-galli, Festuca sp., Poa annua), except for Trifolium sp. In the second step, an existing model (ALOMSys) which quantifies the effects of cropping systems on the dynamics of an autumnal grass weed similar to Lolium sp. was amended to account for EOM applications, considering both weed seed addition to the native soil seed bank and additional nitrogen. Finally, the amended model was used to simulate the effects on grass weed dynamics of applying composted farmyard manure, using the observed EOM characteristics. Simulations focused on a small number of factors potentially interacting with EOM, i.e. EOM application frequency and seed content, tillage strategies, mineral nitrogen fertilization, and initial weed infestation. These simulations showed that for autumnal grass weed species, adding weed seeds via EOM only increased multi-year weed infestation if fields were initially weed-free or if the simulated weed species was highly dormant in summer. Conversely, the additional EOM nitrogen reduced the fitness of the newly produced grass weed seeds by affecting their dormancy and germination pattern, having more of them emerge in summer and thus unable to flower. Burying manure by mouldboard ploughing decreased or even cancelled the EOM effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A REVIEW ON INVASIVE PLANTS IN RANGELANDS OF ARGENTINA	INTERCIENCIA												In Argentina, information on invasive plants is restricted to croplands, while no information is available on rangelands. Our objectives were to 1) identify and describe various characteristics of the most important non-native species that have become invasive and widespread in major rangeland territories of Argentina; 2) summarize the biological information about some naturalized, non-native species with potential to transform natural plant communities, and 3) discuss strategies for plant invasion management and biodiversity conservation in local rangeland ecosystems. The invasive species most represented at local, regional or state scale studies were Acroptilon repens, Centaurea solstitialis, Eleagnus angustifolia, Medicago minima, Chondrilla juncea, Dipsacus sativus and Sorghum halepense. Successful invasion and naturalization rates have been the result of several combined ecological traits: 1) capacity to produce allelophatic compounds, 2) deep rooting, 3) high module density, 4) rapid vegetative spread aboveground, 5) various traits that make species highly competitive, 6) tolerance to shading and water stress, 7) ability to take advantage of disturbances, 8) high seed production, germination and dispersal, and 9) high viability of residual seed banks. The determination of the abundance of invasive species at country scale, and their ecological and economical damage, are objectives of future research. This information will be a critical tool to make decisions on the need to control invasive species. Ecological studies providing understanding of the strategies which make an invader species a successful competitor are critical, and should be the first step to establish policies for control of invasive species and use of rangelands.																	0378-1844					FEB	2013	38	2					95	103									WOS:000318887400003						
J	Kopecky, M; Hedl, R; Szabo, P				Kopecky, Martin; Hedl, Radim; Szabo, Peter			Non-random extinctions dominate plant community changes in abandoned coppices	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												The plant community structure of European lowland forests has changed dramatically in the twentieth century, leading to biodiversity decline at various spatial scales. However, due to methodological difficulties associated with simultaneous changes in species diversity and composition, ecological processes behind the changes are still poorly understood. We analysed temporal changes in forest plant community after the mid-twentieth-century abandonment of coppicing in a typical Central European forest, which had been managed as coppice for centuries. We used 122 semi-permanent plots first surveyed in the 1950s shortly after the last coppicing and again in the 2000s after half a century of natural succession. We used a novel temporal nestedness analysis to disentangle the immigration and extinction processes underlying temporal changes in community structure and tested whether species gains and losses were ecologically random. The studied vegetation has shifted from the species-rich assemblages of a relatively open and low-nutrient forest towards the impoverished flora of a closed-canopy forest dominated by a few shade-adapted species. The significant reduction in beta diversity, that is, compositional heterogeneity among plots, indicated taxonomic homogenization of the forest understorey. Temporal species turnover was only a minor component of the community change, and recent assemblages are nested subsets of the former ones. Ecologically non-random extinctions dominated these changes. Light-demanding species with a persistent seed bank were the most prone to extinction, while species with high specific leaf area substantially increased in frequency. Synthesis and applications. The dominant process after the abandonment of coppicing was the ecologically non-random extinction of light-demanding species, leading to an impoverished, temporally nested plant community structure. This development is typical for many abandoned coppices and poses a significant threat to forest biodiversity in Europe. If forestry and conservation policies continue to prefer closed-canopy stands, many endangered species are likely to pay their extinction debts. To restore declining or even locally extinct species, canopy opening in abandoned coppices is urgently needed.

Spatial relationships between the standing vegetation and the soil seed bank in a fire-prone encroached dehesa in Central Spain	PLANT ECOLOGY												Postfire vegetation regeneration in many fire-prone ecosystems is soil seed bank dependent. Although vegetation and seed bank may be spatially structured, the role of prefire vegetation patterns and fire in determining postfire vegetation patterns is poorly known. Here, we investigated the spatial patterning of species abundance and richness in the vegetation and seed bank of a Mediterranean encroached dehesa in Central Spain. The seed bank was studied with and without a heat shock simulating a spatially homogeneous fire. Semivariograms and cross-semivariograms showed that species richness in the vegetation was aggregated in patches, mainly of herbs, with highest values corresponding to high herb cover and low tree cover. Species richness in the seed bank was also structured in patches, but the spatial pattern was weak. Seedling density of germinates in the seed bank also showed weak spatial pattern. Heating increased overall germination and species richness, and the intensity of the spatial pattern of species richness, particularly of herbaceous species. However, seed bank density patterns disappeared after heat shock because of increased germination of shrubs without spatial pattern. Our results document that the spatial structure of plant richness in the vegetation may persist after fire due to the spatial patterns of herbaceous species in the seed bank, and that postfire species richness patterns can arise independently of fire intensity patterns. However, the spatial structure of the vegetation after fire can be altered by the feedback between shrub encroachment and an eventual fire because of the ubiquitous germination of shrubs.

J	Lutscher, F; Minh, NV				Lutscher, Frithjof; Nguyen Van Minh			Traveling waves in discrete models of biological populations with sessile stages	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS												A common approach to describing invasions of non-native species into previously unoccupied habitat is to consider the speed of population expansion and the existence of traveling waves. Typical existence theorems for traveling waves require some compactness properties of the next-generation operator. Many realistic modeling assumptions, however, give rise to non-compact operators; for example the occurrence of sessile stages during the life cycle of an individual. Recent results have extended the existence theory of traveling waves to a large class of weakly compact operators, but conditions can be difficult to check and not easily accessible to theoretical ecologists. In this paper, we give a new proof for the existence of traveling waves in a large class of equations where the next generation operator is not compact, but rather the sum of an integral operator and a contraction. We illustrate our proof with a model for the dispersal of a plant species with a seed-bank and a model for dispersal of stream insects with larval stages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Soc. 140: 89-100. 2013.-Old field succession has been reviewed extensively in many community settings; however, secondary succession in maritime communities, especially forest and shrub communities is poorly understood. Maritime communities of the North American Atlantic coast are unique and often fragmented ecosystems that provide critical stopover sites for migratory birds. Historical losses coupled with rising developmental pressures have created the need for conservation and restoration to protect these globally rare communities. We examined secondary succession by analyzing the vegetation community composition and soil seed bank of an abandoned agricultural field initially and at seven years (2009) after initiation of state-agency site restoration that used a combination of active and passive restoration techniques. The restoration field was divided into three projected habitats: early maritime forest (16 ha), maritime shrub (12 ha), and coastal grassland (8 ha). A trend was observed with loss of species richness across habitat types. There was a high proportion of species turnover, yet there were no significant differences in the number of species belonging to functional groups for each habitat between the two sampling years (2003 and 2009). Zones where active restoration techniques were used were more indicative of restoration success compared to areas that relied on spontaneous succession. Long-term vegetation surveys are critical to assess the success of restoration operations, and to describe and predict successional trajectories. Accessible vegetation survey data may become increasingly important in the future as land managers place more emphasis on protecting and restoring these overdeveloped, unique coastal communities.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JAN	2013	140	1					89	100		10.3159/TORREY-D-12-00008.1							WOS:000339654800009

With increased global movement of people and goods this historic advantage no longer exists. In the last several decades numerous legislative, policy and operational tools have been used to protect New Zealand's special areas and biota from invasive alien species. With the benefit of 25 years of dedicated protection efforts by the Department of Conservation, best practice alien plant control techniques have been developed, building on lessons from animal pest eradications, trophic relationships, and on-the ground pragmatism and experience. Increasingly, an essential tool to achieving greater success will be working with other agencies, businesses and communities to harness resources. Three case studies illustrate the approaches and lessons learnt from alien plant management in New Zealand in the last 25 years: Raoul Island in the far north of New Zealand, Hen and Chicken Islands to the east of North Auckland Peninsula, and Fiordland National Park in south-western South Island.																	1874-7809		978-94-007-7750-7; 978-94-007-7749-1				2013	7						285	311		10.1007/978-94-007-7750-7_14	10.1007/978-94-007-7750-7						WOS:000339070100016						
S	Simberloff, D		Foxcroft, LC; Pysek, P; Richardson, DM; Genovesi, P		Simberloff, Daniel			Eradication: Pipe Dream or Real Option?	PLANT INVASIONS IN PROTECTED AREAS: PATTERNS, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES	Invading Nature-Springer Series in Invasion Ecology											Invasive alien plant populations have often been eradicated from very small areas, but pessimism about eradication of widely distributed plants pervades the management community. Contributing to this view are several legendary and expensive failed eradication campaigns, the inconspicuous nature of many plants, the existence of soil seed banks, and the perceived expense of eradication over large areas. However, if several years' worth of the cost of maintenance management campaigns could instead be devoted to a one-shot, well-funded eradication effort, projects that currently seem impossible might be brought within the range of feasibility. Factors in addition to cost that must be considered are whether adequate lines of authority can compel cooperation and prevent sabotage, whether there is sufficient knowledge of the target species to have identified a feasible approach to eradication that advances the goal of restoration, and the need for intensive monitoring and possible follow-up operations. Especially for PAs, the likelihood of reinvasion from nearby sites is a concern. If an eradication campaign would employ the same general methods as those that would have been used if the goal was maintenance control, there is likely little cost and much potential benefit to attempting eradication. Gradual improvement has occurred in plant eradication programmes through accumulated experience and incremental improvement of longstanding methods. However, the field of invasive plant management (including eradication) has not seen the advent of remarkably innovative new approaches and greatly improved records of eradication success that currently foster optimism and enthusiasm among managers dealing with invasive animals.																	1874-7809		978-94-007-7750-7; 978-94-007-7749-1				2013	7						549	559		10.1007/978-94-007-7750-7_25	10.1007/978-94-007-7750-7						WOS:000339070100027						
J	Leck, MA				Leck, Mary Allessio			Dispersal potential of a tidal river and colonization of a created tidal freshwater marsh	AOB PLANTS												Background and aims A created tidal freshwater wetland, with no extant seed bank, was monitored to evaluate the colonization potential of a tidal river, vegetation and seed bank changes, and also species persistence. Methodology The 32.3-ha mitigation, adjacent to the Delaware River, was completed in 1994. Three sites, with differing completion dates, and three locations (channel edge, midpoint, upland edge) were sampled. From 1995 to 1999, surveys permitted a view of initial dynamics involving soil seed bank density or field vegetation cover, as well as species composition. Vegetation was monitored through 2011, and in 2011 a seed bank survey was also undertaken. Principal results Between 1995 and 1999, 177 species emerged from soil samples, with a maximum of 32.3 +/- 1.8 (SE)/sample. Eight species were added in 2011, indicating continuing dispersal and input. Comparing species richness across three sites for midpoint locations, 2011 totals and species/sample were lower (61-90 % and 53-72 %, respectively) than 1998 values. In vegetation plots during the first 5 years, 72 cover species were present. In 2011, there were 44; 14 were new and the majority (13) were woody and part of an overhanging edge canopy. Dispersal was primarily via water. Overall, the trend was towards lower seed bank densities, except for Mikania scandens and Phragmites australis which had higher densities, as well as cover values. Species richness also decreased. Species varied in persistence in the seed bank and vegetation, and among sites and with location. Initial site colonization differences were still apparent in 2011 seed bank samples. While present, Lythrum salicaria did not reduce species richness; Phragmites, in contrast, had substantial impact. Conclusions The single most important change was an increase in Phragmites in the vegetation. Vegetation dynamics are now determined by this species, and the persistent seed bank and continuing dispersal input have little obvious future in vegetation development.																	2041-2851						2013	5								pls050	10.1093/aobpla/pls050							WOS:000337481800002

Investigate structure and dynamics of Subalpine meadow community in Beijing Area in the north of China. The species of wildflower community is about 19/m(2), and the density is about 240:m(2). Deaths and regeneration occurs frequently in the community. From spring to summer, competition becomes more intense in horizontal direction than in height direction. The change of height direction, reduces the competition of horizontal direction. Based on the variation of importance value of plants in per square meter, the plant community can be divided into three types: homogeneous, gradient and dominant driven. According to the results of the character of wildflower community, the designed flower meadow was for Beijing area. Sixteen species of perennial flowers are selected, including 10 native wild flowers, formatting the five series. Select one commercial series as an experimental control group. According to the amount of seedling and the landscape analysis, 1.57 g/m(2) even lower seeding rates can reach the landscape requirements. The number of weed seed bank of soil is key factors affecting the flower meadow.																	0567-7572	2406-6168	978-90-66055-86-5				2013	999						249	252									WOS:000333253900034

Banking on the past: seed banks as a reservoir for rare and native species in restored vernal pools	AOB PLANTS												Soil seed banks serve as reservoirs for future plant communities, and when diverse and abundant can buffer vegetation communities against environmental fluctuations. Sparse seed banks, however, may lead to future declines of already rare species. Seed banks in wetland communities are often robust and can persist over long time periods making wetlands model systems for studying the spatial and temporal links between above-and belowground communities. Using collected soils and germination trials, we assessed species diversity and density in the seed banks of restored, ephemeral wetlands (vernal pools) in California's Central Valley, USA. Using long-term vegetation surveys, we compared the community structure of seed banks to that of aboveground vegetation and assessed the temporal links between below-and aboveground communities. We also compared the proportional abundances of different cover classes as well as the abundance of native plants in seed banks to aboveground communities. The proportional abundances of both rare and native species were greater in seed bank samples than in aboveground samples, yet the seed bank had lower species richness than aboveground vegetation. However, the seed bank had greater levels of differentiation among pools (beta diversity; beta) than aboveground samples. Additionally, the seed bank was more similar to the earlier (2003-06) aboveground community than the more recent (2007-10) aboveground community. The correlation of species composition in the current seed bank to an earlier aboveground community suggests that seed banks exhibit storage effects while aboveground species composition in this system is not driven by seed bank composition, but is perhaps due to environmental filtering. We conclude that the seed bank of these pools is neither prone to the same temporal rates of invasion as the aboveground community, nor is seed abundance presently a limiting factor in the aboveground frequency of native species or a promoting factor in plant invasions of these restored habitats.

J	Ghermandi, L; Gonzalez, S; Lescano, MN; Oddi, F				Ghermandi, Luciana; Gonzalez, Sofia; Natalia Lescano, Maria; Oddi, Facundo			Effects of fire severity on early recovery of Patagonian steppes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Fire severity influences the recovery and biodiversity of plant communities. We compared the early post-fire recovery of plant functional groups in two sites (one burnt with high severity and one with low severity) in the north-western Patagonian steppe. We sampled the post-fire soil seed banks, as well as the composition and cover of aboveground plant species, and calculated richness, diversity and the percentage of exotic species. Low fire severity increased the diversity of aboveground vegetation and seed banks, whereas high fire severity reduced the cover of all functional groups, with the exception of fugitive species. Tiller production of perennial grasses decreased due to bud bank mortality. In the seed bank, high severity fire reduced fugitive species and increased exotic species. Fugitive species need fire to recruit, and the combination of fire cues and post-fire environmental conditions can explain the high abundance of these species after fire. In Patagonia, the use of fire is not considered a management option because fires are believed to be dangerous to humans, goods and services. However, north-western Patagonia is sparsely populated and the frequent wildfires pose no danger. It is necessary to increase the knowledge of the ecological processes of Patagonian ecosystems related to fire regime and land use, to achieve a reasonable balance between sustainable use and conservation in this region.																	1049-8001	1448-5516					2013	22	8					1055	1062		10.1071/WF12198							WOS:000329813500004						
J	Thornby, D; Werth, J; Walker, S				Thornby, David; Werth, Jeff; Walker, Steven			Managing glyphosate resistance in Australian cotton farming: modelling shows how to delay evolution and maintain long-term population control	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Glyphosate resistance is a rapidly developing threat to profitability in Australian cotton farming. Resistance causes an immediate reduction in the effectiveness of in-crop weed control in glyphosate-resistant transgenic cotton and summer fallows. Although strategies for delaying glyphosate resistance and those for managing resistant populations are qualitatively similar, the longer resistance can be delayed, the longer cotton growers will have choice over which tactics to apply and when to apply them. Effective strategies to avoid, delay, and manage resistance are thus of substantial value. We used a model of glyphosate resistance dynamics to perform simulations of resistance evolution in Sonchus oleraceus (common sowthistle) and Echinochloa colona (awnless barnyard grass) under a range of resistance prevention, delaying, and management strategies. From these simulations, we identified several elements that could contribute to effective glyphosate resistance prevention and management strategies. (i) Controlling glyphosate survivors is the most robust approach to delaying or preventing resistance. High-efficacy, high-frequency survivor control almost doubled the useful lifespan of glyphosate from 13 to 25 years even with glyphosate alone used in summer fallows. (ii) Two non-glyphosate tactics in-crop plus two in-summer fallows is the minimum intervention required for long-term delays in resistance evolution. (iii) Pre-emergence herbicides are important, but should be backed up with non-glyphosate knockdowns and strategic tillage; replacing a late-season, pre-emergence herbicide with inter-row tillage was predicted to delay glyphosate resistance by 4 years in awnless barnyard grass. (iv) Weed species' ecological characteristics, particularly seed bank dynamics, have an impact on the effectiveness of resistance strategies; S. oleraceus, because of its propensity to emerge year-round, was less exposed to selection with glyphosate than E. colona, resulting in an extra 5 years of glyphosate usefulness (18 v. 13 years) even in the most rapid cases of resistance evolution. Delaying tactics are thus available that can provide some or many years of continued glyphosate efficacy. If glyphosate-resistant cotton cropping is to remain profitable in Australian farming systems in the long-term, however, growers must adapt to the probability that they will have to deal with summer weeds that are no longer susceptible to glyphosate. Robust resistance management systems will need to include a diversity of weed control options, used appropriately.																	1836-0947	1836-5795					2013	64	8					780	790		10.1071/CP13109							WOS:000329871700005

GENETIC VARIATIONS WITHIN AND AMONG POPULATIONS OF ANASTATICA HEIROCHUNTICA AT MACROSCALE GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The annual plant Anastatica hierochuntica is an Ombrohydrochloric species where the seeds released from the canopy seed bank throughout several years. The genetic variations at the intra-and interpopulation levels were studied in the runnel microhabitat in Libya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The genetic diversity was detected by RAPD analysis of the DNA material. The amount of genetic variation within Anastatica hierochuntica populations reached 67.910 % of the total variance. The Nei's gene diversity ranged from 0.336 to 0.361 and the Shannon's diversity index from 0.506 to 0.588 showing relatively high values. The highest value of the gene diversity was obtained in the Libya population. Lower values of the Nei's gene diversity were obtained in the Saudi Arabia then in the Egypt populations. Strong linear relationships were obtained between the Nei's gene diversity and the total amount of annual rainfall (R-2 = 0.88) and between the differences in the total annual rainfall and the values of the fixation index between population pairs (R-2 = 0.83). The role of the dispersal mode in shaping the genetic variations in the species was discussed as the canopy seed bank was suggested to have great significance in the context of species evolution and conservation of genetic diversity.

The pathogen engages in a race with host seeds for endosperm resources; the pathogen success is negatively correlated with seed germination speed. We developed a deterministic model to predict pathosystem outcomes (seed death versus seed escape), using seed bank data from 80 sites collected over a 13-year period. The response variable (killed seeds in the spring seed bank) was regressed on multiple predictor variables (pathogen and host densities at seed dispersal, amount and timing of precipitation). Increased mortality was associated with high seed rain, high pathogen density, and low autumn precipitation. On xeric sites, a positive feedback loop between pathogen and host is created by a large carryover seed bank containing secondarily dormant seeds vulnerable to fungal attack and results in higher inoculum loads at seed dispersal the following year.																	1212-2580	1805-9341					2013	49				SI		S21	S23		10.17221/36/2013-PPS							WOS:000329316100005

The fungal pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda can kill a large fraction of B. tectorum seeds. Outcomes in this pathosystem are often determined by the speed of seed germination. In this paper we extend previous efforts to describe the pathosystem by characterising secondary dormancy acquisition of B. tectorum. In the laboratory approximately 80% of seeds incubated at - 1.0 MPa became dormant. In the field, seeds were placed in the seed bank in late autumn, retrieved monthly and dormancy status determined. The field study confirmed the laboratory results; ungerminated seeds became increasingly dormant. Our data suggest that secondary dormancy is much more likely to occur at xeric sites.																	1212-2580	1805-9341					2013	49				SI		S11	S14		10.17221/30/2013-PPS							WOS:000329316100003

ACHIEVING TARGET 8 OF THE GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR PLANT CONSERVATION: LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN COLLECTIONS ASSESSMENT	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												How much progress has North America made toward the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) Target 8 of at least 75% of threatened plant species in accessible ex situ collections by 2020? To answer this, the North American Collections Assessment was carried out in 2010. More than 200 botanical and conservation institutions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico contributed taxa lists to the Botanic Gardens Conservation International's (BGCI) online Plant Search database for this assessment. By cross-referencing collection information with globally threatened species lists from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), Nature Serve, and Mexico's Red List, we found that approximately 35% of North America's nearly 5000 most threatened taxa are currently in ex situ collections. This marks considerable progress toward the GSPC Target 8, but there is clearly much more to do. Future priorities include collaboratively and strategically increasing threatened species representation in collections and assessing genetic diversity among collections by comparing accession-level data.																	0026-6493						2013	99	2					161	166		10.3417/2011114							WOS:000328662700005

Seed density in the topsoil of the lightly grazed, moderately grazed, heavily grazed and extremely grazed alpine meadows in November, 2010 were 1 551, 1 692, 2 660 and 1 830 grains m(-2), while in the same meadows in April, 2011 densities were 1 530, 2404, 2 530 and 2 692 grains m(-2), respectively. In the cold season pasture, mean seed density in yak dung from November to April in the lightly grazed, moderately grazed, heavily grazed and extremely grazed sites were 121, 127, 187, and 120 grains kg(-1) of dry yak dung. The proportion of total seed numbers in yak dung to soil seed bank in lightly grazed, moderately grazed, heavily grazed and extremely grazed alpine meadow was 1.40, 2.62, 0.69, and 0.90%. 12 species out of the 47 were not found in topsoil but were found in yak dung, 10 species out of 45 were not found in yak dung but were found in the topsoil. Endozoochorous dispersal by yaks is therefore very important for soil seed bank and plant biodiversity and population dynamics in alpine meadows.																	2095-3119						2013	12	12					2243	2249		10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60652-8							WOS:000328805300016

Spatiotemporal distributions of rare bacterioplankton populations indicate adaptive strategies in the oligotrophic ocean	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Spatiotemporal distributions of rare microbial taxa were examined in 384 samples from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, in the northwestern Sargasso Sea. Sequences were partitioned into 6 mutually exclusive sets based on abundance (abundant, rare, and very rare) and frequency of detection (frequent and infrequent). Analyses of variance for taxa that were frequently present, across all levels of abundance, demonstrated environmental filtering, indicating that gradients in environmental factors, such as season and depth, drive community assembly for rare taxa, as they do for abundant taxa. All abundant nodal taxonomic units (NTUs) had spatiotemporal periods of rarity, providing a clear demonstration of the role of fluctuating reproductive success in population dynamics, and the role of rare populations as seed banks. An inverse relationship between the number of rare taxa and physical stratification indicates that transport by mixing drives increased community diversity throughout most of the year. Populations of selected copiotrophic taxa varied in episodic patterns that were not tightly entrained to season and depth, indicating that these populations are not governed by the same rules of community assembly that apply to most other taxa and may be adapted to exploit infrequent, unknown disturbances. Overall, the findings support the perspective that the success of most rare populations was driven by the same fundamental patterns of spatiotemporal variation that drove the success of dominant populations, but also indicate potentially important roles for transport by mixing and atypical life histories in determination of community composition.

Willd. and its encroachment potential in sub-humid grasslands of eastern Australia	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Shrub encroachment involves abiotic and biotic factors that regulate demographic factors influencing seed production, storage, germination, and subsequent recruitment. In the rangelands of semi-arid and arid Australia, the thorny acacia, Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd., is apparently encroaching into grasslands and changing the structure, composition, and functioning of native grasslands. The potential for A. farnesiana to expand rapidly in response to changes in land use was examined by quantifying the reproductive output, dispersal, seed-bank density, and germination of seeds of A. farnesiana. Even in the absence of high grazing pressure, low numbers of seeds were produced and these were mainly locally dispersed, although long-distance dispersal via floods could occur. Pre-dispersal seed predation is likely to reduce the seed output, and despite strong physical seed dormancy, soil-stored seed banks were not large. Seed dormancy is broken by scarification but not strongly synergistically with fire or by fire alone, and fire may have a small effect on recruitment. Hence, pulse recruitment seems unlikely given the match between seedling densities and seed-bank density. These patterns suggest that A. farnesiana is unlikely to encroach rapidly into grasslands unless there is widespread landscape disturbance that triggers broad-scale dispersal, such as floods, and or physical scarification of seed.

Results from a 12-year field study	TUEXENIA												To examine the necessity of livestock grazing for managing threatened sand vegetation so as to ensure and develop its nature-conservation value, we investigated a grazing system in a model nature reserve (German upper Rhine valley) characterized by threatened steppic sandy grassland (Allio-Stipetum vegetation complex: Habitats Directive Annex I, priority type 6240, additionally Koelerion glaucae: priority type 6120). The area has been grazed by sheep and additionally by donkeys since late summer of the year 2000. We established ungrazed (Au) and grazed plots (Ag) in the Allio-Stipetum complex in a systematic grid-plot design before grazing impact started. We sampled phytosociological releves yearly in the Au/Ag plots for 12 vegetation periods. Additionally, we sampled releves on former farmland adjacent to the Allio-Stipetum complex (systematic grid-plot design) over ten vegetation periods. These former fields (Fg) were integrated in the grazing system since the beginning of the study. A constancy table was produced for Au, Ag, Fg. To determine the portions of target species (Koelerio-Corynephoretea, Festuco-Brometea species) we calculated target-species ratios (proportion of target species in comparison with the total species number; qualitative or quantitative approach: TSRqual/quant ). We tested the effects of grazing, year and interactions on structural and phytodiversity characteristics of the releves by mixed linear models. The results of the long-term experiment confirmed significant beneficial effects of grazing on habitat-typical structure and phytodiversity: e. g. reduction of litter, support of species which are short in height (< 20 cm), reduction of taller species (> 50 cm), support of the diversity of all plant species, of non-graminoid herbs and of target plant species, reduction of Calamagrostis epigejos, positive effects on TSRqual and TSRquant values. Similar developments, e.g. for phytodiversity and Calamagrostis epigejos cover, were observed on the former fields, but there are still seed limitations and high ruderal-plant dominances. In general TSRqual/quant show remarkable increases, but do not reach the values of the Ag plots. Concerning aims of nature conservation, the habitat-typical vegetation structure and phytodiversity of the Allio-Stipentum shows an excellent development as a consequence of the used grazing management. However, occasionally small populations of target species did not increase (e.g. Koeleria glauca). The former fields show a development towards valuable sandy grassland.																	0722-494X						2013		33					189	212									WOS:000324790800009

PLANTATIONS	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Seed banks play a key role in the recruitment of forest vegetation after severe disturbance, but can originate an undesired plant community. Thus, investigations on seed bank structure, and early changes occurring after clear-cut, are of primary interest for sustainable forest management. Researches were carried out in two mature stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) plantations located in Tuscany (Italy), along the Mediterranean coast. Soil samples were collected in March, July and October of the 2nd and 3rd year after clear-cut, in cut strips and adjacent intact stands. Seed bank size and composition were evaluated through the number of seedlings and species emerged from soil samples. Intact plantations differed in seed bank richness and composition, but not in abundance that was approximately 1,200 seeds m(-2). Clear-cut doubled seed density in soil, did not change seed bank richness, and affected markedly composition. Seed banks of cut strips were richer in annual and open space species, and poorer in perennial, forest and disturbed sites species. Seeds of Erica scoparia dominated the seed bank, with a relative abundance of 60% in intact stands and 43% in cut strips. Proportion of annual seeds was slightly less than 20% in intact stands, but increased up to 50% after clear-cut. Between the 2nd and 3rd year from clear-cut, the proportion of seeds from species typical of stone pine forests decreased, while that of non-forest species and aliens increased. The scarcity of seeds from most forest species and the lack of tree seeds make the recruitment of understorey vegetation from seed banks critical. In addition, the increased seed density of alien and disturbed site species in intact seed banks with time from clear-cut, suggests that disturbance caused by cutting in narrow strips threatens the integrity of intact plantations.				; Arduini, Iduna/H-1992-2017	Mariotti, Marco/0000-0002-2705-5365; Arduini, Iduna/0000-0001-5874-6145												1505-2249						2013	61	3					457	470									WOS:000324790100004

PLASTICITY IN DYNAMICS AND HYGROCHASTIC PERSISTENCE IN ANASTATICA HIEROCHUNTICA L. (BRASSICACEAE) POPULATIONS UNDER SIMULATED RAINFALL TREATMENTS	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Anastatica hierochuntica is a monocarpic desert annual whose dry skeletons, enclosing mature fruits, often persist for a number of years. The aerial seed bank in these hygrochastic 'resurrection plants' therefore persists too. Life tables and fecundity schedules were constructed for A. hierochuntica populations raised under four water treatments, equivalent to 100, 200, 500 and 1000 mm rainfall. Seedling survivorship showed a Deevey type III curve for 100 mm, and a type II curve for 200 mm, while 500 and 1000 mm treatments produced Deevey type I curves. Fewer seeds germinated and seedling survivorship was lower in the low water treatments. The stage-specific mortality rate reached 0.75 under the 100 mm treatment in the seed germination stage, compared to 0.08 under the 1000 mm treatment. Increased water availability resulted in greater plant growth and reproductive output, in terms of both number of seeds per individual and reproductive value. In field studies, aerial seed banks of small plant size-classes (from 1 to 32 cm(3)) were depleted within 3-to-7 years. For the large size-classes, > 32 cm(3), only a portion (79.7-44.4%) of the seeds produced were dispersed during the observational experiment (the rest remaining within the tumbleweed ball, available for subsequent germination). The projected seed bank life-time for populations raised under different water treatments increased more than fivefold (from 3 to 17 years) for the 100 mm compared to the 1000 mm rainfall treatments. Local persistence of populations was thus likely to be reduced by water stress. Populations of A. hierochuntica characterized by weak plant growth and a preponderance of small size-classes will be more vulnerable to extinction due to their low reproductive output and reduced aerial seed bank reserve.

Designing Strategies and Systems to Identify, Preserve and Promote Underutilized Indigenous Crop Species	II INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON UNDERUTILIZED PLANT SPECIES: CROPS FOR THE FUTURE - BEYOND FOOD SECURITY	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Symposium on Underutilized Plant Species - Crops for the Future - Beyond Food Security	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2011	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)				Informal seed systems, such as farmer-to-farmer exchanges and farmer self-saved seed, are critical components of resource poor farming systems. This local seed production and distribution facilitates maintenance of crop bio-diversity by preserving in situ locally adapted cultivars and by broadening the genetic base of production with multiple cultivars adapted to specific production systems and micro-climates. They also enhance seed and food security during periods of instability or natural disaster, including changing environmental conditions. A rich diversity of underutilized crop species function within these informal seed systems in Southeast Asia, yet current efforts to conserve, improve, and disseminate indigenous species are failing. A strategy was developed and tested linking an innovative seed bank, local farmers and non-commercial seed traders, with developing markets, supported by accessible information made available through a local outreach network. Impacts included identification of key seed traders and farmers functioning within targeted regions of high species diversity, inventories of important indigenous crop species, documentation of specific indigenous knowledge surrounding the culture of key crops, and expanded exchange and distribution of locally adapted underutilized species. This project paves the way for potential longer term benefits including formation of seed bank-farmer linkages that allow non-commercial seed producers to access new cultivars, hybrids and high-value seed resources not available from traditional sources, development of value chains around key indigenous species, and regional distribution of important seed resources to less developed neighbor nations.

Using native annual plants to restore post-fire habitats in western North America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Increasing fire frequencies and uncharacteristic severe fires have created a need for improved restoration methods across rangelands in western North America. Traditional restoration seed mixtures of native perennial mid- to late-seral plant species may not be suitable for intensely burned sites that have been returned to an early-seral condition. Under such conditions, native annual plant species are likely to be more successful at becoming established and competing with exotic annual plant species, such as Bromus tectorum L., for resources. We used a field study in Colorado and Idaho, USA, to test the hypothesis that native annual plant species are better suited to post-fire restoration efforts compared with perennial plant species that are commonly used in traditional seed mixtures. Replicated test plots at three post-fire sites were assigned one of four treatments: (1) native annual seed mixture, (2) standard perennial seed mixture, (3) combination of annual and perennial and (4) an unseeded control. Seeding native annuals with perennials resulted in a slight reduction in exotic plant cover, suggesting that it is potentially beneficial to include native annual plant species in restoration seed mixtures.

We allow the seeds in the bank to be of any age, producing a system of infinitely many equations. We assume that juvenile plants mature into adults at a particular age. The production of new seeds can be density-dependent and so the function describing this growth is allowed to be nonmonotone. The functions describing the seed bank and juvenile plants are linear. We show that when the system has a positive equilibrium, there is a spreading speed that can be computed using model parameters and that this spreading speed can be characterized as the slowest speed of a class of traveling wave solutions. The spreading speed results are obtained through linearization and comparison to an analogous finite system, while the existence of traveling wave solutions is shown by using an asymptotic fixed point theorem. We conduct numerical simulations of a truncated version of this model. These simulations show that both the perennial term and the seed bank can have a stabilizing effect on the population. On the other hand, traveling wave solutions may exhibit different patterns of fluctuations including periodic oscillations and chaotic tails.																	0036-1399						2013	73	4					1676	1702		10.1137/120880501							WOS:000323887600017						
J	Kalesnik, F; Sirolli, H; Collantes, M				Kalesnik, Fabio; Sirolli, Horacio; Collantes, Marta			Seed bank composition in a secondary forest in the Lower Delta of the Parana River (Argentina)	ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA												The native forests once occupying the coastal levees of the Lower Delta islands of the Parana River (in Argentina) have been replaced by commercial forests. Many of those forests have been abandoned, resulting in secondary forest formation that is subject to numerous invasive exotic species. A priori observations suggest that successional trends do not lead to recovery of the original forest. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of invasive exotic species in these environments and the likelihood of recovery of the original forest cover. Therefore, we examined the composition of the seed bank and of the standing vegetation, as well as the population structure of tree species. Secondary forests are described as being in an intermediate successional stage, with few exotic species (mainly trees) but with a high abundance of standing vegetation and seed banks. These exotic species will likely continue to successfully predominate in different forest strata over the next stages. Because of the low density of native tree species, it is difficult to predict their future persistence. In conclusion, ecological restoration strategies will be needed in order to increase native tree species richness and biodiversity of the forests in the Lower Delta of the Parana River.																	0102-3306	1677-941X				JAN-MAR	2013	27	1					40	49		10.1590/S0102-33062013000100006							WOS:000322536000006

SEED AND SEEDLING ECOPHYSIOLOGY OF NEOTROPICAL MELASTOMATACEAE: IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF SAVANNAS AND RAINFORESTS	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												We review the patterns of fruit maturation, dispersal, germination, seed bank formation, and seedling establishment of the Melastomataceae in two Neotropical biodiversity hotspots, the Brazilian cerrado and the Atlantic rainforest. Studies on seed biology of the Melastomataceae are relevant because this family is ubiquitous, species-rich, and dominant in these two hotspots, and its increased relative importance is anticipated under the current scenario of habitat loss and forest fragmentation. The life-history traits of this pioneer-dominated family are quite variable in terms of fruiting phonology and seedling establishment, but less so for dispersal ecology and seed germination. Our knowledge of this seed biology is used to infer on the predicted impacts of global change and forest fragmentation for tropical forest and cerrado melastomes. Species in the Melastomataceae may be key in restoration ecology, and we discuss how seed- and seedling-based restoration techniques can assist ecosystem recovery.

Timing of fire relative to seed development may enable non-serotinous species to recolonize from the aerial seed banks of fire-killed trees	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The existence of non-serotinous, non-sprouting species in fire regimes where serotiny confers an adaptive advantage is puzzling, particularly when these species recruit poorly from soil seed banks or from burn edges. In this paper, white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) was used to show how the timing of fire relative to seed development may permit non-serotinous species to recolonize burned areas from the aerial seed banks of fire-killed trees. To estimate survival of seeds within closed cones during crown fires, cone heating was simulated using a one-dimensional conduction model implemented in a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics fire behavior model. To quantify the area burned when germinable seed would be contained within closed cones during a mast year, empirical fire occurrence and seed development (germinability and cone opening) data were compared for multiple locations across the white spruce range. Approximately 12% of cones contained viable seed following crown fire simulations (0.072 ms(-1) mean spread rate; 9147 kWm(-1) mean intensity), and roughly half of the historical area burned resulted from fires that occurred when closed cones would contain germinable seed. Together, these results suggest that non-serotinous species may recolonize burned areas from in situ aerial seed banks, and that this may be an important cause of their existence in fire regimes to which they otherwise seem poorly suited.

Ibrahim			THE SOIL SEED BANK PATTERN IN HIGHLAND RANGELANDS OF EASTERN ANATOLIAN REGION OF TURKEY UNDER DIFFERENT GRAZING SYSTEMS	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FIELD CROPS												Soil seed bank dynamics are crucially important for natural recovery of degraded ecosystems. The study was conducted on the natural rangelands applied different grazing system at Kargapazari Mountain in Erzurum, Turkey and was aimed to explain the role of applied different grazing system and soil properties on the abundance and spatial distribution of plant species in the seed bank. Total 73 taxa were recorded, 22 of them were annual species on the experimental area. The species number in the seed bank changed between 26 and 36 among the sites. The winter grazing system (WGS) sites had the highest species richness while spring grazing system (SGS) sites had the lower species richness. The highest perennial grasses seedlings were recorded for spring-autumn grazing system (SAGS) and season-long grazing system (SLGS) sites than the others. Similar differences were also recorded for the other functional groups and common species among the range sites. The differences in spatial distribution of plant species in the seed banks were mainly addressed geomorphological heterogeneity rather than grazing system effect while the differences in seed bank composition among range sites were mainly addressed in the difference of grazing season and pressure originated from grazing system practices. The effects of grazing system practices and soil properties on seed bank composition were clearly explained with Redundancy Analysis (RDA). However, there were great differences in seed bank composition among the range sites and virtually all sites have enough seed stock for natural recovery but current grazing system practices should be improved in favour of increasing seed scattering of desired plants in the experimental area and similar steppe rangelands.

In each habitat from 1850 to 2400 m, 20 quadrats were established along four transects, and the above-ground vegetation and the germinable seed banks were determined. Results show that the similarity between seed bank and vegetation was lowest in the ecotone located at intermediate altitudes. Together with the contrasting highest density and species diversity of seeds at these altitudes, the ecotonal role of this habitat was confirmed. We found evidence that lower altitudes could act as storage for seeds of some species growing at higher altitudes; the role of the ecotone was more prominent as a reserve for the meadow plant seeds than the role of the forest as a reserve for seeds of the meadow and ecotone habitats. Soil seed banks, particularly from the ecotone, can be used for restoring vegetation in some degraded sites. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

A SPATIAL PATTERN ANALYSIS OF LANDSCAPE CHANGES BETWEEN 1956-1999 OF PINUS HALEPENSIS MILLER PLANTATIONS IN MONTES DE MALAGA STATE PARK (ANDALUSIA, SPAIN)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Changes in forest diversity and the conversion of coniferous plantations into more natural woodlands are of the especial interest in the Mediterranean. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in land use patterns and vegetation cover from 1956 to 1999 in Pinus halepensis Miller plantations in Montes of Malaga State Park (southern Spain). At a landscape level, a FRAGSTAT analysis was performed using aerial photograph series. At the community level, a total of 47 sample plots were analyzed. Field measurements indicate the presence of a total of 70 species in the different vegetation types sampled. Diversity indices showed a higher species richness for Aleppo pine plantations (H = 1.54 +/- 0.2; D = 3.88 +/- 0.6), while Holm oak forests (H = 1.37 +/- 0.1; D = 3.35 +/- 0.6) and agricultural land (H = 1.33 +/- 0.01; D = 2.80 +/- 0.03) had lower values. FRAGSTATS analyses at landscape and class levels indicated increases in patch richness, number of patches, and percent of landscape mainly for pine plantations, Holm oak forests and shrub. Replacement of agricultural uses by conifer plantations led to a homogenization of landscape structure. This shift has modified the landscape by recovering a natural indigenous tree species, and improving the regeneration of Holm oak species, which are stabilizing and protecting the future establishment of native forests in this area. Our findings suggest that pine plantations could favour woody species diversity by increasing individual abundance and species richness in contrast to the situation in non forested agricultural land.

Individual variability and environmental conditions: effects on zooplankton cohort dynamics	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We use an individual-based cohort model of the planktonic calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa to examine how variability among individuals in bioenergetic traits affects cohort dynamics. The model follows a cohort of individual zooplankton through the hourly processes of feeding and energy distribution among growth, development, and reproduction, under high and low rates of size-dependent mortality. The degree of variability in traits among individuals was quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV). In our first simulation experiment (Expt 1), population growth rate (lambda) increased with increasing variability among individuals (increasing CV) when overall mortality was high; egg production increased with CV under high and low mortality rates, and survival was unaffected by the degree of trait variability. Expt 2 tested the effect of genetic makeup on cohort dynamics; when mortality rate was high, increasing CV resulted in individuals with correlated traits having higher egg production and lambda than individuals with randomly assigned traits. Expt 3 tested how environmental conditions altered the effect of CV on survival, egg production, and lambda. Population growth rate increased with increasing CV under high mortality rate and suboptimal conditions. Our analyses demonstrate how small differences in the values of individual-level traits can influence growth and reproduction which can in turn translate into ecologically important effects on cohort dynamics. The effect of increased variability among individuals on cohort dynamics was particularly important when environmental conditions were poor, when the mortality rate was high, and under certain types of size-dependent mortality. These results may have important implications for understanding the dynamics of populations experiencing stress.

In the framework of an integrated conservation programme of cuprophytes (plants that tolerate a soil with a high level of copper) in Katanga (D.R.Congo), this study aims at: (1) providing new data on species whose germination has never been studied so far; (2) gaining new insight into the storage behaviour of these species; (3) discussing implications for ex situ conservation of these highly threatened species. Methods - Germination tests were conducted on fresh seeds of nineteen species. These tests were repeated after 6, 12 and 24 months of storage in dry-cold conditions. Key results - Most species kept or increased their germination capacity after 2 years storage in dry-cold conditions. Nine species showed a slight decrease in their viability (from 100% to > 80%) after 2 years storage in dry-cold conditions. The present study gives evidence that at least six of the 19 studied species are desiccation-tolerant (orthodox). Among these, two are strict endemics, Haumaniastrum robertii and Faroa malaissei, and two are broad endemics, Diplolophium marthozianum and Gladiolus robiliartianus. This means that ex situ seed banking of these species could form a useful part of a more comprehensive conservation strategy. Only two species have been identified as desiccation-sensitive (recalcitrant), i.e. inappropriate for conservation in standard seed bank conditions. An orthodox behaviour has not been ruled out for the other species tested, but their response was less clear and needs further investigation.

Although the effect of fencing and grazing on vegetation composition is widely known, information on species composition, seed density and spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks in sandy grasslands under fencing and grazing is still lacking. We measured the species composition and seed density of soil seed banks in fenced grassland, grazed grassland and grazed shrubby grassland in Horqin Sand Land, Northern China. By applying the geostatistical methods, we assessed how fencing and grazing affected spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks in sandy grasslands. Total seed density and species richness in soil seed banks were lower in fenced grassland than in either grazed grassland or grazed shrubby grassland. Seed density and species richness of annual species in soil seed banks were also lower in fenced grassland than in either grazed grassland or grazed shrubby grassland, while those of perennial species showed a reverse trend. The analysis of spatial autocorrelation ranges, fractal dimensions and distribution pattern maps from geostatistical methods showed that spatial heterogeneity of seed density and species richness in soil seed banks were also lower in fenced grassland than in either grazed grassland or grazed shrubby grassland. Continuous fencing increases the seed density and species richness of perennial species in soil seed banks, as well as results in a decrease in spatial heterogeneity of seed density and species richness in soil seed banks. So, continuous fencing should be considered to restore the degraded sandy grasslands in management of semiarid grassland ecosystems.

The information provided in this work is relevant both in scientific and technical terms, contributing to the design of effective strategies for the control of Datura ferox (Solanaceae). The aims of this work were to: (a) evaluate the reproductive strategies of D. ferox relative to fruit and seed production, (b) analyze the relationship between reproductive traits and persistence of these populations in agro-ecosystems of central Argentina, and (c) discuss different strategies to control crop weeds based on the knowledge of their reproductive ecology. D. ferox presented a great reproductive capacity that would not be constrained by limited pollen availability or pollinators in the populations studied. Flowers were pollinated by sphingids, coleopterans and Apis mellifera. The populations were self-compatible and autogamous; however, they exhibited higher fruiting percentages by natural pollination. Fruits produced by autogamy and geitonogamy had larger size and lower seed number and mass than those derived from natural pollination and xenogamy. D. ferox has combinations of traits (i.e., two flowering peaks, interactions with different pollinators, seed production after autogamy or xenogamy) that provide ecological advantages for establishment and survival processes in agro-ecosystems, hindering the species' control. Control strategies might be improved if D. ferox abundance would be reduced before flowering to avoid fruit and seed production. This management strategy should be consistent over several years because the soil seed bank would allow population recovery in subsequent years. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Moreover, they play a pretty important role in the process of species occurrence, species regeneration, vegetation succession and recoveration. Therefore, it is an essentially theoretical and practical significance for human beings to learn riparian zone vegetation formation, succession, river and riparian protection and utilization by researching the riparian seed bank. Based on the water depth gradient being important in determining distinct habitat types, Applying the seedling-emergence method under waterlogged and submerged treatment, the studies focusing on impact of three water level fluctuation on riparian seed bank along the riparian zone in JingJiang river are performed to investingate the distribution of seed bank. It is intended to clarify how changes the water level fluctuations make the distributing patterns of seed bank along the riparian zone. The results showed that submerged conditions were generally not suitable for the seed germination, comparing a waterlogged treatment with a submerged treatment. From the sediment samples 25 species emerged under two treatments. A total of 18 species were recorded in the seed bank of S site (low water level site), 18 in the seed bank of D site (middle water level site), and 7 in the seed bank of C site (high water level site). The total number of species germinating under waterlogged conditions was significantly higher than under submerged conditions, while they varied significantly from site to site. Germinated seedling density was 1,198, 621 and 478 seedlings m-2 in S site, D site, and C site, respectively. Frequency of distribution and densities of the dominant species, however, varied significantly from site to site. Biennial and perennial species were significantly more in the low water level S site, while the annual species were found predominately in the high water level C site. Different species in the riparian seed bank were found to contribute to a "annual species-biennial species-perennial species" distribution pattern along the water level fluctuations, thus revealing marked zonal patterns in species distributions in the riparian seed bank.																			978-0-7695-4923-1; 978-1-4673-4893-5				2013							840	845		10.1109/ISDEA.2012.199							WOS:000319283600192

The Margalef's richness indexes (DMA), Shannon-Wiener's diversity index (Hp), Pielou's evenness (Jsw), Simpson Index (C), Importance Value Index (IVtr), Vegetation coverage and soil seed bank were used to assess the vegetation restoration capability of the expressway 25, Lu-Su section in China. Seventy-four quadrats ranged from 1 m X 1 m to 20 m X 20 m were studied and the analytical results indicated that Digitaria sanguinalis, Setariaviridis and Gramineae are the dominant species in the expressway slopes. Texture is the most important factor influencing the a diversity and vegetation coverage. Cinnamon soil is more suitable for the restoration compared with slopes the other kind of texture. The land use type and alien species invasion along the expressway are also vital important for the natural restoration. The soil seed bank in filling slope is more abundant than that of excavation slope. The natural restoration of vegetation along the expressway varies according to the site types and land use and most of the slopes have strong recovery ability.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-564-5				2013	253-255		1-3				1075	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.253-255.1075							WOS:000319231600210

The study was aimed to determine the effects of various soil tillage methods: deep ploughing (20-25 cm), shallow ploughing (10-12 cm), shallow ploughless tillage (8-10 cm) and soil fertility improvement measures (plant residues, plant residues + straw, green manure 1st cut + straw, green manure 2nd cut + straw, farmyard manure 40 t ha(-1) + straw) on the soil weed seed bank and weed incidence in a cereal-grass crop rotation. The soil of the experimental site is Dystric-Epihypogleyic Albeluvisol (ABg-p-w-dy) with a texture of sandy loam. In all experimental years, primary soil tillage had a significant influence on weed incidence in the crops of the rotation and on soil weed seed bank. The greatest amount of weeds, both in numbers and dry mass, in the crops of winter triticale and spring rape was determined in the shallow ploughless tillage treatment, in the crops of spring barley in the shallow ploughing treatment, and in the sward of red clover in deep and shallow ploughing treatments. All soil fertility improvement measures and their interaction with soil tillage methods did not have any substantial influence on the weed incidence in the rotation crops. The soil weed seed bank was 1.5 and 2.2 times greater in the shallow ploughing and shallow ploughless tillage treatments, compared with the conventional tillage treatment (deep ploughing). The influence of soil tillage methods manifested itself not only directly, but also through its interaction with soil fertility improvement measures. Regardless of the chosen soil fertility improvement measure, in all the treatments of shallow ploughless tillage, the soil weed seed bank was significantly greater, compared with the conventional soil tillage treatments. In the shallow ploughing and shallow ploughless tillage treatments there were found 25.5% and 41.5% more weed seed species in the soil, compared with the conventional tillage treatment. The seeds of Chenopodium album L., Persicaria lapathifolia L., Fallopia convolvulus L. and Viola arvensis Murray were found in all tillage treatments. The distribution of F convolvulus L., P lapathifolia L. seeds was significantly influenced by soil tillage only, that of V.. arvensis Murray by soil tillage and its interaction with soil fertility improvement measures, and that of Ch. album L. by soil fertility improvement measures only.																	1392-3196						2013	100	1					25	32		10.13080/z-a.2013.100.004							WOS:000319720000004

A controlled burning was performed on the plots, following the wind-driven fire technique, according to the slope orientation. The objective was to characterize the soil seed of the tree community before and after fire, in order to verify the effects of such discontinuance on both population density and floristic composition. In the centre of each plot, one 40 x 25 cm soil sampling was collected, from the leaf litter downward 5cm deep. One day after the soil sampling the plots underwent controlled burning. New soil samplings were done immediately after burning, following the previous methodology. It was counted 528 and 429 seedlings emerging from the soil seed bank before and after the fire, respectively. Such plants were of 23 species and 14 botanical families; from which Melastomataceae; Asteraceae and Urticaceae stood out. There was no meaningful reduction in the species richness or in the density of individuals of the populations between both samplings. The floristic similarity was 34% Miconia cinnamomifolia and Leandra purpurascens were the most frequent/abundant species. Pioneer species stood out making up 44 and 40 % of the species found in the area before and after fire, respectively.																	0103-9954	1980-5098				JAN-MAR	2013	23	1					19	28									WOS:000318845800002

Earnings and costs data of environmental recovery activities were obtained for the areas that belonged to the Companhia Geral de Minas CGM, on properties sited in the city of Pocos de Caldas, MG The amount of costs of these activities was used to compare the recovery methods by updating them monetarily to a reference date, in other words, the present moment. It is concluded that the difference between the present value of cbsts for simple restoration and rehabilitation activities are less than 1% and that between the complete restoration and rehabilitation is about 15.12%, suggesting that the choice of the methods to be used must be based on the ecological earnings proportional to each of them. The methodology of environmental restoration of the mining areas emphasizes the ecological variables in the process of establishment of the community, to the detriment of complex ecological aspects, which show difficulties in measuring the actual moment of the development of the ecosystem considered.

J	Araki, S; Kunii, H				Araki, Satoru; Kunii, Hidenobu			Conditions for seedling establishment and probable function of seed in the clonal sedge Carex rugulosa Kuk. in riverside marshes	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Carex rugulosa Kuk. forms large meadows in moist zones along estuarine riversides. These meadows are usually maintained by rhizomatous ramet production (clonal growth), and the appearance of seedlings is uncommon. We studied the conditions required for seedling establishment. In areas in which clonal ramets were dense (906-1050/m(2)), and the relative light intensity at ground level was low (0.8-3.8%), seed germination was entirely suppressed. In contrast, many seedlings (288-513/m(2)) were observed in areas in which clonal ramets had been considerably reduced (13-269/m(2)) by continuous inundation in the previous year. In these areas, the relative light intensity had increased (20.5-79.3%). It was inferred that seeds resisted the prolonged inundation that killed the ramets, and that germination was induced under these open conditions. These results suggest that the main functions of sexual reproduction in C. rugulosa are recovery after severe damage to vegetation using seeds from the seed bank and the dispersal of seeds to areas without dense vegetation. Most seedlings died when the marshy meadow was temporarily inundated by heavy rain. However, transplanted seedlings survived better at artificially elevated sites that were not submerged. This shows that inundation during the seedling stage impedes seedling survival. Therefore, seeds can contribute to recovery after ramet decline or colonization to open area when (i) the rainfall is not heavy to cause seedling submergence or (ii) seeds are dispersed to higher area which is not inundated.																	0913-557X					JAN	2013	28	1					12	20		10.1111/j.1442-1984.2011.00355.x							WOS:000318009400003						
J	Fry, D; Stephens, S				Fry, Danny; Stephens, Scott			Seed Viability and Female Cone Characteristics of Mature Knobcone Pine Trees	WESTERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY												As humans continue to alter ecosystems through land-use activities, revegetation projects will be one important way to restore or maintain impacted plant communities. Certain species, such as knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata Lemmon), have been used in some revegetation projects because of their preferable traits. Information on seed production and viability is critical to planning effective projects but is often limited for noncommercial conifer species. Here, we report on cone characteristics, seed quality, and germination rate from female cones collected in mature (63-71 years old) knobcone pine forests, northern Coast Range, California. Cones were divided into two age groups: brown (1-2 years old) and gray (3+ years old). Gray cones were longer and had more unfilled seeds (40%) compared to the brown cones (23%). The number of seeds per cone depended on the extraction method, ranging from 93 to 95 seeds for brown cones and 61 to 96 seeds for gray cones. Germination rate for all seeds combined was approximately 80%. Although there are reports of old, serotinous knobcone pine cones containing viable seeds, it is unclear whether mature stands are important seed collection sources. Stands sampled in this work are still producing a viable canopy seed bank. As restoration projects trend toward using native species, information on the potential use of available seed bank and its viability is critical for planning.																	0885-6095					JAN	2013	28	1					46	48		10.5849/wjaf.11-046							WOS:000317958300007

Disturbance intensity, timing and history interact to affect pasture weed invasion	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Past disturbance events shape future community trajectories if their ecological legacies interact with contemporary disturbance regimes to affect recruitment and reproduction. In pastures, large-scale disturbance events can become undetectable in aboveground community components but persist as augmented weed seedbanks, suggesting disturbance history may be a predictor of weed invasion magnitude following subsequent disturbance. Using a randomized block factorial design, we investigated how soil disturbance intensity, timing and history interact to affect weed recruitment, diversity and reproduction by implementing a range of disturbance intensities in April and June 2004 in pastures of differing disturbance history. Response variables were followed for two years. Disturbance timing interacted with disturbance intensity and history to affect recruitment, with some June treatment combinations having >= 48% higher weed abundance than those in April. Relative to undisturbed controls, low to intermediate disturbance intensity facilitated recruitment by >= 117% but high intensity disturbance had highest recruitment, particularly in previously disturbed pastures (>= 543% increase). In both years, weed species richness was highest in intense disturbances in previously disturbed pastures. Importantly, weed reproduction was nearly one order of magnitude higher in intense disturbance patches, especially in previously disturbed pastures, and increased through time by >= 243%. These findings indicate weed recruitment, diversity and reproductive output are seed- and microsite-limited, and that intense soil disturbance may result in high long-term weed abundance. Although moderate disturbance facilitated recruitment, reproduction here was low, suggesting modest disturbance will not appreciably increase weed abundance. The most common species were Taraxacum officinale and Poa pratensis, both of which can benefit forage-livestock production, but most establishing species were of low palatability. We recommend grassland managers explicitly integrate disturbance history into dynamic management planning, consider augmenting seedbanks with 'desirable' weed species to help communities recover following inevitable disturbance events and do not rely exclusively on aboveground characters to evaluate their system's vulnerability to undesirable plant establishment and persistence.																	1439-1791	1618-0089					2013	14	1					44	53		10.1016/j.baae.2012.10.006							WOS:000317321300006						
J	Burrows, ND				Burrows, Neil D.			Fire dependency of a rock-outcrop plant Calothamnus rupestris (Myrtaceae) and implications for managing fire in south-western Australian forests	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Granite outcrops embedded in south-western Australian forests provide habitat for unique biotic assemblages and refugia for fire-sensitive taxa. Discontinuous vegetation and natural barriers to fire spread enable outcrops to function as fire refugia, provided fires in the surrounding forest are not of high intensity. In Summer 2003, lightning started a fire in jarrah forest that had not been burnt for almost 20 years. The high-intensity fire burned the vegetation on Mount Cooke, a large granite outcrop, providing an opportunity to study the response of Calothamnus rupestris Schauer, a fire-sensitive serotinous plant. The population was killed by the fire, but readily regenerated from seed stored in woody capsules. The post-fire population reached maturity after similar to 7.5 years, whereas the seed bank is unlikely to recover to the pre-fire level until similar to 14 years. The likelihood of intense forest wildfires affecting outcrop communities can be reduced by frequent low-intensity prescribed burning in the surrounding forests to reduce fuel hazard and quantity. Low-intensity forest fires are unlikely to be lethal to sensitive granite-outcrop communities.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2013	61	2					81	88		10.1071/BT12240							WOS:000317057300001

This can drive woodlands across a biotic threshold, where natural regeneration cannot occur. Without management intervention, these woodlands will suffer local extinction. Using a Mediterranean-type, degraded woodland as a case study, we undertook field trials over 3 years, with the aim of increasing revegetation success by (1) introducing propagules of key canopy species to overcome this biotic threshold and (2) applying commonly used revegetation treatments (abiotic treatments such as the addition of nutrient and water resources, two types of tree guards, and combinations of these). We found that (1) control plants had low establishment success, confirming the crossing of a biotic threshold and the practical irreversibility of the degraded state without intervention, (2) plant establishment was often significantly higher for treated than for control seedlings and (3) supplementation of nutrient and water resources seems to be critical in terms of increasing early seedling establishment for some species. We suggest that in declining woodlands that have crossed biotic thresholds, merely adding propagules does not ensure successful revegetation. The present study has practical implications for restoration activities in degraded MTE communities where biotic thresholds may have already been crossed.

Experiments were conducted during 2007 and 2008 in central Uruguay to follow the pattern of seed softening in 35 annual and perennial forage legumes, including three native species of Uruguay and five commercial cultivars. Newly ripened seeds of each plant material were placed in mesh packets on the soil surface in mid-summer. Samples were recovered monthly for germination tests and the proportion of residual hard seeds determined. The native species Adesmia bicolor (Poir.) DC., Adesmia securigerifolia Herter, and Ornithopus micranthus (Benth.) Arechav., together with Ornithopus pinnatus (Mill.) Druce cv. INIA Molles behaved similarly. They showed high levels of initial hard seed from 78% in A. bicolor to 99% in A. securigerifolia and O. pinnatus cv. INIA Molles in 2007; displayed pulses of seed softening, particularly in autumn, and retained moderate levels of residual hard seed for the development of a soil seed bank ranging from 15% in A. bicolor to 49% in O. micranthus. These appear to be desirable characteristics for persistence of forage legumes in subtropical grasslands, both for annual and perennial species. Trifolium repens L. and Lotus corniculatus L. produced few hard seeds, only 2% and 13% respectively were hard after 1-mo in the field and were completely soft by July placing extra reliance on their vegetative propagation for persistence. Materials of L. arenarius Brot. showed pronounced late autumn softening, while materials of L. ornithopodioides L. showed extremely high levels of hardseededness (between 96% and 100%) and no softening during the evaluation period, apart from two materials that were completely soft seeded. Mediterranean forage legumes should be properly evaluated in temperate and subtropical regions as their seed softening behavior is likely to be substantially modified in these summer moist environments.

Effects of Growth Regulator Herbicide on Downy Brome (Bromus tectorum) Seed Production	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Previous research showed growth regulator herbicides, such as picloram and aminopyralid, have a sterilizing effect on Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus Thunb.) that can reduce this invasive annual grass's seed production nearly 100%. This suggests growth regulators might be used to control invasive annual grasses by depleting their short-lived seed banks. The goal of this study was to extend the previous Japanese brome research to downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), the most damaging invasive annual grass of U.S. grasslands. In a greenhouse, we found picloram did not greatly influence downy brome seed production, while point estimates suggest aminopyralid reduced seed production 55 to 80%. If not for a highly abnormal retillering response that we somewhat doubt would occur in the field, point estimates suggest aminopyralid would have reduced downy brome seed production approximately 90% when applied at the heading stage and approximately 98% when applied at three earlier growth stages. Our greenhouse study should encourage field studies designed to further explore the potential for using growth regulators to control downy brome and other invasive annual grasses.																	1939-7291					JAN-MAR	2013	6	1					60	64		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00033.1							WOS:000316840300006

INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Downy brome (cheatgrass) is a highly successful, exotic, winter annual invader in semi-arid western North America, forming near-monocultures across many landscapes. A frequent but poorly understood phenomenon in these heavily invaded areas is periodic 'die-off' or complete stand failure. The fungal pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda is abundant in cheatgrass seed banks and causes high mortality. To determine whether this pathogen could be responsible for stand failure, we quantified late spring seed banks in die-off areas and adjacent cheatgrass stands at nine sites. Seed bank analysis showed that this pathogen was not a die-off causal agent at those sites. We determined that seed bank sampling and litter data could be used to estimate time since die-off. Seed bank patterns in our recent die-offs indicated that the die-off causal agent does not significantly impact seeds in the persistent seed bank.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JAN-MAR	2013	6	1					105	111		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00043.1							WOS:000316840300011

Influence of Post-Harvest Management of Rice Crop on Red Rice Seed Bank	PLANTA DANINHA												The incorporation of straw after rice harvest makes rice seed reduction difficult. On the other hand, it favors the decomposition of straw, enabling the preparation of the area in advance, thus allowing the preparation of the recommended planting period. The objective of this work was to assess the interference of different management techniques after harvest in rice-cultivated areas in reducing the viability of red rice seeds. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, in split-plots in time, with four replications. The treatments were arranged in a factorial design (7x6), consisting of factor A: [a] permanent water blade, [2] straw incorporation with dry soil tillage after rice harvest, [3] incorporation of straw with flooded soil after harvest, [4] incorporation of dry soil only in July, [5] incorporation of straw with flooded soil after harvest and area disking in July with dry soil, [6] incorporation of straw in dry soil immediately after harvest and area disking only in July with dry soil and [7] without incorporation. Factor B was composed of different timings of seed bank sampling for the presence of red rice. Sampling was initiated at harvest, occurring every thirty days until October. The greatest effect on seed bank reduction was verified when using implements that superficially incorporated the straw, such as the rolling knife, which acts on dormancy breaking, non-viability and stimulation of red rice germination.

This study reports the reproductive biology and early establishment of Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii, describing its invasive properties in a protected natural area of the Brazilian coastal sandy plains. We evaluated the seed germination and rain, longevity of seed viability and the initial dynamics of the seedlings of Pinus elliottii var elliottii through field and laboratory experiments. We recorded a continuous seed rain of about 204.0 viable seeds m(-2) per year, with a 90 % germination rate. The seeds exhibited a low longevity of viability in the soil and a dense, permanent seedling bank that may explain the high levels of pine invasion. The environmental impact caused by the pine's biological invasion suggests the recommendation for its immediate eradication, together with a restoration plan to restitute the native biodiversity gradually.

Plant species richness and abundance	RANGELAND JOURNAL												The occurrence of interstitial species in Astrebla grasslands in Australia are influenced by grazing and seasonal rainfall but the interactions of these two influences are complex. This paper describes three studies aimed at determining and explaining the changes in plant species richness and abundance of the interstitial species in a long-term sheep utilisation experiment in an Astrebla grassland in northern Queensland. In the first study, increasing utilisation increased the frequency of Dactyloctenium radulans (Button grass) and Brachyachne convergens (Downs couch) and reduced that of Streptoglossa adscendens (Mint bush). In the second study, seasonal rainfall variation between 1984 and 2009 resulted in large annual differences in the size of the seed banks of many species, but increasing utilisation consistently reduced the seed bank of species such as Astrebla spp. and S. adscendens and increased that of species such as B. convergens, D. radulans, Amaranthus mitchellii (Boggabri) and Boerhavia sp. (Tar vine). In the third study, the highest species richness occurred at the lightest utilisation because of the presence of a range of palatable forbs, especially legumes. Species richness was reduced as utilisation increased. Species richness in the grazing exclosure was low and similar to that at the heaviest utilisation where there was a reduction in the presence of palatable forb species. The pattern of highest species richness at the lightest grazing treatment was maintained across three sampling times, even with different amounts of seasonal rainfall, but there was a large yearly variation in both the density and frequency of many species. It was concluded that the maintenance of highest species richness at the lightest utilisation was not aligned with other data from this grazing experiment which indicated that the maximum sustainable wool production occurred at moderate utilisation.

Rangeland vegetation responses to traditional enclosure management in eastern Ethiopia	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Enclosures are widely used by pastoralists in East Africa. However, the response of herbaceous and woody vegetation to enclosures seasonally grazed by livestock remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effectiveness of traditional enclosures in improving herbaceous and woody vegetation in the Somali Regional State of eastern Ethiopia. Vegetation composition (species composition, diversity and richness) and structure (herbage mass, density and canopy cover) were measured inside and outside a set of enclosures. The enclosures contained higher numbers of desirable species than the adjacent open-access grazing areas. Woody species richness was higher in the open-access grazing areas than in the enclosures, which is attributed to the manual removal of most of the undesirable shrubs and trees in the enclosures by pastoralists. Herbage mass was 2642 and 843 kg of dry matter ha(-1) in the enclosures and open-access communal grazing areas, respectively. Herbaceous species diversity was higher in the enclosures than in the open-access communal grazing areas (Shannon-Wiener index: 1.8 v. 1.4, respectively). The enclosures were richer in herb species than the open-access grazing areas (13.5 v. 6.8, respectively), but values for woody species were not significantly different. Overall, we found that establishment of enclosures and the short-term protection from grazing they allow is an option for realising positive vegetation changes that support the local pastoral economy in the semiarid rangelands of eastern Ethiopia.

Reinstating soil microbial diversity in agroecosystems: The need of the hour for sustainability and health	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												It has been reported that collapse of soil microbial diversity, mainly due chemical inputs leads to degradation of conventional agroecosystems. Indirect methods related to manipulation of plant and animal components in the ecosystems have been currently practised to reinstate the microbial diversity. However, those methods are laborious and time-consuming, and hence less efficient. Also, there are limits to those management methods due to ever increasing global food demand, particularly in tropics. Therefore, we have to look for methods that sustain productivity of large-scale conventional croplands even with continuous mono-cropping. This article reports that direct soil application of developed microbial communities in biofilm mode increases microbial diversity in the agroecosystems through breaking dormancy of microbial seed bank. That contributes to strengthen biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship, which leads to agroecosystem sustainability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Facilitation of coral reef biodiversity and health by cave sponge communities	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Marine caves are understudied ecosystems that are frequently associated with coral reef communities; many are tidally influenced and may host a highly diverse sponge fauna. Although each cave represents a distinct habitat likely structured by site-specific hydrographic processes, a more complete understanding of the ecology of these communities requires comparative studies. Based on a gradient of sponge cover within 5 Bahamian caves, we conducted a natural experiment in sponge-derived nutrient enrichment of nearby patch reefs. We tested the hypothesis that water exiting the cave during low tide provides a nutrient-rich resource that facilitates the diversity and health of nearby reef communities. The percent cover and diversity of corals surrounding the openings of caves were significantly higher than in similar habitats farther removed from these communities. There was a significant correlation between percent sponge cover within the caves and nitrate concentrations in seawater flowing out of the caves, and delta N-15 stable isotope signatures indicated enrichment of the nearby reefs by sponge-derived nitrate. Zooxanthellae abundance and total protein concentration were higher in corals from reefs near cave entrances, suggesting that those corals benefited more from cave nutrients than did corals farther from cave openings. In addition to corals, percent algal cover increased near cave entrances, but these potential competitors of corals were kept in check by increased levels of herbivory relative to sites removed from cave mouths. As global environmental changes continue to impact coral reef ecosystems, diversity 'hot spots', such as these marine caves, could serve as refuges and 'seed-banks' for nearby dwindling reef habitats.																	0171-8630						2013	476						71	+		10.3354/meps10139							WOS:000315465900006

Influence of aboveground vegetation on seed bank composition and distribution in a Great Basin Desert sagebrush community	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The quantity, composition, and spatial dispersion of seed banks can greatly affect community dynamics. While seed banks of hot deserts have been studied extensively, little is known about seed banks in cold deserts, in particular the relationship between the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation. We investigated the relationship between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation and the effect of microhabitat (shrub interspace or beneath shrub) and aboveground community phase (high or low perennial bunchgrass cover) on the seed bank of a Great Basin Desert sagebrush community. The seed bank and aboveground vegetation differed in their most dominant species, resulting in moderately dissimilar species compositions as determined by Sorensen's similarity index and Bray-Curtis distance. In contrast, comparing the seed bank species composition to the aboveground vegetation structure (functional groups) using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed a correspondence between the two communities. Shrub seed densities were higher beneath shrubs. Neither microhabitat nor community phase explained variation in total seed density or species richness. Therefore, our measures of the aboveground vegetation did not influence seed density across functional groups or species richness, and the similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation varied depending on the aboveground organizational level used in comparisons.

Seed removal patterns in burned and unburned desert habitats: Implications for ecological restoration	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In desert ecosystems, selective foraging by seed consumers affects distribution and composition of soil seed banks, influencing plant population dynamics. However, the roles of consumers in burned habitats where direct seeding is used during ecological restoration to replenish depleted seed banks have not been well established. We evaluated seed removal for nine seed species over 12 months in burned and unburned shrublands in the Mojave Desert, USA. Percentage of total seed removed was highest during spring (16% of offered seed) and summer (21%). Rodents removed much of the large-seeded Coleogyne ramosissima in both burned and unburned habitats, while seed removal of this species by ants was low in burned and moderate in unburned habitats. Ants removed the greatest amount of small-seeded species (Penstemon bicolor, Encelia farinosa, and Sphaeralcea ambigua) in unburned habitat, indicating that ants can exploit different seed masses. Seed removal imposes limitations on seed availability, particularly for large-seeded species, as both rodents and ants selected seeds of C. ramosissima. Successful restoration seeding projects in arid lands may require protecting seed from granivore pressure, and seed species selection and season of seeding warrant consideration to reduce seed loss.

What can the demography of Astrophytum ornatum tell us of its endangered status?	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The Cactaceae are prominent members of national and international endangered species lists. This is true for even those that have not been studied in any significant detail, and given the need to assess these species there is still a general lack of information. Demographic studies in the Cactaceae have highlighted several threats some of which are clearly human induced (disturbance), and others that have a biological component (e.g. low survival rates of seedlings). We modelled the population dynamics of Astrophytum ornatum (the southernmost representative of Astrophytum) in one population in central Mexico, during a three year period. We constructed two size classified transition matrices and determined the growth rate (lambda), as well as the stochastic log growth rate. We simulated changes in the matrix elements that correspond to the seed bank and the seed-seedling transition as these were the most important bottlenecks to population growth. In both years, the growth rate indicates a declining population, which will face serious problems in the next 2 to 3 decades. The simulations show that the seed bank is not as important as the seed-seedling transition. Any program that aims to restore A. ornatum populations needs to enhance seedling establishment.

J	Feer, F; Ponge, JF; Jouard, S; Gomez, D				Feer, Francois; Ponge, Jean-Francois; Jouard, Sylvie; Gomez, Doris			Monkey and dung beetle activities influence soil seed bank structure	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												In Neotropical forests, dung beetles act as efficient secondary dispersers of seeds that are dispersed primarily by red howler monkeys. Here, we investigated the origins of soil seed bank variability in relation to monkey and dung beetle activity, to assess the impact of dung beetles on seed fate, and their adaptability to resource availability. This question is important to better understand the process of tree regeneration, and is especially timely in the current context of threat to primates. We characterized soil seed bank structures in sites differing in monkey frequentation, and conducted field experiments with artificial beads to monitor bead fate. We also conducted experiments on specific roller and tunneller beetle species to examine bead processing behavior and its variability among and within species. We found that seed number and diversity increased with monkey frequentation, but seed viability was optimal under moderate monkey frequentation. We showed for the first time that dung provisioning yielded higher beetle activity in sites more often visited by monkeys, which calls for further investigation to understand the mechanisms of attraction to resource and potential spatial structuration of beetle populations. Although all beetle species involved in the experiments actively excluded beads from dung reserves, selectivity was higher for small than large beetle species, and for large compared to small bead sizes. It also increased when per-capita dung resource decreased, suggesting that intraspecific competition could alter seed fate. Altogether, our results support a major role of dung beetles in soil seed bank structure and dynamics. They reveal interesting interspecific variability within the dung beetle community and a complex interplay with primary dispersal.

Spatio-temporal variation in a seed bank of a semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This study aimed to evaluate variations in the seed bank within a 3-year temporal series in order to answer the following questions: 1) Does the seed bank's species richness and seed density differ among climatic seasons and between years? 2) Are there differences in the richness and density of seed banks between the litter and mineral soil? 3) Can the seed bank's species richness and seed density be explained by characteristics such as the previous year's precipitation and soil depth (litter or mineral soil)? The samples were collected from litter and mineral soil (0-5 cm), in 210 sub-plots, during the dry and rainy seasons of each year (August 2005 through February 2008). Overall, 79 species were recorded. On average, 1168, 304 and 302 seeds.m(-2) were recorded in the seed bank during years I, II and III, respectively. This study showed that the Caatinga's seed bank is rich in herbaceous species, yet species' density and richness are low in the litter. Furthermore, about 43% of the variation in species richness and density was explained by soil depth (litter and mineral soil) and previous years' rainfall. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Ecology of Compounding Disturbances: The Effects of Prescribed Burning After Clearcutting	ECOSYSTEMS												Disturbance regimes in much of the boreal forest have shifted from wildfire to clearcutting over the last century, resulting in concerns for biodiversity. Because the boreal forest has evolved under a natural fire regimes, we hypothesized that application of prescribed burning (PB) after clearcutting would result in plant communities more similar to wildfire than clearcut only. However, because clearcutting + PB involves multiple disturbances in a short interval, we proposed an alternate hypothesis that clearcutting + PB would result in a species composition and trait assemblage that differ from those that develop after a single wildfire or clearcutting event. We determined species composition, diversity, and trait composition of 17 clearcut, 17 clearcut + PB, and 15 wildfire sites of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) dominated forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada 15-37 years after disturbance. Contrary to our primary hypothesis we found that clearcut + PB formed communities different from wildfire and clearcut, the latter two being similar. Clearcut + PB harbored more early successional species associated with seed banking, wind dispersal, deciduous foliage, and alien origin than wildfire or clearcut sites, which showed no specific trait associations. Taxonomic and trait analysis of clearcut + PB sites exhibited effects of compound disturbances, as observed after short-interval fires, supporting our alternate hypothesis. We concluded that PB after clearcutting formed plant communities significantly different from those developed either after clearcutting or wildfire alone. We attribute this community divergence to the compounding effects associated with the addition of prescribed fire to these previously disturbed forests.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				JAN	2013	16	1					170	181		10.1007/s10021-012-9607-2							WOS:000314024900013

Glyphosate effects on seed bank and vegetation composition of temperate grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Intensification of livestock production has led to the increasing input of agrochemicals, mostly herbicides, in natural and semi-natural grasslands. Glyphosate application shifts vegetation composition of grasslands of the Flooding Pampa region. Consequently, we asked two questions: (1) does the application of glyphosate affect the size, composition and diversity of the seed bank of these grasslands; and (2) to what extent does seed bank determine the vegetation composition of grassland communities affected by glyphosate application? Location Temperate-humid grassland of Flooding Pampa region, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Method We studied paddocks dominated by native grassland on a commercial livestock farm. Glyphosate is usually applied in late summer to promote winter annual grasses in native grasslands. We chose three paddocks that had never been exposed to any herbicide and three paddocks that had been treated with glyphosate in late summer during the previous 5 years. We extracted soil cores to evaluate seed bank composition from 2007 to 2009 and recorded basal cover of above-ground vegetation from 2008 to 2010 from the upper and the lower position of each paddock. Results Glyphosate treatment caused a dramatic shift in seed bank composition, so that seed densities of cool-season annual grasses increased while cool and warm-season perennial grasses, sedges, legumes and dicotyledonous herbs decreased. Richness and diversity of the seed bank were lower and dominance was higher under the glyphosate treatment. Similarity between the seed bank and floristic composition was higher in glyphosate-treated paddocks in the upper position. Strong correspondences between the seed densities of cool-season annual grasses and species composition of glyphosate-treated paddocks and between the seed densities of cool- and warm-season perennial grasses and legumes with the species composition of untreated paddocks were found. Conclusions Because the seed bank changes in response to glyphosate treatment involved the local extinction of several native perennial species, community restoration of these grasslands would depend mainly on propagule dispersal from adjacent areas. Our results raise awareness of the risks of widespread herbicide application for biodiversity conservation in the last semi-natural habitats in the Pampas grasslands.

This STR locus is defined by the polymerase chain reaction amplification primers CS1F and CS1R and is referred to as NMI01 (for National Marijuana Initiative) in our study. The population database consists of seed seizures of two categories: seed samples from labeled and unlabeled packages regarding seed bank source. Of a population database of 93 processed seeds including 12 labeled Cannabis varieties, the observed genotypes generated from single seeds exhibited between one and three peaks (potentially six alleles if in homozygous state). The total number of observed genotypes was 54 making this marker highly specific and highly individualizing even among seeds of common lineage.

The dynamics of three shrub species in a fire-prone temperate savanna: the interplay between the seed bank, seed rain and fire regime	PLANT ECOLOGY												A model was developed to assess how the seed rain and fire regime affect seed bank dynamics and seedling establishment of three native shrub species (Acanthostyles buniifolius, Baccharis pingraea and Baccharis dracunculifolia) with different regeneration strategies, in temperate South American savanna. Seed bank and seed rain were quantified for each species under different fire regimes, and their relative roles in regeneration were evaluated. All species had short-term persistent seed banks and high annual variability in seed production. A high proportion of seeds deposited in the seed rain produced seedlings after fire; few entered the soil seed bank. Fire killed a high proportion of the seeds in the soil seed bank. Seedlings derived from the seed rain had a higher probability of surviving for 2 years than seedlings emerging from the soil seed bank. In the absence of fire, establishment depended on germination both from the seed rain and the soil seed bank, whereas with annual fire, establishment was primarily dependent on germination of seeds arriving in the annual seed rain, regardless of species' regeneration strategies. These results help to explain changes in the vegetation of South American temperate savannas as a result of changes in fire regime and grazing management during the last 50 years. By revealing the crucial roles of the soil seed bank and seed rain in regeneration, this study provides vital information for the development of appropriate management practices to control populations of shrub species with different regeneration strategies in South American temperate savannas.																	1385-0237					JAN	2013	214	1					75	86		10.1007/s11258-012-0147-9							WOS:000313413200007

Angus			Seasonal timing of inundation affects riparian plant growth and flowering: implications for riparian vegetation composition	PLANT ECOLOGY												Changes to the timing of peak river flows caused by flow regulation affect riparian vegetation composition, but the mechanisms driving such vegetation changes are not well understood. We investigated experimentally the effects of timing of inundation on riparian plant growth and flowering. We collected 168 sods from 14 sites across five lowland rivers in south-eastern Australia. Plant cover and flowering within the sods were surveyed each season for a year. During this period, sods were inundated for 6 weeks in either early spring or in summer. Terrestrial plant taxa (which included most exotic species) senesced in response to inundation, regardless of its timing. In contrast, native amphibious species (particularly amphibious forbs) responded favourably to inundation in spring, but were unaffected by inundation in summer. Native and exotic emergent macrophytes responded favourably to inundation regardless of timing, and flowered frequently in both the spring- and the summer-inundation treatments. In contrast, many native annuals flowered only in the spring-inundation treatment, while more exotic grasses flowered in the summer-inundation treatment. In temperate climates, inundation in early spring followed by non-flooded conditions is likely to be important for promoting the growth of amphibious forbs and the recruitment and flowering of riparian annuals. Without inundation in spring, many terrestrial exotic weeds may flourish and set seed prior to any subsequent inundation (e.g. in summer). We contend that natural seasonal timing (i.e. winter-early spring) of flow peaks is important for the maintenance of native riverbank vegetation and reducing the extent of terrestrial exotic species within the riparian zone.

Clarifying the role of fire heat and daily temperature fluctuations as germination cues for Mediterranean Basin obligate seeders	ANNALS OF BOTANY												This study aims to determine the role that both direct effects of fire and subsequent daily temperature fluctuations play in the seed bank dynamics of obligate seeders from the Mediterranean Basin. The short yet high soil temperatures experienced due to passage of fire are conflated with the lower, but longer, temperatures experienced by daily fluctuations which occur after removing vegetation. These germination cues are able to break seed dormancy, but it is difficult to assess their specific level of influence because they occur consecutively after summer fires, just before the flush of germination in the wet season (autumn). By applying experimental fires, seed treatments were imposed that combined fire exposure/non-fire exposure with exposure to microhabitats under a gradient of disturbance (i.e. gaps opened by fire, mechanical brushing and intact vegetation). The seeds used were representative of the main families of obligate seeders (Ulex parviflorus, Cistus albidus and Rosmarinus officinalis). Specifically, an assessment was made of (1) the proportion of seeds killed by fire, (2) seedling emergence under field conditions and (3) seeds which remained ungerminated in soil. For the three species studied, the factors that most influenced seedling emergence and seeds remaining ungerminated were microhabitats with higher temperature fluctuations after fire (gaps opened by fire and brushing treatments). The direct effect of fire decreased the seedling emergence of U. parviflorus and reduced the proportion of seeds of R. officinalis remaining ungerminated. The relevance of depleting vegetation (and subsequent daily temperature fluctuation in summer) suggests that studies focusing on lower temperature thresholds for breaking seed dormancy are required. This fact also supports the hypothesis that the seeding capacity in Mediterranean Basin obligate seeders may have evolved as a response to a wide range of disturbances, and not exclusively to fire.

Bruce			Tree seedling recruitment in Amazon secondary forest: Importance of topography and gap micro-site conditions	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Deforested lands in Amazonia are usually converted into pastures and maintained through annual prescribed burning which depletes the soil seed bank. Here, we assess the effect of topography and micro-site conditions on the seed bank and recruitment success of tree species in 20-year old secondary forests developing on abandoned pastures in Central Amazonia, Brazil. Seedling emergence, mortality, and growth were monitored in four 1 x 1-m sub-plots located systematically in the center of 21 10 x 10-m artificial canopy gaps, seven each on three different topographic positions - plateau, slope, and bottomland. The 84 seedling sub-plots were assigned to four different treatments generated by the combination of two litter treatments, litter intact and litter removed, and two soil treatments, soil turned and soil unturned. Sixteen soil samples were collected from the four corners of each sub-plot for analysis of the seed bank. There was no significant effect of topography on the number of seeds, although on the average, densities on the plateaus and the bottomlands were more than double that on the slopes. Seedling emergence increased 200% with litter removal and 50% with soil turning relative to respective controls. Seedling emergence was significantly higher in bottomlands than in slopes, and seedling growth was significantly higher in bottomlands and slopes than in plateaus, indicating that water availability may be the limiting factor for the recruitment success on the higher parts of relief. There were no effects of topography and litter removal on seedling mortality. Management tools that can accelerate succession on intensively used land offer options for fostering reforestation. Based on this study, manipulating litter and soil micro-environment provide viable methodological tools. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods Every 57 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.				bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017	bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060; Wezel, Alexander/0000-0001-5088-5087												1100-9233	1654-1103				JAN	2013	24	1					148	156		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01436.x							WOS:000312156600016

Angus			Flow regulation is associated with riverine soil seed bank composition within an agricultural landscape: potential implications for restoration	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Does altered flow timing affect seed bank dynamics within river margins of agricultural areas? Are seed banks of degraded riparian zones important for contributing to native riverine plant diversity? Location Murray-Darling Basin, SE Australia. Methods We surveyed the seed banks of five lowland rivers, three of which have large dams that alter the seasonal timing of flow peaks. Three sites on each river with a remnant native overstorey were selected and classified into three levels of regulation based on the extent to which their seasonal flow timing was altered. Soil samples were collected from each site, and seed bank composition determined using the seedling emergence method. We also experimentally tested the effect of seasonal timing of flow peaks on germination by wetting seed bank subsamples in both spring and autumn. Results More than 28 000 seedlings from 115 taxa germinated from the seed bank samples; 262 taxa had previously been recorded in the extant vegetation. In general, seed bank and extant vegetation compositions were dissimilar, and the seed banks surveyed were dominated by ruderal (and often exotic) species. More seedlings and taxa (both native and exotic) germinated from the seed banks of regulated sites than unregulated sites. Spring wetting favoured the germination of some native species, while exotic grass taxa germinated in greater numbers in autumn. Conclusions Our results suggest that flow regulation affects the composition of riverine seed banks. This is likely to be driven by changes in the extant vegetation, and altered patterns of germination and water-borne seed dispersal (hydrochory). Regardless, the role of seed banks in degraded riverine systems in promoting native plant diversity may be limited. In particular, riparian woody species often do not develop persistent soil seed banks; rather, their recruitment may rely on newly released seeds being dispersed and deposited at appropriate times for germination. Our study corroborates previous research suggesting that flow regulation affects riverine seed bank dynamics, and that natural seasonal flow peaks are important for the persistence of some native riverine plant species.

Heterozygote excess through life history stages in Cestrum miradorense Francey (Solanaceae), an endemic shrub in a fragmented cloud forest habitat	PLANT BIOLOGY												Comparisons of genetic diversity and population genetic structure among different life history stages provide important information on the effect of the different forces and micro-evolutionary processes that mould diversity and genetic structure after fragmentation. Here we assessed genetic diversity and population genetic structure using 32 allozymic loci in adults, seeds, seedlings and juveniles of eight populations of the micro-endemic shrub Cestrum miradorense in a highly fragmented cloud forest in centraleastern Mexico. We expected that due to its long history or rarity, this species may have endured the negative effects of fragmentation and would show moderate to high levels of genetic diversity. High genetic diversity (H-e = 0.445 +/- 0.03), heterozygote excess (F-IT = -0.478 +/- 0.034, F-IS = -0.578 +/- 0.023) and low population differentiation (F-ST = 0.064 +/- 0.011) were found. Seeds had higher genetic diversity (H-e = 0.467 +/- 0.05) than the later stages (overall mean for adults, seedlings and juveniles H-e = 0.438 +/- 0.08). High gene flow was observed despite the fact that the fragmentation process began more than 100 years ago. We conclude that the high genetic diversity was the result of natural selection, which favours heterozygote excess in all stages, coupled with a combination of a reproductive system and seed/pollen dispersal mechanisms that favour gene flow.

The seed bank density of the weed population and frequencies of resistant and susceptible alleles are taken as the state variables of the growing cycle. The control variable is taken as the application doses. The goal is to reduce herbicide use, maximize profit in a pre-determined period of time and minimize the environmental impacts caused by excessive use of herbicides. The optimization problem of finding the application doses is solved with a dynamic programming approach which takes into account the decreased herbicide efficacy over time due to weed resistance evolution caused by a selective pressure which varies with the applied doses. Numerical simulations for a case study with the Bidens subalternans frequent in a corn crop is presented. We used data from a green house experiment to obtain the weed response to the most widely used Atrazine herbicide. Also, the sensitivity of the optimum solution in terms of the key parameters in the seed bank dynamics that are highly influenced by environmental factors is analysed. This suggests that the optimizing solution features some robustness under a quite realistic assumption that there are imported seeds in the system.

Unlike the usual top-down agricultural interventions that are government/donor initiatives for crop production improvement and advisory services, the seed banking approach is a bottom-up initiative that enables the smallholder farmers to simultaneous engage in crop production, processing, sales and preservation of seeds for future planting. A system dynamics model is developed and used to evaluate seed banking effectiveness in agricultural profitability and prosperity of farmers. The model simulations show that seed banking provides access to improved seeds for planting irrespective of crop yields volatility or natural calamities such as drought, floods, hurricanes, pests and diseases. In addition, the model confirms that seed banking creates an environment for stable crop prices leading to predictable returns on investment. The paper concludes that farming is profitable provided interventions that target the individual smallholder farmers themselves such as seed banking are supported by government and other development partners.

Themeda triandra: a keystone grass species	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Themeda triandra is a perennial tussock grass endemic to Africa, Australia and Asia. Within these regions it is found across a broad range of climates, geological substrates and ecosystems. Because it is widespread across these areas it has great economic and ecological value, as it is a relatively palatable species across most of its range. It is of critical importance in supporting local populations of both native and introduced herbivores, and is thus central to wildlife and livestock production, and consequently rural livelihoods. It is an important climax or subclimax species that is well adapted to fire, a common element of many areas where it is found. Inappropriate grazing management, however, can result in a decline of Themeda, as it is not well adapted to an uninterrupted, selective grazing regime. A decline in abundance of Themeda in a grassland is usually coupled to a decline in grazing value, species richness, cover and ecosystem function. In spite of its significant ecological and economic importance, there has been no attempt to review and synthesise the considerable body of research undertaken on this grass. Our aim is to summarise and synthesis work previously undertaken and identify areas where further research is required.

IN VITRO METHODS AND THE CHALLENGE OF EXCEPTIONAL SPECIES FOR TARGET 8 OF THE GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR PLANT CONSERVATION	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												For the majority of plant species of conservation concern, seed banking and traditional propagation methods are the most efficient ways of meeting the ex situ and recovery conservation goals of Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) Target 8. However, there are estimated to be 5000 or more endangered species for which these methods will not be adequate conservation tools. These "exceptional" species are those with recalcitrant seeds or those that produce few or no seeds. In vitro methods can provide alternative procedures for propagating and preserving germplasm in the long term for these species. Research at the Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) with several U.S. endangered species has shown the potential of these methods. In vitro propagation can provide plants for reintroduction and research when traditional propagation methods are not adequate. Phytotissue banking can be used for long-term ex situ conservation when seed or embryo banking is not possible. In vitro methods are also needed for recovery when embryo banking of recalcitrant seeds is possible. The full implementation of in vitro methods is constrained by information, scientific, and economic challenges, but the need for its use in meeting the needs of exceptional species should provide impetus for overcoming these challenges and making these methods an integral part of an overall ex situ conservation strategy.																	0026-6493	2162-4372					2013	99	2					214	220		10.3417/2011112							WOS:000328662700011

Spatial and temporal mating-system variations were investigated in Banksia cuneata (A. S. George), a rare bird-pollinated shrub occurring in a highly fragmented landscape. Substantial variation in the mating system was observed, with the magnitude of temporal variation within a population often as high as the level of spatial variation among populations within a season. A significant reduction in outcrossing rates and increased temporal variation in both outcrossing rates and correlated paternity were observed in disturbed populations. Doubling of the paternal neighbourhood and a trend to increased outcrossing rate was found after augmentation of a disturbed population where population size was increased from 57 to 214 adult plants. A large increase in the fixation index for seeds compared with adults was observed in all populations, with the magnitude of the difference showing temporal and spatial uniformity. We suggest that temporal mating-system variation warrants increased consideration, not only in assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation on plant populations, but also in the design and establishment of successful translocation, augmentation and restoration programs.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2013	61	4					235	242		10.1071/BT12244							WOS:000320729000001

Advances in seed conservation of wild plant species: a review of recent research	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Seed banking is now widely used for the ex situ conservation of wild plant species. Many seed banks that conserve wild species broadly follow international genebank guidelines for seed collection, processing, storage, and management. However, over the last 10-20 years, problems and knowledge gaps have been identified, which have led to more focused seed conservation research on diverse species. For example, there is now greater ecogeographic understanding of seed storage behaviour and of the relative longevity of orthodox seeds, and we are therefore able to predict which species should be conserved using cryostorage techniques; seed development studies have identified when seeds should be harvested for maximal tolerance of desiccation and longevity in storage, as well as highlighting how seed development can vary between species; and there is now a wealth of literature on the dormancy-breaking and germination requirements of wild species which, as well as enabling better management of accessions, will also mean that their use in restoration, species reintroduction, or for evaluation for other applications is possible. Future research may be focused, for example, on nursery and plant production systems for wild plant species that maximize genetic diversity, so that introduced seeds and plant materials have the resilience to cope with future environmental stresses.

Model parameters were derived from our experiments and from published sources. Individual and integrated management strategies were simulated. More than 85% of B. diandrus seeds emerged within the first cohort. In the absence of any control the seed-bank population grew until reaching an equilibrium at density of 17,324 seeds m(-2). Results pointed to the difficulty in controlling this weed with individual control tactics. All integrated programmes simulated resulted in long-term reductions in the seed bank. Simulations showed that the combination of pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides or combination of autumn shallow cultivation and post-emergence,herbicides are the best techniques to employ in integrated weed management (IWM) programmes in cereal. A sensitivity analysis indicated that B. diandrus is particularly vulnerable to small changes in the fecundity of the first cohort. Consequently, it is important to find strategies which can reduce the effect of the first cohort, because this is a clue to the control of this weed.

FLORA												The interaction between microhabitat and inter-annual variation in precipitation has an important role on the dynamics of the seed bank and can play a crucial role in survival and maintenance of plant populations in semi-arid environments. We hypothesized that the type of microhabitat and the inter-annual variability in precipitation can explain the richness and density of the seed bank in a semi-arid region in Brazil. The study was conducted in an area of tropical dry forest with shrub-tree physiognomy, locally called caatinga. We collected 35 soil samples in three distinct microhabitats, at the end of rainy and dry seasons, respectively, over three years, totalling 630 samples. The seed bank (richness and seed density) were determined by seedling emergence method. Over the three years, 79 species emerged from the seed bank, 64, 45 and 42 in riparian, non-riparian and rocky microhabitats, respectively. We recorded differences in species richness and average density between microhabitats and between years, with significant statistical interaction between them. Inter-annual precipitation explained 48% and 5% of the variation in richness and seed density, respectively. Spatial variation explained 7% of the species richness and 31% of the density. Our results show that the interaction between spatial variation and precipitation has an important role on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the richness and density of seed banks in dry environments.

Comprehensive genotyping of the USA national maize inbred seed bank	GENOME BIOLOGY												Background: Genotyping by sequencing, a new low-cost, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to genotype 2,815 maize inbred accessions, preserved mostly at the National Plant Germplasm System in the USA. The collection includes inbred lines from breeding programs all over the world. Results: The method produced 681,257 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers distributed across the entire genome, with the ability to detect rare alleles at high confidence levels. More than half of the SNPs in the collection are rare. Although most rare alleles have been incorporated into public temperate breeding programs, only a modest amount of the available diversity is present in the commercial germplasm. Analysis of genetic distances shows population stratification, including a small number of large clusters centered on key lines. Nevertheless, an average fixation index of 0.06 indicates moderate differentiation between the three major maize subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decays very rapidly, but the extent of LD is highly dependent on the particular group of germplasm and region of the genome. The utility of these data for performing genome-wide association studies was tested with two simply inherited traits and one complex trait. We identified trait associations at SNPs very close to known candidate genes for kernel color, sweet corn, and flowering time; however, results suggest that more SNPs are needed to better explore the genetic architecture of complex traits. Conclusions: The genotypic information described here allows this publicly available panel to be exploited by researchers facing the challenges of sustainable agriculture through better knowledge of the nature of genetic diversity.

J	Yang, YF; Zhu, T; Niu, DK				Yang, Yu-Fei; Zhu, Tao; Niu, Deng-Ke			Association of Intron Loss with High Mutation Rate in Arabidopsis: Implications for Genome Size Evolution	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Despite the prevalence of intron losses during eukaryotic evolution, the selective forces acting on them have not been extensively explored. Arabidopsis thaliana lost half of its genome and experienced an elevated rate of intron loss after diverging from A. lyrata. The selective force for genome reduction was suggested to have driven the intron loss. However, the evolutionary mechanism of genome reduction is still a matter of debate. In this study, we found that intron-lost genes have high synonymous substitution rates. Assuming that differences in mutability among different introns are conserved among closely related species, we used the nucleotide substitution rate between orthologous introns in other species as the proxy of the mutation rate of Arabidopsis introns, either lost or extant. The lost introns were found to have higher mutation rates than extant introns. At the genome-wide level, A. thaliana has a higher mutation rate than A. lyrata, which correlates with the higher rate of intron loss and rapid genome reduction of A. thaliana. Our results indicate that selection to minimize mutational hazards might be the selective force for intron loss, and possibly also for genome reduction, in the evolution of A. thaliana. Small genome size and lower genome-wide intron density were widely reported to be correlated with phenotypic features, such as high metabolic rates and rapid growth. We argue that the mutational-hazard hypothesis is compatible with these correlations, by suggesting that selection for rapid growth might indirectly increase mutational hazards.

(Asteraceae) (also known as Siam Weed or Jack-in-the-Bush) fallow to the management of plant parasitic nematodes was undertaken between April 2008 and April 2010. The experiment involved comparing nematode population densities in: (i) pure planted fallow of C. odorata, (ii) a mixture of C. odorata with other weeds, and (iii) natural re-growth of weeds from the seed bank in the soil in the field with C. odorata excluded. The population densities of several nematode species were determined at the outset, and then at 6-month intervals for 24 months. The nematode taxa identified as being present prior to fallowing were Meloidogyne spp. (Heteroderidae), Pratylenchus spp. (Pratylenchidae), Helicotylenchus spp., Rotylenchulus spp. (Hoplolaimidae); Rhabditids (Rhabditidae) and Dorylaimus spp. (Dorylaimoidea). Chromolaena odorata fallow significantly reduced the population densities of Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., and Helicotylenchus spp. after 2years of fallow, by 77.2%, 75.3% and 81.3% respectively. Under natural re-growth, reduction in populations of Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., and Helicotylenchus spp. ranged between 0.12% and 17%. Densities of non-parasitic species (Rhabditids and Dorylaimus spp.) significantly increased under both C. odorata + natural re-growth fallow. However, a 16% increase in the population density of Rotylenchulus spp. was observed under C. odorata fallow in contrast to a significant (54.1%) reduction observed under the natural re-growth fallow. Bush fallow with C. odorata may become part of an integrated management practice in the management of nematode pests in crop production by indigenous farmers in south-western Nigeria.																	0967-0874					JAN 1	2013	59	1					79	88		10.1080/09670874.2013.766776							WOS:000316061300010

Additionally, the high germination rate, high seed production, and seed bank carryover of annual bromes points to the need to assay soil seed banks as part of monitoring programs. We sampled the soil seed bank to help assess the effectiveness of treatments utilizing the herbicide Plateau (R) (imazapic) and a perennial native seed mix to control annual Bromus species and enhance perennial native plant establishment following a wildfire in Zion National Park, Utah. This study is one of few that have monitored the effects of imazapic and native seeding on a soil seed bank community and the only one that we know of that has done so in a pinyon-juniper woodland. The study made use of untreated, replicated controls, which is not common for seed bank studies. One year posttreatment, Bromus was significantly reduced in plots sprayed with herbicide. By the second year posttreatment, the effects of imazapic were less evident and convergence with the controls was evident. Emergence of seeded species was low for the duration of the study. Dry conditions and possible interactions with imazapic probably contributed to the lack of emergence of seeded native species. The perennial grass sand dropseed outperformed the other species included in the seed mix. We also examined how the treatments affected the soil seed bank community as a whole. We found evidence that the herbicide was reducing several native annual forbs and one nonnative annual forb. However, overall effects on the community were not significant. The results of our study were similar to what others have found in that imazapic is effective in providing a short-term reduction in Bromus density, although it can impact emergence of nontarget species.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JAN-MAR	2013	6	1					118	129		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00048.1							WOS:000316840300013						
J	Gioria, M; Osborne, BA				Gioria, Margherita; Osborne, Bruce A.			Biological Flora of the British Isles: Gunnera tinctoria	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Gunnera tinctoria (Molina) Mirb. (G. chilensis Lam.; G. scabra Ruix & Pav.; G. pilosa Kunth) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Gunnera tinctoria is a gynomonoecious, clonal, perennial herb that is naturalized in parts of Britain, becoming invasive in parts of Ireland and, more recently, Scotland. It occurs where winter temperatures are mild, and precipitation and humidity are high. Gunnera tinctoria is native to South America, predominantly in the Andean region of Chile and Colombia, and probably in parts of Argentina, ranging from sea level to c. 2000 m a.s.l. 3. Typical habitats in Britain and Ireland include stream and river banks, lake and pond margins, coastal cliffs, as well as disturbed areas, such as roadsides, quarries and ditches. In its native range it occurs predominantly on the banks of rivers and streams, on coastal cliffs and within canopy gaps or at the margins of temperate-humid rain forests. 4. Gunnera tinctoria occurs on a variety of substrates, mainly on alluvial or colluvial soils derived from volcanic material or on thin gley soils of marine origin. In Ireland, it occurs naturally on soils with a pH ranging from 4.6 to 6.2 and has been cultivated in soils with a pH up to 7. Soil moisture content and soil organic matter vary greatly, although it rarely colonizes highly organic soils such as peat. It is susceptible to even mild water deficits at all stages of development, and its seedlings are also sensitive to waterlogged conditions. 5. Gunnera tinctoria produces large numbers of seeds and also spreads clonally, by a horizontal rhizome system. It is wind pollinated, although insect pollination has been reported in New Zealand. Seeds are likely to be predominantly water and/or bird dispersed. In its invasive range, it can form a large and persistent soil seed bank. Recruitment from seeds seems to be important for its initial establishment, while vegetative propagation is the main means of expansion, leading to dense clonal stands. Long-distance seed dispersal seems to be central to the colonization of new areas, although the transport of vegetative propagules may also be important. 6. Gunnera tinctoria is a strong competitor in its invasive range, particularly in wet, humid environments. Its competitive ability arises from its large stature, the persistence of its seeds and rhizomes and a capacity for fixing nitrogen through a unique intracellular symbiosis with cyanobacteria (Nostoc) that may be particularly important for supporting the rapid growth of established plants early in the spring.

With the aim of depicting the annual variability of diatom benthic stage production and understanding the relationships between planktonic and benthic dynamics, we quantified diatoms in surface waters and their viable resting stages in surface sediments at the long-term ecological research station MareChiara (LTER-MC) in the Gulf of Naples (Mediterranean Sea) over 15 mo. A considerable fraction of the diatom species recorded in the water column was also obtained from germination in surface sediments, showing that the formation of resting stages is a widespread life strategy in coastal areas. The most abundant taxa recorded in the plankton were several species of the genera Chaetoceros, Skeletonema, Thalassiosira, Cyclotella, Pseudo-nitzschia and Bacteriastrum. Species of the latter 2 genera were never retrieved from the sediment. Peaks of viable resting stages were generally recorded in the same period as blooms of the individual species in the plankton. Repeated germination experiments with the same sediments demonstrated that some species are more resistant than others to prolonged darkness, while different daylength conditions did not produce a clear effect on germination patterns. This first time-series analysis of a coastal seed bank demonstrates that the assemblage of viable diatoms in the sediment varies over the year, reflecting the diatom dynamics in the water column, but also species-specific characteristics in survival capability and likely the disturbance due to biotic and abiotic factors.				margiotta, francesca/E-8755-2015; Zingone, Adriana/E-4518-2010	Zingone, Adriana/0000-0001-5946-6532; Montresor, Marina/0000-0002-2475-1787; SARNO, DIANA/0000-0001-9697-5301												0171-8630						2013	484						79	+		10.3354/meps10236							WOS:000320321300006

Galapagos is a unique case study for the management of alien plants in protected areas because much the archipelago has few alien plants and the original ecosystems are relatively intact. We discuss a pragmatic approach developed over 15 years to help prioritise management of 871 plant species introduced to the islands. This approach includes understanding invasion pathways; identifying which species are present and their distribution; determining invasive species impact on biodiversity, ecosystem function and mutualisms; prioritising management using weed risk assessment; guidelines to prevent further introduction through quarantine and early intervention; and developing methods to control or eradicate priority species. Principal barriers to application of the approach are limited capacity and coordination among managers and inherent difficulties arising from invasive species traits such as seed banks and dispersal and their interactions with ecosystems. We also discuss the approach of managing invasive species individually and suggest it may be more appropriate, when feasible, for the relatively intact uninhabited islands and dry regions of Galapagos. The more degraded highlands of the inhabited islands need a more complex approach that balances costs with prioritised outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem functionality.

A very limited amount of it has been saved in good condition. We investigated the principal hypothesis that the vegetation and seed banks, especially of the ancient forest species, are good indicators of habitat naturalness and its aptitude for restoration. Vegetation and seed bank sampling were carried out in fragments of forest with a known management and disturbance history over the past 80 years. We predicted that natural and anthropogenic transformations of tree stands would be significant factors shaping species composition and similarity of vegetation and seed banks. The closest similarity was observed between the seed banks of plots which were never logged. The least related to others was the seed bank of the logged site, whose soil was ploughed prior to tree replantation. The highest number of ancient forest species was recorded in the vegetation (33 species) and in the soil seed bank (21 species) of the least transformed patch of thermophilous oak forest. It was decreasing gradually with increase of the tree canopy cover on the research plots. Our results indicate also that the higher the coefficient of similarity between seed bank and vegetation, especially of the ancient forest species, the higher the forest's naturalness. We conclude that restoration of thermophilous oak wood has the highest chances for success in patches with well preserved seed banks and vegetation.

Urgently control of degraded grassland and prevent advanced deterioration are needed. Recently, irrigation plays vital role on the recovery of degraded grassland in northern pastoral areas. Different amount irrigation experiment (adequate and moderate irrigation amount) was carried out from 2007 to 2009 on Xilamuren Grassland, Inner Mongolia, north China. The experiment plots' vegetation quantitative characteristics (including community height, coverage, species number and upper ground biomass) and soil seed bank were investigated during 2007-2012. Compared with never irrigated plot, we have concluded that: (1)Different irrigation amount have the same obvious effect on improving the grassland production during 2007-2009. And the two irrigated plots' Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index were 1.4 similar to 1.6, and their Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient were nearly 0.8 in 2007-2009. Indicated that different irrigation amount had no obvious influence on community composition as well as biodiversity. (2)Irrigation stopped in 2010, the two ever irrigated plot's production equally decreased severely, and even worse than the never irrigated plot. These indicated that the advantage of irrigation on improving production disappeared immediately with stopping irrigation. The two irrigated plots' Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index were lower than the never irrigated plot in 2010 and 2011, however were at the same low level in 2012, illustrated for one thing, great change of water supporting affected the interspecies competition and thus decreased biodiversity of the community which were accustomed to irrigation, on the other hand, long-term enclosure went against biodiversity. What's more, from 2010 to 2012, the adequate irrigation plot's Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient had been still about 0.6, and the moderate irrigation plot's had been increased to 0.84 from 0.55, indicated the species composition in moderate irrigation plot was approaching the never irrigated plot. Namely, different irrigation amount had the different effect on plant survival strategy after irrigation stopped. (3)Soil seed bank reflect the vegetation growth condition of last year. Local variable interannual climatic condition was the main affection on plant sexual reproduction so as to on soil seed bank. The two irrigated plots presented temporary increase first and then prolonged decrease trend of seed amount compare to never irrigated plot, however seed species decreased gradually to about 3 specie/m(2) from 5 similar to 8 specie/m(2) and finally tend to be stable in three plots. The seed amount of two ever irrigated plots can not reflect the vegetation status due to irrigation. By comparison, soil seed bank of moderate irrigation plot was a little better than the adequate irrigation plot during and after irrigation, indicated the different irrigation amount could arouse slight affection on plant reproductive strategy. In short, moderate irrigation amount is superior to adequate irrigation amount.																			978-7-302-33544-3				2013							3244	3249									WOS:000343761504043

The experimental soil was Hapli-Albic Luvisol. Purpose of investigation was to evaluate winter wheat spelt (Triticum spelta L.) 'Franckenkorn' agrophytocenoses at three growth stages of two sowing times under conditions of organic agriculture. In the experiment crop weediness and soil weed seed bank were established at three growth stages of winter wheat spelt and weed mass influence on the spelt grain yield. For experiment establishment standard research methods were used. In the spelt crop of later sowing, weeds spread and accumulate air-dry mass more intensively than in the crop of earlier sowing. During crop vegetation air-dry weed biomass regularly increased from 0.22 to 3.55 g m(-2) and from 0.52 to 10.63 g m(-2). Soil weed seed bank did not change essentially comparing crop soil before and after over-wintering of the winter wheat spelt. At hard stage of wheat maturity, weed seed bank significantly increased in both crops of different sowing time. Cereal earlier or later sowing time did not significantly influence winter wheat spelt grain yield. Because of particularly low crop weediness, homologous wheat grain yield dependences on crop weed mass were not established.																	1822-3230						2013	6	2					209	213									WOS:000357669500043

Overcoming Weed Management Challenges in Cover Crop-Based Organic Rotational No-Till Soybean Production in the Eastern United States	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Cover crop based organic rotational no-till soybean production has attracted attention from farmers, researchers, and other agricultural professionals because of the ability of this new system to enhance soil conservation, reduce labor requirements, and decrease diesel fuel use compared to traditional organic production. This system is based on the use of cereal rye cover crops that are mechanically terminated with a roller-crimper to create in situ mulch that suppresses weeds and promotes soybean growth. In this paper, we report experiments that were conducted over the past decade in the eastern region of the United States on cover crop-based organic rotational no-till soybean production, and we outline current management strategies and future research needs. Our research has focused on maximizing cereal rye spring ground cover and biomass because of the crucial role this cover crop plays in weed suppression. Soil fertility and cereal rye sowing and termination timing affect biomass production, and these factors can be manipulated to achieve levels greater than 8,000 kg ha(-1), a threshold identified for consistent suppression of annual weeds. Manipulating cereal rye seeding rate and seeding method also influences ground cover and weed suppression. In general, weed suppression is species-specific, with early emerging summer annual weeds (e.g., common ragweed), high weed seed bank densities (e.g. > 10,000 seeds m(-2)), and perennial weeds (e.g., yellow nutsedge) posing the greatest challenges. Due to the challenges with maximizing cereal rye weed suppression potential, we have also found high-residue cultivation to significantly improve weed control. In addition to cover crop and weed management, we have made progress with planting equipment and planting density for establishing soybean into a thick cover crop residue. Our current and future research will focus on integrated multitactic weed management, cultivar selection, insect pest suppression, and nitrogen management as part of a systems approach to advancing this new production system.

Weed Management Strategies to Reduce Herbicide Use in Zero-Till Rice-Wheat Cropping Systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plains	WEED TECHNOLOGY												In the rice wheat (RW) systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia, conservation tillage practices, including zero-tillage (ZT), are being promoted to address emerging problems such as (1) shortages of labor and water, (2) declining factor productivity, (3) deterioration of soil health, and (4) climate change. Despite multiple benefits of ZT, weed control remains a major challenge to adoption, resulting in more dependence on herbicides for weed control. Alternative management strategies are needed to reduce dependence on herbicides and minimize risks associated with their overuse, including evolution of herbicide resistance. The objectives of this review are to (1) highlight and synthesize research efforts in nonchemical weed management in ZT RW systems and (2) identify future weed ecology and management research needs to facilitate successful adoption of these systems. In ZT RW systems, crop, residue can play a central role in suppressing weeds through mulch effects on emergence and seed predation. In ZT rice, wheat residue mulch (5 t ha(-1)) reduced weed density by 22 to 76% and promoted predation of RW weeds, including litdeseed canarygrass and barnyardgrass seeds. For ZT wheat, rice residue mulch (6 to 10 t ha(-1)) in combination with early sowing reduced emergence of littleseed canarygrass by over 80 Yo. Other promising nonchemical approaches that can be useful in suppressing weeds in ZT RW systems include use of certified seeds, weed-competitive cultivars, stale seedbed practices, living mulches (e.g., sesbania coculture), and water and nutrient management practices that shift weed crop competition in favor of the crop. However, more research on emergence characteristics and mulching effects of different crop residues on key weeds under ZT, cover cropping, and breeding crops for weed suppression will strengthen nonchemical weed management programs. Efforts are needed to integrate multiple tactics and to evaluate long-term effects of nonchemical weed management practices on RW cropping system sustainability.

Changes in weed seed banks and the potato yield as affected by different amounts of nitrogen and crop residue	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												In order to evaluate the impact of crop residues (zero, 25 and 50%) and nitrogen (zero, 125 and 250 kg ha) on weed seed bank and potato yield, two-years research was conducted as a split plot arranged in randomized complete block design in Rozveh Agriculture Research Station, Freidan-Esfahan. Numbers of weed species in seed bank, aboveground, and both seed bank and aboveground were 1, 2 and 8 respectively. Amaranthus retroflexus L. was dominant weed in seed bank in the both years. Weed seed bank was significantly lower in both N rates than control in the both years with no significant difference between the rates. Weeds biomass with increased use of nitrogen fertilizer increased. In 25 and 50 percent of crop residue treatments, weed seed density was greater than control. 125 kg N ha(-1) with 25 percent of crop residue treatment produced the highest tuber yield (27850 kg ha(-1)), although weed biomass was also high in this treatment. The results showed that management of nitrogen fertilizer application and weed control by applying crop residue crops in rotation will change.

Composition and diversity of natural regeneration in Pinus-Quercus communities under high fire recurrence in northeastern Mexico	REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD												We evaluated the natural regeneration of woody species at the mid-term in a Pinus-Quercus mixed forest affected by frequent medium-to-high intensity wildfires (1972, 1984 and 1998) in northeastern Mexico. The objective was to determine the recovery of vegetation from recurrent fires, and whether it depends on slope exposure (NE vs. NW). The results indicated that 93% of the species are obligated resprouters already present in the site before the fires. This capability enables the reconstitution of aerial part of existing individuals. According to abundance records, the key genus was Quercus, and Q. rysophylla was the most abundant species after the fires. While the specie Pinus pseudostrobus is adapted to fire due to a thick bark and the long life span of its seed bank, frequent medium-to-high intensity fires implied the local extinction of the species. We did not find significant differences in density (N/ha) and dominance (m(2)/ha) in relation to the exposures assessed, but in terms of diversity and composition there were significant differences, being the NW the most diverse exposure. These results provide useful information to be considered for the development and design of management plans of protected areas in NE Mexico.

Germination, growth and seed bank of red-root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) as influenced by allelopathic extract and residues of alfalfa	RESEARCH ON CROPS												This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the residue from different parts of alfalfa at different stages of growth and in different amounts of extract and residues on red-root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus). For this purpose, a factorial experiment was carried out three times during 2008-09. The factors included five levels of the residue from the leaves, stem, root, the whole plant of alfalfa and the control; the added amounts of residue to the soil at five levels of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 g/m(2) and the residue in the four stages of vegetative, flowering, seed. bulking of alfalfa and the control. The results of the study showed that the extract and residue from the different parts of alfalfa significantly decreased the germination rate, seedling length, plant height, leaf area, dry weight of the shoot and root, biomass, 1000-seed weight and grain production of red-root pigweed. By increasing the amount of the alfalfa residue in the soil, where the red-root pigweed was growing, the amounts of all the attributes to be studied decreased. The reduction of the leaf area, biomass, 1000-seed weight and grain production of red-root pigweed, due to the addition of 50 g/m(2) alfalfa residue, was 12.82, 23.82, 30.5 and 9.52%, respectively, as compared with control. By increasing the alfalfa residue by 200 g/m(2), this reduction reached 73.42, 78.25, 29.85 and 76.19%, respectively. Thus, the biomass and grain production of red-root pigweed showed more sensitivity to the amount of the alfalfa residue. Compared to the control group, reduction in the pigweed dry weight by adding residuals obtained from vegetative, inflorescence and seed bulking stage was 30, 38 and 36%, respectively. The red-root pigweed grain production recorded as 1.62 g/plant for the control group decreased by adding 200 g/m(2) of the residue from the leaf, stem, root and the whole plant of alfalfa to 79, 67, 72 and 69%, respectively. The increasing red-root pigweed seed to soil seed bank decreased from 15 to 72%. Residue from alfalfa leaf in the vegetative stage had the highest decreasing effect on the most attributes and especially on the soil seed bank.

Seedling establishment and survival play a critical role in determining the composition of these plant communities by supplying new individuals for their maintenance. Seedling emergence and mortality were investigated to test the hypothesis that recruitment into the seedling bank is periodic. Materials and methods: Seed production and seedling emergence and survival was monitored during 1994-2007 in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white spruce (Picea glauca) in four pristine stands of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Measurements were collected twice per month by sampling one permanent plot of 20 x 20 m per stand. Key results: Seed-rain abundance reached 9 x 10 3 seeds m(-2) year(-1), and was characterized by synchronous sequences of low and high seed production. New seedlings appeared only during the year following a seed production of at least 1 x 10 3 and 1.5 x 10(2) seeds m(-2) year(-1) for balsam fir and white spruce, respectively. Seedlings emerged in July and survived 34-52 d on average, with balsam fir showing a longer lifespan and lower mortality, although 85-99% of seedlings died before completing one year of life. Conclusions: The emergence of young seedlings was coupled with massive seed rains, which allowed synchronous replenishment of the seedling banks among stands and species, and generated different cohorts, yielding a discontinuous age structure.				rossi, sergio/I-3725-2014	rossi, sergio/0000-0002-9919-0494												0002-9122					DEC	2012	99	12					1942	1950		10.3732/ajb.1200267							WOS:000312951600018	23204491

Wildfire effects on the soil seed bank of a maritime pine stand - The importance of fire severity	GEODERMA												This study addressed the impacts of wildfire and, in particular, its severity on the seed bank of the litter/ash layer and the topsoil of a Mediterranean pine plantation (Pinus pinaster Ait.) in north-central Portugal. The study location was selected for presenting a homogeneous pine cover before the fire, on the one hand, and, on the other, heterogeneous patches with distinct degrees of damage to the pine crowns immediately after the fire. The experimental design involved the selection, from the opposite valley side, of three zones with adjacent strips of Low and High Canopy Consumption (L/HCC). Within each of these strips, a transect was laid out along which three plots were established at 10 m intervals. The same was done in the unburnt area immediately outside the fire perimeter. At each plot, samples were collected within the first two weeks after the fire to: (i) asses viable seed densities for three sampling layers, using the indirect method for a 10-month period: (ii) estimate maximum temperature reached (MTRs) at 0-3 cm depth, on the basis of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR). Fire severity at the plots was further determined by verifying, in situ, pine canopy consumption (FCC) as well as by measuring the minimum diameter of remaining shrub twigs (TDI). In comparison with the unburnt area, the recently burnt area as a whole revealed a substantial increase in overall densities of viable seeds. Seed bank composition, however, varied markedly within the burnt area but this could be explained reasonably well by differential effects of the wildfire associated with its severity, in terms of the two crown consumption classes as well as the TDI index but not the MTRs. The inclusion of the litter/ash layer and the separation of two soil depths were amply justified by providing clear support for the important role of fire severity, in particular for the two principal taxa (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp., presumably mainly E. australis).

Thirty samples from the litter/duff (LD) and the top 5 cm of the mineral soil (MS) were collected from five 5-ha burn units (6 plots per experimental unit) before and immediately after low-intensity prescribed fires, where maximum fire temperatures varied from <79 to 316 degrees C. A split-plot ANOVA and multi-response permutation procedures (MRBP) were utilized to assess the effects of burn treatment (pre- or post-fire) and seed bank layer (LD and MS) on the diversity and density of the buried seed bank. An average of 471 emergents/m(2) was observed in the buried seed bank comprising 133 identifiable taxa. No differences in total seed-bank density, Shannon-Weiner's diversity index (H'), or overall species composition between pre- and post-fire sampling or between the LD and MS layers were observed. Species richness (S) of the seed bank, however, was slightly greater pre-fire than post-fire, regardless of layer. Similarity, as defined by Sorenson's index, of species common to the seed bank and aboveground forest understory was low, with a slight increase in Sorenson's index observed during post-fire sampling of the seed bank and aboveground vegetation. Although we observed only negligible effects of a once-applied, low-intensity prescribed fire on the buried seed bank, the effects of a low-intensity prescribed fire management regime-one that involves repeated low intensity burns-on the buried seed bank are unknown and should be a focus of future studies across mixed-oak forests in the eastern US.																	1528-7092					DEC	2012	11	4					669	688		10.1656/058.011.0407							WOS:000312985900007

The relative contributions of seed bank, seed rain, and understory vegetation dynamics to the reorganization of Tsuga canadensis forests after loss due to logging or simulated attack by Adelges tsugae	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Profound changes are occurring in forests as native insects, nonnative insects, or pathogens irrupt on foundation tree species; comprehensive models of vegetation responses are needed to predict future forest composition. We experimentally simulated hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) infestation (by girdling trees) and preemptive logging of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) and compared vegetation dynamics in replicate 90 m x 90 m treatment plots and intact hemlock stands from 2004 to 2010. Using Chao-Sorensen abundance-based similarity indices, we assessed compositional similarities of trees, shrubs, forbs, and graminoids among the seed bank, seed rain, and standing vegetation over time and among treatments. Post-treatment seed rain, similar among treatments, closely reflected canopy tree composition. Species richness of the seed bank was similar in 2004 and 2010. Standing vegetation in the hemlock controls remained dissimilar from the seed bank, reflecting suppressed germination. Recruits from the seed rain and seed bank dominated standing vegetation in the logged treatment, whereas regeneration of vegetation from the seed bank and seed rain was slowed due to shading by dying hemlocks in the girdled treatment. Our approach uniquely integrates multiple regeneration components through time and provides a method for predicting forest dynamics following loss of foundation tree species.

Grassland plant communities are known to be sensitive to shifts in precipitation and increases in temperature associated with climate change, but we do not know if and how these factors interact to affect the similarity between seed bank and aboveground vegetation. Also unknown is how the impact of grazing, the dominant land-use in grasslands, will interact with climatic conditions to affect similarity. We manipulated precipitation and temperature, and cut vegetation (as a proxy for grazing) at a grassland site for three years. Percent cover of aboveground vegetation was estimated in the third year, and compared with persistent seed bank samples taken in the year prior from the same plots. Similarity increased with reduced precipitation, was unresponsive to warming, and decreased with clipping. The aboveground community responded strongly to the treatments, while the seed bank community did less so, suggesting similarity responses were largely driven by changes in aboveground vegetation. Because of the importance of the seed bank in vegetation regeneration, understanding the relationship between seed bank and aboveground vegetation will improve our understanding of plant community dynamics under climate change and varied management (grazing) intensities.

Vegetation, soils and seed banks of limestone grasslands are still impacted by former cultivation one century after abandonment	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												This study identifies the long lasting impacts of former cultivation on soils, seed banks and above-ground vegetation of limestone grasslands. We compared the resilience of three crop fields cultivated in the 19th century and abandoned (Abandoned Fields) with three grasslands which have never been cultivated (Old Grasslands). Grasslands were located in the Nature reserve of Grand-Pierre and Vitain valleys in France. Sites were identified using historical sources. Chemical and physical soil properties, above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) were studied. Data were analysed using a multivariate and univariate analyses to detect the effects/impacts of ancient cultivation. Our results clearly show that soil properties (e.g., calcium, carbonate, clay contents), above-ground vegetation (species diversity, moss and lichen cover) and seed bank (floristic composition, species-richness and diversity) are still impacted more than one century after their abandonment. Species richness of both above ground vegetation and seed bank are higher in old grasslands than in formerly cultivated fields. In the seed bank of the formerly cultivated soils we also found the presence of a very rare arable weed species (Althaea hirsuta) which has not been inventoried for a long time in the above-ground vegetation of the nature reserve. The resilience of formerly cultivated limestone grasslands might be influenced by the present management regime (site effect). Nevertheless, the resilience period of limestone grasslands is very long-more than one century-and return to an initial state might be difficult or impossible to reach.

Wallace			Nonnative species influence vegetative response to ecological restoration: Two forests with divergent restoration outcomes	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Changes in the vegetative structure and diversity of ponderosa pine forests have generated interest in conducting ecological restoration projects to improve the overall forest health of these ecosystems. Ecological restoration prescriptions often consist of thinning trees to emulate pre-1870s forest structure followed by prescribed burning. Disturbances associated with ecological restoration can, however, promote invasion by nonnative species. We compared two northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests treated for ecological restoration, one at the Fort Valley Experimental Forest and one at Mt. Trumbull on the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. We examined the response of native and nonnative plant species, as well as all species combined, to treatments at the two forests. Both study sites showed a significant increase in native and nonnative species cover and richness by the fifth year post-treatment that remained significant by the tenth year post-treatment. Despite these general trends in native and nonnative community development, the understory vegetation at the two sites followed diverging successional patterns after treatment. By the tenth year post-treatment Fort Valley was dominated by native species and Mt. Trumbull was dominated by a single nonnative species, cheatgrass. The differences in post-treatment understory recovery are likely due to pretreatment forest conditions. At Fort Valley, nonnatives were present, but accounted for only 0.11% of the pretreatment cover. At Mt. Trumbull, nonnatives accounted for 5.26% of the pretreatment understory cover, with cheatgrass accounting for approximately 4% of the understory cover. Additionally, the soil seedbank at Fort Valley had greater overall species richness and greater native perennial grass richness than Mt. Trumbull. We propose that the application of ecological restoration treatments should be targeted to sites with low abundance of nonnatives prior to treatment. Sites containing high abundance of nonnatives prior to treatment should be managed for nonnative species mitigation before initiating any ecological restoration projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Seed germination and longevity of autumn-flowering and autumn-seed producing Mediterranean geophytes	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The seasonality of the Mediterranean climate has important implications for plant physiology and some specific conditions must be met before germination can occur. Most plants sprout during the spring season although a few germinate during the autumnal rainy period. To understand the patterns of germination under autumn conditions we selected five Mediterranean autumn-flowering geophytes that usually co-exist in fire-prone habitats: Leucojum autumnale, Narcissus cavanillesii, Narcissus serotinus, Scilla autumnalis and Urginea maritima. Experiments were performed under conditions simulating those prevailing in the habitat during the autumnal Mediterranean season when seeds of these species usually germinate. In all species, germination occurred quickly (<7 d), was usually higher at the lowest temperatures tested (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C; >89%) and no signs of delayed germination were detected. Nevertheless, species usually had different patterns of seed germination, a strategy that might avoid interspecific competition when co-occurring in the same habitats. Germination was lower and slower in light than in darkness, suggesting that under natural conditions germination of seeds directly exposed to sunlight can be severely restricted. Several fire-dependent treatments (heat and ash) revealed a lack of fire-stimulated germination, and treatments even had a negative effect. In addition, only a small fraction of seeds remained viable after 1 year of dry lab storage and their germinability was very low, suggesting the absence of a permanent soil seed bank in the life cycle of these geophyes.

Using Satellite Imagery to Assess Macrophyte Response to Water-level Manipulations in the Saskatchewan River Delta, Manitoba	WETLANDS												QuickBird satellite imagery and object-based classification were used to map emergent macrophyte response in wetlands that were partially drawn down during a three-year period (2007-2010) in the Saskatchewan River Delta, Manitoba, Canada. Generalized logistic models were used to classify vegetation genera in three drawdown and three high-water (control) wetlands. User accuracy of models averaged 74 %, and was lower in partial drawdown wetlands (72 %) than in high-water wetlands (77 %). In partial drawdown wetlands, emergent macrophytes (especially Typha spp. and Carex spp.) senesced significantly after the first year of lowered water levels but senescent areas decreased over following years. Plants were not completely dead in dewatered areas and emergent stands recovered by the third year after drawdown. Open water area in the partial drawdown wetlands gradually decreased due to clonal expansion of Sparganium spp. Vegetation areas in high-water wetlands remained unchanged throughout the study period. Although partial water-level drawdowns temporarily influenced the growth of emergent macrophytes they did not expose the seed bank and did not result in substantial, prolonged changes in spatial arrangement of vegetation areas. The combination of high-resolution satellite imagery, object-based classification and logistic modeling was useful for documenting vegetation response to management in these remote, boreal wetland systems.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2012	32	6					1091	1102		10.1007/s13157-012-0339-z							WOS:000311540400010

Changes in plant species and functional composition with time since fire in two mediterranean climate plant communities	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Do floristic composition and plant functional type (PFT) richness and dominance change with time since fire, in the directions predicted through consideration of their fire response traits? Location Two vegetation communities in the globally significant biodiversity hotspot of south-western Australia: mallee, dominated by resprouters, and mallee-heath, dominated by non-resprouters. Methods Species richness and cover were sampled in replicated plots across a time since fire gradient ranging from 2 to >55yr post-fire, using a space-for-time approach. Species were allocated to PFTs according to traits relevant to the processes of vegetation change underpinning the initial floristic composition model of vegetation assembly: their capacity to resprout, the location and persistence of the seed bank, competitive stratum and longevity. Ordination and ANOVA were used to test for differences in floristic and PFT composition between young (<10yr post-fire), mature (1835yr) and old (>40yr) vegetation in each community. Results Plant functional type and floristic analyses were similar, showing substantial changes in the composition of mallee-heath vegetation with time since fire, but not in mallee. The direction of change in PFT composition in mallee-heath was consistent with predictions, with increasing cover of non-resprouting, serotinous PFTs, an intermediate peak in cover of PFTs with persistent soil-stored seed banks, and decreasing cover of post-fire ephemerals and non-resprouting, non-serotinous dwarf shrubs, herbs and graminoids with increasing time since fire. Success in predicting changes in PFT dominance in mallee was lower. Conclusions The similarity of floristic and PFT analyses suggest that these approaches are interchangeable for characterizing vegetation change with increasing time since fire. PFTs were more effective for predicting fire response trajectories in the vegetation community dominated by non-resprouting, serotinous shrubs (mallee-heath) than that dominated by resprouting, serotinous trees (mallee). The underlying vegetation assembly model and PFTs used appear suitable for broader application in fire-prone communities with competitive dominance by non-resprouting, serotinous shrubs, but less so in communities dominated by other PFTs.

The primary aim of this study was to compare the seed bank dynamics, including dormancy cycling, of the two seed morphs (black and brown) of the cold desert halophyte Suaeda corniculata and, if differences were found, to determine their influence on regeneration of the species. Seeds of the two seed morphs were buried, exhumed and tested monthly for 24 months over a range of temperatures and salinities, and germination recovery and viability were determined after exposure to salinity and water stress. Seedling emergence and dynamics of the soil seed bank were also investigated for the two morphs. Black seeds had an annual dormancy/non-dormancy cycle, while brown seeds, which were non-dormant at maturity, remained non-dormant. Black seeds also exhibited an annual cycle in sensitivity of germination to salinity. Seedlings derived from black seeds emerged in July and August and those from brown seeds in May. Seedlings were recruited from 26 of the black seeds and from 28 of the brown seeds in the soil, and only 05 and 04 of the total number of black and brown seeds in the soil, respectively, gave rise to seedlings that survived to produce seeds. Salinity and water stress induced dormancy in black seeds and decreased viability of brown seeds. Brown seeds formed only a transient soil seed bank and black seeds a persistent seed bank. The presence of a dormancy cycle in black but not in brown seeds of S. corniculata and differences in germination requirements of the two morphs cause them to differ in their germination dynamics. The study contributes to our limited knowledge of dormancy cycling and seed bank formation in species producing heteromorphic seeds.

Comparison of methods to estimate soil seed banks: the role of seed size and mass	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												There are two main methods for estimating seed density and species composition of soil seed banks: manual seed extraction and seedling emergence. These methods were used to determine and compare seed density and species composition in the soil of a natural grassland in Patagonia. Additionally, known amounts of seeds of different sizes from Patagonian grassland species were mixed with soil to evaluate the efficiency of the seed extraction method, and determine their recovery percentage. Seed density found in the grassland soil with the extraction method was four times higher than that found with the seedling emergence method. Through the use of these two methods, there was very little overlap found in species composition. Small seeds (< 1 mm) were only found with the seedling emergence method, whereas the seeds of species with specific germination requirements were found with the seed extraction method. Seed recovery of grassland species varied from 2.5% for smaller seeds (Erophila verna) to 100% for larger seeds (Rumex acetosella) with the seed extraction method. This method was more effective in detecting seeds of large-seeded species. Discrepancies in seed detection between both methods may be related to seed dormancy, specific germination requirements, seed size and mass. These two methods are necessary to describe seed density and seed bank composition.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				DEC	2012	13	2					238	242		10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.2.14							WOS:000311361200014

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to compare differences in the soil seed bank among the native grasslands in different degraded states, in the revegetated grasslands across years since restoration and seasonal changes. The Sorenson similarity index and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were applied to examine the similarity of species composition in the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation. It was found that the highest and lowest soil seed density occurred in autumn (October) and summer (July), respectively. We also explored the changes about transient and persistent soil seed banks. Basically, we found that all experimental plots were inclined to choose transient seed banks rather than persistent seed banks expect for non-degraded and 5 year restoration grasslands. There were significant differences in soil seed density among the degraded grasslands and among the different aged revegetated grasslands (P < 0.05). Soil seed density increased with decreasing levels of degradation while it increased with age since restoration. We also explored the seed density among three functional groups (grasses, sedges and forbs) and found that forbs had the highest soil seed density. A low similarity of species composition between soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation in the degraded grasslands implied that the seed bank contributed little to the restoration of the aboveground vegetation in these degraded grasslands. A high similarity of species composition between soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation in the artificially restored grasslands indicated that the seed soil bank was important in maintaining the vegetation structure and cover in the established grasslands.

J	Cabaco, S; Santos, R				Cabaco, Susana; Santos, Rui			Seagrass reproductive effort as an ecological indicator of disturbance	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The available information on the changes in the reproductive effort (RE) of seagrasses in response to disturbances was reviewed and analysed to assess if seagrasses invest in RE when disturbed, and if this response is related to specific types of disturbance or seagrass traits. In 72% of the documented cases RE increased with disturbance, in 25% it decreased, and in 3% no changes were reported. Overall, seagrass RE increased 4-fold with disturbance. Anthropogenic disturbances had the highest impact on RE (a 13-fold increase); 3 times higher than the effect of natural disturbances. Mechanical and sedimentary/hydrodynamics disturbances caused the highest RE increase (9- and 5-fold, respectively). The positive RE response was significantly correlated with rhizome diameter of seagrasses, but not with shoot size (mass or length), suggesting that species with higher storage capacity have a higher capacity of investing in sexual reproduction when conditions deteriorate. Seagrasses showed a general trend of increasing RE under disturbance; this was evident regardless of the origin and type of disturbance, which suggests that changes in seagrass RE provide a valuable indicator of disturbance in coastal areas.

Whether or not seeds of Harrisia fragrans Small, a U. S. endangered cactus endemic to Florida (USA) form persistent soil seed-banks or withstand drying and/or freezing under storage conditions was unknown. We conducted a seed burial experiment with seeds collected from three sites (North, Middle, and South) within the Savannas Preserve State Park, FL, USA. We buried the seeds in plots with three light conditions (sun, partial sun, and shade) at each of the three sites and tested their viability in germination trials after 3.5, 8, 11, 16, 19 and 23 months of burial in soil. Buried seeds remained alive throughout the 23 months of the study period with germination ranging from 64 to 100%, which suggests that this species forms a persistent soil seed-bank. Microhabitat conditions markedly affected seed-bank size and subsequent seed viability. Seeds from the South site exhibited higher and faster germination than seeds from the Middle or North sites. We also evaluated if H. fragrans seeds could withstand dry storage under low relative humidity (RH) and low temperature. In the laboratory 76% of seeds stored under 12% RH and -20 degrees C for 1 and 24 weeks germinated faster than seeds stored under 21-23 degrees C and 50% RH. Thus, the capacity of Harrisia fragrans to form a persistent soil seed bank influences population persistence. Its ability to be stored in orthodox ex-situ conditions offers viable options for its future conservation and regeneration.																	1070-0048	1938-2898				DEC	2012		18					85	94		10.2985/026.018.0111							WOS:000208941400011

Herbicidal strategies to control Phalaris brachystachys in a wheat-sunflower rotation: a simulation approach	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Phalaris brachystachys is a common and troublesome weed in winter cereals in Mediterranean countries. A deterministic model was developed to simulate P. brachystachys seedbank dynamics in the wheat-sunflower rotation, a commonly practiced cropping system in southern Spain, under different herbicide-based management scenarios: no herbicide application, full herbicide dose (standard rate) and two reduced dose rates (75 and 50% of the standard rate). Without treatment, a steady increase of the seed bank is predicted up to an equilibrium level of 54,859 seeds m (2) (575 plants m (2)) after 25 years. Full dose herbicide applications in wheat years resulted in a progressive seed bank decline over years. Reducing the efficacy of the herbicide by using 50% or 75% of the recommended rate resulted in no long-term seed bank decline. Instead, a population increase until equilibrium densities is predicted. A sensitivity analysis showed that seedling survival and fecundity were the most sensitive demographic parameters under the full dose strategy, whereas fecundity and seedbank mortality were the most sensitive parameters under reduced dose strategies. Reduced dose strategies tended to be less sensitive than the full dose strategy. Simulations indicated that long-term control of this weed may be attained under full dose, highly effective, herbicide applications. Unless effectiveness could be maintained at very high levels, reduced herbicide doses may not be a recommendable option for the long-term control of this species in a wheat-sunflower rotation.

Angus			Flow regulation affects temporal patterns of riverine plant seed dispersal: potential implications for plant recruitment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Changes to the natural flow regime of a river caused by flow regulation may affect waterborne seed dispersal (hydrochory), and this may be an important mechanism by which regulation affects riverine plant communities. We assessed the effect of altered timing of seasonal flow peaks on hydrochory and considered the potential implications for plant recruitment. 2. We sampled hydrochory within five lowland rivers of temperate Australia, three of which are regulated by large dams. These dams are operated to store winter and spring rains and release water in summer and autumn for agriculture. At three sites on each river, hydrochory was sampled monthly for 12 months using passive drift nets. The contents of the drift samples were determined using the seedling-emergence method. 3. More than 33 000 seedlings from 142 taxa germinated from the samples. In general, more seeds and taxa were observed in the drift at higher flows. By altering the period of peak flows from winterspring to summerautumn, flow regulation similarly affected the period of peak seed dispersal. The effect of regulation on seed dispersal varied between taxa depending on their timing of seed release and whether or not they maintain a persistent soil seed bank. 4. Hydrochory in rivers is a product of flow regime and the life history of plants. By altering natural flow regimes and thus hydrochorous dispersal patterns, flow regulation is likely to affect adversely the recruitment of native plant species with dispersal phenologies adapted to natural flow regimes (such as many riparian trees and shrubs) and encourage the spread of non-native (exotic) species. 5. Changes to hydrochorous dispersal patterns are an important mechanism by which altered flow timing affects riverine plant communities. Natural seasonal flow peaks (in this case spring) are likely to be important for the recruitment of many native riparian woody taxa.

J	Boschilia, SM; de Oliveira, EF; Schwarzbold, A				Boschilia, Solana Meneghel; de Oliveira, Edson Fontes; Schwarzbold, Albano			The immediate and long-term effects of water drawdown on macrophyte assemblages in a large subtropical reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Disturbances play a central role in determining the spatial and temporal dynamics of many plant communities. In our study of macrophyte assemblages at 150 sites in five arms of a large subtropical reservoir (Itaipu Reservoir, BrazilParaguay border), we used co-occurrence null models and spatiotemporal analyses to describe the patterns in the assemblages during a historically large water drawdown in 2000, in comparison with the previous year (1999) and subsequent years (200107). A C-Score co-occurrence index tested the null hypothesis of random structure during the drawdown period. A detrended correspondence analysis and multiresponse permutation procedure were used to verify whether species composition differed before, during and after the disturbance. 2. In contrast to our expectations, the null models showed that the macrophyte assemblages were spatially structured during the drawdown (2000), although species composition was significantly different from the previous year (1999) and also changed in the following years (200107). Significant species co-occurrence patterns were generated by the drawdown disturbance, with species extinctions and colonisation by new species from propagules and seed bank germination. 3. The randomness we expected in 2000 actually occurred in 2001, probably because the reestablishment of normal water level enabled both submersed and free-floating species to recolonise the shore that emergent species had inhabited since the drawdown. Biotic interactions appeared to increase during the years after the disturbance and the habitat preferences of the aquatic macrophytes were re-established, resulting in higher similarities in aquatic macrophyte species composition in the years after the drawdown.

The germination stimulatory activity of smoke can largely be attributed to karrikinolide (KAR(1)), while a related compound, trimethylbutenolide (TMB), has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on germination. The aim of this study was to characterize the interaction of these potent fire-generated compounds. Dose-response analysis, leaching tests and a detailed transcriptome study were performed using highly KAR(1)-sensitive lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv 'Grand Rapids') achenes. Dose-response analysis demonstrated that the compounds are not competitors and TMB modulates germination in a concentration-dependent manner. The transcriptome analysis revealed a contrasting expression pattern induced by the compounds. KAR(1) suppressed, while TMB up-regulated ABA, seed maturation and dormancy-related transcripts. The effect of TMB was reversed by leaching the compound, while the KAR(1) effect was only reversible by leaching within the first 2 h of KAR(1) treatment. Our findings suggest that the compounds may act in concert for germination-related signaling. After the occurrence of fire, sufficient rainfall would contribute to post-germination seedling recruitment by reducing the concentration of the inhibitory compound.

RECREATIONAL TRAILS AS CORRIDORS FOR ALIEN PLANTS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, USA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Alien plant species often use areas of heavy human activity for habitat and dispersal. Roads and utility corridors have been shown to harbor more alien species than the surrounding vegetation and are therefore believed to contribute to alien plant persistence and spread. Recreational trails represent another corridor that could harbor alien species and aid their spread. Effective management of invasive species requires understanding how alien plants are distributed at trailheads and trails and how their dispersal may be influenced by native vegetation. Our overall goal was to investigate the distribution of alien plants at trailheads and trails in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. At trailheads, we found that although the number of alien species was less than the number of native species, alien plant cover ((x) over bar = 50%) did not differ from native plant cover, and we observed a large number of alien seedlings in the soil seed bank, suggesting that alien plants are a large component of trailhead communities and will continue to be so in the future. Along trails, we found higher alien species richness and cover on trail (as opposed to 4 m from the trail) in 3 out of 4 vegetation types, and we observed higher alien richness and cover in meadows than in other vegetation types. Plant communities at both trailheads and trails, as well as seed banks at trailheads, contain substantial diversity and abundance of alien plants. These results suggest that recreational trails in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado may function as corridors that facilitate the spread of alien species into wildlands. Our results suggest that control of alien plants should begin at trailheads where there are large numbers of aliens and that control efforts on trails should be prioritized by vegetation type.

Response of drought and fertilization in Erica andevalensis seed banks: Significance for conservation management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The present study attempts to investigate the size, composition and seedling dynamics of the seed bank of a metalliferous and vulnerable species, Erica andevalensis. Samples were taken during spring and autumn from two different sites. We also studied the effects of nutrient solution, irrigation from the river Tinto and irrigation deficit on seeding establishment and survival. Only E. andevalensis and Poaceae species emerged from the seed banks, although the former was dominant (98%). Germination and seedling establishment was totally inhibited by the waters of the river Tinto. Seed density was high in the soils of both seed banks irrigated with water and nutrient solution. We found no seasonal differences in the seed bank and number of germinated seeds and mortality rate and density were similar. From the standpoint of restoration management, the results indicate that the seed bank is a very important factor for successful species establishment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A Study of Three Species with Contrasting Life History Strategies	PLOS ONE												We attempted to confirm that seed banks can be viewed as an important genetic reservoir by testing the hypothesis that standing (aboveground) plants represent a nonrandom sample of the seed bank. We sampled multilocus allozyme genotypes from three species with different life history strategies: Amaranthus retroflexus, Carduus acanthoides, Pastinaca sativa. In four populations of each species we analysed the extent to which allele and genotype frequencies vary in consecutive life history stages including the summer seed bank, which has been overlooked up to now. We compared the winter seed bank (i.e., seeds collected before the spring germination peak), seedlings, rosettes, the summer seed bank (i.e., seeds collected after the spring germination peak) and fruiting plants. We found that: (1) All three species partitioned most of their genetic diversity within life history stages and less among stages within populations and among populations. (2) All genetic diversity parameters, except for allele frequencies, were similar among all life history stages across all populations in different species. (3) There were differences in allele frequencies among life history stages at all localities in Amaranthus retroflexus and at three localities in both Carduus acanthoides and Pastinaca sativa. (4) Allele frequencies did not differ between the winter and summer seed bank in most Carduus acanthoides and Pastinaca sativa populations, but there was a marked difference in Amaranthus retroflexus. In conclusion, we have shown that the summer seed bank is not genetically depleted by spring germination and that a majority of genetic diversity remains in the soil through summer. We suggest that seed banks in the species investigated play an important role by maintaining genetic diversity sufficient for recovery rather than by accumulating new genetic diversity at each locality.

Consequently, indigenous flora has developed a rich repertoire of life-history strategies to deal with fluctuations in resource availability. Examinations of how future climate change will affect the biota often forecast negative impacts, but these-usually correlative-approaches overlook precipitation variation because they are based on averages. Here, we provide an overview of how variable precipitation affects perennial and annual desert plants, and then implement an innovative, mechanistic approach to examine the effects of precipitation on populations of two desert plant species. This approach couples robust climatic projections, including variable precipitation, with stochastic, stage-structured models constructed from long-term demographic datasets of the short-lived Cryptantha flava in the Colorado Plateau Desert (USA) and the annual Carrichtera annua in the Negev Desert (Israel). Our results highlight these populations' potential to buffer future stochastic precipitation. Population growth rates in both species increased under future conditions: wetter, longer growing seasons for Cryptantha and drier years for Carrichtera. We determined that such changes are primarily due to survival and size changes for Cryptantha and the role of seed bank for Carrichtera. Our work suggests that desert plants, and thus the resources they provide, might be more resilient to climate change than previously thought.

The seeds were separated into short, medium and long sizes. Two experiments used only achenes medium due to differences in the response of germination in the dark, when they were artificially stored in Cerrado soil, in a previous study. The response of achenes short, medium and long to increase flow of white light was observed under a white light gradient from 0 to 46.44 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) creep. The reversal of phytochrome far red (Pfr) in phytochrome red (Pr) in the dark, achenes medium newly collected and stored for 14 months at 4 degrees C, which were imbibed in water for 24 hours and incubated at 35 degrees C for 24, 48 and 72 hours in the dark and germination was 25 degrees C in the dark and observed after 15 and 30 days. Finally, a gradient was constructed photoequilibrium for each size and age of achene in petri dishes moistened with distilled water, and the germination was observed every two days. In irradiances from 0 to 46.44 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), germinability of achenes long and medium sizes increased with irradiance, but the seeds had low germination always short. Achenes medium stored imbibed for 24 h and incubated in the dark for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h at 35 degrees C remained response photoblastic when germination was observed every two days and after 15 and 30 days therefore showed no reversion Pfr for Pr in the dark. However, achenes medium newly collected and subjected to the same treatments were removed when the Pfr incubated for 48 and 72 hours. These achenes showed response very low fluence of light, when germination was observed every two days under green light. The results indicated that heteroblastism can check to the species different strategies of invasion and survival in the savanna: in places with low light availability may occur germination of achenes long, even in the rainy season (February). While short achenes can remain stored in the soil to germinate only come at the end of the dry season (in September). So, the short achene persists in the soil seed bank for seven months and is what allows the establishment of Bidens gardneri at the fields and savannah grasslands.																	0100-6762					NOV-DEC	2012	36	6					1145	1153		10.1590/S0100-67622012000600015							WOS:000314367300015

Seed dormancy and germination characteristics of Astragalus arpilobus (Fabaceae, subfamily Papilionoideae), a central Asian desert annual ephemeral	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Although Astragalus is the largest genus of seed plants, it contains only a relatively few annual species, about which little is known with regard to seed dormancy and germination. Thus, seed dormancy-break and germination were investigated in the cold-desert annual Astragalus arpilobus Kar. et Kir. Most of the seeds had a water-impermeable seed coat that became permeable after mechanical or acid scarification, i.e. physical dormancy. Both wet heat and alternate wet heat and cold (ice water) made only a small portion of the seeds permeable, and neither exposure to high nor to low temperatures was effective in breaking dormancy. Scarified seeds germinated at temperatures ranging from 5/2 to 30/15 degrees C, with 20/10 degrees C and 25/15 degrees C being optimal. Non-dormant seeds germinated to high percentages in light and in darkness across the range of temperatures. Germination percentages did not increase with duration of dry storage at room temperature. Scarified seeds germinated to nearly 100% at water potentials between 0 and -0.30 MPa but to 0% at -0.77 MPa. Seedling emergence was higher for seeds buried at soil depths of 1 and 2 cm than at 0 or >2 cm. Forty-three percent of the scarified seeds sown in July in an experimental garden under natural conditions germinated in autumn, and an additional 5% germinated in spring. In contrast, no non-scarified seeds germinated in autumn, and only 5.3% of them germinated in spring. Most of the non-scarified seeds that did not germinate became part of the persistent seed bank. Our results indicate that the high intensity of hard-seed dormancy in the annual A. arpilobus is similar to that reported for the perennial species of Astragalus. (C) 2012 SAAB.

An updated review of biological information is provided for Avena fatua. A widespread species originating in Eurasia, A. fatua is one of the 10 worst annual weeds of temperate agricultural regions of the world. Key weediness traits of this highly selling species include fecundity, seed shatter, and a large and persistent seed bank with variable degrees of primary seed dormancy. The species occurs in all Canadian provinces and most states in the USA. In Canada, it is most troublesome as a weed in the prairies, where it has spread throughout crop areas in all climatic zones. Depending upon plant density and relative time of emergence, A. fatua competition may reduce annual crop yields by as much as 70%. First cohort emergence of A. fatua coincides with planting and emergence of spring-seeded crops, although additional cohorts can emerge throughout the growing season. Avena fatua is more abundant in zero-than intensive-tillage systems; the former regime promotes earlier and greater emergence because of a shallower and less persistent seed bank. Despite the introduction of highly efficacious herbicides in the 1970s and 1980s, abundance of the species has not declined across the Canadian prairies or elsewhere. The continual evolution of herbicide-resistant A. fatua populations, seed spread via farm machinery, and limited herbicide modes of action for its control threaten sustained annual field crop production in many temperate agricultural areas. Further adoption and integration of multiple non-herbicidal weed management practices, such as enhanced crop seeding rate, competitive crops and cultivars, and precision fertilizer placement, should help mitigate A. fatua interference. The species has some beneficial uses as an alternative feed and food constituent or industrial feedstock, as well as potential in cultivated oat (Avena saliva L.) improvement.

An Application of Plant Functional Types for Predicting Restoration Outcomes	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												We evaluated the restoration of native plant assemblages by topsoil translocation in the Hunter Valley, south-east Australia. Species' responses were characterized by defining nine plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of four response mechanisms (seed bank persistence, germination cues, resprouting mechanisms, and longevity) through which species were predicted to persist or decline following translocation. The effects of community type and delay in topsoil restoration on restoration outcomes were tested in an orthogonal experiment. Changes in species' frequency were detected using Bayesian statistics with prior probabilities derived from pre-clearing data. Few species failed to reestablish following translocation; these were offset by recruitment of other native species not detected prior to clearing. Compositional changes were more pronounced when topsoil was stockpiled (cf direct reinstatement), although there was no trend related to the period of stockpiling. The PFT response model correctly predicted the rank probability of decline in three of the nine PFTs, while a further three were correctly placed in the top ranks but in the incorrect order. Three PFTs were incorrectly ranked because the response model was incorrect. Resprouters declined more frequently than seeders; however, species with physical seed dormancy declined less frequently than those with either transient seed banks or physiological, morphological, or morpho-physiological dormancy, irrespective of resprouting ability. Species with short juvenile periods were more likely to increase. We conclude that PFTs based on fire-response traits represent a practical means of predicting species' responses to translocation and a basis for prioritizing species for supplementary planting.

J	Zivkovic, D; Tellier, A				Zivkovic, Daniel; Tellier, Aurelien			Germ banks affect the inference of past demographic events	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Continuous progress in empirical population genetics based on the whole-genome polymorphism data requires the theoretical analysis of refined models in order to interpret the evolutionary history of populations with adequate accuracy. Recent studies focus prevalently on the aspects of demography and adaptation, whereas age structure (for example, in plants via the maintenance of seed banks) has attracted less attention. Germ banking, that is, seed or egg dormancy, is a prevalent and important life-history trait in plants and invertebrates, which buffers against environmental variability and modulates species extinction in fragmented habitats. Within this study, we investigate the combined effect of germ banking and time-varying population size on the neutral coalescent and particularly derive the allele frequency spectrum under some simplifying assumptions. We then perform an ABC analysis using two simple demographic scenariosa population expansion and an instantaneous decline. We demonstrate the appreciable influence of seed banks on the estimation of demographic parameters depending on the germination rate with biases scaled by the square of the germination rate. In the more complex case of a population bottleneck, which comprises an instantaneous decline and an expansion phase, ignoring information on the germination rate denies reliable estimates of the bottleneck parameters via the allelic spectrum. In particular, when seeds remain in the bank over several generations, recent expansions may remain invisible in the frequency spectrum, whereas ancient declines leave signatures much longer than in the absence of seed bank.

Our study provided a point in time assessment of the standing vegetation and soil-stored vegetation at two experimental sites with treatments of biennial burning, quadrennial burning since 19711972 and no burning since 1969. Vegetation composition, density and richness of certain plant groups in the standing and soil-stored vegetation were influenced by fire treatments. The density of resprouting plants <3 m in height was higher in the biennially burnt treatment than in the unburnt treatment, but resprouters 37.5 m in height were absent from the biennial burning treatment. Obligate seeder richness and density in the standing vegetation was not significantly influenced by the fire treatments, but richness of this plant group in the seed bank was higher in the quadrennial treatment at one site and in the long unburnt treatment at the other site. Long unburnt treatments had an understorey of rainforest species, while biennial burning at one site and quadrennial burning at the other site were associated with greater standing grass density relative to the unburnt treatment. This difference in vegetation composition due to fire regime potentially influences the flammability of the standing understorey vegetation. Significant interactions between fire regime and site, apparent in the standing and soil-stored vegetation, demonstrate the high degree of natural variability in vegetation community responses to fire regimes.																	1442-9985					NOV	2012	37	7					767	778		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02337.x							WOS:000310245300003

M.; Midgley, Jeremy; Haccou, Patsy; Mignot, Agnes; Ronce, Ophelie; Olivieri, Isabelle			Optimal resource allocation in a serotinous non-resprouting plant species under different fire regimes	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Serotiny, the retention of mature seeds in closed fruits within the canopy for over a year, is a common trait in fire-prone environments. When competition with adult plants prevents seedling establishment between fire events and in the absence of post-release soil seed dormancy, strong serotiny, i.e. the retention of all seeds until the next fire, appears as the best strategy. Despite the low levels of inter-fire seed recruitment for several species in both Australian and South African fire-prone environments, considerable variation in the duration of fruit retention is nevertheless observed among species. Our aim is to predict optimal age-specific reproductive schedules in a perennial, serotinous species, when cone maintenance is costly. We focus on species where adults are killed by fire, without a soil seed-bank. We explicitly consider a trade-off between growth (which determines plant survival), seed production and seed maintenance. In our model recruitment relies upon fire events. We use dynamic programming to determine, for given fire regimes, the optimal pattern of resource allocation. We further study the effect of changes in fire regime on the viability of populations adapted to some historical fire regime. We find that, whenever maximal plant survival probability is low, the optimal strategy consists in reducing resource allocation to seed maintenance while increasing resource allocation to annual seed production. This illustrates a trade-off between current and future reproduction. A low rather than a strong level of serotiny should evolve whenever the variance of fire intervals is large and the mean fire interval is low. Low levels of serotiny could constitute a bet-hedging strategy with decreasing predictability of the arrival of fire. Once adapted to some historical fire regime, serotinous populations are highly sensitive to a change in mean fire frequency and to an increase in the variance of fire intervals. Populations adapted to a historically high level of variance in fire return are more robust to changes in fire regime. Synthesis: Life-history trade-offs and low predictability of fire intervals may favour low rather than strong levels of serotiny even when recruitment essentially occurs just after fire events.

This study evaluated the long-term (18-year) impact of different tillage systems on faba bean (Vicia faba L.) productivity, including weed and broomrape incidence, and N-2 fixation. The experiment was carried out on a Vertisol under rainfed Mediterranean conditions. It was set up as a strip-plot design. The tillage systems were: conventional tillage (CT) with moldboard plow, reduced tillage (RT) with chisel plow, and no tillage (NT). Nitrogen fixation was estimated over 2 years in the final phase of the experiment using the N-15 isotope dilution technique. On average, grain yield was 31 % and 23 % higher under NT than under CT and RT, respectively; however, the effect of tillage varied by year. The yield advantage of NT over CT was pronounced when rainfall was scarce. Average broomrape infestation was lower under NT than under CT, but a reduction in tillage intensity resulted in an increase in weed biomass. Tillage had no effect on weed richness, but the use of the NT technique progressively altered the weed composition by determining conditions conducive to the growth of a few weed species that are hard to control. Nitrogen fixation was strongly influenced by tillage, being higher under NT than under CT. The results suggest that NT is a valuable option in the rainfed cereal-legume rotation systems of Mediterranean environments; however, the success of NT technique depends on the use of effective weed control strategies.

J	Li, BT				Li, Bingtuan			Traveling wave solutions in a plant population model with a seed bank	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												We propose an integro-difference equation model to predict the spatial spread of a plant population with a seed bank. The formulation of the model consists of a nonmonotone convolution integral operator describing the recruitment and seed dispersal and a linear contraction operator addressing the effect of the seed bank. The recursion operator of the model is noncompact, which poses a challenge to establishing the existence of traveling wave solutions. We show that the model has a spreading speed, and prove that the spreading speed can be characterized as the slowest speed of a class of traveling wave solutions by using an asymptotic fixed point theorem. Our numerical simulations show that the seed bank has the stabilizing effect on the spatial patterns of traveling wave solutions.																	0303-6812					NOV	2012	65	5					855	873		10.1007/s00285-011-0481-x							WOS:000309871100002	22042534

LONG-TERM, LARGE SCALE BANKING OF Citrus SPECIES EMBRYOS: COMPARISONS BETWEEN CRYOPRESERVATION AND OTHER SEED BANKING TEMPERATURES	CRYOLETTERS												The long-term, large scale application of embryo cryopreservation has been assessed rarely and comparisons of viability loss for partially dried material with conventional seed bank storage conditions infrequently made. Five citrus species were cryopreserved following air drying of embryos (seed minus the testa) and embryonic axes: rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri), pommelo (C. grandis), mandarin (C. reticulata), citron (C. medica) and kagzi lime (C. aurantifolia). Although drying rates to c. 10% moisture content (MC) were approximately 10-times faster for isolated axes compared to embryos, the optimum MCs for cryopreservation were generally similar within a species, varying from c. 10% (C. jambhiri) to c. 20% (C. medica). Nonetheless, the hydration window for cryopreservation of the axis was usually wider than for the embryo. For all species, embryo or axis survival after cryopreservation ranged from 65% to 96% (C. medica axes), producing normal healthy seedlings from embryos and plantlets from axes without intervening callus growth in vitro. Whilst partially dried embryos of all five species survived fully liquid nitrogen vapour storage for 120 days, viability loss was rapid at -20 degrees C, 5 degrees C and ambient temperature, with a maximum interpolated half-life across these temperatures of c. 80 days for C. grandis at 5 degrees C. The developed cryopreservation protocols were applied routinely to cryobank 377 accessions of Citrus germplasm from field genebanks, farmer's orchards, semi-wild and wild sources. After an average of 6.3 to 8.4 years cryo-storage, between 69 and 81% of accessions per species retained >= 70% of the viability after desiccation. The results provide irrevocable evidence for the importance of cryopreservation for the banking of seeds of higher plants.																	0143-2044	1742-0644				NOV-DEC	2012	33	6					453	464									WOS:000313407300006	23250405

Analysis of sustainable pastureland farming in tropics of Deccan Plateau	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES												A study was conducted by an interdisciplinary team covering pasturelands of 9 blocks of Coimbatore, Erode and Karur districts of Tamilnadu, together referred as Kangaym grasslands. Survey of grasslands, laboratory analysis of grass species, seed bank analysis, market study, stakeholder interviews, secondary and primary data collection were the methods employed. Aristida setacea had the highest importance value index (126.9) in species composition followed by Cenchrus ciliaris (49.2). Contribution of grasses to the total dry matter production was 82.50% and that of legumes was 12.42% with an average production of 1.61 t/ha/year. Acacia leucocephala was the most widely planted tree species with an average density of 358.42 plants/ha with DBH of 7.16 +/- 1.13 cm. Among the 10 C. ciliaris accessions, the maximum similarity obtained was 89% between Cenchrus-6 with Cenchrus-4 and 2 major clusters were indicated by dendrogram. Cenchrus spp. dominated the seed bank composition (72.7%). Majority of the farmers (65%) owned sheep. On an average, respondent graze animal for about 6.2 months in the paddocks that contributed more than 80% to its total diet. Balsamodendron berryi was the most commonly used live fence for the paddocks. One-fifth of the respondents reported that livestock contribution to their total farm income was between 75 and 99%. The average family size was 1.55 (G-1), 2.15 (G-2) and 2.4 (G-3) helping them to defer land fragmentation and maintain the big land size (average 10.9 ha).

Seed priming is used to induce pre-germinative metabolism and then enhance germination efficiency and crop yields. It has been hypothesized that priming treatments might also improve stress tolerance in germinating seeds, leaving a sort of 'stress memory'. However, the molecular bases of priming still need to be clarified and the identification of molecular indicators of seed vigor is nowadays a relevant goal for the basic and applied research in seed biology. It is generally acknowledged that enhanced seed vigor and successful priming depend on DNA repair mechanisms, activated during imbibition. The complexity of the networks of DNA damage control/repair functions has been only partially elucidated in plants and the specific literature that address seeds remains scanty. The DNA repair pathways hereby described (Nucleotide and Base Excision Repair, Non-Homologous End Joining, Homologous Recombination) play specific roles, all of them being critical to ensure genome stability. This review also focuses on some novel regulatory mechanisms of DNA repair (chromatin remodeling and small RNAs) while the possible use of telomere sequences as markers of aging in seed banks is discussed. The significant contribution provided by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in elucidating the kinetics of seed aging, in terms of free radical profiles and membrane integrity is reported.

Seedbanks, germination and early survival of bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata) in coastal British Columbia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Early successional species that rely on a seedbank differ in life history from most other species of forested landscapes. Prunus emarginata (bitter cherry) is a shade-intolerant tree that can develop in abundance (>20,000 stems ha(-1)) from a seedbank after disturbance in forests along the northwest coast of North America. It can inhibit growth of commercially valuable conifers, but also provide habitat diversity and appearance-grade wood. We determined (1) seed populations in soil of 15 stands 1 to 140-plus years old (2) emergence and survival from planted seed, along with environmental conditions, for three years in open clearcut, forest edge, and under closed canopy on mineral soil or organic seedbeds and with and without cages to exclude animals, and (3) effects of light and temperature on germination in controlled environments. There, seeds were cold-stratified (0 or 70 days), then exposed to temperature (10, 17, or 25 degrees C) and photoperiod (0, 14 h) treatments, which were interrupted with a second (90 day) cold period. Population densities of filled seed were greatest in 51-75 year-old stands (>10(6) ha(-1)). Of emergence in the field, 0% was in year 1, 79% in year 2 and 21% in year 3; 81% of emergence occurred in the open, 19% at the edge, and 0% under the canopy. Emergence in the open was greatest in caged, mineral soil plots. Survival of emerged seedlings was 18% in the open, but 0% at the forest edge. Seedling emergence occurred mainly in April. In controlled environments, germination began during the second cold stratification, suggesting alternating warm and cold periods were needed to overcome seed dormancy. Germination was greatest at 17 degrees C, but only in combination with the first cold stratification and light. Midday seedbed temperatures partly explain the timing and location of emergence, but diurnal temperature amplitude may be a more important cue of canopy removal. Large accumulations of seed in soil, combined with low emergence and survival rates, can account for the high population densities of seedlings sometimes observed following disturbance. Canopy removal is necessary to maintaining P. emarginata in the conifer-dominated landscape, and the long-lived seedbank allows it to persist between disturbances. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Stimulatory effects of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on seed germination of Orobanche minor Sm.	ALLELOPATHY JOURNAL												The effects of winter wheat varieties exudates were tested on the germination of Orobanche minor seeds through hydroponical culture and field experiments. The results indicated that allelopathic potential of wheat on stimulating O. minor seeds germination varied with tested varieties, growth stages, extraction solvents and extract concentrations. The methanolic extracts of all wheat varieties displayed a stronger induction of O. minor seeds germination than the aqueous extracts. The aqueous extracts at 10% and 1% effectively stimulated the germination, but the undiluted (100%) and 0.1% extracts did not induce the seed germination. Likewise, the methanolic extracts also induced the seeds germination. The methanolic extract of variety 'Xiaoyan No. 22' induced O. minor seed germination up to 56.8%. Thus O. minor seeds could be induced to germinate by the aqueous and methanolic extracts of winter wheat varieties. Winter wheat especially at the seedling and heading stages contained allelopathic substances to induce O. minor seeds germination. It is possible that wheat allelopathy could be used to stimulate the germination of O. minor, thereby rapidly depleting the seed bank of this problematic parasitic weed.

Sulfur Cinquefoil (Potentilla recta) Response to Defoliation on Foothill Rangeland	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Sulfur cinquefoil is an invasive, perennial forb on rangelands of western Canada and the United States. Sulfur cinquefoil reproduces solely by seed and it is a prolific seed producer. Our 2-yr study (2006, 2007) investigated the optimal timing and intensity of defoliation to decrease aboveground productivity and seed production of sulfur cinquefoil plants on foothill rangeland in southwestern Montana. Each year, 150 sulfur cinquefoil plants within a 430-m(2) enclosure were tagged for identification and randomly assigned to one of 15 clipping treatments with 10 plants per treatment. Clipping treatments were conducted at three timings: (preflower [early June], flowering [late June], and seedset [mid-July]) and all possible combinations of timings for a total of seven timing treatments clipped to two stubble heights (7.5 cm or 15 cm), comprising 14 unique treatments. The final (15th) treatment consisted of an unclipped control. Response variables collected at senescence (late July) included aboveground biomass; number of buds, flowers and fruits on each plant; and number and viability of seeds produced. Results indicated that defoliation of sulfur cinquefoil can effectively reduce its yield and seed production. All clipping treatments reduced aboveground biomass of sulfur cinquefoil compared with control plants (P <= 0.05), except clipping to 15 cm during preflowering in the wetter year of 2006. Clipping to either 7.5 cm or 15 cm at all times or combinations of timings reduced the number of buds, flowers, fruits, and seeds produced by sulfur cinquefoil (P <= 0.05). Viable seed production was reduced 99 to 100% when plants were clipped once to either 7.5 or 15 cm during flowering or seedset. Results suggest that targeted livestock grazing or mowing applied one time per season during flowering or seedset could effectively suppress the biomass production and viable seed production of sulfur cinquefoil.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT-DEC	2012	5	4					408	416		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00003.1							WOS:000312282900003

Ecological Characteristics of Sites Invaded by Buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding the ecological characteristics of areas invaded and not invaded by exotic plants is a priority for invasive plant science and management. Buffelgrass is an invasive perennial species that managers view as a major threat to indigenous ecosystems of conservation lands in Australia, Mexico, the United States, and other locations where the species is not native. At 14 sites in Saguaro National Park in the Arizona Uplands of the Sonoran Desert, we compared the soil, vegetation, and soil seed bank of patches invaded and not invaded by buffelgrass. Abiotic variables, such as slope aspect and soil texture, did not differ between buffelgrass patches and patches without buffelgrass. In contrast, variables under primarily biotic control differed between patch types. Soil nutrients, such as organic C and NO3-N, were approximately twofold greater in buffelgrass compared with nonbuffelgrass patches. Average native species richness was identical (14 species 100 m(-2)) between patch types, but native plant cover was 43% lower in buffelgrass patches. Unexpectedly, native seed-bank densities did not differ significantly between patch types and were 40% greater than buffelgrass seed density below buffelgrass canopies. Results suggest that (1) soil nutrient status should not be unfavorable for native plant colonization at buffelgrass sites if buffelgrass is treated; (2) at least in the early stages of buffelgrass patch formation (studied patches were about 10 yr old), native vegetation species were not excluded, but rather, their cover was reduced; and (3) native soil seed banks were not reduced in buffelgrass patches.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT-DEC	2012	5	4					443	453		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00012.1							WOS:000312282900007

Demographic studies were carried out at two site named as site 'A' and site 'B'. Plants exhibited Deveey type I survivorship curves, characteristic of annuals. Populations of C. viscosa were found to be highly dynamic on spatial scale. Soil moisture content, competition and grazing were some of the factors responsible for the considerable variations in the plant density and growth of plants. Plants inhabiting site 'B; exhibited better vegetative and reproductive growth due to greater amounts of soil nutrients and high water holding capacity of the soil (thereby providing better soil moisture regime). C. viscosa at both the sites possessed persistent seed bank. The below ground seed bank was much diverse than the above ground vegetation. C. viscosa produced light weighted seeds in large numbers. Wind is the predominant agent for the dispersal of seeds. Seeds traveled grater distances mainly due to their lighter weights and taller mother plants.				Shaukat, S.

J	Casanova, MT				Casanova, Michelle T.			Does cereal crop agriculture in dry swamps damage aquatic plant communities?	AQUATIC BOTANY												The response of swamp vegetation to cropping was measured by analysis of the seed bank present (as a measure of swamp resilience) and a survey of the extant vegetation (as a measure of swamp integrity). Samples of seed bank were exposed to a germination stimulus, the plants that germinated and established were identified, and the density of emergent vegetation was assessed. Surveys of the extant vegetation after flooding in cropped and uncropped swamps indicated that the plant communities establishing after the different treatments were different. Cropping results in a reduced diversity and density of plants, although swamp plant communities retain some resilience to such disturbances. Cropping also affects germination from the seed bank of these wetlands. The degree to which cropping is a threatening process to swamp plant communities and their dependent fauna will depend on whether vulnerable elements can return to swamps, which in turn depends on swamp management, connectivity and landscape level processes. As the climate changes and wetlands become more temporary and flooding less reliable, recognition and conservation of the processes that maintain biodiversity in the landscape will become more important.

SHORT SEED LONGEVITY, VARIABLE GERMINATION CONDITIONS, AND INFREQUENT ESTABLISHMENT EVENTS PROVIDE A NARROW WINDOW FOR YUCCA BREVIFOLIA (AGAVACEAE) RECRUITMENT	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the Study: The future of long-lived stand-forming desert plants such as Yucca brevifolia (Joshua tree) has come into question in light of climate variation and landscape-scale disturbances such as wildfire. Understanding plant establishment dynamics is important for mitigating the impacts of disturbances and promoting revegetation. Methods: We placed Y. brevifolia seeds in shallow caches and manipulated granivore access, nurse shrub effects, and the season of cache placement to determine conditions for seed germination and seedling establishment. Key Results: Greatest seedling emergence occurred during spring and summer, when increased soil moisture was accompanied by warm soil temperatures. Late winter-spring emergence for cached seeds was enhanced beneath shrub canopies, but seedling survival declined beneath shrubs as temperatures increased in spring. Germinability of seed remaining in the soil was reduced from 50-68% after 12 mo residence time in soil and declined to <3% after 40 mo. Following dispersal from parent plants, seeds are either removed by granivores or lose germinability, imposing substantial losses of potential germinants. Conclusions: Specific germination and establishment requirements impose stringent limits on recruitment rates for Y. brevifolia. Coupled with infrequent seed availability, the return rates to prefire densities and demographic structure may require decades to centuries, especially in light of potential changes to regional desert climate in combination with the potential for fire recurrence. Demographic patterns are predicted to vary spatially in response to environmental variability that limits recruitment and may already be apparent among extant populations.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				OCT	2012	99	10					1647	1654		10.3732/ajb.1200099							WOS:000310197500017	23028005					
J	Cseresnyes, I; Csontos, P				Cseresnyes, Imre; Csontos, Peter			Soil seed bank of the invasive Robinia pseudoacacia in planted Pinus nigra stands	ACTA BOTANICA CROATICA												Pinus nigra and Robinia pseudoacacia are exotic trees used for afforestation in Hungary. Pinus nigra was non-invasive, however R. pseudoacacia escaped from cultivation and invaded several vegetation types including pine plantations. It has recently been planned to cut P. nigra plantations and replace them by native tree stands, especially in nature reserves. The scattered presence of R. pseudoacacia specimens in pine stands might place constraints on planned tree replacement because of their vegetative resprouting and recolonization from an established seed bank. The aim of this study was to investigate the soil seed bank under the canopy of solitary R. pseudoacacia specimens found in P. nigra plantations. Altogether 250 soil samples were collected from the 0-6 and 6-12 cm soil layers under solitary Robinia trees of varying ages (with basal areas between 62.4 and 1089.3 cm(2)). Seeds were separated by sieving then scarified and germinated. Seed bank density ranged between 640 and 2285 seeds m(-2) with an average distribution of 82.7% and 17.3% in the upper and lower soil layer, respectively. Total density of the seed bank and also the seed bank ratio of the lower soil layer increased with tree age. The accumulated seed bank of R. pseudoacacia should be considered in the careful planning of tree replacement operations in Pinus nigra stands.

The Population Dynamics and Ecological Effects of Garlic Mustard, Alliaria petiolata, in a Minnesota Oak Woodland	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata (M. Bleb.) Cavara & Grande, is an introduced biennial forb that has commonly been referred to as highly invasive and as having substantial negative effects on other plants in the eastern deciduous forests of North America. However, several recent studies have documented only modest effects on other plant species, raising questions as to the extent of the threat really posed by A. petiolata. Alliaria petiolata often exhibits an alternating two-year life-history cycle, with high rosette years alternating with high flowering stem years. It has been proposed that this cycle is partly driven by intraspecific competition between the stems and the rosettes. In a two-year study, we extensively sampled A. petiolata in a Minnesota woodland at two spatial scales, including 6.5 km of belt transects in a 6.8 ha study grid (20 X 20 m cells) and 90 small sampling quadrats (1.0 X 0.5 m) within the grid. At the large scale, we compared seed bank abundance and diversity of other herbaceous plants with A. petiolata abundance. Using the monitoring data we also investigated whether this population was exhibiting an alternating two-year life-history cycle, consistent with the intraspecific competition hypothesis for this phenomenon. At the small scale, we compared A. petiolata abundance with the abundance of other plants, including herbs, ferns, shrubs, and tree seedlings. We also conducted an ex-situ pot experiment in which we planted seeds of six tree species in soil collected from dense A. petiolata patches and soil collected where A. petiolata was absent and recorded emergence rates and seedling growth over an 8 wk period. Overall, we found little evidence that A. petiolata was negatively affecting other plant species. This is consistent with other recent studies and indicates that, despite earlier claims to the contrary, A. petiolata seems to be more a product than an agent of change in eastern North American deciduous forests. We also documented an alternating two-year life-history cycle, providing additional evidence to support the hypothesis that this cycle is at least partly being driven by intraspecific competition.

J	Dhileepan, K				Dhileepan, Kunjithapatham			Reproductive Variation in Naturally Occurring Populations of the Weed Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae) in Australia	WEED SCIENCE												Parthenium weed, an annual herb native to tropical America, causes severe economic, human, and animal health and environmental impacts in Australia and in many countries in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. There is little known about variation in reproductive output in naturally occurring populations of this weed. This information is vital to develop plant population models, devise management strategies to reduce seed output, and formulate parthenium weed pollen-induced human health (e.g., dermatitis and hay fever) risk assessment. Here, the variations in the number of capitula produced by the parthenium weed at two sites in Queensland, Australia, over a 4-yr period are reported. Under field conditions, parthenium weed produced up to 39,192 capitula per plant (> 156,768 seeds per plant), with majority of the plants (approximate to 75%) producing between 11 and 1,000 capitula, and less than 0.3% of the plants producing more than 10,000 capitula (> 40,000 seeds per plant). The number of capitula per plant in the field (297 +/- 22) was much lower than those reported from glasshouse and laboratory studies. Plant biomass contributed to 50 to 80% of the variation in capitulum production between plants within plots at each site, and weed density accounted for 62 to 73% of the variation in capitulum production between plots within each site. As plant size is directly correlated with reproductive output, plant size distributions in parthenium weed can be used to estimate effective population size. Information on variation in reproductive output will be used to implement management strategies to reduce parthenium weed seed output, resulting in reduced soil seed bank and weed seed spread.

Morphological and physiological responses of Triglochin buchenaui Kocke, Mering & Kadereit to various combinations of water and salinity: implications for resilience to climate change	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Impacts of abiotic factors on low lying salt marsh species have been closely evaluated as unique stressors, but few studies have determined the physiological and morphological responses to predicted climate change conditions. This study investigated the effects of water state (tidal, flooded and drought) and salinity on Triglochin buchenaui Kocke, Mering and Kadereit, newly separated from the Triglochin bulbosa L. complex. Growth, proline concentration, relative water content, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll concentration and morphological analyses were done following 3 months of treatments. Results showed significant variation in height (7.57 +/- A 0.5-29 +/- A 1.55 cm, p < 0.005, df = 55), leaf area increments and relative growth rates which decreased with increasing salinity under all water states. There was almost a cessation of growth under submergence which reduces the plant's regeneration potential under these conditions. Proline accumulation (1.84 +/- A 0.23-3.36 +/- A 0.38 mg g(-1) DW), response of photosynthetic pigments and electrolyte leakage (8.17 +/- A 0.80-38.36 +/- A 7.42 % mu S g(-1) FW) were fundamental to osmotic and membrane response regulation. Plants survived in all water states at salinity up to 45 ppt, but the optimum range was 0-18 ppt, and best water state was the tidal condition. Viable rhizomes were produced under drought conditions but in the absence of seed banks, regeneration of the species following prolonged submergence may not be possible due to absence of both rhizomes and seeds. In their natural habitat, highly succulent T. buchenaui plants (29 +/- A 1.55 cm tall and above) are indicative of freshwater conditions.

J	Koenig, J; Griffiths, A				Koenig, Jennifer; Griffiths, Anthony			The Population Ecology of Two Tropical Trees, Brachychiton diversifolius (Malvaceae) and Bombax ceiba (Bombaceae), Harvested by Indigenous Woodcarvers in Arnhem Land, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We describe the population ecology of two tropical deciduous trees, Bombax ceiba leiocarpum A. Robyns and Brachychiton diversifolius R. Br., which are in high demand for Indigenous sculpture production in Arnhem Land, Australia. We monitored tagged populations of both species at two locations for 2 years to examine their reproduction, growth, and survival rates and their response to harvest. Both species have similar life histories: they reproduce during the dry season (June-November) producing a high seed load, seed predation was high, seeds did not survive in the soil past the following wet season to form a seed bank, and germination rates were low and variable for both species. Average annual circumference growth rates were 1.07 cm year(-1) for B. ceiba and 0.98 cm year(-1) for B. diversifolius, with most of the growth occurring during the early wet season. Most (65-88 %) of the harvested B. ceiba and B. diversifolius stems coppiced. Coppice and stem size class were the main factors influencing tree growth rates with coppice stems growing up to six times faster than similar sized non-coppice stems. The survival of B. ceiba and B. diversifolius stems was size class dependent and affected by local site factors (e.g. fire and other disturbances) so that the smaller size classes had a low probability of survival. Given the resprouting potential of both species, their wild harvest is likely to have only minimal local impact on wild populations. However, further population modelling is required to determine whether the small and disjunct B. ceiba populations can sustain harvesting at current levels.

Effects of flood timing and livestock grazing on exotic annual plants in riverine floodplains	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Riverine floodplains around the world are highly prone to invasions by exotic species. While many processes have contributed to floodplain invasions, two theories have received particular attention: (i) replacement of native perennials by exotic annuals following historical livestock grazing and (ii) terrestrialization because of fewer floods following river regulation. We assessed how exclusion of grazers and flooding in different seasons affected established populations of exotic annuals in an 8-year experiment. We hypothesized that effects of season of flooding would vary depending on timing in relation to annual plant life cycles and that outcomes may be affected by interactions between grazing and flooding. Flooding in any season reduced exotic annuals to <2% cover and converted a dryland flora dominated by exotic annuals to a wetland flora dominated by native perennials. However, flood effects may be short lived, as areas flooded in 1 year supported abundant exotics the next. Grazer exclusion and interactions between grazing and flooding did not affect cover of exotic annuals, although grazing depleted native perennials in recently flooded areas. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the terrestrialization hypothesis, short-duration floods provide a practical method for controlling exotic annual plants where river regulation has reduced the frequency of natural floods. As exotic impacts are greatest in dry periods, when exotics are most abundant, ecosystem benefits will be greatest when flooding leads to a protracted decline in exotic annuals during the dry (non-inundated) years following flood recession. Otherwise, reductions in exotic annuals may be transient and have little positive impact on floodplain ecosystems and processes.

Which are the possible mechanisms underlying vegetation change, addressing in particular the relative role of competition and dispersal limitation? What are the implications for grassland management? Location Mesophyte semi-natural grassland in southeast Estonia (58 degrees 06'37'' N, 27 degrees 4'14'' E). Methods We decreased grassland productivity by adding sugar and increased productivity by fertilizing in a 10-yr experiment, using four plot scales for treatments. We also conducted sowing experiment with Plantago lanceolata as a phytometer and describe the soil seed bank in experimental plots. Results We found that in comparison to control plots, fertilization decreased species richness, increased the dominance of a few species and prevented the establishment of sown P. lanceolata. Although the sugar treatment decreased the standing crop, plant communities diverged little from the control over the 10 yr. Beta-diversity decreased over time in the control and sugar-treated plots, and increased in the fertilized plots. In plots with the least fertilization, species richness began to increase from year 9, probably due to the immigration of species from outside the treatment area. There were several grassland species in the surrounding vegetation or in the seed bank, but these did not appear in the sugar-treated plots over the 10-yr experimental period. Conclusions The short-term response of grassland communities to changing productivity is driven by competition, presumably most importantly by competition for light, and the role of dispersal limitation is small. However, long-term dynamics in the community where the standing crop decreased is dispersal-limited. Given that there is a source of additional species, local immigration may reverse the decrease in diversity due to eutrophication. Biomass removal and the suppression of productivity (soil fertility) are primary goals of semi-natural grassland management and also during the creation of sown grassy strips at field margins, but in the case of grassland restoration, enhancement of long-distance arrival of grassland species should be supported.

J	Kaeser, MJ; Kirkman, LK				Kaeser, Melanie J.; Kirkman, L. Katherine			Seed longevity of 12 native herbaceous species in a fire-maintained pine savanna after 8 years of burial	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Restoring the fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem in the southeastern United States has become a regional conservation priority in recent years and development of cost-effective approaches to restoration is a major objective. An improved understanding of the potential role of persistent seed banks in the longleaf pine ecosystem and reliance on the seed bank for restoration efforts could contribute to reduced costs associated with restoration. We used a buried seed bag method to determine seed banking potential of species within three common families (Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Asteraceae) and a rare, endangered member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the longleaf pine ecosystem. Seeds were exhumed 1, 2, 4, and 8 years after burial and tested for viability. Species within the Fabaceae showed the greatest potential for forming long-term persistent seed banks with seed viability 50% or greater after 8 years of burial. Some species in the Poaceae, Asteraceae, and Orobanchaceae form transient or short-term persistent seeds banks. The ability of some species to form short- or long-term persistent seed banks may in some cases make it possible to rely on the seed bank for native species re-introductions on sites scheduled for restoration.

Drought-mediated stem and below-ground bud dynamics in restored grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Does the below-ground bud bank mediate response to drought in restored grasslands? Location Platte River Valley region of south-central Nebraska, USA. Methods We imposed severe drought for one growing season using rainfall manipulation structures and measured the response of above- and below-ground plant communities (ramet and below-ground bud densities) with respect to non-drought controls during the drought year and a recovery year. Results Drought reduced below-ground bud bank density and above-ground stem density. However, bud bank density recovered, and bud production was higher on previously droughted subplots relative to controls in the year following drought. The response of below-ground bud and above-ground stem density to drought differed according to functional identity (C3 grass, C4 grass, and forb), with forbs least resistant to, but having the greatest recovery from, drought. Conclusions While overall density in restored grasslands was resilient, drought effects on below-ground bud banks may have longer-term impacts on plant community structure. Reduced density above- or below-ground during the growing season following drought may allow for the persistence of species relatively more reliant on recruitment from seed banks in favourable micro-sites.

J	Webb, JA; Wallis, EM; Stewardson, MJ				Webb, J. Angus; Wallis, Elizabeth M.; Stewardson, Michaell J.			A systematic review of published evidence linking wetland plants to water regime components	AQUATIC BOTANY												We used the Eco Evidence method for systematic review to analyze the literature for evidence of causal relationships between components of wetland water regimes (waterlogging, inundation, depth, duration, frequency, timing) and their effects on plant establishment, growth, reproduction, assemblage composition and diversity. Using systematic keyword searches of Thompson ISI's Web of Science, we located 102 studies. Some studies examined multiple water regime components and/or plant characteristics. Overall, the papers yielded 281 pieces of evidence relevant to 38 cause-effect hypotheses. Of these papers, 49% studied plant growth responses. Inundation and water depth were the most-commonly studied water regime components (55% of papers each). Very few studies considered flood frequency (4 studies) or timing (8 studies), and in many cases there was insufficient evidence to test the effect of these components on wetland plants. Overall, our results show that increases in the magnitude of water regime components are related to negative effects on plant characteristics. Within this, the strongest set of results related inundation depth to negative impacts on nearly all plant characteristics (we found a positive relation for shoot length). Waterlogging (as opposed to complete inundation) was generally related to improvements in plant characteristics, but there was insufficient evidence to test several hypotheses. A large number of hypotheses (17) showed inconsistent effects of water regime components, reflecting the diversity of responses of different plant taxa, wetland types, and study methods. We were unable to find sufficient evidence to test 10 of the hypotheses, and are confident that these represent true knowledge gaps that can only be filled by future targeted research. Evidence of causal links improves our understanding of the water requirements of wetland plants. Such evidence can inform the development of environmental flow programs to maintain and restore wetland plant communities on regulated rivers. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Genetic diversity and structure in the annual vernal pool endemic Limnanthes vinculans Ornduff (Limnanthaceae): implications of breeding system and restoration practices	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Many California vernal pool plants are endangered requiring information on genetic diversity and structure to inform conservation efforts. We determined the temporal, and range-wide population genetic status of the outcrossing endangered vernal pool forb Limnanthes vinculans, endemic to Sonoma and Napa Counties with 10 microsatellite markers. Allelic diversity was threefold higher than in an endangered self-pollinating congener. Most populations showed heterozygote deficiency indicating past bottlenecks, inbreeding or genetic drift. Analysis of molecular variance and Bayesian ordination revealed genetic distinction at the county scale (F (CT) = 0.158); within Sonoma County, population genetic distinctions were lower (F (SC) = 0.043). Eight gene flow barriers demarcated most natural populations (F (ST) > 0.05). We found temporal genetic structure among six natural populations (F (ST) = 0.07). We conclude that breeding system and natural, anthropogenic, and temporal seed inputs combined to influence the patterns of genetic variation we found in natural and created populations informing conservation of the species.																	1566-0621					OCT	2012	13	5					1365	1379		10.1007/s10592-012-0380-8							WOS:000307762000016						
J	Chauhan, BS				Chauhan, Bhagirath Singh			Can knowledge in seed ecology contribute to improved weed management in direct-seeded rice?	CURRENT SCIENCE												Direct-seeded rice is an emerging production technology in Asia due to labour and water scarcity. However, weeds are an important biotic constraint in the production of direct-seeded rice. Manual weeding is becoming less common and herbicides are replacing manual weeding to manage weeds in direct-seeded systems. However, there are concerns about the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds and shifts in weed flora. Therefore, there is an interest among scientists to evaluate cultural weed management strategies to improve weed management in direct-seeded rice systems. Weed seed banks are the main source of weed infestation in any crop. Depleting the weed seed bank should be the main aim of cultural weed management strategies. Better understanding of the factors affecting seed germination and seedling emergence could help in the development of effective cultural weed management strategies through either suppressing germination or encouraging germination when emerged seedlings can be easily killed. Weed seed germination and emergence are influenced by light exposure, seed burial depth, use of residue as mulches and flooding of soils. However, the factors affecting weed seed germination and seedling emergence are poorly understood in Asia.

ALLOCATION TRADEOFFS AMONG CHAPARRAL SHRUB SEEDLINGS WITH DIFFERENT LIFE HISTORY TYPES (RHAMNACEAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the Study: California chaparral shrub species have different life history types: Nonsprouters (NS) are killed by fire and persist through a fire-stimulated seed bank; facultative sprouters (FS) reestablish by a combination of vegetative sprouting and seeding; and obligate sprouters (OS) reestablish exclusively by sprouting. Nonsprouters and FS establish seedlings in opencanopy postfire environments, whereas OS establish seedlings between fires in the shady understory. We hypothesized that allocation differences among seedlings of postfire sprouters and nonsprouters and regeneration niche differences would lead to contrasting patterns in biomass accumulation (NS > FS > OS, in sun; OS > FS > NS, in shade). Methods: Seedlings of three species from each life history type were grown in sun and 75% shade. We measured net carbon assimilation and biomass accumulation after one year. Key Results: Biomass accumulation was similar in the sun except FS>OS. In the shade, NS had lower biomass than FS and OS. Assimilation rates, nitrogen relations, and allocation differences could not fully explain biomass accumulation differences. Instead, biomass accumulation was inversely related to water-stress tolerance and shade tolerance. Additionally, OS and FS differed in root/shoot allocation even though both are sprouters. Conclusions: Seedling growth and carbon assimilation rates were divergent among three life history types and were consistent with differences in tolerance to water stress and shade or sun regeneration niches, but not tradeoffs in sprouting-related allocation differences per se.

The different temperature and storage times tested did not affect the vigor seed germination as indicated by the measures of plant growth and survival. The different temperatures used did not cause changes in the carbohydrate composition. The tegument cell walls were rich in lignin, arabinose and xylose.

Upon field abandonment, the seed bank becomes a potentially important mechanism of natural regeneration at early successional stages. Soil properties and climate seasonality may affect seed bank characteristics, thus we analyzed the effects of these two factors on seed bank density and composition in agricultural fields of a seasonally dry tropical region of southern Mexico. Soil cores were collected for the rainy and the dry seasons in order to assess changes occurring in the seed bank from the time of harvest to the moment when succession could potentially start (the next rainy season). The 12 studied fields comprised three different soil types recognized by local inhabitants: sandy and stony, silty, and clayey soils, locally known as cascajo, black soil, and red soil, respectively. At each field 20 soil cores (8 cm diameter, 4.5 cm depth) were collected and mixed to form four pooled samples, which were placed in a greenhouse to induce germination. A total of 4,422 seedlings (2,291 seeds m(-2)) representing 40 species were recorded. The most abundant species were, in decreasing order, Melanthera nivea, Rhynchelytrum repens, Waltheria indica, Amaranthus scariosus, Digitaria bicornis, and Cenchrus pilosus. Herbs were the prevailing growth form (> 80% of total richness). No clear pattern was observed in the seed bank related to soil type; however, seed bank characteristics tended to be associated with the time of use of the agricultural fields, a variable that was not controlled in the study. Seed bank species richness was significantly larger in the dry season, and although seed density showed a similar trend, it was not significant. The studied seed banks contain no elements of the regional primary tropical dry forest, which suggests that seed banks in deforested areas cannot guarantee their maintenance beyond forested areas.

J	Risberg, L; Granstrom, A				Risberg, Lotta; Granstrom, Anders			Seed dynamics of two fire-dependent Geranium species in the boreal forest of southeastern Sweden	BOTANY-BOTANIQUE												We analyzed critical life-history variables for two rare fire-dependent annual Geranium species in southern Sweden, which are today threatened because of effective fire suppression. At recently burned sites with abundant recruitment, seedlings occurred only where the humus layer had been completely removed by smoldering fire. Emergence depths ranged 1-6 cm in the mineral soil. Soil sampling at four sites revealed that in unburned soil Geranium seeds were located only in the mineral soil. Surprisingly, residual seeds were still present where fire had burned away the humus layer. An experiment showed that both species deposit seeds relatively evenly within a radius of 5-6 m, through ballistic dispersal. Repeated sampling in the field over a 2-year period after seed dispersal at one site indicated a low rate of seed depletion, corroborated by an indoor incubation of seeds. Our results show that successful management of these species depend on deep-burning prescribed fire, which can only result after severe drought. On the other hand, the seed bank is extremely long-lived, as viable seeds were present at a site last burned 200 years ago. This well-protected seed bank will likely buffer against both ill-timed fires and occasional failure in the recruiting seedling populations.																	1916-2790					SEP	2012	90	9					794	805		10.1139/B2012-045							WOS:000308475900002						
J	Gabler, CA; Siemann, E				Gabler, Christopher A.; Siemann, Evan			Environmental Variability and Ontogenetic Niche Shifts in Exotic Plants May Govern Reinvasion Pressure in Restorations of Invaded Ecosystems	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												When restoring ecosystems dominated by exotic plants, reinvasion pressure, or the rate of new exotic recruitment following mature exotic removal, can vary broadly between similarly invaded habitats. Reinvasion pressure strongly influences restoration costs and outcomes but is difficult to predict. Ontogenetic niche shifts (ONSs, changes in niche breadth or position during development) in exotic species paired with interannual variation in abiotic conditions may decouple pre-removal mature exotic density and average reinvasion pressure. Identifying such decouplings could improve restoration efficiency by informing site selection and management strategies, but requires estimates of average reinvasion pressure that mandate greater understanding of its principle drivers. We hypothesize that reinvasion pressure is predominantly driven by exotic propagule abundance and spatiotemporal availability of realized recruitment windows, which are periods of variable duration that permit exotic establishment from propagules. Realized recruitment windows are based on the safe sites concept but account for ONSs and are determined by abiotic conditions and interspecific interactions with recipient communities. Biotic resistance or facilitation may increase or decrease times required for establishment by influencing exotic growth rates or altering niche availability and may permit or preclude establishment in marginal abiotic conditions. We discuss factors influencing reinvasion pressure, basic approaches to estimate reinvasion pressure, and potential ways to increase management efficiency under different reinvasion pressure scenarios. Accurate estimates of reinvasion pressure could improve restoration efficacy, efficiency, and predictability in ecosystems dominated by exotic plants. We argue that greater theoretical and practical considerations of reinvasion pressure and ONSs are merited.																	1061-2971					SEP	2012	20	5					545	550		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00901.x							WOS:000308399600001

Soil seed banks in a mature coniferous forest landscape: dominance of native perennials and low spatial variability	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Soil seed banks are important to vegetation recruitment, ecosystem functioning and land management. We evaluated composition of 0-5 cm soil seed banks and relationships of seed banks with forest community types (ranging from low-elevation pinyon-juniper to high-elevation bristlecone pine), vegetation cover and environmental variables within a 40,000-ha relatively undisturbed coniferous forest landscape in Nevada, USA. We collected samples from 36 sites and used the emergence method to assay seed banks. Seed density averaged 479 seeds m(-2) across sites and a total of 39 taxa were detected. Most (79%) of these taxa were perennials and 35 of 39 (90%) were native. Moreover, 62% of seed-bank taxa were in the vegetation of mature forests, an uncommon finding in studies of forest soil seed banks. Seed-bank density, species richness and composition did not display strong relationships with forest community types, vegetation cover or environmental variables. Weak relationships likely arose from the relatively uniform seed-bank density among sites, where 50% of sites had seed densities in the range of 106-282 m(-2). Results suggest that while seed banks on this landscape are not large, they provide recruitment potential for some native perennial species of mature, relatively undisturbed communities.																	0960-2585					SEP	2012	22	3					207	217		10.1017/S0960258512000074							WOS:000308118400007

Fire as a threatening factor for endemic plants of the Canary Islands	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The endemic flora of the Canary Islands is remarkable but highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Several factors, such as fire, could be threatening. The purpose of this study was to analyze various treatments in endemic threatened species which could have been growing in the understory of the Canary pine forest. We attempted to improve germination through dormancy breaking, and analyze the influence of fire on these plants. Seven physical and chemical treatments were tested: control, mechanical scarification, boiling water, dry heat (50 and 120 A degrees C), smoke and smoked water. Mechanical scarification showed a positive response in germination percentage in two species characterized by hard seed coat, but out of all of the species tested, only one demonstrated a positive response to any of the treatments related to fire. At the temperatures registered on wildfires, neither the seeds situated on the aerial structure nor seeds in seed bank seem to be able to survive and germinate. The increasing incidence of fires through anthropogenic causes could contribute to the current threat status of these species and poorness of the Canary pine forest understory.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				SEP	2012	21	10					2621	2632		10.1007/s10531-012-0321-3							WOS:000307533100014

Location Australia, applying data from arid central to monsoonal northern regions (1126 degrees S, 129138 degrees E). Methods With reference to a substantial sub-continental floristics dataset, we first assigned the fire response (obligate seeder, resprouter) and seedbank persistence (transient, dormant) of rapid and longer-maturing (> 3 years) woody taxa. Using logistic regression, we then modelled the proportions of taxa possessing these traits as a function of mean annual rainfall (highly correlated with fire frequency) and terrain roughness (a measure of topographic variability) in 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees and 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells. Separate assessments were undertaken with datasets for 1264 sclerophyll and 236 rain forest taxa. Results This woody flora is characterized by taxa exhibiting mostly resprouting and dormant seedbank traits that promote site persistence. While numbers of obligate seeder and resprouter taxa were related positively to both rainfall and roughness, the relative abundance of both sclerophyll and rain forest obligate seeders decreased significantly with rainfall. The relative abundance of sclerophyll (especially long-lived) obligate seeders alone increased with topographic roughness. The proportion of taxa with transient seedbanks increased with rainfall in resprouters generally, and in rain forest obligate seeders alone. Main conclusions We find that resprouters are favoured on more productive, fire-prone sites, and obligate seeders are favoured in less productive, more fire-protected settings. Seedbank persistence responses are more variable. These findings concur generally with theoretical constructs, and support comparable assessments in Australian and other fire-prone systems ranging from mediterranean to boreal environments. Our observations illustrate that resprouting and obligate seeding syndromes, but not necessarily seedbank persistence, are useful predictors of vegetation responses to changing fire regime conditions at large landscape scales.

Dispersal and microsite limitation in Australian old fields	OECOLOGIA												The recovery of native communities after cultivation may be constrained by (a) the failure of species to reach a site or (b) their failure to survive once there. Although seed addition is a common method to test for seed versus microsite limitation, most studies do not follow populations beyond seedling establishment, nor do they measure seed dispersal. We examined dispersal across native grassland/old field boundaries and investigated the relative importance of seed and microsite limitation across multiple life-history stages and generations. Seed trapping showed little movement of native seeds into old fields and that most species had extremely localized dispersal. Consequently, there was no pattern of seed density with distance from boundaries, and similarity between the seed rain and standing vegetation was moderate to high. Seed addition showed that two annual species were able to establish in all, and flower in most, subplots in the first year, and that seedling establishment increased with sowing density, consistent with seed limitation. However, the relative importance of microsite limitation increased over the lifespans of the species. Density dependence reduced the number of flowering plants, resulting in a large decline in seedling density in the following generation. This decline continued so that the initial positive effect of sowing density on seedling numbers disappeared by the fourth generation and hence the persistence of populations is uncertain. Thus, by monitoring seed dispersal and following experimental populations beyond seedling establishment, we showed that dispersal limits species distributions, but microsite plays an important role in limiting population growth and persistence.																	0029-8549					SEP	2012	170	1					221	232		10.1007/s00442-012-2285-0							WOS:000307757600020	22388691

We expect that, in areas with large-scale land use changes, legacies from previous land uses persist and affect current ecosystem responses to climate-associated disturbances like fire. This study analyses whether post-fire vegetation dynamics may differ according to specific historical land use histories in a Mediterranean forest landscape of about 60,000 ha that was burnt by extensive fires. For that, we assessed land use history of the whole area through the second half of the XXth century, and evaluated the post-fire regeneration success in terms of: (i) forest cover and (ii) tree species composition (biotic-dispersed, resprouter species, Quercus spp. vs. wind-dispersed species with or without fire-resistant seed bank. Pinus spp.). Results showed that stable forest areas exhibited a higher post-fire recovery than younger forests. Furthermore. the longer since crop abandonment translates into a faster post-fire recovery. Results highlight that to anticipate the impacts of disturbances on ecosystems, historical land trajectories should be taken into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seed size influence on germination responses to light and temperature of seven pioneer tree species from the Central Amazon	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												In Amazon secondary forests are dominated by pioneer species that typically produce large amounts of small and dormant seeds that are able to form a persistent soil seed bank. Seed dormancy in this group of species is overcome by environmental conditions found in open areas, such as high irradiation or alternating temperatures. Nevertheless, a variety of germination responses to environmental factors is known among pioneers; some of them may germinate in diffuse light or in darkness condition at constant temperature. Seed mass can be considered as one of the factors that promotes this variety. Regarding species with very small seeds, it seems that the trigger for germination is light and for larger seeds temperature alternation may be a more important stimulus. In this study we established a relationship between seed mass and germination response to light and alternating temperature for a group of seven woody pioneer species from the Amazon forest. We found that an increase in seed mass was followed by a decrease in the need for light and an increase in the tolerance to alternating temperatures. Understanding germination strategies may contribute with the knowledge of species coexistence in high diverse environments and also may assist those involved in forest management and restoration.																	0001-3765					SEP	2012	84	3					759	766		10.1590/S0001-37652012000300018							WOS:000308263900018	22886162

Does long-term fire exclusion in an Australian tropical savanna result in a biome shift? A test using the reintroduction of fire	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The structure of tropical savanna ecosystems is influenced by fire frequency and intensity. There is particular interest in the extent to which long-term fire exclusion can result in a shift from savanna to forest vegetation that is not easily reversed by the reintroduction of fire. This study examined changes in the structure and composition of a long-unburnt site within the northern Australian savannas following an extended period of active fire exclusion (>20 years), and the effect of the reintroducing fire through experimental fire regimes, including fires in the early and late dry season at a range of frequencies. After the long period of fire exclusion, the vegetation community was characterized by a well-developed midstorey and canopy layer, low grass cover, substantially higher densities of woody sprouts and saplings than frequently burnt savanna. The community composition included a high proportion of rainforest-affiliated species. Three years of experimental fires had no detectable effect on the overall composition of grass layer and woody plants but had an effect on woody vegetation structure. Continued fire exclusion further increased the density of woody stems, particularly in the midstorey (2.04.99 m), whereas moderate-intensity fires (>800 kW m-1) significantly reduced the density of midstorey stems. The reintroduction of higher moderate intensity fire events resulted in the vegetation in some compartments reverting to the open savanna structure typical of frequently burnt sites. Such rapid reversibility suggests that in general, the woody thickening resulting from long-term fire exclusion did not represent a biome shift to a non-savanna state. However, there was a small proportion of the site that could not sustain the fires applied to them because grass cover was very low and patchy and therefore appeared to have crossed an ecological threshold towards closed forest.

As a putative allelochemical it inhibits seed germination and seedling growth. Using Lepidium sativum as a model target species, experiments were conducted to investigate how environmental cues modulate MyA's interference with key processes of seed germination. Time course analyses of L. sativum testa and endosperm rupture under different light conditions and water potentials were combined with quantifying testa permeability, endosperm weakening, tissue-specific gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) contents, as well as embryo growth and apoplastic superoxide production important for cell expansion growth. Lepidium sativum testa permeability and early water uptake by imbibition is enhanced by MyA. During late germination, MyA inhibits endosperm weakening and embryo growth, both processes required for endosperm rupture. Inhibition of embryo cell expansion by MyA depends on environmental cues, which is evident from the light-modulated severity of the MyA-mediated inhibition of apoplastic superoxide accumulation. Several important key weakening and growth processes during early and late germination are targets for MyA. These effects are modulated by light conditions and ambient water potential. It is speculated that MyA is a soil seed bank-destroying allelochemical that secures the persistence of M. gale in its flood-prone environment.

Aboveground plant community and seed bank composition along an invasion gradient	PLANT ECOLOGY												Invasive plants can reduce plant diversity and abundance in native grassland communities; however, the effect on the native seed bank is less clear. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of invasion by the exotic grass old world bluestem (OWB; Bothriochloa spp.) on native aboveground plant species composition and seed bank diversity and abundance (i.e., cover, density). In this central Great Plains grassland, OWB invasion had differential effects on native diversity and abundance of both aboveground and seed bank plant communities. Native plant species diversity and cover showed a steep decline as OWB cover increased. No change in native seed density or richness was observed in response to OWB invasion, however, OWB seed density increased with increasing invasion, thus increasing total seed density. Our results indicate that as OWB invasion increases, the native plant community decreases in diversity and abundance. Although, no effect on native seed bank diversity and density was observed in this study, as native seeds are lost through a loss of native species in the plant communities, native seed bank diversity and density is expected to decline.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				SEP	2012	213	9					1461	1475		10.1007/s11258-012-0104-7							WOS:000307718300008						
J	Parsons, RF				Parsons, R. F.			Incidence and ecology of very fast germination	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												A group of flowering plant species is known to germinate h less than 24h from imbibition, but this phenomenon is often overlooked in the current literature. Here, I review this topic by searching the literature published since 1967 and listing the 28 most detailed cases found. Of these, 20 are species of Amaranthaceae (all formerly treated as Chenopodiaceae); 15 of these are from the subfamily Salsoloideae, which is characterized by the possession of spiral embryos. The non-chenopods listed are small numbers of species from the families Acanthaceae, Cruciferae, Gramineae (one species) and Salicaceae (Populus and Salix). Seeds of the Salsoloideae contain fully differentiated embryos. On imbibition, the embryo cells elongate and the spiral embryo uncoils and ruptures the thin seed coat. This can occur in as little as 10 min. Nearly all of the families showing very fast germination have small to very small seeds and little or no endosperm. Most species have soft, thin seed coats that imbibe water readily. All are from high-stress habitats, either arid or saline or from active floodplains, where they can rapidly exploit temporarily favourable conditions for germination. They exhibit one of two contrasting germination behaviours, either having seeds which all germinate within a very short time of wetting or having seed persistence whereby small amounts of rain cause germination of small fractions of seed from a long-living soil seed bank. Serious confusion in the literature in the use of the term 'opportunistic' is pointed out and clarified.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				SEP	2012	22	3					161	167		10.1017/S0960258512000037							WOS:000308118400002

Consequences for growing genetically-modified sugar beet - A modelling approach	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Weed beet cannot be controlled by herbicides in sugar beet (except via height-selective applicators) as it is a crop relative, descending from accidentally flowering sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) crop plants either because of vernalization during cold springs, or presence of a dominant bolting allele in sugar beet seed lots due to cross-pollination by annual wild beet (B. vulgaris ssp. maritima) in seed production areas. A second, minor source of weed beet are crop roots lost during harvest. These roots ("groundkeepers") can reproduce in the year after sugar beet and potentially contribute to weed beet dynamics and gene flow. Bolting, flowering and seed production timing and potential of groundkeepers were measured in field experiments. Bolting and flowering were faster in groundkeepers vs. weed beet; flower and seed production was lower in groundkeepers but the latter were less sensitive to competitive crops. The measured parameters were used to introduce a ground-keeper life-cycle into the GENESYS-BEET model which quantifies the effects of cropping systems on weed beet in landscapes. Simulations over several years showed weed beet dynamics to be more sensitive to groundkeeper parameter values than to root loss at sugar beet harvest. Groundkeepers were identified as a key source of weed beet populations and of gene escape from novel sugar beet varieties (e.g. genetically-modified herbicide-tolerant varieties) in the absence of crop bolters. The control of the latter, either by manual weeding or by genetic improvement of sugar beet varieties, was shown to be essential for controlling weed beet populations and avoid the advent of herbicide-tolerant weed beet.

J	Gardarin, A; Durr, C; Colbach, N				Gardarin, Antoine; Duerr, Carolyne; Colbach, Nathalie			Modeling the dynamics and emergence of a multispecies weed seed bank with species traits	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Models quantifying the effects of cropping systems on weed life-cycles, in interaction with environmental conditions, are invaluable tools to evaluate and design integrated cropping systems. In the past, we have developed such a model called ALOMYSYS for a single grass weed species. The objective of the present paper was to extend the monospecific emergence model to a multi-specific weed flora, by removing a few non-generic processes (e.g. maternal effects on dormancy and germination) and by adapting the germination sub-model to a larger diversity of species. The model is based on a daily simulation of weed seedbank mortality, seasonal dormancy variations, germination and pre-emergent growth until seedling emergence, in interaction with cropping systems and environmental conditions. In order to parameterize the model for numerous and contrasting species, we developed an innovative approach consisting in estimating 25 parameters from easily accessible species traits or from empirical expert knowledge. Relationships were established between seed traits (e.g. seed coat thickness, mass or shape) and seed mortality rates, dormancy levels, speed of germination as well as pre-emergent mortality. Base temperature for germination and dates of dormancy variations were related to usual dates of the species emergence in fields, obtained from expert knowledge. The generic model structure and the trait-parameter relationships make it possible to simulate a wide diversity of weed species and to predict their response to a large range of cropping systems. Thanks to a daily time-step and the integration of the interactions with soil and climatic conditions, FLORSYS permits to optimize the choice of cultural techniques for weed management, as a function of field characteristics and previous technical operations. For instance, the model was used to compare the emergence of different weed species depending on tillage, in interaction with the preceding technical operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

MONOCULTURE VIA SOIL SEED RESERVES	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The relationship between soil seed reserves and degree of infestation by common weed species (Avena fatua L., Convolvulus arvensis L., Cyperus rotundus Pers., Fumaria parviflora Lamk., Phalaris minor Ritz. and Solanum nigrum L.) was assessed for from five wheat fields. Soil sampling was carried out before sowing season in fields where wheat crop was grown. Soil from two profiles (0-8 and 8-15cm) was taken from five sites within each field and seed bank size was estimated via seedling emergence. A considerable number of viable weed seeds of the species were quantified from both soil profiles. More viable seeds were found in the lower soil profile than the surface layer. C. rotundus had the greatest seed bank size followed by C. arvensis, F. parviflora and A. fatua. respectively. S. nigrum had the lowest values for the attribute. The study indicated that seed reserves of these species can be a major source of weed infestation in wheat fields. It is likely that seeds are transferred to the surface layer by tillage and give rise new weed population that cause infestation. Moreover, seed population seems to be demographically well adapted through fecundity, seed size and longer viability. The study suggested an integrated approach for weed management and control to minimize yield losses particularly in situations where weed species persist through soil seed reserves.																	0556-3321					AUG	2012	44	4					1375	1379									WOS:000309314400032

Viable seed banks under grazing and exclosure conditions in montane mesic grasslands of Argentina	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Grazing by large herbivores affects the composition of established vegetation and seed banks. Montane Pampas grasslands are highly productive and have evolved with the influence of grazing by native herbivores. Thus we proposed, firstly that grazing by feral horses would increase seed bank diversity, without changing seed density in grazed areas and secondly that there is a greater similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in exclosure areas. The study area is located in sub-humid montane grassland in mid-eastern Argentina. Sampling took place at the beginning and end of summer in 2008 and 2009, in three one-year-old exclosures and grazed areas. Soil and litter samples were collected and established vegetation cover was visually recorded in every area. Each sample was elutriated and sieved. Seed composition was recorded using a dissecting microscope. Seed density and species richness of the samples was analyzed using ANOVA and species composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Grazing reduces the seed density and richness of grasses, but forb species are not affected. The seed density of grasses increases in soil samples at the end of summer, while the density of forb species does not change. Similarity between the established vegetation and the seed bank was low. Grazing affects seed bank composition which could limit restoration time after the removal of herbivores. However, grass seed availability increases considerably during a short period after exclosure establishment, showing high potential for recovery in sub-humid grasslands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Effects of elevated nitrogen and exotic plant invasion on soil seed bank composition in Joshua Tree National Park	PLANT ECOLOGY												We investigated the effects of exotic species invasion and 3 years of nitrogen (N) fertilization on the soil seed bank in Joshua Tree National Park, California, USA at four sites along an N deposition gradient. We compared seed bank composition and density in control (no N added) and fertilized (30 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) plots to determine if the seed bank would reflect aboveground changes due to N fertilization. Soil samples were collected and germinated in a greenhouse over 2 years. In the field, invasive species cover responded positively to N fertilization. However, we did not observe increased seed density of exotic invasive species in fertilized plots. While no significant differences were detected between treatments within sites, exotic invasive grass seeds overwhelmed the seed bank at all sites. Significant differences between sites were found, which may be due to differences in level of invasion, historic N deposition, and soil surface roughness. Sites experiencing low N deposition had the highest seed bank species richness for both control and fertilized treatments. Aboveground plant density did not correlate well with seed bank density, possibly due to the inherent patchiness of soil seed banks and differential ability of species to form seed banks. This seed bank study provided insight into site-specific impacts on native versus invasive species composition of soil seed banks, as well as magnitude of invasion and restoration potential at invaded sites.																	1385-0237					AUG	2012	213	8					1277	1287		10.1007/s11258-012-0085-6							WOS:000306694200007						
J	Evju, M; Hagen, D; Hofgaard, A				Evju, Marianne; Hagen, Dagmar; Hofgaard, Annika			Effects of disturbance on plant regrowth along snow pack gradients in alpine habitats	PLANT ECOLOGY												Human disturbance in alpine habitats is expected to increase, and improved knowledge of short-term recovery after disturbance events is necessary to interpret vegetation responses and formulate planning and mitigation efforts. The ability of a plant community to return to its original state after a disturbance (community resilience) depends on species composition and environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze initial short-term effects of disturbance in alpine plant communities in contrasting climates (oceanic vs. continental; central Norway). We used a nested block-design to examine vegetative regrowth and seedling recruitment after experimental perturbation. Three plant community types along the snow pack gradient were exposed to (1) no disturbance, (2) clipping, and (3) clipping and uprooting. Slow vegetative regrowth and low seedling establishment rates were found in dry alpine ridges and late-melting oceanic snowbed communities. Leeside habitats with intermediate snow conditions were found more resilient. The difference was related to growth form and species diversity. Woody species, which dominated in ridges and oceanic snowbeds, showed the most negative response to disturbance. Species-rich plant communities dominated by graminoids and herbs showed higher rates of regrowth. Species richness seems to cause resilience to the plant communities through higher response diversity. Plant communities at the extreme ends of abiotic gradients, ridges and late-melting snowbeds, will be most sensitive to both disturbance and environmental change. In an up-scaled human-used landscape disturbance effects will be amplified and further limit recovery to a pre-disturbance state.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				AUG	2012	213	8					1345	1355		10.1007/s11258-012-0094-5							WOS:000306694200013

Double-Crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) Nesting Effects on Understory Composition and Diversity on Island Ecosystems in Lake Erie	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The context for this study is the management concerns over the severity and extent of the impact of cormorants on island flora in the recent past on Lake Erie islands. Accordingly, this study sought to quantify the nesting colonies' influence on coarse woody litter and how nest densities and litter depth may influence the herbaceous layer, the seed bank composition and viability across the extent of three Lake Erie islands. The data for this study were collected from 2004 to 2008 on East Sister Island and Middle Island using two main strategies. First, herbaceous layer surveys, cormorant nest counts, soil seed bank cores, and litter depth measurements were executed using a plotless-point quarter method to test island-wide impacts from nesting activities (data were also collected on a third island, West Sister Island as a reference for the other two islands). Secondly, a sub-sample of the entire plot set was examined in particularly high nesting density areas for two islands (Middle Island and East Sister Island). Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that there are subtle changes in the herbaceous diversity (total, native and exotic) and seed bank composition across the islands. The sub sample set of the plots demonstrated that Phalacrocorax auritus nest density does influence litter depth, herbaceous species abundance and diversity.

However, there remains a risk to the interior herbaceous layer of the island if the effects of nesting pressures at the edges advance inward from this perimeter.																	0364-152X					AUG	2012	50	2					304	314		10.1007/s00267-012-9878-6							WOS:000306174200011	22643824

The potential for endozoochorous dispersal of temperate fen plant species by free-roaming horses	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Can free-roaming Konik horses digest and subsequently disperse seeds of plant species growing in a temperate fen environment? Which species have the potential to be dispersed internally (endozoochory), and do they share common plant and seed traits? How could potential dispersal via endozoochory impact upon grazing management and the natural recolonization of wetland vegetation at a landscape scale? Location Wicken Fen NNR, Cambridge, UK. Methods Twelve dung samples were collected for one calendar year (Jun 2009May 2010) from a free-roaming herd of Konik horses grazing vegetation at Wicken Fen NNR. Germinable seed content of the dung was determined by means of a seedling emergence study. Species presence and estimated cover/abundance were recorded for the grazed (background) vegetation in spring and summer 2009. Results Almost one-third of all species present in the background vegetation were also identified in the dung samples. There was an equal split between graminoids and forbs, but substantially more graminoid germinable seeds. Species were dispersed year-round, with the number of species peaking in Sep and again in Dec. Of the 13 traits measured, there were significant differences between dung and background vegetation for six traits. Mean values for seed release heights (minimum and maximum) and dispersule weight were significantly lower in species found in the dung, whilst dung species had significantly greater numbers of seeds per shoot, inferred Ellenberg nitrogen values and seed bank persistence. Conclusion Year-round free-roaming grazing has the potential to make a considerable contribution to the long-range dispersal of species growing in temperate fen habitats, and is likely to complement alternative dispersal strategies. However, germination and establishment of species post-dispersal fate will be governed by a wide range of environmental conditions.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				AUG	2012	15	3					359	368		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2011.01172.x							WOS:000305936800007						
J	Sharpe, PJ; Baldwin, AH				Sharpe, Peter J.; Baldwin, Andrew H.			Tidal marsh plant community response to sea-level rise: A mesocosm study	AQUATIC BOTANY												Recent evidence from field surveys suggests that periodic saline intrusions into tidal freshwater wetlands may not reduce plant species richness and that reductions in richness may not occur until a more consistent brackish salinity regime develops. In a greenhouse experiment using tidal wetland mesocosms, we tested the hypothesis that plant species richness of coastal marshes (wetlands dominated by herbaceous plants) would be similar under oligohaline (0.5-5) and freshwater conditions (<0.5) (psu; practical salinity units), provided that propagules of salt-tolerant species were present. We also hypothesized that plant community responses would depend on inundation frequency. Species richness was highest in fresh and oligohaline treatments (<5, 11-13 species per mesocosm) and decreased with increasing salinity up to 12. Inundation frequency did not significantly influence species richness. Aboveground biomass decreased weakly as salinity increased, but the difference between salinity treatments was significant only at the 0.1 level. Flooding did not significantly alter aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass was not significantly influenced by either salinity or flooding treatments (P<0.05). Biomass of individual species and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis indicated a shift toward salt-tolerant plant communities with increasing salinity, but detected little influence of inundation. These findings suggest that species composition shifts may prevent strong reductions in biomass due to loss of individual species as salinity increases, and that community composition will change more rapidly in response to increases in salinity than to inundation increases. Also, saltwater intrusions into low-salinity marshes of up to 6 will not create an immediate and significant reduction in species richness assuming propagules of salt-tolerant plants are available and given the tolerance of many Fresh/Oligohaline species observed in this study to salinity levels >= 6. However, the species composition of fresh and oligohaline wetlands can shift toward a less species-rich brackish plant community within a single growing season under prolonged salinity exposures of 12.

J	Chauhan, BS; Singh, RG; Mahajan, G				Chauhan, Bhagirath Singh; Singh, Ravi Gopal; Mahajan, Gulshan			Ecology and management of weeds under conservation agriculture: A review	CROP PROTECTION												Tillage has been known to cause soil erosion and cost time and resources and this affects productivity and inflates the cost of production. Therefore, over the past few years in many countries, there has been a growing trend toward conservation agriculture (CA) to enhance sustainability without compromising land productivity. Three important pillars of CA are minimal tillage operations, permanent residue cover, and rotation of primary crops. Adoption of CA, however, influences weed populations differently from conventional agriculture. Weed control in CA is a greater challenge than in conventional agriculture because there is no weed seed burial by tillage operations and soil-applied herbicides are not incorporated, resulting in reduced efficacy. The behavior of weeds and their interaction with crops under CA tend to be complex and not fully understood. A large proportion of weed seed bank remains generally on or close to the soil surface after crop sowing under CA. Weed species, in which germination is stimulated by light, are likely to be more problematic in CA. In addition, in the absence of tillage, perennial weeds may also become more challenging in this system. On the other hand, weed seeds present on the soil surface are more prone to desiccation and greater predation activity of insects, especially ants. Crop residues, when uniformly and densely present, under CA could suppress weed seedling emergence, delay the time of emergence, and allow the crop to gain an initial advantage in terms of early vigor over weeds. Where pre-emergence herbicides are applied, crop residues may also intercept a considerable proportion of the applied herbicide and may result in lower herbicide efficacy. Approaches such as stale seedbed practice, uniform and dense crop establishment, use of cover crops and crop residues as mulch, crop rotations, and practices for enhanced crop competiveness with a combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicides could be integrated to develop sustainable and effective weed management strategies under CA systems.

A population dynamics study involving fire and precipitation	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Shrub encroachment is the advance of woody plants over grasslands. For some shrub species this process is favoured by fire and high precipitation. In northwestern Patagonia spring precipitation is related with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Over the past years, ENSO has shown an increase in both amplitude and frequency. Our study focuses on the population dynamics of the shrub Fabiana imbricata Ruiz & Pav. (Solanaceae) using stochastic models which involve different fire frequencies and variations in spring precipitation. Our results indicate that F. imbricata's population grows at a wide range of fire frequencies, reaching its maximum every 6-10 years. The elasticity analysis show that, as fire frequency diminishes, population growth rate depends almost exclusively on adult survival, recruitment events are rare and the presence of seedlings or juveniles is seldom observed. In this case, the landscape would be formed by mature E imbricata shrublands, and population persistence would depend on adult survival, seed production and their accumulation in the soil bank. However, in the case of very high fire frequencies, more recurrent recruitment pulses would be observed, with a landscape dominated by young shrublands composed of individuals of different ages and reproductive status.

Martijn			The importance of plant-soil interactions, soil nutrients, and plant life history traits for the temporal dynamics of Jacobaea vulgaris in a chronosequence of old-fields	OIKOS												We examined to what extent temporal dynamics of Jacobaea vulgaris cover in old-fields were related to plantsoil feedback, soil nutrients, seed availability and performance, and seedling establishment. Long-term measurements at an experimental field and in ten old-fields representing a chronosequence following land abandonment revealed a remarkably similar hump-shaped temporal pattern of J. vulgaris cover, which peaked at about five years after abandonment. In a plantsoil feedback study, J. vulgaris biomass of plants grown in soil from all chronosequence fields was lower than in sterilized control soil. However, biomass of J. vulgaris in the feedback study was lower when grown in soil collected from fields with a high density of J. vulgaris plants than in soil from fields with a low density of J. vulgaris. When plants were grown again in the conditioned soil, a strong negative plantsoil feedback response was observed for soils from all fields. These results indicate that soils from all stages of the chronosequence can develop a strong negative soil feedback to J. vulgaris, and that there is a positive relationship between J. vulgaris density and the subsequent level of control by the soil community. In a common-garden experiment with turfs collected from the chronosequence fields in which J. vulgaris was seeded, seedling establishment was significantly lower in turfs from older than from young fields. In a seed bank study the number of emerging seedlings declined with time since abandonment of the field. In conclusion, negative plantsoil feedback is an important factor explaining the hump-shaped population development of J. vulgaris. However, it is not operating alone, as propagule availability and characteristics, and competition may also be important. Thus, in order to explain its contribution to plant population dynamics, the role of biotic plantsoil interactions, soil nutrients and life history characteristics along successional gradients should be considered from a community perspective.

J	Miller, AD; Roxburgh, SH; Shea, K				Miller, Adam David; Roxburgh, Stephen H.; Shea, Katriona			Timing of disturbance alters competitive outcomes and mechanisms of coexistence in an annual plant model	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY												Ecological disturbance is inherently a multi-faceted phenomenon; disturbance events can differ in distinct quantifiable aspects, such as intensity, duration, spatial extent, and time since last disturbance. Though effects of disturbance timing (specifically, time within a season) have been investigated empirically, theoretical work is lacking, in part because effects of disturbance may depend on the timing relative to the life cycle of the species in question. To demonstrate a theoretical basis for the effects of timing, we develop a model of annual plants subject to soil disturbance. We show that timing of disturbance can have significant effects on community composition. In addition, we quantify the mechanisms of coexistence acting under different timing regimes and show that differences in timing lead to different coexistence mechanisms. Specifically, we find that early disturbance (which enhances germination from the seed bank) generates the storage effect, whereas coexistence under late disturbance (which reduces adult fecundity and contributions to the soil seed bank) depends more on relative nonlinearity of competition. We discuss these two distinct mechanisms within the context of the underlying ecological processes, and we also briefly consider the broader implications of our analyses for disturbance timing in real communities. Our findings extend ecological disturbance theory by linking timing to specific competitive outcomes and can be applied to a wide range of disturbance-prone communities. Because we identify the underlying mechanisms resulting from different disturbance timings, our results can potentially inform theory for conservation and invasive species management practice.

J	Mikschofsky, H; Broer, I				Mikschofsky, Heike; Broer, Inge			Feasibility of Pisum sativum as an expression system for pharmaceuticals	TRANSGENIC RESEARCH												Based on its high protein content and excellent storage capacity, pea (Pisum sativum), as well as other plants, is considered to be a suitable production platform for protein-based pharmaceuticals. Its capacity to produce high proportions of active recombinant proteins (up to 2% total soluble protein corresponding to approximately 8 mg/g fresh weight) has been proven using pea-derived strong seed-specific promoters. The active antigens produced were also stable for more than 4 years. Pea can be used as a feed additive, up to a proportion of 30% to total feed, despite the presence of lectins. Thus, a low dosage of recombinant pea-based pharmaceuticals is non-hazardous. In addition, it is independent of N-fertilisation, has excellent biosafety characteristics and is accessible to gene transfer. Growth systems with a capacity for high yield are available for the greenhouse (5 t/ha) and, to a limited extent, also in the field (2.3 t/ha). The practicable establishment of pea seed banks allows a continuous production process. Although the use of a pea system is limited by complex transformation procedures, these advantages render pea a promising plant for the production of pharmaceuticals.																	0962-8819	1573-9368				AUG	2012	21	4					715	724		10.1007/s11248-011-9573-z							WOS:000306283500003	22057506

Spatial pattern and composition of the Florida scrub seed bank and vegetation along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question How does spatial pattern and composition of the seed bank and its relationship to above-ground cover vary across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient of intact Florida rosemary scrub, degraded scrub and improved pasture? Location Florida rosemary scrub, Lake Wales Ridge, Highlands County, FL, USA (27 degrees 11'N, 81 degrees 21'W). Methods In nine grid plots located in intact Florida rosemary scrub, degraded scrub and improved pasture, we assessed percentage vegetation cover and seed bank composition. Results The vegetation was dominated by long-lived perennials, while the seed bank was dominated by short-lived species. Shrubs were the dominant above-ground cover in rosemary scrub, sub-shrubs and the spike moss Selaginella arenicola in degraded scrub and non-native grasses in pastures. Scrub forbs were dominant in the seed bank of rosemary scrub, similar amounts of sedges, ruderal forbs and scrub forbs in degraded scrub, and ruderal species and sedges in pastures. Species absent from the vegetation were randomly distributed in the seed bank, while species present above-ground had an aggregated spatial distribution. In rosemary scrub, scrub forb seed banks were spatially aggregated and were positively associated with conspecific species above-ground and with litter cover. These patterns were not observed in degraded scrub, perhaps due to reduced shrub and increased bare ground. Conclusion Our results suggest that reduced shrub cover and increased bare ground in the degraded scrub may explain why there is less spatial aggregation of scrub forbs in the seed bank. Restoration of Florida rosemary scrub in pasture sites will require species reintroduction of appropriate scrub species; restoration of degraded scrub should emphasize increasing shrub cover to restore habitat spatial structure.

The first Australian populations of C. bonariensis, where it is known as flaxleaf fleabane, were confirmed resistant to glyphosate in 2010. Control with alternative herbicides in fallows has been inconsistent, with earlier research indicating that weed age could be a potential contributing factor. In two field experiments, the impact of weed age (one, two and three months) was measured on the efficacy of six non-selective herbicide mixtures and sequential applications for control in fallows. In another two experiments we evaluated 11 non-selective herbicides, mixtures and sequential applications applied to one and three month old weeds using higher rates on older weeds. When herbicide rates were consistent for different weed ages, efficacy was reduced only by an average of 1% when two month old weeds were treated compared to one month old weeds. However when applied to three month old weeds, efficacy of treatments was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by 3-30%. When herbicide rates were increased, weed age had no adverse effect on efficacy, which ranged from 90 to 100%, for amitrole, glyphosate mixed with 2,4-D amine plus picloram, and three sequential application treatments of glyphosate mixtures followed with bipyridyl products. Thus, this problem weed can be controlled effectively and consistently at the rosette stage of one to two months old, or three month old weeds with several different treatments at robust rates. These effective glyphosate alternatives and sequential-application tactics will minimise replenishment of the soil seed-bank and further reduce the risk for further evolution of glyphosate resistance.

Early life-history stages drive community reassembly in Australian old-fields	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Do native annual forb seedling communities reassemble after agricultural abandonment to an undisturbed condition? Do environmental changes associated with cultivation affect seedling establishment? Is post-abandonment recovery of seedling and vegetation communities more limited by seed availability, seedling establishment or seedling survival? Location Northern Victoria, Australia. Methods Seedling density, species richness and composition were sampled across a 100-yr chronosequence. Standing vegetation, cover of the biological soil crust and soil properties were sampled from the same plots, and the seed bank was sampled from the same sites. Patterns were compared among the seedlings, seed bank and vegetation. Results Native seedling density and species richness did not increase with time-since-abandonment, despite some recovery in species composition. Native density and richness were negatively associated with soil fertility and bare ground and positively associated with biological soil crust cover; exotics showed the opposite pattern. Species composition showed little association with soil resources. Percentage field emergence from the seed bank was unaffected by time-since-abandonment. Compositional similarity between the seedlings and vegetation was higher (81%) than that between the seedlings and seed bank (61%); neither was affected by time-since-abandonment. Conclusions While environmental conditions partially determined patterns of seedling recruitment, seed availability was the main driver of seedling density and composition with time-since-abandonment. Post-establishment mortality was apparently not a major determinant of species composition of the standing vegetation. Thus, seed and microsite limitation interacted to drive community reassembly, but seed availability was relatively more important.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				AUG	2012	23	4					721	731		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01382.x							WOS:000305959600012

Distribution, habitat ecology, soil seed bank and seed dispersal of threatened Lindernia procumbens and alien Lindernia dubia (Antirrhinaceae) in the Czech Republic. - Phyton (Horn, Austria) 52 (1): 39-72, with 5 figures. Using recent data on wetland flora, vegetation, soil seed bank and seed dispersal, gathered in various parts of the Czech Republic, we compared the distribution and ecology of two wetland annuals, the native and threatened Lindernia procumbens (KOCKER) PHILCOX and the alien L. dubia (L.) PENNELL. While L. procumbens was documented in 16 localities in the Czech Republic, L. dubia only occurred in 9. The size of well-established populations of L. dubia, amounting to thousands of individuals, is, however, much larger than that of L. procumbens populations. Large differences in the population size of both species are also reflected in the density of the soil seed bank and the seed dispersal potential. We found that the alien L. dubia is able to colonize habitats with a broader range of moisture conditions and a longer duration of substrate exposure, i.e. with a higher cover of perennial plants. For L. procumbens, large inter-annual fluctuations in the size of populations are typical, as well as the preference for habitats with a short summer drainage. Both species survive unsuitable climatic or habitat conditions in the soil seed bank. Three populations of L. procumbens were only found due to the seed bank analysis because this species did not occur in the vegetation of the studied ponds. We found that small seeds of both Lindernia species can be spread by water and on rubber boots. For L. dubia, we also confirmed seed dispersal via vehicles used in fish farming. Source populations in fish storage ponds can help the survival of threatened L. procumbens in fishpond areas, but they also drive the invasion of neophyte L. dubia.

Don (Leguminosae) in Italy: first cases of naturalization. Anales lard. Bot. Madrid 69(2): 193-200. The first two cases of naturalization of Acacia cyclops are reported for Italy. Young trees were observed growing in the wild some 15 years ago on Linosa (Pelagie Islands, Strait of Sicily). A decade later, this alien plant should no longer be considered as a casual, since a very intensive process of self-sown regeneration has been observed in some plantations on Lampedusa, the major island of the same Archipelago. The available literature suggests the need for careful monitoring of the ongoing invasion process, as A. cyclops has already shown a very invasive behaviour elsewhere within Mediterranean-type biomes due to its ability to withstand high environmental stresses. As migrating birds are suspected to have played an important role in facilitating the arrival of A. cyclops, further propagules are likely to reach the islands in the future. We recommend that new plantations of A. cyclops should be forbidden, but that extant naturalized populations should be managed instead of eradicating them. In fact, the effect of Acacia plantations warrants investigation at different scales in order to assess their impact on local plant-diversity and ecological succession processes.

Spatial environmental variation affects seed survival and germination in artificial seed banks in a Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) metapopulation	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												PERONI, P.

Spatial environmental variation affects seed survival and germination in artificial seed banks in a Silene halibut, (Caryophyllaceae) metapopulation. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 139: 290-298. 2012.-This study was conducted to determine the effects of time and spatial environmental heterogeneity on the survival and germination of artificial Show latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) seed banks. Replicate packets of Silene latifolia seeds were buried at depths of 5 cm at five randomly selected locations at each of two sites located within a southwestern Virginia metapopulation. Samples of seeds from each site and location within site were exhumed periodically over a 3.5 yr period and examined for germination during burial. Seeds that had remained intact during burial were placed into growth chamber germination trials. Thirty-six to 59% of seeds remained intact (i.e., not germinated) and viable at the end of the 3.5 yr period. Germination during burial represented the primary avenue of loss from the seed bank and varied significantly among locations within sites for the 2.5 and 3.5 yr exhumations, and between sites at the 3.5 yr exhumation. The results suggest that appreciable proportions of buried Silene latifolia seeds are able to remain intact, but viable in the study environments over a 3.5 yr period. Germination during burial accounted for most losses from the seed bank, and varied significantly among locations within sites, which suggests that the ability of Silene latifolia seed banks in this metapopulation to serve as demographic buffers for local populations may be highly dependent on local environmental factors. Spatial environmental variation in seed bank persistence could contribute to the development or maintenance of genetic structuring within both local populations and the metapopulation.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL-SEP	2012	139	3					290	298		10.3159/TORREY-D-12-00016.1							WOS:000310407200006

In this study we tested the hypothesis that the germination of seeds of seedbeds from Semidecidual Seasonal Forest (SSF) is inhibited under the canopy of exotic trees. Fifty (50) single samples of soil were collected (0.25 x 0.25 x 0.05 m) in a fragment of SSF; the samples were homogenized and from that new samples were taken and submitted to four (4) treatments: 10 samples were deposited in the greenhouse (SMN-CV); other 10 were returned to the forest fragment understory (SMN-MN); 10 were deposited on the soil under homogeneous canopy of Pinus elliottii (SMN-P) and the last 10 samples were allocated under homogeneous plantation of Eucalyptus sp (SMN-E). We also collected samples of soil under the canopies of P. elliottii (SP-CV) and Eucalyptus sp.(SE-CV) that were transferred to a greenhouse. The number of seedlings was counted at intervals of 15 days in each seedbed sample and the plants obtained were identified when possible. We obtained 515 plants from 15 botanical families, 21 genera and 13 morphospecies. The analysis of variance and comparison of means by Tukey-Kramer 0.01% showed no statistical differences between the treatements. Outcomes indicate that the low density and diversity of plants in P. elliottii and Eucalyptus sp understory are not directly corelated to suppressive effects promoted by the presence of these species, supporting recent data from literature that stands out the forest plantations of exotic species as possible areas for biodiversity conservation, in opposition to the designation of "green deserts" that are assigned to them.

The potential impact of climate change on groundwater-fed wetlands in eastern England	ECOHYDROLOGY												Wetlands are fragile ecosystems that provide a range of useful functions. However, such ecosystems have been experiencing persistent pressures and stresses from a range of socio-economic drivers in the last few centuries. In the 21st century, changes in global climate are expected to have impacts on hydrological and water supply regimes, which will in turn impose additional pressures on wetlands. Consequently, the need for quantitative methods to evaluate the likely impact of climate change is essential if appropriate conservation strategies and integrated water management regimes are to be developed. In this paper, a methodology is presented to evaluate the implications of potential climate change on groundwater-fed wetlands underlain by an unconfined limestone (Chalk) aquifer in eastern England, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in the UK. A daily weather generator, a recharge model and a groundwater model have been coupled to investigate the most extreme consequences of future climate change as described by the UKCIP02 high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Simulations showed that a declining trend in wetland water levels could result in loss of species with a small tolerance to dry conditions by the end of the 21st century.

Investigations of the soil seed banks of invasive plant species and changes in the composition and structure of resident seed banks following plant invasions can provide valuable insight into the long-term implications of plant invasions. Soil seed banks play a major role as reservoirs of species and genetic diversity and allow for the persistence of a species at a locality, buffering environmental changes that may occur over time. Despite the emerging body of literature on ecological impacts of invasive plants on the diversity of resident communities, the long-term implications of impoverished soil seed banks for vegetation dynamics and ecosystem functioning have only recently begun receiving attention. Evidence has so far indicated that there is a correlation between the invasiveness of a species and the characteristics of its seed bank, and that changes in the seed banks of resident communities associated with plant invasions affect their biotic resistance to primary and secondary invasions. To promote the study of soil seed banks in the context of invasive species, we (i) summarize the functional roles of soil seed banks; (ii) describe how the capacity to form a seed bank may contribute to a species' invasiveness using data from the flora of the Czech Republic, showing an increasing representation of species capable of forming long-term persistent seed bank from casual to naturalized to invasion stage; (iii) assess the impact of invasive plants on seed banks of resident communities, including the potential creation of conditions that favour secondary invasions by other alien species or native weeds, and long-term implications of such impact; and (iv) describe the potential effects of climate change on the soil seed bank in the context of plant invasions. We conclude with highlighting promising avenues for future research on invaded soil seed banks, and emphasize the importance of this knowledge in the development of control programs and restoration strategies.

To test the allelopathic effect was carried experiments of pre and post-emergence with seeds of L. sativa and to quantify the stock of seeds, soil samples were collected from three specimens at three distances from the stem (1, 2 and 3 m) and at three depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15cm) in the region of savanna in the dry and wet seasons. The samples tested in bioassay of pre-emergence no significant influence on germinability, mean germination time and mean germination speed, but showed a difference in the synchronism of germination, these data were independent of sampling station. In test for post-emergence was observed statistical difference in the parameters evaluate (length of primary roots and hypocotyls) in both seasons. To quantify the natural seed bank were macroscopic analysis of each soil sample with the help of stereoscopic microscope. The analysis of the natural seed bank showed a larger number of seeds in the 0-5cm and in distance of 2m for both seasons. The results suggest the presence of allelochemical substances in soil samples collected under the canopy of Copaifera langsdorffii.

Germination response and viability of an endangered tropical conifer Widdringtonia whytei seeds to temperature and light	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The tropical conifer Widdringtonia whytei Rendle is an endangered species endemic to Mulanje Mountain in Malawi. A study was conducted for the first time under controlled conditions in order to assess the effects of temperature and light on germination and viability of W. whytei seeds. Seeds incubated at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C attained the highest cumulative germination percentage (100%) followed by 87% germination under fluctuating temperatures of 15 degrees C night/25 degrees C day. No seed germination occurred at temperatures below 15 degrees C. Seeds that failed to germinate at temperatures below 15 degrees C showed the highest (>90%) viability compared to the seeds incubated at 25 degrees C (60%). Across temperature regimes, germination was significantly higher under light (44.7%) than dark (35.6%) conditions. It is concluded that temperature is one of the critical factors for germination of W. whytei seed. The ability of W. whytei seeds to germinate both in light and darkness implies that the species would unlikely form a persistent soil seed bank, an attribute which is common in species that survive in habitats frequently disturbed by fires.

Resource managers in the Larimer County Open Space Program in Northern Colorado began a cheatgrass reduction program at the Devil's Backbone Open Space preserve that consisted of prescribed burns in fall 2007 and spring 2008, followed by post-emergent imazapic treatments at 0.44 L/ha. The fire was characterized as a slow-moving, highly consumptive burn, and managers monitored results intermittently following the integrated treatments. Post treatment, average cheatgrass cover was reduced from 82% to 9% from 2007 to 2009 based on six permanent monitoring transects. While quantitative data was not taken for the emergence of native grasses and forbs, incidence of bare ground did not increase significantly following treatment. This case study suggests a highly consumptive burn can decrease cheatgrass from the seed bank and create favorable conditions for vegetation other than cheatgrass to return. More research and long-term monitoring building upon this pilot study could help to understand if this combined treatment is a viable long-term reduction strategy.

Seed Production in Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata) Prevented by Some Methods of Manual Removal	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												The eradication of garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) from natural populations has proven to be difficult; however, manual removal efforts can be effective at reducing or eliminating small populations when repeated for several years, exhausting the seed bank. We evaluated a variety of manual removal methods for efficacy in reducing viable seed production in garlic mustard. Plants were uprooted and evaluated for subsequent viable seed production based on four variables: (I) height (short, tall), (2) phenological stage (flowering, early-fruiting, late-fruiting), (3) deradication (root removed from uprooted plant), and (4) disposal method (hang, scatter, pile). Uprooting plants at the flowering stage prevented production of any viable seed, while early- and late-fruiting plants were still able to produce viable seed. Fruits initiated on taller plants (>= 40 cm) produced significantly (P < 0.01) more viable seed than those on short plants (<= 35 cm). Deradication of uprooted plants did not offer an advantage in reducing viable seed production. There were no significant differences in viable seed production between groups of plants subjected to different disposal methods. Garlic mustard root systems left in the ground after aboveground portions of the plants were removed at four phenological stages (budding, flowering, early-fruiting, and late-fruiting) either did not resprout or produced short-lived sprouts that died without flowering. Our findings suggest that pulling garlic mustard before fruit initiation will reduce seed production, regardless of the disposal method employed or whether roots are left intact.																	0885-8608					JUL	2012	32	3					305	309		10.3375/043.032.0308							WOS:000306821600009

The importance of space, time, and stochasticity to the demography and management of Alliaria petiolata	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												As population modeling is increasingly called upon to guide policy and management, it is important that we understand not only the central tendencies of our study systems, but the consequences of their variation in space and time as well. The invasive plant Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) is actively managed in the United States and is the focus of a developing biological control program. Two weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Ceutorhynchus) that reduce fecundity (C. alliariae) and rosette survival plus fecundity (C. scrobicollis) are under consideration for release pending host specificity testing. We used a demographic modeling approach to (1) quantify variability in A. petiolata growth and vital rates and (2) assess the potential for single- or multiple-agent biocontrol to suppress growth of 12 A. petiolata populations in Illinois and Michigan studied over three plant generations. We used perturbation analyses and simulation models with stochastic environments to estimate stochastic growth rates (lambda(S)) and predict the probability of successful management using either a single biocontrol agent or two agent species together. Not all populations exhibited invasive dynamics. Estimates of lambda(S) ranged from 0.78 to 2.21 across sites, while annual, deterministic growth (lambda) varied up to sevenfold within individual sites. Given our knowledge of the biocontrol agents, this analysis suggests that C. scrobicollis alone may control A. petiolata at up to 63% of our study sites where lambda(S) > 1, with the combination of both agents predicted to succeed at 88% of sites. Across sites and years, the elasticity rankings were dependent on lambda. Reductions of rosette survival, fecundity, or germination of new seeds are predicted to cause the greatest reduction of lambda in growing populations. In declining populations, transitions affecting seed bank survival have the greatest effect on lambda. This contrasts with past analyses that varied parameters individually in an otherwise constant matrix, which may yield unrealistic predictions by decoupling natural parameter covariances. Overall, comparisons of stochastic and deterministic growth rates illustrate how analyses of individual populations or years could misguide management or fail to characterize complex traits such as invasiveness that emerge as attributes of populations rather than species.

Biomass, Fecundity, and Interference Ability of Multiple Herbicide-Resistant and -Susceptible Late Watergrass (Echinochloa phyllopogon)	WEED SCIENCE												Echinochloa phyllopogon is a serious weed of California rice that has evolved resistance to most grass herbicides. We assessed differences in growth, interference, and fecundity between multiple resistant (R) and susceptible (S) E. phyllopogon. Interference with rice by R and S plants was similar, although R plants were shorter and had less leaf area and shoot biomass than S plants. Interference by one S or R E. phyllopogon plant with rice was 2.31 or 2.45 times greater than intraspecific interference by one rice plant, respectively. Interference was mostly driven by root interactions and E. phyllopogon on average produced seven times more root dry weight than rice. Deeper E. phyllopogon root placement compared with rice may explain niche differentiation between the two species. On average, R plants produced 55% less seeds than S plants. Lower fecundity could compromise fitness of R plants in the absence of herbicide selection, but partial avoidance of seed removal during rice harvest through earlier seed shattering may allow greater soil seed bank replenishment by R plants compared with S plants. E phyllopogon control is needed to prevent high rice yield losses, and suppressing survivors of initial herbicide treatments is essential to limit seed bank replenishment by R plants. The potential benefits of taller rice varieties with enhanced root competitiveness, and that may be harvested earlier, should be considered.

Thomas			Seed bank persistence of genetically modified canola in California	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Canola, which is genetically modified (GM) for tolerance to glyphosate, has the potential to become established as a new glyphosate resistant weed, thus reducing the effectiveness of glyphosate. Volunteer from dormant canola seeds produced thousands of plants per hectare in the fourth year (2011) following a 2007 crop harvest. This occurred with no additional canola seed production since the 2007 harvest. Volunteer plants following harvests of annual crops are typically only a problem for the first year after harvest. In California, glyphosate is the core herbicide on over a million hectares of high value row, tree, and vine crops and new glyphosate resistant weeds reduce the effectiveness of glyphosate. The combination of dormant seed and herbicide resistance makes GM glyphosate-resistant canola a new and difficult California weed which was first observed in the winter of 2009.																	0944-1344					JUL	2012	19	6					2281	2284		10.1007/s11356-011-0733-8							WOS:000306123000041	22258428

To understand the ecological mechanisms of spontaneous forest regeneration that follows these impacts, it is crucial to investigate the species composition and functional diversity of the buried germinable seeds in those stands. We analysed the soil seed bank by germination method and characterised germination dynamics and distribution of seedlings throughout the samples according to a sigmoid model and cumulative curves, respectively. To compare the proportions of functional and syntaxonomical groups between seed bank and aboveground vegetation, we applied the Fisher's exact test. Additionally, we described the spatial distribution of the species in the seed bank according to semivariograms. The studied seed bank reached a density of about 5,300 seed m(-2). Most of the species detected in the seed bank are related to open vegetation, forest fringes and early successional stages of forest regeneration. In spite of a low floristic similarity between seed bank and aboveground vegetation, the functional and syntaxonomical composition is very similar. Further studies considering the distribution of seeds in the soil and the changes of the seed bank composition during the regeneration process are required.																	1286-4560					JUL	2012	69	5					557	567		10.1007/s13595-011-0174-z							WOS:000305950300004

They host a number of red-listed species not found elsewhere, illustrating that many plant species are threatened by extinction due to too little soil disturbance. Implementing a suitable disturbance regime is therefore crucial to ensure species-rich environments. We have reviewed the literature on soil disturbance as a restoration measure in dry sandy grasslands, with a special focus on xeric sand calcareous grasslands as these are severely threatened. Our objective was to elucidate the relations between diversity and disturbance regimes, and to determine how disturbance can be used to counteract acidification, to reduce nutrient availability and to create gaps in the vegetation. Our findings indicate that the current disturbance regime should be based on the historical disturbance regime, the productivity of the habitat and the propagule supply, in order to promote diversity at a landscape scale. Based on earlier studies and on the diversity/disturbance theory, we propose a conceptual model that can be used to determine the appropriate soil disturbance regime for restoration purposes. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering soil productivity, soil chemistry and dispersal limitations when choosing restoration measures and disturbance regimes for the conservation of biodiversity.

Here we evaluate the long-term effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13 years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods, and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas. Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests. Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots. Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands. We discuss how native forest management practices can be implemented to contribute positively to the conservation of the Araucaria mixed forest biodiversity.

Persistence of Triticale Seed in the Soil Seed Bank	CROP SCIENCE												Spring triticale (xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus) is being developed as a bio-product crop for the Canadian prairies and may involve the use of genetic modification. Seed loss before or during harvest from genetically modified (GM) triticale could impact its ability to coexist with conventional crops. Experiments were conducted in Alberta, Canada, to determine if spring triticale exhibits primary dormancy relative to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and whether seeds persist in the seed bank. Primary dormancy was assessed for four triticale cultivars, AC Alta, Blue Aleurone, Tyndal, and AC Ultima, and AC Barrie wheat by quantifying germination weekly from anthesis to postharvest. Seed persistence was assessed for the same cultivars by placing seed-filled mesh bags on the soil surface (0 cm) and at 2 and 12 cm burial depths. Before harvest in 2009, germinations were less than 56% for all cultivars. After harvest, AC Barrie and Blue Aleurone exhibited a short period of primary dormancy. In 2010, wet conditions were conducive to preharvest sprouting. Germinations ranged from 46 to 85% preharvest with no lingering primary dormancy postharvest. Seeds buried to 12 cm germinated readily, removing them from the seed bank within 7 mo, while 99% of seeds buried to 2 cm were nonviable 11 mo after burial. Seeds on the soil surface persisted longest; however, 99% were nonviable after 26 mo. Like wheat, triticale has little or no primary dormancy, and results from this study suggest triticale seed does not persist in the seed bank.																	0011-183X					JUL	2012	52	4					1868	1880		10.2135/cropsci2011.11.0596							WOS:000305804900040

Burial of Zostera marina seeds in sediment inhabited by three polychaetes: Laboratory and field studies	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												The large number of seeds produced by eelgrass, Zostera marina, provides this plant with a potential to disperse widely and colonise new areas. After dispersal, seeds must be buried into sediment for assuring long-term survival, successful germination and safe seedling development. Seeds may be buried passively by sedimentation or actively through sediment reworking by benthic fauna. We evaluated the effect of three polychaetes on the burial rate and depth of eelgrass seeds. Burial was first measured in controlled laboratory experiments using different densities of Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor (400-3200 ind m(-2)), Arenicola marina (20-80 ind m(-2)), and the invasive Marenzelleria viridis (400-1600 ind m(-2)). The obtained results were subsequently compared with burial rates of seed mimics in experimental field plots (1 m(2)) dominated by the respective polychaetes. High recovery of seeds in the laboratory (97-100%) suggested that none of these polychaetes species feed on eelgrass seeds. N. diversicolor transported seeds rapidly (<1 day) into its burrow, where they remained buried at a median depth of 0.5 cm. A. marina and M. viridis buried seeds by depositing their faeces on top of the sediment. At their highest abundance. A. marina and M. viridis buried seeds to a median depth of 6.7 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively, after a month. The burial efficiency and depth of these species were, in contrast to N. diversicolor, dependent on animal abundance. Only 2% of seed mimics casted in the field plots were recovered, suggesting that physical dispersion by waves and currents was considerably important for horizontal distribution. However, polychaete affected significantly the vertical distribution of seeds. Overall the effects of these three polychaetes indicate that benthic macroinvertebrates may significantly impact eelgrass seed bank at the ecosystem scale. Some species have a positive effect by burying seeds to shallow depths and thereby reducing seed predation and facilitating seed germination, while other species bury seeds too deep for successful seed germination and seedling development.

Alteration and Recovery of Slash Pile Burn Sites in the Restoration of a Fire-Maintained Ecosystem	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration practices incorporating timber harvest (e.g. to remove undesirable species or reduce tree densities) may generate unmerchantable wood debris that is piled and burned for fuel reduction. Slash pile burns are common in longleaf pine ecosystem restoration that involves hardwood removal before reintroduction of frequent prescribed fire. In this context, long-lasting effects of slash pile burns may complicate restoration outcomes due to unintended alterations to vegetation, soils, and the soil seed bank. In this study, our objectives were to (1) examine alterations to the soil seed bank, soil physical and chemical characteristics, and initial vegetation recolonization following burn and (2) determine the rate of return of soil and vegetation characteristics to pre-burn conditions. We found that burning of slash piles (composed of scores of whole trees) results in elevated nutrient levels and significant impacts on vegetation and the soil seed bank, which remain evident for at least 6 years following burn. In this ecosystem, formerly weakly acidic soils become neutral to basic and levels of P remain significantly higher. Following an initial decrease after burn, total soil N increases with time since burn. These changes suggest that not only does pile burning create a fire scar initially devoid of biota, but it also produces an altered soil chemical environment, with possible consequences for long-term ecosystem restoration efforts in landscapes including numerous fire scars. To facilitate restoration trajectories, further adaptive management to incorporate native plant propagules or suppress encroaching hardwoods within fire scars may be warranted in fire-dependent ecosystems.																	1061-2971					JUL	2012	20	4					505	516		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2011.00780.x							WOS:000306007300011						
J	Rivera, D; Jauregui, BM; Peco, B				Rivera, Desiree; Jauregui, Berta M.; Peco, Begona			The fate of herbaceous seeds during topsoil stockpiling: Restoration potential of seed banks	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Topsoil removed during linear infrastructure construction is one of the most valuable resources for the ecological restoration of roadslopes, as it contains high concentrations of micro-organisms, nutrients and seeds. During construction work, topsoil is stockpiled in a way that can harm seed germination and survival capacity. In order to assess the effects of topsoil storage time and seed burial depth on seed survival, germination and mortality, an experiment with three replicates was conducted using two factors: time (1-6 months) and burial depth (0, 5, 30 and 50 cm). At each stockpile depth we buried 25 seeds from 10 natural grassland species (5 families) in permeable nylon sachets. Seed mass and seed functional responses to light (LI) and diurnal temperature fluctuations (DTF) were also measured for each species. Seed survival, germination and mortality during stockpiling were analyzed using binomial GLMs. Explanatory variables were family, depth of burial, time, seed mass. LI and DTF responses. Seed survival decreased with storage time but increases with depth. Seed losses were due to seed germination and mortality in the stockpile. Germination percentage increased with time but decreased with burial depth. This parameter was negatively related to LI and DTF. Mortality increased significantly with time and depth and was negatively related to seed mass. Results show that there may be a loss of viable seeds in topsoil stockpiles, particularly in the case of large seeds. Our results also underline the functional role of light requirements for germination and the detection of diurnal temperature fluctuations as mechanisms to achieve higher soil seed persistence. The correct management of topsoil is decisive for the restoration of roadslopes. Seed germination potential decrease with time of storage and burial depth, consequently a serious loss of seeds conducts an impoverishing of topsoil, which is the main natural resource for the restoration of these disturbed ecosystems. Viable seed loss is lower in deeper layers of the stockpile, so short-period topsoil storage and bigger stockpiles could reduce seed loss and increase thus the restoration potential of topsoil.

Effect of different cultivation methods on germination and growth of Puccinellia tenuiflora	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												The effects of drip irrigation and different cultivation methods on seed germination and growth of Puccinellia tenuiflora in saline-sodic soils were investigated in field experiments during 2008-2010 in the Songnen Plain, China. Drip irrigation was applied to waste saline-sodic P. tenuiflora grasslands for both flat and ridge cultivation methods. Drip irrigation affected the distributions of electrical conductivity of saturated-soil extract (ECe) and pH of the saline-sodic soil. After cropping under drip irrigation for two years, the ECe and pH had decreased greatly in the root zone on both the flat and ridge lands, and enabled P. tenuiflora seeds to germinate and grow rapidly. In addition, the plant height, number and length of spikes, coverage and aboveground biomass were all higher on the flat than on ridge land, but the differences of the two cultivation methods were not obvious. Compared to ridge planting, the flat planting method was more convenient, and flat cultivation and drip irrigation may be appropriate for restoration of saline-sodic grasslands.																	1735-6814	1735-8043				JUL	2012	6	3					353	365									WOS:000305044200007

The Biology of Canadian weeds. 150 Erechtites hieraciifolius (L.) Raf. ex DC. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 729-746. Erechtites hieraciifolius, American burnweed, is a herbaceous annual in the Asteraceae native to forest zones of eastern North America, but introduced to parts of Europe and the Pacific region. Confusion sometimes arises in distinguishing it from other weedy rayless composites in Canada, such as Senecio vulgaris (common groundsel) and Conyza canadensis (Canada fleabane). A pioneer therophyte species of forest zones, it occurs in large numbers when associated with major disturbances such as forest fires, but is also common in areas of smaller scale disturbance such as shores, forest edges and wind-throws. Soil conditions may vary greatly in nutrient content, moisture content, pH and salinity. In Canada, it is generally considered a minor garden and agricultural weed. It is most common in crops such as lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon), strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) and vegetable crops; however, it occasionally occurs in other field and forage crops. Impacts include a variety of problems contributing to increased production costs or crop yield losses, including herbicide resistance, resource competition, and as a reservoir harbouring crop pathogens. It has been valued as a medicinal herb for treating a variety of ailments. Populations may grow rapidly in response to disturbances typical of managed landscapes, but E. hieraciifolius can usually be effectively controlled by chemical, cultural or manual weed control tactics.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				JUL	2012	92	4					729	746		10.4141/CJPS2012-003							WOS:000305816900011						
J	Ma, MJ; Zhou, XH; Ma, Z; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Zhou, Xianhui; Ma, Zhen; Du, Guozhen			Composition of the soil seed bank and vegetation changes after wetland drying and soil salinization on the Tibetan Plateau	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The primary goal was to address a question with regard to whether the seed bank be regarded as a potential as a source of seeds for saline-alkaline meadow restoration on the Tibetan Plateau. We collected soil samples, soil seed bank samples, sampled the vegetation in a seasonal wetland and in a saline-alkaline meadow, and used the NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) to evaluate the relationship of species composition between the seed banks and vegetation. The saline-alkaline meadow develops after drying of wetlands following disturbance. Soil properties, and seed density and species richness were compared. The seed density and species richness of the seed banks showed no difference between the two habitats. The NMDS results showed that composition of the vegetation of the two sites was obviously different, but that of the seed bank was not. The drying of the wetland altered plant community and soil properties. Persistent seed bank can be regarded a strategy of adaptation to current soil environment (high soil moisture or salinity). There was a significant negative effect on soil characteristics after wetland drying and subsequent salinization. If hydrology is restored, the seed bank will continue to be an importance source of diversity of propagules for saline-alkaline meadow restoration following disturbance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of benthic barrier products for submerged aquatic weed control	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												The use of biodegradable products as benthic barriers to control submerged aquatic weeds and their impact on desirable native plant species was assessed in a common garden study. Five introduced invasive species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Egeria densa, Elodea canadensis, Hydrilla verticillata, Lagarosiphon major, a lesser weed (Potamogeton crispus, also introduced), and desirable native species (Myriophyllum triphyllum, Potamogeton ochreatus, an assemblage of charophytes, and oospore rich sediment) were grown in pots under common conditions before being covered by one of three matting products. Two different grades of hessian (burlap) and a coconut fiber product were placed over the plants and anchored in the pots. Plant emergence through the barrier and biomass were assessed over a 5-month period. For all species, the trend was toward reduced emergence with increasing product density, with significantly fewer plants emerging from treated pots compared with untreated control pots for all species except C. demersum and the charophytes. Biomass data corroborated the trends observed in the emergence data, except that the biomass of the germling charophytes was significantly lower in the densest treatments compared with controls. There was, however, a variable response among plant species; some were inhibited by all of the products while others only had reduced emergence and biomass with the densest matting product. The variable response of the weeds and the native plants to the different products provides an opportunity for selective control of some weed species, while providing a recruitment opportunity for native charophytes species from the seed bank.																	0146-6623					JUL	2012	50						101	105									WOS:000209043700004

Microsite and litter cover effects on seed banks vary with seed size and dispersal mechanisms: implications for revegetation of degraded saline land	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seed movements and fates are important for restoration as these determine spatial patterns of recruitment and ultimately shape plant communities. This article examines litter cover and microsite effects on seed availability at a saline site revegetated with Eucalyptus sargentii tree rows interplanted with 5-6 rows of saltbush (Atriplex spp.). As litter accumulation decreases with increasing distance from tree rows, soil seed banks were compared between paired bare and litter-covered zones within three microsites; tree row, saltbush row closest to tree row and saltbush mid-row (middle row of saltbush between tree rows). Germinable seed banks of the four most abundant species with contrasting seed sizes and dispersal mechanisms were assessed to test the hypotheses that: (i) microsites with litter cover contain higher seed densities than bare areas, but that (ii) microsite and litter effects will vary depending on seed size and dispersal mechanisms. Overall, litter cover increased seed densities, however, litter effects varied with seed size, with no effect on small-seeded species and litter increasing densities of large-seeded species. Seed bank composition also differed between tree and shrub microsites due to differences in seed morphology and dispersal mechanisms. Water-dispersed species were unaffected by microsite but densities of wind-dispersed species, including Atriplex spp., were higher in saltbush microsites. Densities of wind-dispersed species also differed between the two saltbush microsites despite similar litter cover. Future plantings should consider row spacing and orientation, as well as the dimensions of seeding mounds and associated neighbouring depressions, to maximize litter and seed-trapping by microsites.

Influence of Time of Emergence on the Growth and Development of Wild Oat (Avena fatua)	WEED SCIENCE												Successful control of wild oat in cereal crops requires an accurate prediction of the developmental stages of wild oat plants that emerged during the growing season. The main objective of this research was to evaluate wild oat growth and to predict the phyllochron of wild oat plants that emerge at various times in the Red River Valley region of Minnesota and North Dakota. Field experiments were conducted in 2002 and 2003 in Crookston, MN, and Fargo, ND. Four emergence cohorts were established in 4 successive wk. Research plots were arranged in randomized complete blocks with six replications. From the naturally emerged wild oat population, 10 randomly selected plants per plot were evaluated for plant height, leaves on main stem, tillers per plant, total leaves per plant, days to flag leaf emergence and to heading, biomass per plant, and seeds per plant. Haun's numerical cereal development scale was regressed on days after emergence (DAE), day length (DL), growing degree days (GDD), or photothermal units (PTU). Wild oats that emerged first required more time for flag leaf emergence and heading, were taller, and had more biomass, leaves, tillers, and seed production than wild oat plants that emerged later. Wild oat phyllochron intervals were 5.3 d, 94 GDD, or 1,468 PTU, regardless of emergence timing. These data suggest that wild oat phyllochron is primarily driven by air temperature and is relatively stable during the extended emergence period. Later-emerging wild oat plants, although not as competitive as earlier emerging ones, still have the potential to contribute to the seed bank if left uncontrolled.

In RDF, it is believed that ducks can control weeds effectively. Since the weed seed bank determines the weed community in the following crop, a better understanding of the seed bank could provide useful insights into the long-term effects of RDF adopted for weed control. Nine consecutive years' field experiments were conducted to study the characteristics of the weed seed bank under RDF and evaluate the weed control effect of RDF. After 9 years under RDF, the number of weed species in the weed seed bank declined from 38 to 21 and the density of both the weed seed bank and the above-ground weed decreased by more than 90%. RDF resulted in a more uniform vertical distribution of the weed seed bank both quantitatively and qualitatively. The ecological indices point to a gradual change towards fewer species, lower density, and lower diversity following continued RDF. The dominant species in the weed seed bank shifted from Lindernia procumbens, Mazus japonicus, Cardamine hirsuta, and Alopecurus aequalis at the beginning of this experiment in 1999 to A. aequalis, Rotala indica, M. japonicus, and Cyperus difformis in 2008. The results provide concrete evidence for the efficacy of RDF in depleting the weed seed bank and as a weed management approach without any herbicides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yan, QL; Zhu, JJ; Yu, LZ				Yan, Qiao-Ling; Zhu, Jiao-Jun; Yu, Li-Zhong			Seed Regeneration Potential of Canopy Gaps at Early Formation Stage in Temperate Secondary Forests, Northeast China	PLOS ONE												Promoting the seed regeneration potential of secondary forests undergoing gap disturbances is an important approach for achieving forest restoration and sustainable management. Seedling recruitment from seed banks strongly determines the seed regeneration potential, but the process is poorly understood in the gaps of secondary forests. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effects of gap size, seed availability, and environmental conditions on the seed regeneration potential in temperate secondary forests. It was found that gap formation could favor the invasion of more varieties of species in seed banks, but it also could speed up the turnover rate of seed banks leading to lower seed densities. Seeds of the dominant species, Fraxinus rhynchophylla, were transient in soil and there was a minor and discontinuous contribution of the seed bank to its seedling emergence. For Quercus mongolica, emerging seedling number was positively correlated with seed density in gaps (R = 0.32, P<0.01), especially in medium and small gaps (<500 m(2)). Furthermore, under canopies, there was a positive correlation between seedling number and seed density of Acer mono (R = 0.43, P<0.01). Gap formation could promote seedling emergence of two gap-dependent species (i.e., Q. mongolica and A. mono), but the contribution of seed banks to seedlings was below 10% after gap creation. Soil moisture and temperature were the restrictive factors controlling the seedling emergence from seeds in gaps and under canopies, respectively. Thus, the regeneration potential from seed banks is limited after gap formation.

J	Mordecai, EA				Mordecai, Erin A.			Soil Moisture and Fungi Affect Seed Survival in California Grassland Annual Plants	PLOS ONE												Survival of seeds in the seed bank is important for the population dynamics of many plant species, yet the environmental factors that control seed survival at a landscape level remain poorly understood. These factors may include soil moisture, vegetation cover, soil type, and soil pathogens. Because many soil fungi respond to moisture and host species, fungi may mediate environmental drivers of seed survival. Here, I measure patterns of seed survival in California annual grassland plants across 15 species in three experiments. First, I surveyed seed survival for eight species at 18 grasslands and coastal sage scrub sites ranging across coastal and inland Santa Barbara County, California. Species differed in seed survival, and soil moisture and geographic location had the strongest influence on survival. Grasslands had higher survival than coastal sage scrub sites for some species. Second, I used a fungicide addition and exotic grass thatch removal experiment in the field to tease apart the relative impact of fungi, thatch, and their interaction in an invaded grassland. Seed survival was lower in the winter (wet season) than in the summer (dry season), but fungicide improved winter survival. Seed survival varied between species but did not depend on thatch. Third, I manipulated water and fungicide in the laboratory to directly examine the relationship between water, fungi, and survival. Seed survival declined from dry to single watered to continuously watered treatments. Fungicide slightly improved seed survival when seeds were watered once but not continually. Together, these experiments demonstrate an important role of soil moisture, potentially mediated by fungal pathogens, in driving seed survival.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CONTENT OF SOIL WEED SEED BANK IN SUNFLOWER CROP	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Soil contains great amount of seeds of different weed species. The term "seed bank" refers to the reservoir of seed capable of germinating in favorable conditions in the soil or on the surface. Determination of the seed bank is of great significance for study of population dynamics, as well as for planned weed control. Data on seed quantity in certain area enable better choice of crops and cultural practices, as well as more rational herbicide use. During 2008-2009 studies of the seed bank in sunflower crop were performed in two different localities with the aim of determination of quantitative and qualitative properties of the seed bank and viability of seeds from arable soil layers of 0-10; 10-20 and 20-30 cm. Samples of the soil were taken before the end of vegetation, from each plot in four replications. The samples were rinsed in the water through copper sieves of specific diameters, and weed seeds were separated. Seed was germinated in controlled conditions of climatic chamber. Germination capability and hypocotyls and epicotyls lengths of seedlings were evaluated after 14 days. Seeds determined from the studied samples showed a great diversity but only a few of hem were dominant, i.e. were more abundant in seed, such as: Amaranthus retroflexus, Sinapis arvensis, Polygonum lapathifolium and Datura stramonium. The species Sinapis arvensis, Polygonum lapathifolium, Hibiscus trionum, Amaranthus retroflexus, Echinocloa crus-galli and Datura stramonium, which were the species whose seed proved to be dominant in all of the examined soil samples had the greatest percentage of viable seeds. The highest level of germination viability was found in seed of Polygonum lapathifolium, Datura stramonium and Sinapis arvensis.																	1310-0351					JUN	2012	18	3					348	353									WOS:000309631600007

The Role of the Seed Bank in Recovery of Understory Species in an Eastern Oregon Ponderosa Pine Forest	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests may not promote understory recovery where residual understory plant abundance or propagule availability is insufficient for natural re-establishment. The value of the seed bank for understory recovery in Pacific Northwest ponderosa pine forests is not fully understood, therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the potential of the seed bank as a source of desired herbaceous understory species recruitment. Seed bank samples were collected from 14 ponderosa pine stands, seven with a perennial bunchgrass dominated understory (intact) and seven with little or no understory (depauperate). Seedling emergence methods were used to estimate the germinable seed bank; seedling density and diversity comparisons were made using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests; and seedling species composition compared using multiple response permutation procedures. Comparisons were also made between seed bank and understory vegetation species composition. No statistical differences were observed in seedling density or diversity, but the intact group appeared higher in both. Seedling species composition differed between the two groups and in both groups several species present in the seed bank were also present in the corresponding understory vegetation. However, species that germinated from the seed bank of the depauperate understory group did not include any of the predominant species in the standing vegetation of the intact group indicating that a suitable propagule source for understory recovery is not available in dense ponderosa pine forests with severely degraded understories. Direct seeding of desired understory vegetation should be considered in ponderosa pine restoration activities.																	0029-344X					SUM	2012	86	3					168	178		10.3955/046.086.0302							WOS:000308341200002

The regeneration of most clear-cut areas was left to occur naturally from the seed bank and from seeds provided by the surrounding beech trees. This review is integrating the results obtained from the study of tree physiology, soil biology and mycorrhizal communities in three nearby beech stands: one clear-cut in 2001; another clear-cut in 1996 and an unmanaged forest for at least the last century. The main objectives were (i) to study the microclimatic conditions inside the beech stands subjected to clear-cutting, then naturally regenerating from disturbance, and exhibiting very different tree size and density; (ii) to deepen the knowledge of some anatomical, physiological and biochemical parameters of beech trees that had successfully established within clear-cut areas with strong differences in microclimatic conditions and (iii) to know the biological properties of soils belonging to beech stands naturally regenerating from clear-cutting. We hypothesized that the soil biology in regenerating clear-cut beech stands of different ages could be markedly influenced by the microclimatic conditions determined by both tree size and density within each site, with the latter factor uncertain when stands are naturally regenerating from disturbance.

We previously described the formation of an egg bank of Heterocypris incongruens, a widespread and common freshwater ostracod. The egg bank was made up of genetically homogeneous resting eggs produced by a laboratory clonal lineage that we used to colonise a pond with an unpredictable hydroperiod. Here we report on laboratory experiments on the study of hatching phenology of resting eggs from the newly established egg bank. We measured the hatching percentage and egg bank depletion during four successive inundations (followed by dry periods) without reproduction. In a first factorial experiment, egg hatching was assessed under the following set of conditions: egg age (3 or 15 months), inundation photoperiod (12:12 L:D or 16:8 L:D), water quality (mineral water or adult-conditioned water). In a second experiment egg hatching in four successive inundations was assessed varying the duration of the first inundation (6 or 30 days). Our estimation of resting egg density in the pond was 65x 10(4) eggs m(-2). A total of 7133 hatchings were recorded, about 80 % were observed in the first inundation while the rest occurred in three subsequent inundations. Egg age and photoperiod had no effect on hatching percentage while metabolites produced by adult females in conditioned water had a negative effect. Short inundation did not affect hatching percentages or resting egg survivorship. Hatching in successive inundations did not depend on genetic differences among eggs and the process may be considered a stochastic switching of a single genotype among different phenotypes. Such a hatching phenology ensures a risk spreading response that is advantageous in highly stochastic environments. It prevents population extinction following very short hydroperiods and for at least four subsequent generations of failed reproduction.

The record of the composition and abundance of the seed bank was conducted in 2 types of vegetation (tetechera and thorny scrub) in the microhabitats (under shrubs, open space and refuse- dumps of granivorous ants Pogonomyrmex barbatus). Seed collection was carried out in dry, rainy and late rainy seasons for 2 years. There were no differences in seed density between seasons and years, but there were differences between microhabitats evaluated. The microhabitat of the ant refuse-dumps had the highest abundance of seeds, which highlights the importance of ants in the spatial conformation of the structure of communities in these ecosystems. Seeds of 38 species of plants were recorded. The average density ranged from 23 800 to 28 000 seeds m(-2), consistent with other reports for arid and semiarid regions. The most frequent species were the annual Eragrostis mexicana, Bouteloua barbata, Kallstroemia rosei and Portulaca pilosa. Results show that this area had a high heterogeneity at site and microhabitat level. It is necessary to conduct more studies on spatio-temporal patterns in seed banks and their relationship with the standing vegetation in arid and semiarid areas in Mexico.

Changes in soil seed bank with a Tall fescue cover	FOURRAGES												One way of preventing crop weeds is to reduce soil seed banks. Does introducing a perennial plant cover in a crop rotation system help reduce soil seed bank and weed density in subsequent crops? In order to answer this question, a Tall fescue perennial cover was introduced in a crop rotation system. Changes in soil seed bank were determined by counting germinated and non-germinated seeds. The number of germinated seeds on the ground was fairly low (2 346 to 7 877 seeds/m(2)), with important variations from one year to the next, depending on plant species present in the plant cover and their seed set. In spite of these variations, the perennial plant cover helped reduce the number of seeds belonging to certain weed species that are harmful for cereal crops.

J	Dybzinski, R; Tilman, D				Dybzinski, Ray; Tilman, David			Seed and microsite limitation in a late-successional old field: the effects of water, adults, litter, and small mammals on seeds and seedlings	PLANT ECOLOGY												Many plant communities are recruitment limited, which may occur because there are either too few seeds to fill available microsites, too few available microsites, or both. In a recruitment-limited, Minnesota, USA old field, we tested among these alternatives in a three-phase study. In phase 1, we estimated the production of late-successional forb and C4 grass seeds. In phase 2, we experimentally modified field establishment conditions with rainfall amendment, adult plant thinning, litter reduction, and small mammal exclusion. We then measured recruitment. On average, of the nearly 2,600 seeds produced m(-2), only 164 seeds m(-2) were present and living after overwintering, as measured by field and greenhouse germination. Furthermore, on average, only 9 of those 164 seeds m(-2) germinated in the field, even under the relaxed establishment conditions of our four experimental treatments. Although adults of C4 grasses dominate the field, surprisingly few C4 grass seedlings germinated. To understand why, in phase 3, we added seed of the three dominant C4 grasses into the same plots the following year. Their ability to recruit into control plots compared with treated plots was relatively lower than for the ambiently recruited forbs from phase 2, suggesting that the competitively dominant C4 grasses have greater difficulty establishing in the extant community. Of the seeds that did germinate in the field in phases 2 and 3, all four experimental treatments significantly improved at least one stage of establishment, with the rainfall amendment having the greatest overall effect across species. In total, our results suggest that seed limitation was exacerbated by microsite limitation via multiple mechanisms.

However, information on how spatial scale influences the spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks in a grassland under grazing disturbance is still lacking. Based on field sampling and greenhouse germination, we measured the species composition and seed density of soil seed banks at different spatial scales (30 mx30 m, 30 mx60 m and 30 mx90 m) along a topographical gradient in a sandy grassland in Horqin Sand Land, Northern China. By applying geostatistical methods, we examined how spatial scale and topography affected the spatial distribution of soil seed banks in the study area. Our results showed that the total number of species in soil seed banks, as well as the number of dominant annuals, increased with the increase of spatial scales. Seed density in soil seed banks decreased with the increase of spatial scales due to an increase in the slopes and relative heights of the sampling points. Geostatistical analysis showed that the relative structural variance (C/(C-o+C)) of seed density and species richness were over 65% for all spatial scales, indicating that these variables had an obvious spatial autocorrelation and the spatial structured variance accounted for the largest proportion of the total sample variance. Spatial autocorrelation of seed density in soil seed banks increased with the increase of measured scales, while that of species richness showed a reverse trend. These results suggest that the total number of species in soil seed banks is spatial scale dependent and lower topography may accommodate more seeds. Spatial distribution of seed density in soil seed banks is also scale dependent due to topographic variation. Grassland management, therefore, needs to consider local grazing disturbance regime, spatial scale and topography.

Response of wetland vegetation to the post-1986 decrease in Lake St. Clair water levels: Seed-bank emergence and beginnings of the Phragmites australis invasion	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water-level fluctuations are critical for maintaining the diversity and resultant habitat value of wetland plant communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, activation of the seed bank can also provide an opportunity for invasive species to displace native species, as occurred when common reed, Phragmites australis, expanded across many wetlands after lake levels receded following highs in 1997. Timing of the invasion process is not clear, however, as Phragmites propagules had to be present to exploit the exposed soils. A data set from Dickinson Island on the St. Clair River delta collected in 1988-1991, 1996 during a previous lake-level decline was analyzed to document prior Phragmites growth, as well as overall seed-bank response. Above-ground biomass was determined for all plants each year in randomly placed quadrats in a 5-ha area exposed when lake levels decreased by 0.65 m from 1986 to 1988. A total of 38 taxa were identified in 1988, but the number decreased, along with biomass of many species, as canopy-dominating Typha angustifolia and Phragmites increased in later years. Although Phragmites did not expand greatly until after the decline from the 1997 high, it likely inoculated the area with viable seed during the previous low. Because post-1997 lake levels were lower than those post-1986, they exposed a greater area for Phragmites colonization from seed; lake levels also remained low for a longer time. Differences in bathymetry below the 1986 and 1997 lake-level elevations likely played a role in greater post-1997 spatial expansion of Phragmites at other sites in the Great Lakes also. The next high lake level will likely be required to displace Phragmites, but the effect will be temporary.

Competitiveness and technical efficiency: Determinants in the groundnut oil sector of India	FOOD POLICY												India imports about half of its domestic consumption needs of edible oils. Groundnuts are a major source of edible oils in India. One of the central problems of groundnut production and processing is huge inefficiencies due to an uncertain production environment owing to rainfed cultivation, the low resource base of smallholder farmers and processors, and the low adoption rates of improved technology. This paper addresses critical issues that impair the groundnut sector's international competitiveness and efficiency. The paper uses primary data collected from Indian farmers and processors of groundnuts to measure efficiency, and it suggests policies for reducing yield gaps and increasing efficiency. Specific policies suggested from the study are (a) the harnessing of improved varieties with attributes like drought tolerance, high oil content, high productivity for large-scale seed multiplication and distribution by public and private agencies; (b) viable village seed banks and seed networks through cycles of post-rainy season seed multiplication to meet the seed requirements in the rainy season and vice versa; (c) adoption of low-cost technologies to increase profitability and reduce risk; (d) oilseed clusters to facilitate scale and scope economies in processing units; and (e) capital subsidies to accelerate technological upgrading to shed inefficiency in the processing sector. The expected gains in efficiency in the production and processing of oilseeds are expected to result in producer and consumer gains which would justify the proposed incentives for seeds and for technological upgrading in the processing sector.

An investigation of the composition of the urban riparian soil propagule bank along the River Brent, Greater London, UK, in comparison with previous propagule bank studies in rural areas	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Most propagule bank research has been conducted in rural areas and has emphasised agricultural soils, although research on rural riparian propagule banks has expanded rapidly over the last decade. This paper presents observations of the species abundance of plant propagules in urban riparian soils along the River Brent, Greater London, UK. The data are analysed to explore changes in species abundance of the propagule bank with depth (0-5 cm compared with 5-10 cm soil layer), with distance from the river (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m), and at different locations on the river network. No significant differences were found in propagule abundance with soil depth or distance from the river's edge, but significantly more species were found in the propagule bank close to the river's edge. The species composition of the Brent's propagule bank is then compared with riparian propagule banks from the rural rivers Dove, Frome and Tern, UK. Species richness of the Brent propagule bank samples was generally lower than was found in the three rural rivers and, in total, 21%, 4%, 5% and 4% of observed species were aliens in the Brent, Dove, Frome and Tern soil samples, respectively. When the species present in the Brent's propagule bank were compared with published data on urban garden soils in another UK city, the latter were found to support a higher number of alien species, suggesting that other propagule sources to urban river systems support lower numbers of alien species in riparian zones than domestic gardens.																	1083-8155	1573-1642				JUN	2012	15	2					367	387		10.1007/s11252-011-0203-6							WOS:000304241400006

Parental environment changes the dormancy state and karrikinolide response of Brassica tournefortii seeds	ANNALS OF BOTANY												The smoke-derived chemical karrikinolide (KAR(1)) shows potential as a tool to synchronize the germination of seeds for weed management and restoration. To assess its feasibility we need to understand why seeds from different populations of a species exhibit distinct responses to KAR(1). Environmental conditions during seed development, known as the parental environment, influence seed dormancy so we predicted that parental environment would also drive the KAR(1)-responses of seeds. Specifically, we hypothesized that (a) a common environment will unify the KAR(1)-responses of different populations, (b) a single population grown under different environmental conditions will exhibit different KAR(1)-responses, and (c) drought stress, as a particular feature of the parental environment, will make seeds less dormant and more responsive to KAR(1). Seeds of the weed Brassica tournefortii were collected from four locations in Western Australia and were sown in common gardens at two field sites, to test whether their KAR(1)-responses could be unified by a common environment. To test the effects of drought on KAR(1)-response, plants were grown in a glasshouse and subjected to water stress. For each trial, the germination responses of the next generation of seeds were assessed. The KAR(1)-responses of seeds differed among populations, but this variation was reduced when seeds developed in a common environment. The KAR(1)-responses of each population changed when seeds developed in different environments. Different parental environments affected germination responses of the populations differently, showing that parental environment interacts with genetics to determine KAR(1)-responses. Seeds from droughted plants were 5 more responsive to KAR(1) and 5 less dormant than seeds from well-watered plants, but KAR(1)-responses and dormancy state were not intrinsically linked in all experiments. The parental environment in which seeds develop is one of the key drivers of the KAR(1)-responses of seeds.

The Red Queen and the seed bank: pathogen resistance of ex situ and in situ conserved barley	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Plant geneticists have proposed that the dynamic conservation of crop plants in farm environments (in situ conservation) is complementary to static conservation in seed banks (ex situ conservation) because it may help to ensure adaptation to changing conditions. Here, we test whether collections of a traditional variety of Moroccan barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) conserved ex situ showed differences in qualitative and quantitative resistance to the endemic fungal pathogen, Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, compared to collections that were continuously cultivated in situ. In detached-leaf assays for qualitative resistance, there were some significant differences between in situ and ex situ conserved collections from the same localities. Some ex situ conserved collections showed lower resistance levels, while others showed higher resistance levels than their in situ conserved counterparts. In field trials for quantitative resistance, similar results were observed, with the highest resistance observed in situ. Overall, this study identifies some cases where the Red Queen appears to drive the evolution of increased resistance in situ. However, in situ conservation does not always result in improved adaptation to pathogen virulence, suggesting a more complex evolutionary scenario, consistent with several published examples of plant-pathogen co-evolution in wild systems.

The Western English Channel contains a persistent microbial seed bank	ISME JOURNAL												Robust seasonal dynamics in microbial community composition have previously been observed in the English Channel L4 marine observatory. These could be explained either by seasonal changes in the taxa present at the L4 site, or by the continuous modulation of abundance of taxa within a persistent microbial community. To test these competing hypotheses, deep sequencing of 16S rRNA from one randomly selected time point to a depth of 10 729 927 reads was compared with an existing taxonomic survey data covering 6 years. When compared against the 6-year survey of 72 shallow sequenced time points, the deep sequenced time point maintained 95.4% of the combined shallow OTUs. Additionally, on average, 99.75%+/- 0.06 (mean +/- s.d.) of the operational taxonomic units found in each shallow sequenced sample were also found in the single deep sequenced sample. This suggests that the vast majority of taxa identified in this ecosystem are always present, but just in different proportions that are predictable. Thus observed changes in community composition are actually variations in the relative abundance of taxa, not, as was previously believed, demonstrating extinction and recolonization of taxa in the ecosystem through time.

J	Ruprecht, E; Szabo, A				Ruprecht, Eszter; Szabo, Anna			Grass litter is a natural seed trap in long-term undisturbed grassland	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Litter quantity in grasslands is highly affected by disturbance regime and influences seed recruitment of constituent species through differentmechanisms. Does litter act as a mechanical barrier to burial of freshly shed seeds, and does seed morphology affect this? How is the fate and mobility of seeds affected by litter compared to that of seeds in the seed bank? Location: Transylvanian Lowland, Romania. Methods: We analysed the seed content of litter and underlying soil collected from six dry grassland sites having different disturbance histories, ranging from sites that are currently grazed to those that have been long abandoned. We related seed content of litter to the litter quantity, seed morphology and the seed content of soil, and the estimated seed production of the above-ground vegetation. Results: Grass litter represented a natural trap for seeds; we identified significant quantities of seeds of a large number of species (37) within litter samples, and there was a mass effect in the seed trapping by litter -higher litter quantities trapped more seeds. As a long-term consequence, we expected that seed bank stores would be gradually depleted in abandoned grassland due to the elimination of seeds by litter, but this was not the case. The higher seed production of the above-ground vegetation in undisturbed sites very probably compensated for seed losses through litter. Seeds retained in the litter were larger, more rounded and had appendages than those in soil. Especially for seeds meeting any of these criteria, litter represents a hazardous medium, since the seeds may fail or have delayed germination. Conclusions: The role of litter as a seed trap is more relevant in grasslands that have not been disturbed for a long time, where litter seed entrapment can exert a selective pressure on certain species, and thus drive community assembly in grasslands.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				JUN	2012	23	3					495	504		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01376.x							WOS:000303042300009

Reciprocal transplants demonstrate strong adaptive differentiation of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana in its native range	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												To quantify adaptive differentiation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we conducted reciprocal transplant experiments for five years between two European populations, one near the northern edge of the native range (Sweden) and one near the southern edge (Italy). We planted seeds (years 13) and seedlings (years 45), and estimated fitness as the number of fruits produced per seed or seedling planted. In eight of the 10 possible site x year comparisons, the fitness of the local population was significantly higher than that of the nonlocal population (3.122.2 times higher at the southern site, and 1.73.6 times higher at the northern site); in the remaining two comparisons no significant difference was recorded. At both sites, the local genotype had higher survival than the nonlocal genotype, and at the Italian site, the local genotype also had higher fecundity. Across years, the relative survival of the Italian genotype at the northern site decreased with decreasing winter soil temperature. The results provide evidence of strong adaptive differentiation between natural populations of A similar to thaliana and indicate that differences in tolerance to freezing contributed to fitness variation at the northern site. In ongoing work, we explore the functional and genetic basis of this adaptive differentiation.

Effects of changes in the timing and duration of the wet season on the germination of the soil seed bank of a seeder-dominated Mediterranean shrubland	PLANT ECOLOGY												In seasonal climates, rainfall patterns are highly variable across years, and can control seed bank dependent regeneration. Here we asked how changing the timing and duration of the wet season would affect the germination of the soil seed bank of a 14-year-old seeder-dominated shrubland. Soil samples, subjected or not to a heat shock, simulating fire, were set to germinate in a chamber whose conditions (temperature and photoperiod) were successively changed to simulate autumn, winter, and spring. Irrigation was implemented to produce three wet season treatments, varying its timing and duration: long (14 weeks of irrigation, during autumn, winter, and spring), medium (8 weeks, late autumn to early spring) and short (4 weeks in winter). Wet season treatments significantly affected germination of shrubs and herbs, as well as species richness and diversity, whereby the later and shorter the season, the lower these variables. Dicots were more sensitive to the treatments than monocots. The timing of the wet season was also important, as similar significant differences were found when only the first 4 weeks of each simulated wet season treatment were considered; the later the season, the lower the germination and richness. Heating the soil generally increased germination but few significant effects were found. We document that a change in the timing and/or duration of the wet season can significantly affect soil seed bank germination. We discuss these results in a context of shifting rainfall patterns under climate change.

We focused explicitly on seed-bank records of ancient forest species, which are assumed to lack a persistent seed bank; a hypothesis suspected to be partly due to methodological shortcomings. Through a quantitative review of 31 seed-bank studies in temperate deciduous forests of central and north-west Europe, we quantified the role of sampling methodology in constraining total seed-bank records and seed-bank records of ancient forest species (gamma-diversity, average species' retrieval frequency and average seed density). A major methodological trade-off was established between sampled plot area and the number of plots: at an increased number of plots, the area sampled per plot decreased significantly. The total surface area sampled in a study was the primary determinant of gamma-diversity, both for overall species richness and for ancient forest species richness. A high retrieval frequency of ancient forest species indicated that few plots were intensively sampled. The parallel increase in total species richness and ancient forest species richness and the non-significance of their ratio in relation to methodological variables suggests that ancient forest species are not particularly rare in the seed bank compared to other species. These results imply that sampling methodology has a far-reaching impact on seed-bank records such as gamma-diversity, the detection of ancient forest species and ultimately seed-bank composition. We formulate a set of guidelines to improve the quality of seed-bank studies in temperate deciduous forests.

Direct and indirect effects of plant litter on a seed-pathogen interaction in Bromus tectorum seed banks	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The naturally occurring fungal seed pathogen, Pyrenophora semeniperda, reduces the seed bank of Bromus tectorum but the role of plant litter in this seed-pathogen interaction is unexplored. To investigate the direct and indirect effects of litter on this interaction, we first collected field seed-bank samples from low and high Bromus litter patches. From these data, we explored the relationship between litter depth, seed-bank density and seed mortality from P. semeniperda. Second, we manipulated the fungal stages (conidial spores and mycelium) in/on the litter through sterilization techniques, to measure the direct effect of litter on seed death. Third, for indirect effects, we manipulated litter levels and held seed density and inoculum constant to determine whether Bromus litter could modify the seed zone microsites to favour disease. We found that seed-bank samples from high-litter patches contained higher field-killed seed densities compared with low-litter patches, although the percent difference of disease between litter patch types varied among sites and years (e. g. 80% to 46%). In testing the direct effects of litter on the seed-pathogen interaction, we found that litter can act as a direct inoculum source for the pathogen in the early summer but decreases in disease transmission by the following spring when the litter naturally is in contact with seeds. Investigating indirect effects, we found four times as many pathogen-killed seeds in high-litter treatments as compared with low-litter treatments when inoculum loads and seed densities were held constant. In addition, we found that litter influences the seed-pathogen interaction through density-dependent disease transmission. Our findings demonstrate the ecological importance of litter in semi-arid environments as it influences disease levels of a seed pathogen by direct and indirect means.

We summarised the historical and recent data on this species, and analysed its distribution and associated habitat changes in the Czech Republic. We used permanent plots as well as seed bank and seed dispersal studies to obtain better insight into the plant's survival strategy. During the second half of the twentieth century T. aquatica disappeared from most historical localities situated mainly in large fishponds. After 1999, altogether 18 new populations were found in small fry ponds and other fish-farming ponds. The largest populations of Tillaea were found in ponds with long-term bottom exposure where the vegetation of perennial herbs was eliminated by herbicides or grazing. Propagules easily dispersible by water, on gumboots or tyres of vehicles, and long-term soil seed bank also might contribute to persistence of the species in the habitats, diminishing the chance of extinction. As the fishpond management has changed, and so have done the original habitats of Tillaea, the species could survive in habitats different from those in the past. In this article, we suggest management measures aimed at promoting survival of Tillaea under new circumstances.

Strigolactone analogues induce suicidal seed germination of Striga spp. in soil	WEED RESEARCH												Kgosi RL, Zwanenburg B, Mwakaboko AS & Murdoch AJ (2012). Strigolactone analogues induce suicidal seed germination of Striga spp. in soil. Weed Research52, 197203. Summary Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica are obligate root parasites that cause serious problems in the production of staple cereal crops in Africa. Because of the high levels of infestation, there is an urgent need to control these weeds. A potentially useful control option is depletion of the soil seed bank by suicidal germination, which involves germination of the seeds in the absence of host plants. Suicidal germination is often mentioned in the literature, but not considered realistic, because of the alleged untimely decomposition of the stimulants in the soil, despite the fact that some encouraging results were reported around 1980. The alleged instability has prevented active research in this direction for the past 2025 years. Five newly designed synthetic germination stimulants were investigated as candidates for suicidal germination. An important issue is the persistence of these stimulants in soil. Packets with Striga spp. seeds were put in pots with soil and then treated with aqueous solutions of the stimulants. All five compounds induced germination under these conditions, with percentages varying between 18% and 98% depending on stimulant and species. There were no noticeable signs of decomposition of the stimulants. The best performing stimulant is derived from 1-tetralone. We conclude that synthetic strigolactones analogues have excellent prospects for use in combating parasitic weeds. Further testing will be needed to evaluate whether such prospects can be realised in the field.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				JUN	2012	52	3					197	203		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2012.00912.x							WOS:000303440900001

Effects of flooding on germination and establishment of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora	WEED RESEARCH												Abbas AM, Rubio-Casal AE, De Cires A, Figueroa ME, Lambert AM & Castillo JM (2012). Effects of flooding on germination and establishment of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora. Weed Research52, 269276. Summary Flooding has been described as one of the most important environmental factors determining the distribution of salt marsh plants. We studied the impact of five water levels (from well-drained to 8 cm deep) on the germination and establishment of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora under controlled glasshouse conditions. The germination rate was ca. 60%, tending to decrease gradually with depth. There was no seedling emergence from deeper than 4 cm, because every seedling at 8 cm died. Spartina densiflora showed a high physiological plasticity. Seven months after germination, relative water content varied between 69 +/- 13% at well-drained conditions and 87 +/- 7% at 4 cm, without significant differences between treatments. Plants rooted at 4 cm presented the highest quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) with slightly lower maximum net photosynthesis rate than other treatments, reflecting high photoprotection levels, together with low nitrogen and pigments contents.

J	Plue, J; Hermy, M				Plue, Jan; Hermy, Martin			Consistent seed bank spatial structure across semi-natural habitats determines plot sampling	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Seed bank sampling remains a critical bottleneck to the quality of studies investigating community patterns in the seed bank. The main cause is a large knowledge gap in two aspects critical to sampling, i. e. spatial autocorrelation and species-area relations. The central question of this study is howthe seed bank of a single plot should be sampled, in order to obtain more precise estimates on plot seed bank characteristics, without resorting to a disproportionate investment of available resources. Similar seed bank samples may then enable better plot-based statistical inference of ecological patterns in the seed bank in community ecology studies. Location: Semi-natural habitats in Flanders (Belgium) and northern France. Methods: We investigated the fine-scale spatial structure of individual seed banking species across 12 2.1 m 9 2.1 m plots in three widespread habitats: temperate forest, grassland and heathland. Soil core samples (128) were collected in each plot, using a combined systematic (64) and random design (64). This enabled both geostatistical analyses of the fine-scale spatial structure of individual species-plot combinations as well as the calculation of sampled-based species rarefaction curves. Results: Fine-scale (i. e. within plot) spatial seed bank structure was detected in all plots in each habitat, in at least one or usually more plant species. Over half of the species records displayed significant spatial structure -visible as a random distribution of seed clusters -with medium to strong spatial dependence between point observations of a species of ca. 30 cm. Species rarefaction curves did not attain an asymptote at the actual sampling intensity of 128 samples. Seven out of 12 extrapolated species rarefaction curves did reach an asymptote in less than 384 samples. Conclusions: Using these consistent results in spatial structure and species-area relations across habitats, we present a method of how researchers can develop a tailor-made seed bank design to accommodate their individual needs, abiding by simple predefined boundaries. When the tailored design samples ca. 3% of a plot surface area along a systematic grid with a mesh width of at least 30 cm, these studies will potentially significantly increase the comparability among future seed bank community studies in semi-natural habitats.

This fragment is located on the UFV campus, in Vicosa, MG and is known as Mata da Praca de Esportes (Sports Court Forest), comprising an area of 10.65 ha under regeneration for 75 years. The sample area was subdivided into 40 plots of 3 x 5 m, distributed in 4 parallel transects. Composite samples were taken from 20 of those plots and then distributed within 40 wooden boxes, set up as seedling nurseries. Then, that amount was divided, allocating each half to shading levels of 11.5% and 60%. The total germination, as well as the one of the arbustive-arboreous species, was compared for the two conditions of shade by the test t for independent samples. The seed bank has been comprised mainly of invading herbs, mostly belonging to the Asteraceae, Solanaceae and Poaceae (I5, 4 and 3 species, respectively) families. A total of 5,194 seedlings have been recorded, mostly being arbustive-arboreous pioneer species of the Melastomataceae and Cecropiaceae families. The seed germination carried out under shade was significantly higher than under the environment with 11.5% of shade (light). Zoochoric species were more abundant, indicating the importance of the Forest fragments as a source of resources and shelter for the local fauna. The high densities of pioneer arboreous and bush species such as Cecropia hololeuca, the species of the Melastomataceae, Asteraceae and Piperaceae, which are important for forest regeneration, indicate a resilience capacity of the studied area to restoration after-disturbances.																	0100-6762					MAY-JUN	2012	36	3					423	432		10.1590/S0100-67622012000300004							WOS:000308850600004

RANGELAND DEGRADATION AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES IN BALOCHISTAN, PAKISTAN	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Rangeland ecosystems have vital role in Balochistan due to many direct services to the society like food, forage, medicines, fuel, building materials, industrial products, and indirect services of maintaining the composition of the environment, mitigating climate and moderating weather, fertilizing and stabilizing soils, disposing of wastes, cycling nutrients, storing and purifying water. Rangelands degradation in Balochistan is a major issue and affecting not only the direct users of pastoral communities but many others benefiting from the environmental services. Some of the indicators of rangelands degradation include reduction in vegetation cover, above ground plant productivity, soil erosion, elimination of soil seed bank, and shift in species composition. Rangeland degradation is site specific due to spatial, temporal variation of vegetation and utilization practices. Studies on recovery of natural vegetation, re-generation of native species, seasonal biomass variations, evaluation of fodder shrubs and community based efforts are being carried out by the Arid Zone Research Centre (AZRC), Quetta in various districts of Balochistan. Above ground dry biomass production varies from 40 to 200 kg/ha in open areas as compared to 200 to 865 kg/ha in protected areas. Heavily grazed grasslands have good recovery potential under favourable climatic conditions. Re-generation potential of native range species is limited due to weak persistent soil seed bank and insufficient rainfall distribution during germination and establishment of seedlings. Biomass availability gradually declines and winter months are critical for grazing. Fodder shrubs like Atriplex canescens and Salsola vermiculata have potential for establishment of forage reserve blocks with micro-catchment water harvesting techniques. Communities degraded rangelands can be rehabilitated either by grazing management or plantation of drought tolerant fodder shrubs on appropriate sites. A viable and sound rangeland policy and implementation strategies are mandatory for conservation and utilization of the rangeland resources on sustainable basis.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				MAY	2012	44				2		127	136									WOS:000308355500018						
J	Moreno, L; Bertiller, MB				Moreno, Laura; Bertiller, Monica B.			Variation of morphological and chemical traits of perennial grasses in arid ecosystems. Are these patterns influenced by the relative abundance of shrubs?	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We asked whether morphological and chemical traits of perennial grasses in semiarid-arid ecosystems are influenced by the abundance of coexisting shrubs, in northern-central Patagonia, Chubut Province, Argentina. We selected populations of two perennial grass species, highly preferred by herbivores (4 for Festuca pallescens and 8 for Poa ligularis)at 10 sites distributed across a wide range of aridity. We assessed the relative shrub cover (shrub cover as percent of total cover) of each site and randomly collected 5 to 10 bunches of each grass species per site in December 2007 (late vegetative-early reproductive growth period). We measured the height of vegetative tillers, and morphological (length, width, area, dry mass, and specific area) and chemical (N, C, soluble phenolics and lignin concentration) attributes of full expanded green blades in the collected bunches. Further, we computed the aridity index of each site using temperature and precipitation data. The aridity index ranged from 1.07 to 3.9 at F. pallescens sites and from 3.6 to 7.3 at P. ligularis sites. The relative shrub cover increased significantly with aridity varying from 0.01 to 99%. Tiller height, blade length, and blade area of P. ligularis increased significantly with increasing relative shrub cover and aridity. Concentration of soluble phenolics in blades of both species decreased with increasing relative shrub cover and aridity. N concentration in blades of P. ligularis and specific blade area in E pallescens decreased with increasing relative shrub cover and aridity. We conclude that some traits of perennial grasses (phenolics concentration in green blades in both species, and tiller height and some blade attributes in P. ligularis) were influenced by shrub cover itself. The variation in these traits was opposite to that expected by the effect of aridity and could be associated with escape from herbivores and/or drought, enhanced mesophytism, and reduced chemical defenses.

Use of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) tools to set priorities and optimize strategies in biodiversity conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Pantepui is a biogeographical province composed of a group of approximately 50 tabular mountain summits, or tepuis, in the southeast of Venezuela. This region, also known as Guayana Highlands (GH), lies between 1500 and 3014 m elevation and has an approximate extension of 6000 km(2). The summits of the tepuis are characterized by exceptional vascular plant diversity and high endemism. However, it is expected that ongoing global warming will produce upward displacements of summit taxa, which may cause the extinction of certain species due to habitat loss. This study assessed the potential extinction risk of the > 600 Pantepui endemic vascular plant species during the 21st century due to global warming, revealing that 30-50% of endemic species would lose their habitat by the end of this century. In light of these results, prioritization of threatened species for conservation purposes became necessary. This was achieved through the calculation of an Environmental Impact Value (EIV) for each species, and a subsequent division of these species into priority categories, which should be used in a chronological sequence to guide decision-making and future research aimed at establishing the most suitable conservation strategies. A number of in situ and ex situ conservation alternatives were discussed. In situ conservation by means of designating protected areas does not appear a viable option because of the upward habitat displacement involved in this case. Conversely, seed banks, living plant collections and managed relocation were suggested in this chronological order to preserve the species studied here. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sewage sludge fertiliser use: Implications for soil and plant copper evolution in forest and agronomic soils	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fertilisation with sewage sludge may lead to crop toxicity and environmental degradation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of two types of soils (forest and agronomic), two types of vegetation (unsown (coming from soil seed bank) and sown), and two types of fertilisation (sludge fertilisation and mineral fertilisation, with a no fertiliser control) in afforested and treeless swards and in sown and unsown forestlands on the total and available Cu concentration in soil, the leaching of this element and the Cu levels in plant. The experimental design was completely randomised with nine treatments and three replicates. Fertilisation with sewage sludge increased the concentration of Cu in soil and plant, but the soil values never exceeded the maximum set by Spanish regulations. Sewage sludge inputs increased both the total and Mehlich 3 Cu concentrations in agronomic soils and the Cu levels in plant developed in agronomic and forest soils, with this effect pronounced in the unsown swards of forest soils. Therefore, the use of high quality sewage sludge as fertiliser may improve the global productivity of forest, agronomic and silvopastoral systems without creating environmental hazards.

The regeneration ecology of Empetrum nigrum, the black crowberry, on coastal heathland in Nova Scotia	BOTANY-BOTANIQUE												The reproductive cycle of the black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum L., Ericaceae) was investigated on exposed headlands on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. At the main study site, Gaff Point, aerial photographs revealed a shoreline retreat rate from 1976 to 2011 (ca. 0.3 m.y(-1)), with a threefold increase in the rate of heath area loss in the last 10 years relative to the previous 25 years (1976-2001). Empetrum nigrum produces a large crop of berries and sets up seedlings via three main dispersers (gulls, passerines, and mink) at the sea edge and woodland margin. Laboratory study demonstrated that seed germination was scant and slow in the season of berry production but that it was rapid and substantial (mean 33%-50% from berry or scat) for seeds that incubated overwinter in berry or in scat. The largest seed bank coincides with the site of greatest berry production in the heath, but seedlings were not observed in its mat. Most of the scat rain (77%) is deposited at the shore edge and seedlings here are lost to coastal erosion over-winter. Spruce tree understories are the only safe sites for seedling establishment, and if these juveniles become adults of heathland formed after the death of edge trees, the crowberry has an ontogenetic niche shift adapted to climate change. A preliminary checklist is provided for conservation managers of coastal heaths.

Genetic structure among arable populations of Capsella bursa-pastoris is linked to functional traits and in-field conditions	ECOGRAPHY												Wild arable plants can be an economic burden but they also support diverse arable food webs and contribute to valuable ecosystem functions. These benefits may have been compromised over recent decades by declining weed diversity. The decline in wild arable plant diversity has been viewed predominantly in terms of species shifts a view that ignores the genetic and functional variation existing within species and the impact on ecological and evolutionary processes which this may have. To examine within-species diversity, ISSR markers were used in parallel with environmental and phenotypic characterisation, to investigate the population structure and diversity of Capsella bursa-pastoris (shepherd's purse) from arable fields in the UK. Analysis of 338 ISSR products for 109 individuals from 51 accessions obtained from the seed banks of 33 arable fields showed that in-field populations of shepherd's purse were genetically differentiated between individuals, and among accessions and fields. In addition, cluster analysis identified three genetically distinct regional-scale populations. Phenotypic variation was present at all scales of genetic differentiation, including the regional scale where populations differed in their key life-history traits: flowering time, fecundity and dormancy. Genetic drift is proposed as a contributor to differentiation among genetically isolated but locally co-occurring accessions. In addition, the genetic and phenotypic variation in shepherd's purse exhibited large scale, spatial trends and showed statistically significant associations with cropping intensity and soil-pH. These results suggest that adaptation as a result of selection by cropping practise and soil-pH has played a role in the ability of shepherd's purse to colonise and persist in arable fields.

Soil translocation by narrow openers with various rake angles	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												Australian no-till farming often uses narrow point openers to open the soil and place seed and fertiliser in the furrow, in conjunction with spraying pre-emergence herbicides and using press-wheels to pack soil over seeds. At speeds above 6 km h(-1) these openers can create excessive soil throw which creates problems for adjacent furrows, such as greater seeding depth and herbicide contamination, as well as increased weed germination and furrow seedbed moisture loss. This study evaluated the effect of 35 degrees, 53 degrees, 72 degrees and 90 degrees rake angles on the soil movement induced by a flat-faced narrow point opener operating at 120 mm depth and 8.2 km h(-1). Small cubic plastic tracers were used in a soil-bin environment to quantify soil movement by individual depth layer over the 0-120 mm range. Results of this study showed the large difference in action between low and high rake angle openers. A low rake angle opener was seen to move tracers placed deep in the soil up to the surface and to throw more soil and deeper soil out onto the furrow ridge. Conversely, a larger rake angle opener disturbed a smaller furrow size and achieved slightly more furrow backfill. The widest band within the furrow cleared of surface soil was achieved using the 53 degrees rake angle. Lower rake angles increased the movement from deeper soil layers into the seed zone. These findings have implications for optimising no-till seeding practices such as deep moisture movement, pre-emergence herbicide incorporation and associated crop safety, as well as weed seed germination.

The present study evaluated the effects of the distance to a preserved forest fragment on the recuperation of an abandoned agricultural field that had been naturally regenerating for 15 years in Caruaru, PE, Brazil. Seven 240 m transects were laid out perpendicular to the border between the abandoned field and preserved forest fragment, and each transect was divided into twelve 5 x 20 m contiguous plots, thus forming 12 bands at progressive distances from the preserved site. The height and diameter of all live individuals within each plot with a stem diameter >= 3 cm at ground level were recorded. At the community level, the number of individuals, their average heights and their maximum diameters did not demonstrate any statistically significant relationship with increasing distance from the preserved vegetation fragment. Only a few species demonstrated any relationship between the distance to the preserved fragment and density, basal area or ecological importance. The anthropogenically altered area had higher numbers of individuals of autochoric species than the numbers of anemochorous and zoochoric species. The relatively long period of abandonment of the area apparently masked part of the role of the preserved forest fragment in restoring the altered area through dispersal because some species could have sprouted from cut stems, while others could have germinated directly from the soil seed bank. The species Croton blanchetianus and Cordia trichotoma were identified as principal colonizers in the initial phases of succession. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Role of Propagule Banks from Drainage Ditches Dominated by Free-Floating or Submerged Plants in Vegetation Restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Dominance by free-floating plants results in a loss of plant species in many waters. An important source for re-establishment of non-floating aquatic plants can be the propagule bank. This study focuses on whether the propagule bank of free-floating plantdominated ditch sediments can serve as potential source for recovery of a diverse plant community. The first objective was to determine differences in propagule germination from sediments of ditches in the Netherlands that differ in vegetation composition through a seedling-emergence experiment. The second objective was to analyze the effect of sediment disturbance on the number of germinating propagules. The results show that, compared to sediments from ditches with submerged vegetation, sediments from free-floating plantdominated ditches produced significantly lower numbers of individuals and species of submerged and emergent plants, while numbers of individuals and species of free-floating plants were higher. These results suggest that sediments from free-floating plantdominated ditches have lower potential to recover a diverse plant community probably resulting from positive feedback mechanisms caused by the vegetation present, maintaining the free-floating plantdominated state. Sediment disturbance strongly favors the germination of free-floating plant propagules, especially from free-floating plantdominated ditch sediments. Ditch maintenance activities such as mowing and dredging will therefore likely favor persistence of the free-floating plantdominated state. To shift from dominance by free-floating plants to a more diverse plant community, alternative maintenance methods should be considered that cause less sediment disturbance together with measures that promote colonization such as temporary drawdown or re-introduction of species.

Germination of this species was evaluated to understand its ecological response. We tested the effects of different pre-germination treatments (cold, and dry and wet heat) and storage time, as well as those of natural priming in two microhabitats with different disturbance levels. Experiments were performed in laboratory conditions under constant (25 A degrees C) and fluctuating (20/30 A degrees C) temperatures. Seeds did not germinate during burial and proved to be positively photoblastic. Under pre-germination treatments, final germination percentage was higher at 20/30 A degrees C in seeds after four or more months of storage. None of the pre-germination treatments favored germination. Seeds can survive for more than 1 year and form a seed bank. Thus, seeds underwent natural priming that favored final germination percentage; however, germination rate and lag time were not affected by this process. In natural conditions, germination is delayed until the rainy season, improving the success of seedling establishment and growth. We discuss the role of fluctuating temperature in germination processes and the adaptations of seeds to their seasonal environment.

Simulation of control strategies for decision-making regarding Digitaria sanguinalis in glyphosate-resistant soybeans	CIENCIA E INVESTIGACION AGRARIA												F.H. Oreja, F. Bastida, and J.L. Gonzalez-Andujar. 2012. Simulation of control strategies for decision-making regarding Digitaria sanguinalis in glyphosate-resistant soybeans. Cien. Inv. Agr. 39(2): 299-308. A bioeconomic model was developed for decision-making regarding large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) control in glyphosate-resistant soybeans in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina. The model was used to evaluate the economic returns of four different glyphosate-based strategies for weed control. In the absence of herbicide application (T1), the soil seed bank increases to an equilibrium density of 12,079 seeds m(-2) in three years. A single herbicide application during the early stages of the crop (T2), which was intended to be highly effective in the control of an early weed cohort, allows a late, unaffected cohort to produce sufficient seeds to maintain population densities in the soil seed bank. A single, delayed herbicide application (T3), which was intended to control both early and late cohorts, results in a soil seed bank increase up to an equilibrium density similar to that achieved without treatment. Two sequential herbicide applications per year (14), targeting the two cohorts, leads to a soil seed bank density after 10 years of 107 seeds m-2. Model predictions indicate that in the absence of control measures, a 93% reduction in soybean yield was predicted due to weed interference. The lowest reduction in crop yield (27%) was predicted using strategy T4, which is the most common control measure used by local farmers. This strategy clearly outperforms the other options tested, leading to lower D. sanguinalis seed bank densities and higher soybean yields and economic returns compared to those obtained using the alternative strategies.

J	Hong, JM; Liu, S; Shi, GP; Zhang, YQ				Hong, Jianming; Liu, Shu; Shi, Guopeng; Zhang, Yuqu			Soil seed bank techniques for restoring wetland vegetation diversity in Yeyahu Wetland, Beijing	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In recent years, wetland restoration measures have created extensive concerns globally. The theory and practice of restoring wetland vegetation diversity in wetlands through soil seed banks is discussed in this paper. A comparative study on soil seed bank and species composition in Yeyahu Wetland, Beijing, was conducted in 2007. Species and quantities of seeds from 12 sample sites were counted and measured by the seed-germinating method. After germination, 27 species belonging to 16 families and 23 genera were recorded, with an average of 11.75 species per sample site, and total average density of 24831.0 individuals/m(2). There were significant differences between the soil seed bank and vegetation in spring, summer and autumn, with similarity coefficients of 0.2620 +/- 0.0868, 0.2580 +/- 0.0778 and 0.1953 +/- 0.0452, respectively. Also in 2008, by using the seed bank technique, vegetation diversity was restored in a degraded wetland near Maying River of Yeyahu Wetland through the processes of spot selection, topographic surveying, water level monitoring, and vegetation management. The results showed that in the restored regions, both species and diversity coefficients of vegetation observably increased: 73.68% of the hydrophytic species we discovered were transplanted from provenance regions; germination of seeds in the soil lasted until late September; and many species completed their life history and produced new seeds to renew the seed bank. In addition, the results suggested that seed bank technique not only increased richness and multiplicity of vegetation, but also provided food chains with animal diversity in wetlands.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Campanula rotundifolia L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivory and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Campanula rotundifolia is a slender, rhizomatous, prostrate to erect herb with long-stalked roundish basal leaves, linear stem leaves, and a blue, bell-shaped corolla. It is widespread in the British Isles though absent from parts of Ireland. Globally, C. rotundifolia has a circumpolar distribution extending from the Arctic Circle to northern Mexico and North Africa. It forms a polyploid complex with some characters linked to ploidy level. Populations in the British Isles are predominantly tetraploid and hexaploid, with occasional pentaploids. The distribution of these cytotypes in the British Isles has a strong spatial structure. 3. Campanula rotundifolia has a wide ecological amplitude, tolerating very dry conditions but also occasionally occurring in permanently saturated habitats, and it grows on a very wide range of soil types, from coarse sands through loams to heavy clays and pure peats. However, C. rotundifolia is rarely found on fertile lowland clays where competition from more vigorous species may limit growth. Campanula rotundifolia is found in a range of grassland, heath, mire, scrub and sand dune communities spanning a wide range of soil pH. 4. Campanula rotundifolia is perennial and spreads by seed and by rhizome. Plants generally overwinter as frost-resistant green rosettes. As the spring season progresses, plants make slow vegetative growth. Erect flowering stems develop from June onwards. Campanula rotundifolia is largely self-incompatible, and is insect pollinated, regularly producing large quantities of viable seed. 5. Although C. rotundifolia is a widespread and locally very common species there is some evidence from Britain and across Europe that it is in decline. These losses are likely to be due to a number of factors including agricultural intensification, reversion of grassland to scrub and woodland, disturbance, and atmospheric pollution.

Smoke Water and Heat Shock Influence Germination of Shortgrass Prairie Species	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Smoke or heat from fire can act as a cue that affects seed germination. We examined germination responses of 10 plant species (six forbs, two shrubs, two grasses) native to the southern High Plains in the United States, to smoke, heat, and their interaction ;in a laboratory experiment. Smoke treatments were applied by soaking seeds in 1:5, 1:10, or 1:100 (v/v) Regen 2000 (R) smoke solution for 20 h. Heat treatments were applied by placing seeds in an oven at 50 degrees C or 80 degrees C for S min. Nine species responded to smoke, heat, or both. Results showed that smoke can enhance, inhibit, or not affect seed germination. Germination capacities of Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britton & Rushy and Astragalus crassicarpus Nutt. were promoted by 1:5 and 1:100 dilutions of smoke water, respectively; Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt., G. sarothrae, Salvia reflexa Hornem., Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.) Koeler, and Panicum virgatum L. were inhibited by high and/or moderate concentrations of smoke water either in germination percentage or in mean germination time. Germination percentage of Solanum elaeagnifolium Cav, increased following an 80 degrees C heat treatment. Interaction effects between smoke and heat on germination also were detected. Smoke and heat treatments might be useful as management tools for promoting or suppressing specific target species of shortgrass prairie communities in future habitat management.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				MAY	2012	65	3					260	267		10.2111/REM-D-11-00093.1							WOS:000305203900006						
J	del Cacho, M; Lloret, F				del Cacho, M.; Lloret, F.			Resilience of Mediterranean shrubland to a severe drought episode: the role of seed bank and seedling emergence	PLANT BIOLOGY												Extreme climate events, such as severe drought episodes, may induce changes in vegetation if they induce species-specific adult mortality and changes in the seedling recruitment pattern. In 2005 a severe drought occurred in Don ana National Park (south Spain) causing extensive shrubland mortality. Over the following years we monitored the soil seed bank and seedling emergence via a gradient of canopy dieback induced by the drought episode. The canopy dieback corresponded to an increase in emergence of seedlings of woody species in 2007, probably because of the reduced competition induced by canopy loss. The soil seed bank of woody species sampled in 2008 was less abundant on plots with a higher proportion of dead vegetation, probably because of depletion of the seed bank as a result of the increased germination in the previous year and also as a result of a reduction in seed supply in these sites. Accordingly, in 2009 we detected reduced emergence of woody species on plots that had suffered the greatest shrub mortality. We failed to find any significant changes in patterns of the soil seed bank and seedling emergence of short-lived herbaceous species, indicating greater resilience in these types of species. This study highlights the resilience of Mediterranean shrublands to climate fluctuations at one extreme of the variability characteristic of these ecosystems. An increase in the frequency of severe drought episodes increasingly probable under the new climate conditions does have the potential, however, to induce changes in vegetation, especially in woody communities that need more time to replenish their seed banks.

We studied the re-establishment of these species after scrub clearance with and without the removal of the layer of litter and mosses in long-term (14 years) permanent plots. Most of the species belonging to the community species pool of dry alvar grassland species before clearance were found in permanent plots between 2 and 14 years after the clearance. A large part originated from vegetative spread of already occurring species in the established vegetation in the surroundings. Only a small part of the long-term persistent soil seed bank resulted in the re-establishment of alvar species. There was no significant difference in the traits soil seed bank, seed weight and long-distance dispersal by wind, dung or fur of animals of established and non-established species. Removal of litter and mosses positively affected the re-establishment of alvar species.

Aeolian process effects on vegetation communities in an arid grassland ecosystem	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Many arid grassland communities are changing from grass dominance to shrub dominance, but the mechanisms involved in this conversion process are not completely understood. Aeolian processes likely contribute to this conversion from grassland to shrubland. The purpose of this research is to provide information regarding how vegetation changes occur in an arid grassland as a result of aeolian sediment transport. The experimental design included three treatment blocks, each with a 25 x 50 m area where all grasses, semi-shrubs, and perennial forbs were hand removed, a 25 x 50 m control area with no manipulation of vegetation cover, and two 10 x 25 m plots immediately downwind of the grass-removal and control areas in the prevailing wind direction, 19. north of east, for measuring vegetation cover. Aeolian sediment flux, soil nutrients, and soil seed bank were monitored on each treatment area and downwind plot. Grass and shrub cover were measured on each grass-removal, control, and downwind plot along continuous line transects as well as on 5 x 10 m subplots within each downwind area over four years following grass removal. On grass-removal areas, sediment flux increased significantly, soil nutrients and seed bank were depleted, and Prosopis glandulosa shrub cover increased compared to controls. Additionally, differential changes for grass and shrub cover were observed for plots downwind of vegetation-removal and control areas. Grass cover on plots downwind of vegetation-removal areas decreased over time (2004-2007) despite above average rainfall throughout the period of observation, while grass cover increased downwind of control areas; P. glandulosa cover increased on plots downwind of vegetation-removal areas, while decreasing on plots downwind of control areas. The relationships between vegetation changes and aeolian sediment flux were significant and were best described by a logarithmic function, with decreases in grass cover and increases in shrub cover occurring with small increases in aeolian sediment flux.

J	Rubiales, D; Fernandez-Aparicio, M				Rubiales, Diego; Fernandez-Aparicio, Monica			Innovations in parasitic weeds management in legume crops. A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Parasitic weeds decrease severely the production of major grain and forage legumes. The most economically damaging weeds for temperate legumes are broomrapes, in particular Orobanche crenata. Broomrape species such as Orobanche foetida, Orobanche minor, and Phelipanche aegyptiaca can also induce high local damage. Other parasitic weeds such as Striga gesnerioides and Alectra vogelii decrease yield of legume crops throughout semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Dodders such as Cuscuta campestris can be damaging for some crops. Here, we review methods to control parasitic weeds. Preventing the movement of weed seeds into uninfested areas is a crucial component of control. Once a field is infested with parasitic weeds, controlling its seed production is very difficult. The only effective way to cope with parasitic weeds is to apply an integrated approach. Seedbank demise can be achieved by fumigation and solarization. However, this method is not economically feasible for low-value and low-input legume crops. A number of cultural practices including delayed sowing, hand weeding, no-tillage, nitrogen fertilization, intercropping, or rotations can contribute to seed bank demise. Other strategies such as suicidal germination, activation of systemic acquired resistance, biocontrol or target site herbicide resistance are promising solutions that are being explored but are not yet ready for direct application. The only methods currently available to farmers are the use of resistant varieties and chemical control, although both have their limitations. Chemical control with systemic herbicides such as glyphosate or imidazolinones at low rates is possible. Advances in modeling and the availability of new technologies allow the development of precision agriculture or site-specific farming. The most economical and environmentally friendly control option is the use of resistant crop varieties; however, breeding for resistance is a difficult task considering the scarce and complex nature of resistance in most crops. These strategies for parasitic weed management in legume crops will be presented and critically discussed.

Lumbricus terrestris Prefers to Consume Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata) Seeds	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Temperate and boreal forests in Canada and the northeastern United States have been invaded by several exotic species, including European earthworms (family Lumbricidae) and garlic mustard. Earthworms and garlic mustard co-occur and are both known to adversely impact some native plant species. However, relatively little is known about potential interactions between these two invaders. In a series of growth chamber experiments, we determined the palatability of garlic mustard and six native herbaceous forest species (shooting star, columbine, wild geranium, sweet cicely, butterfly milkweed, and yellow jewelweed) to the common nightcrawler. We also assessed the ability of the common nightcrawler to bury and digest garlic mustard and wild geranium. When offered seeds from garlic mustard and a native plant species, the earthworms ingested more garlic mustard seeds than seeds from four of the six native species. In a mesocosm experiment, the common nightcrawlers apparently digested 72 and 27% of garlic mustard and wild geranium seeds, respectively, that were placed on the soil surface. No seeds were observed on the soil surface at the end of the experiment but the majority of recovered seeds for both species were found within the top 10 cm (3.94 in). More seeds were recovered in 0- to 10-cm and 31- to 40-cm sections for wild geranium than for garlic mustard. No difference in seed recovery was detected at the other depths. Garlic mustard seed is readily consumed by common nightcrawlers and appears to be preferred over some native plant species suggesting that common nightcrawlers may reduce the size of the garlic mustard seed bank.

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using targeted cattle grazing and late-season prescribed burning, alone and in combination, to reduce B. tectorum seed bank input and seed bank density and thus alter aboveground community dynamics (species composition) on a B. tectorum dominated landscape in northern Nevada. Cattle removed 80 to 90% of standing biomass in grazed plots in May of 2005 and 2006 when B. tectorum was in the boot (phenological) stage. Grazed and ungrazed plots were burned in October 2005 and 2006. The combined grazing burning treatment was more effective than either treatment alone in reducing B. tectorum seed input and seed bank density, and in shifting species composition from a community dominated by B. tectorum to one composed of a suite of species, with B. tectorum as a component rather than a dominant. This study provides a meso-scale precursor for landscape-scale adaptive management using grazing and burning methodologies.																	1939-7291					APR-JUN	2012	5	2					259	269		10.1614/IPSM-D-10-00065.1							WOS:000305879800013

Seed Biology of the Invasive Species Buffalobur (Solanum rostratum) in Northwest China	WEED SCIENCE												Buffalobur is an invasive summer annual species in Xinjiang Province, China. Our purpose was to investigate certain aspects of the seed biology of this weedy species that might be useful in controlling it. In contrast to a previous report that fresh seeds have physical (water-impermeable seed coat) plus physiological (low growth potential of embryo) dormancy, our results, along with those of others, verify that the seeds have only physiological dormancy. The seed's coat is water-permeable, the embryo is fully developed at seed maturity, and dormancy can be broken by cold stratification in the field during winter and early spring. Fifty-five percent of seeds buried in the soil in autumn germinated in the soil the following May, and 53% of the remaining nongerminated seeds germinated when tested in light in the laboratory. Thus, about 20% of the seeds did not germinate but were viable, demonstrating that the species forms at least a short-lived persistent seed bank. This information will be useful in planning a management strategy for this highly invasive species in northwest China.

J	Krause, S; Luke, C; Frenzel, P				Krause, Sascha; Lueke, Claudia; Frenzel, Peter			Methane source strength and energy flow shape methanotrophic communities in oxygen-methane counter-gradients	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												The role of microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning has become an important subject in microbial ecology. Recent work indicates that microbial communities and microbial processes can be very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. However, to what extent microbial communities may change upon, resist to, or overcome disturbances might differ depending on substrate availability. We used soil from an Italian rice field in gradient microcosms, and analysed the response of methanotrophic communities to an NH4+ pulse as a potential disturbance under two different CH4 source strengths. We found a significant influence of source strength, i.e. the energy flow through the methanotrophic community, while NH4+ had no effect. Our data suggest that historical contingencies, i.e. nitrogen fertilization, led to an ammonium-tolerant MOB community. Methanotrophs were able to oxidize virtually all CH4 diffusing into the oxic-anoxic boundary layer regardless of NH4+ addition. Total and active methanotrophic communities were assessed by a pmoA-specific microarray. From the reservoir of dormant methanotrophs, different species became active with Methylobacter and an environmental cluster affiliated with paddy soils being indicative for high CH4 source strength. Thus, a microbial seed bank is an important prerequisite to maintain functioning in a fluctuating environment.

J	Richards, JH; Cao, C				Richards, Jennifer H.; Cao, Carla			Germination and early growth of Nymphaea odorata at different water depths	AQUATIC BOTANY												We experimentally determined the effects of water depth on seed germination and seedling growth and morphology, and we documented the transition from submerged to emergent plants in the white water lily. Nymphaea odorata. Seeds of N. odorata were germinated at 30, 60, and 90cm water depth in outdoor mesocosms and percent germination and morphology measured after a month. The presence of self-seeded seedlings in pots at the same 3 water levels was also recorded over two years. To examine juvenile growth, seeds planted in soil were placed at the same mesocosm depths; germination and growth were monitored for three months, when the plants were harvested for morphological and biomass measurements. N. odorata germinated equally well in 30, 60 and 90 cm water; seedlings grew as submerged aquatics. After one month, seedlings in 90 cm water had less biomass than those in 30 cm (1.1 vs. 3.3 mg and 1.0 vs. 1.8 mg for different seed sources, respectively) and allocated relatively more biomass to shoots (97.5 vs. 67.8% and 73.1 vs. 58.0%, respectively). Seedlings in 60 cm water were intermediate. After 3 months of submerged growth, plant biomass remained less in 90 vs. 60 and 30 cm water (22.5 vs. 36.4 and 33.3 mg, respectively). Plants in 90 and 60 cm water had greater biomass allocation to shoots than plants in 30 cm water (85.7 and 72.6% vs. 64.4%, respectively) and produced larger laminae on longer petioles (lamina length = 33.3 vs. 25.2 mm in 90 vs. 30 cm; petiole length = 99.0 vs. 36.0 mm, respectively). After about 3 months, submerged plants produced floating leaves that had 39% shorter laminae but 267% to 1988% longer petioles than submerged leaves on the same plant. Lamina length to width allometric relations of submerged leaves were >1 at all water levels, distinguishing them from the equal allometry of adult floating leaves. The switch from production of submerged to emergent leaves resembles submergence-escape growth in other aquatics, but because the seedlings have been submerged throughout their life, submergence itself cannot be the stimulus to produce emergent leaves in these totally immersed plants. Our data show that N. odorata plants can establish from seeds in up to 90 cm water and that seedlings grow as submerged aquatics until they switch abruptly to production of floating leaves.

Projected soil temperature increase and seed dormancy response along an altitudinal gradient: implications for seed bank persistence under climate change	PLANT AND SOIL												Background and aims Understanding the mechanistic effects of climate change on species key life-history stages is essential for predicting ecological responses. In fire-prone regions, long-term seed banks allow post-fire recovery and persistence of plant populations. For physically dormant species, seed bank longevity depends on the maintenance of dormancy which is controlled primarily by temperature. Successful inter-fire recruitment is rare and dormancy loss between fires produces a net loss to the seed bank. We assessed whether temperature increases related to climate change can affect seed dormancy and, potentially, seed bank longevity. Methods We quantified the relationship between air temperatures and soil temperatures. Seeds of two shrub species, from four populations along an altitudinal gradient, were then exposed to a range of soil temperatures calculated to occur at the end of the 21st century, using projected mean and heat wave scenarios. Alterations to dormancy were assessed via germination. Results For every 1 degrees C increase in air temperature, associated soil temperature increased by 1.5 degrees C. Mean temperature increase had no affect on seed dormancy. However, future heat wave conditions produced soil temperatures that significantly increased dormancy loss. This impact was greatest in seeds from cooler, high elevation populations. Conclusions Projected heat wave events produce conditions that provide a mechanism for seed bank compromise. Dormancy-breaking temperatures for each population were positively related to parental environment temperatures, indicating local adaptation. Whilst heat from fire may govern post-fire recruitment response, we suggest that parental climate is the key selective force determining dormancy-breaking threshold temperatures, ensuring inter-fire seed bank persistence.

Intensive thinning strongly increased light and soil temperature but reduced litter accumulation, thus facilitating seed germination, seedling emergence, and seedling survival of primarily early- and mid-successional species compared to late-successional species. As a result, more early- and mid-successional species were observed in Intensive compared to Weak and Control, whereas the number of late-successional species did not differ among thinning intensities. Thus, the number of species was greatest in Intensive but lowest in Control throughout the 5 years. However, Shannon's diversity index (H') did not strongly differ among thinning intensities, largely due to the predominance of the mid-successional species Cornus controversa, particularly in Intensive. In Control and Weak, both seedling survival and height were often greater for advance regeneration than for seedlings newly emerged in the year following thinning, whereas neither variable differed between advance regeneration and seedlings newly emerged in Intensive, mainly due to selective predation of advance regeneration by mammalian herbivores. These results suggest that the future composition of hardwoods can be roughly predicted by the composition of advance regeneration in Weak but by the composition of both advance regeneration and seedlings newly emerged in Intensive. When comparing large individuals (height >1.5 m), the number of species was greatest in Intensive in 2008, 5 years post-thinning, primarily due to rapid vertical growth regardless of successional status. These results suggest that within a C. japonica plantation, a canopy-level mixed conifer-hardwood forest would be more probable and occur more rapidly in Intensive compared to Weak. In Weak, enhanced species diversity would likely be restricted to the understorey layer because of the slower growth rate and lower survival rate of hardwood seedlings caused by the more rapid deterioration of favourable environmental conditions.

Invasion of alien Acacia dealbata on Spanish Quercus robur forests: Impact on soils and vegetation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Invasive tree Acacia dealbata was introduced in the Iberian Peninsula in the 19th century. Nowadays, it is spreading in wide areas in which native vegetation has been altered or removed by human-activities, as in the case of Quercus robur forests in the northwest of Spain. In this article we assess the impact of A. dealbata invasion on soil properties (pH, organic matter, total N, NH4+-N and NO3--N), light characteristics (direct and diffuse photon flux density and leaf area index) and soil seed bank and established vegetation. We selected three sites where native Q. robur forests and A. dealbata invaded patches grow nearby. Before 2008 autumn rains, we took soil samples under five trees per species (A. dealbata and Q robur) and site to determine soil seed bank floristic composition and soil properties. In spring 2009 we monitored the floristic composition of the vegetation growing under the same trees. Our results show that A. dealbata presence increases total N, NH4+-N and NO3--N and decreases pH in soils but does not affect light characteristics. Acacia dealbata modifies soil seed bank composition by decreasing species richness, seed density and the percentage of bryophyte and fern spores, and by increasing the percentage of Asteraceae and exotic species. Understorey of invaded A. dealbata forests shows a decrease in species richness and plant cover. Finally, A. dealbata reduces the similarity between the soil seed bank and the established vegetation. These results suggest that A. dealbata invasion produces a deep impact on Q robur forests that hampers their regeneration, even after A. dealbata removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The way light stress controls the recruitment of aquatic plants (phanerogams and charophytes) is a key process controlling plant biodiversity, although still poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate how light stress induced by phytoplankton, that is, independent from the aquatic plants themselves, determines the recruitment and establishment of plant species from the propagule bank. The hypotheses were that an increase in light stress (i) decreases abundance and species richness both of established aquatic plants and of propagules in the bank and (ii) decreases the recruitment success of plants from this bank. 2. These hypotheses were tested in 25 shallow lakes representing a light stress gradient, by sampling propagule banks before the recruitment phase and when the lakes are devoid of actively growing plants (i.e. at the end of winter), established vegetation at the beginning of the summer and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) during the recruitment and establishment phase. 3. The phytoplankton biomass was negatively correlated with the richness and abundance of established vegetation but was not correlated with the propagule bank (neither species richness nor propagule abundance). The similarity between the propagule bank and established vegetation decreased significantly with increasing phytoplankton biomass. 4. The contrast in species composition between the vegetation and the propagule bank at the highest light stress suggests poor recruitment from the propagule bank but prompts questions about its origin. It could result from dispersal of propagules from neighbouring systems. Propagules could also originate from a persistent propagule bank formerly produced in the lake, suggesting strong year-to-year variation in light stress and, as a consequence, in recruitment and reproductive success of plants.				bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017	bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060; Arthaud, Florent/0000-0002-9632-264X; Mousset, Mathilde/0000-0002-3839-395X; Wezel, Alexander/0000-0001-5088-5087												0046-5070					APR	2012	57	4					666	675		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02730.x							WOS:000301227000003

Demography of a dormancy-prone geophyte: influence of spatial scale on interpretation of dynamics	PLANT ECOLOGY												Both temporal and spatial scales are important in the evaluation of population dynamics, but the latter often receives less attention in demographic analyses. We used a 5-year demographic data set for a long-lived geophyte, Calochortus lyallii, to investigate the pattern and components of spatial variation at two scales (population and microsite). We found that neither the projected population structure nor asymptotic population growth rate (lambda) varied greatly across either scale, although the underlying contributors to the variation in lambda, V(lambda), did differ between scales. Life table response experiment analyses showed that V(lambda) among populations came primarily from variation in seedling survival and progression of non-reproductive plants, whereas V(lambda) among microsites was primarily due to the variable fertility of large adults. Prolonged dormancy was important in reducing V(lambda) among quadrats at both the scales, partly countering fluctuations in other transitions such as recruitment. This result represents some of the first evidence that underground "bulb banks" could function to offset the effects of a spatially heterogeneous environment in a manner analogous to seed banks. Future work is needed to isolate the specific, sometimes idiosyncratic, life history phenomena acting to modulate plant population dynamics in a spatial context.

Dominance of native grasses leads to community convergence in wetland restoration	PLANT ECOLOGY												Wetland restoration is a pressing conservation priority, but there are few replicated field studies that provide a scientific foundation for these activities. We conducted a 3-year, replicated field experiment to examine the effectiveness of initial site preparation techniques (combinations of solarization, herbicide, tilling, and thermal weed control) in restoring native plant biodiversity to an agricultural field in a former wetland prairie in Oregon, USA. Post-treatment, plots were sown with a typical restoration mix of native graminoids and forbs. Treatments were compared to three high-quality managed reference wetlands and the adjacent agricultural field. Site preparation treatments varied in their effectiveness in suppressing extant vegetation and eliminating the residual seed bank. After 1 year, the solarization and fall herbicide application treatments were the most effective at reducing exotic cover. However, after 3 years, plant community composition converged in all treatments due to a loss of annual species and increasing dominance of native perennial bunchgrasses. Plant community composition became more similar to the reference wetlands each year, but diversity and richness diverged, apparently due to a trade-off between the cover of the dominant native bunchgrasses and diversity. Successional theory offers insights into how priority effects and competitive inhibition may influence community trajectories, and offers a useful model for restoring plant communities with high native diversity and dominance. Finding ways to mitigate the tradeoff between native plant cover and diversity by actively managing successional trajectories is an important challenge in wetland restoration that deserves further investigation.

Seed bank survival of an invasive species, but not of two native species, declines with invasion	OECOLOGIA												Soil-borne seed pathogens may play an important role in either hindering or facilitating the spread of invasive exotic plants. We examined whether the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Caprifoliaceae) affected fungi-mediated mortality of conspecific and native shrub seeds in a deciduous forest in eastern Missouri. Using a combination of L. maackii removal and fungicide treatments, we found no effect of L. maackii invasion on seed viability of the native Symphoricarpos orbiculatus (Caprifoliaceae) or Cornus drummondii (Cornaceae). In contrast, fungi were significant agents of L. maackii seed mortality in invaded habitats. Losses of L. maackii to soil fungi were also significant in invaded habitats where L. maackii had been removed, although the magnitude of the effect of fungi was lower, suggesting that changes in soil chemistry or microhabitat caused by L. maackii were responsible for affecting fungal seed pathogens. Our work suggests that apparent competition via soil pathogens is not an important factor contributing to impacts of L. maackii on native shrubs. Rather, we found that fungal seed pathogens have density-dependent effects on L. maackii seed survival. Therefore, while fungal pathogens may provide little biotic resistance to early invasion by L. maackii, our study illustrates that more work is needed to understand how changes in fungal pathogens during the course of an invasion contribute to the potential for restoration of invaded systems. More generally, our study suggests that increased rates of fungal pathogen attack may be realized by invasive plants, such as L. maackii, that change the chemical or physical environment of the habitats they invade.																	0029-8549					APR	2012	168	4					1103	1110		10.1007/s00442-011-2159-x							WOS:000301604200020	22006283					
J	Tan, X				Tan, Xiao			Physiological and ecological characteristics in the life cycle of bloom-forming cyanobacteria	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater lakes provide water sources for drinking, aquaculture, agricultural irrigation, and so on, but many eutrophic lakes around the world are suffered by cyanobacterial blooms. These harmful cyanobacteria (such as Microcytis, Anabaena, Aphnizomenon, and so on) are capable of nuisance growth and producing toxins, which pose serious threats to water safety and human health. Based on most of the literature, this paper reviewed the progress made in following fields: physiological and ecological characteristics of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in their annual life cycle, internal regulation mechanisms and environmental factors for blooms formation. In winter, dormant period is regarded as the continuation of cyanobacteria populations, which conserve "seed bank" for the following year. In spring, recruitment can be defined as an inoculation of overwintering cyanobacteria to the pelagic phase after growth recovery under suitable conditions. Temperature, resuspension and bioturbation had been recognized lobe the main driving factors for recruitment. Shortly after recruitment, cyanobacteria establish dominance by fast growth rate (i.e. r-type ecological strategy) and colony enlargement. Under suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions, cyanobacterial colonies aggregate and float up to form heavy blooms, which can lead to water supply crisis and ecological disaster. From late autumn, blooms disaggregate and decline. The sinking process is not only a periodic life cycle but also an irregular mechanical movement. Cyanobacteria accumulation areas in late autumn might highly related to the First occurence of blooms in the following year. The time series of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in lakes of temperate and subtropical zones could be summarized as the four-stage hypothesis, but the spatial patterns of blooms in large lakes were rarely explored. Moreover, further studies are needed to explore the threshold values of environmental factors at each stage, and compare the ecophysiological differences between cyanobacteria and other algae, which could provide valuable information for the prediction and prevention of harmful blooms, so as to establish a sound and stable lacustrine ecosystem.																	1459-0255	1459-0263				APR	2012	10	2	3				929	934									WOS:000305310800004						
J	Gomaa, NH				Gomaa, Nasr H.			Soil seed bank in different habitats of the Eastern Desert of Egypt	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The floristic composition and species diversity of the germinable soil seed bank were studied in three different habitats (desert salinized land, desert wadi, and reclaimed land) in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Moreover, the degree of similarity between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation was determined. The seed bank was studied in 40 stands representing the three habitats. Ten soil samples (each 25 x 20 cm and 5 cm depth) were randomly taken per stand. The seed bank was investigated by the seedling emergence method. Some 61 species belonging to 21 families and 54 genera were identified in the germinable seed bank. The recorded species include 43 annuals and 18 perennials. Ordination of stands by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) indicates that the stands of the three habitats are markedly distinguishable and show a clear pattern of segregation on the ordination planes. This indicates variations in the species composition among habitats. The results also demonstrate significant associations between the floristic composition of the seed bank and edaphic factors such as CaCO3, electrical conductivity, organic carbon and soil texture. The reclaimed land has the highest values of species richness, Shannon-index of diversity and the density of the germinable seed bank followed by the habitats of desert wadi and desert salinized land. Motyka's similarity index between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation is significantly higher in reclaimed land (75.1%) compared to desert wadi (38.4%) and desert salinized land (36.5%).

J	Kalamees, R; Pussa, K; Zobel, K; Zobel, M				Kalamees, Rein; Puessa, Kersti; Zobel, Kristjan; Zobel, Martin			Restoration potential of the persistent soil seed bank in successional calcareous (alvar) grasslands in Estonia	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: What is the overall restoration potential of the persistent soil seed bank of abandoned alvar grassland sites? To what degree does the share of characteristic alvar grassland species in the soil seed bank change during secondary succession from traditionally managed pasture towards stages overgrown by Corylus avellana and Juniperus communis? Location: Northern Estonia. Methods: The species composition of above-ground vegetation and the persistent soil seed bank were investigated in successional alvar grasslands. Particular attention was given to typical grassland species in the persistent soil seed bank. Soil seed bank density was also recorded. General linear models and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to assess successional trends and the restoration potential of the soil seed bank. Results: The cessation of traditional management has led to a considerable decline in above-ground plant species richness. The composition of above-ground vegetation in different successional stages was considerably more variable than that of the seed bank. We detected large and species-rich persistent soil seed banks in all our study sites. About 70% of species in the seed banks of overgrown sites could be classified as typical grassland species. The frequency of typical alvar grassland species, such as Arabis hirsuta, Arenaria serpyllifolia, Cerastium fontanum, Helianthemum nummularium, Poa angustifolia, Potentilla crantzii, Sedum acre and Veronica spicata in the seed bank of long-term abandoned (25 and 50 yr) sites was unexpectedly high. Conclusions: Abandoned semi-natural grassland sites in northern Estonia still contain a relatively large grassland community species pool, including a large and effective soil seed bank. The soil seed bank could thus play amore important role in the restoration management of abandoned dry grassland communities than could be concluded from previous studies.

The effect of heat and smoke on the emergence of exotic and native seedlings in a Mediterranean fire-free matorral of central Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												We studied the effect of heat shock and wood-fueled smoke on the emergence of native and exotic plant species in soil samples obtained in an evergreen matorral of central Chile that has been free of fire for decades. It is located on the eastern foothills of the Andes Range in San Carlos de Apoquindo. Immediately after collection samples were dried and stored under laboratory conditions. For each two transect, ten samples were randomly chosen, and one of the following treatments was applied: (1) heat-shock treatment, (2) plant-produced smoke treatment, (3) combined heat-and-smoke treatment, and (4) control, corresponding to samples not subjected to treatment. Twenty-seven species, representing 13 families, emerged from the soil samples. The most abundant families were Asteraceae and Poaceae. All of the emerged species were herbaceous, and 18 species were exotic. Respect to general hypothesis, there is no evidence for the proposition that fire-free matorral has lower proportion of exotic and native species with fire-related cues than matorral with fires. Among the exotic and native, the mean number of species that emerged from soil samples did not change significantly with respect to the control for any of the treatments applied. Nevertheless, important species-specific responses were observed. Smoke and heat-smoke combination significantly increased the emergence of the exotic species Anthriscus caucalis. While smoke-related cues significantly increased the emergence of the exotic species Avena barbata, the emergence of the exotic Aphanes arvensis and the native Bromus berteroanus decreases. For several species our results showed inconsistent responses to fire-related cues compared to those reported in the literature. We suggest that these differences might be related with the fire-history in the populations, an important issue poorly acknowledge in the literature.

Acacia saligna seed banks: Sampling methods and dynamics, Western Cape, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Acacia saligna is potentially the most damaging invasive species in the coastal lowlands of the south-western Cape. The gall rust fungus, Uromycladium tepperianum, has been highly successful as a biological control agent for A. saligna populations in South Africa and has effectively reduced density, canopy cover and seed production of the tree. However, concerns still remain about the soil-stored seed bank and knowledge of seed bank status and dynamics is crucial for effective management. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two different sampling methods in assessing the status of the seed bank, how the seed bank of A. saligna at two different sites varies over time and how these findings compare to findings of other seed bank studies of A. saligna across southern Africa. Even with the reduction in seed production caused by biological control, numbers of seed in the soil seed bank are high enough to maintain high levels of recruitment after management or natural disturbances. Both sampling methods (grid and random sampling) attempted were effective in assessing the vertical distribution of the seed bank and estimated the size of the seed bank to be within the same order of magnitude. However, random sampling is more effective in assessing seed bank size as it was found that the seed has a clumped horizontal distribution. The vertical distribution of seed in the seed bank was found to be influenced by soil properties. The largest portion of the seed bank is situated in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile and declines in size with depth. (C) 2011 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in seed dispersal processes and the potential for between-patch connectivity for an arid land daisy	ECOLOGY												Dispersal is a major and critical process in population biology that has been particularly challenging to study. Animals can have major roles in seed dispersal even in species that do not appear specifically adapted to animal-aided dispersal. This can occur by two processes: direct movement of diaspores by animals and modification of landscape characteristics by animals in ways that greatly influence dispersal. We exploited the production of large, persistent dispersal structures (seed heads, henceforth) by Erodiophyllum elderi (Asteraceae), a daisy from arid Australia, to further understand secondary dispersal. Seed head dispersal on and off animal tracks in eight E. elderi patches was monitored for 9.5 months by periodically recording the location of marked seed heads. Sites were located inside a reserve that excludes sheep but not kangaroos, and in a nearby area with both kangaroos and sheep. The distance moved and likelihood of seed head movement was higher in areas with sheep, and especially along animal tracks. There was clear evidence that seed heads were channeled down animal tracks during large rainfall events. Seed head dispersal away from patches occurred to a limited extent via their physical contact with sheep and potentially via wind dispersal. Thus, the advantages of this study system allowed us to demonstrate the two postulated effects of herbivores on dispersal via direct movement of seed heads, and two distinct indirect effects through landscape modification by herbivores from the creation of animal tracks and the denudation of vegetation.

Our objective was to investigate whether extracts from non-host plants, specifically, Chinese medicinal plants, could stimulate germination of Orobanche spp. Samples of 606 Chinese medicinal herb species were extracted with deionized water and methanol. The extracts were used to induce germination of three Orobanche species; Orobanche minor, Orobanche cumana, and Orobanche aegyptiaca. O. minor exhibited a wide range of germination responses to the various herbal extracts. O. cumana and O. aegyptiaca exhibited an intermediate germination response to the herbal extracts. O. minor, which has a narrow host spectrum, showed higher germination rates in response to different herbal extracts compared with those of O. cumana and O. aegyptiaca, which have a broader host spectrum. Methanolic extracts of many Chinese herbal species effectively stimulated seed germination among the Orobanche spp., even though they were not the typical hosts. The effective herbs represent interesting examples of potential trap crops. Different countries can also screen extracts from indigenous herbaceous plants for their ability to induce germination of Orobanche spp. seeds. The use of such species as trap plants could diminish the global soil seed bank of Orobanche.

J	Cursach, J; Rita, J				Cursach, Joana; Rita, Juan			Implications of the reproductive biology of the narrow endemic Naufraga balearica (Apiaceae) for its conservation status	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												Naufraga balearica is an endemic umbelliferous plant of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain), considered Critically Endangered according IUCN categories. We present a study of its reproductive biology to look for the causes of its threatened status. It was carried out in natural populations at Cap de Catalunya and Coves Blanques and in ex-situ cultivated plants on the campus of the Universitat de les Illes Balears. We examined (1) the flowering and fruiting phenology, reproductive potential and reproductive success; (2) the pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio and mating system; (3) the identities and numbers of pollinators; (4) the germination potential and the effect of temperature on the germination process; and (5) the seedling performance of this species. The results indicated that under natural conditions, an average individual produced approximately 100 seeds and cross-pollination was the most effective mating system. Pollination was myrmecophilous, and the germination potential was high (76-97%), but seedling survival after the first summer was low (7-54%). We conclude that the major threats to this species are fundamentally extrinsic in character and are related to changing climatic conditions, soil erosion and alteration, and umbel predation. Given that cross-pollination yields greater reproductive success and that pollination is myrmecophilous, lower population densities would lead to lower reproductive success for the species. Therefore, conservation efforts should focus primarily on habitat conservation and on ex-situ conservation through the establishment of an ex-situ population and the maintenance of a seed bank.

There are over 600 species of tropical timbers in the world, many of which are commercially valuable in the international trade of plywood, roundwood, sawnwood, and veneer. Many of these tree species are being threatened and are endangered because of logging practices, conversion to agricultural lands, non-optimal management strategies, and overall deforestation rates that cannot keep up with natural regeneration of native forests. Tropical tree species provide timber for commercial uses because of the beauty of the wood-grain, -color, or -pattern, strength, durability, and versatility of finishing applications for a vast array of markets. Because of the high value of tropical tree species, in vitro (adventitious shoot regeneration, cryopreservation, genetic transformation, micrografting, protoplast culture, shoot tip and nodal culture, and somatic embryogenesis) propagation technologies are an integral component in tree improvement and conservation programs, in order to complement seed banking and ex situ measures for long-term conservation and clonal propagation of germplasm. Tropical tree species are also important because wildlife populations may be affected, soils can be stabilized and organic matter and nutrients in the forest floor altered, degraded areas can be restored, and tropical trees also provide socio-economic development for local communities. In addition, tropical tree species are valuable as ornamentals for landscaping (shade, flower, fall foliage, and fruit production), and as resources for a multitude of known and yet unknown commercial properties, such as medicinal drugs, natural insecticides, industrial uses, and non-timber products. This paper is a literature review (2001-2011) on in vitro propagation of tropical tree species grown or harvested for timber.

BURIAL INCREASES SEED LONGEVITY OF TWO ARTEMISIA TRIDENTATA (ASTERACEAE) SUBSPECIES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study : Seed longevity and persistence in soil seed banks may be especially important for population persistence in ecosystems where opportunities for seedling establishment and disturbance are unpredictable. The fire regime, an important driver of population dynamics in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, has been altered by exotic annual grass invasion. Soil seed banks may play an active role in postfire recovery of the foundation shrub Artemisia tridentata, yet conditions under which seeds persist are largely unknown. Methods : We investigated seed longevity of two Artemisia tridentata subspecies in situ by retrieving seed bags that were placed at varying depths over a 2 yr period. We also sampled naturally dispersed seeds in litter and soil immediately after seed dispersal and before flowering in subsequent seasons to estimate seed persistence. Key results : After 24 mo, seeds buried at least 3 cm below the soil surface retained 30-40% viability whereas viability of seeds on the surface and under litter declined to 0 and < 11%, respectively. The density of naturally dispersed seeds in the seed bank was highly heterogeneous both spatially and temporally, and attrition varied significantly by region. Conclusions : Our study suggests that Artemisia tridentata has the potential to form a short-term soil seed bank that persists longer than has been commonly assumed, and that burial is necessary for seed longevity. Use of seeding techniques that promote burial of some seeds to aid in formation of a soil seed bank may increase restoration potential.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				MAR	2012	99	3					438	447		10.3732/ajb.1000477							WOS:000301254600016	22301894

However, information on how environment factors influence the vegetation patterns at different spatial scales in semiarid area ecosystem is lacking. We measured vegetation compositions and environment characteristics form 55 sample sites in grassland habitat (flood plain grassland, wet meadow, dry meadow) and sand dune habitat (fixed dune, semi-fixed dune, mobile dune) in Horqin Sandy Land. Multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between vegetation patterns and environment factors at the two scales of habitat and region. Vegetation cover, aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and soil water content decreased from grassland habitat to sand dune habitat. Vegetation cover increased with the increase in soil water content in grassland habitat. Vegetation cover, species diversity and aboveground biomass increased with the increase in soil organic C, total N and EC in sand dune habitat. The most important complex gradient determining vegetation pattern and composition showed a region scale relationship with the combination of soil properties and topography features. Soil water content, EC and altitude were closely related to the vegetation distribution in grassland habitat, whereas soil organic C, total N and EC were significantly related to the vegetation distribution in sand dune habitat. Our results suggest that vegetation-environment relationships are dependent on the scale of observation. Thus, the interpretation of the vegetation pattern and composition in semiarid area needs to consider the spatial scales and habitats at which important environmental variables actually vary.

Linking landscape history and dispersal traits in grassland plant communities	OECOLOGIA												Dispersal limitation and long-term persistence are known to delay plant species' responses to habitat fragmentation, but it is still unclear to what extent landscape history may explain the distribution of dispersal traits in present-day plant communities. We used quantitative data on long-distance seed dispersal potential by wind and grazing cattle (epi- and endozoochory), and on persistence (adult plant longevity and seed bank persistence) to quantify the linkages between dispersal and persistence traits in grassland plant communities and current and past landscape configurations. The long-distance dispersal potential of present-day communities was positively associated with the amounts of grassland in the historical (1835, 1938) landscape, and with a long continuity of grazing management-but was not associated with the properties of the current landscape. The study emphasises the role of history as a determinant of the dispersal potential of present-day grassland plant communities. The importance of long-distance dispersal processes has declined in the increasingly fragmented modern landscape, and long-term persistent species are expected to play a more dominant role in grassland communities in the future. However, even within highly fragmented landscapes, long-distance dispersed species may persist locally-delaying the repayment of the extinction debt.

Soil seed bank, fire season, and temporal patterns of germination in a seeder-dominated Mediterranean shrubland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks play a major role in the post-fire regeneration of Mediterranean shrublands. They vary throughout the year in species composition, abundance, and readiness to germinate. After fire, germination occurs mainly during the following fall to spring. Time of germination can determine recruitment success. It is unclear what factors control post-fire germination and its timing. We tested the effects of season and fire on the readily germinable soil seed bank of a seeder-dominated shrubland. Plots were burned early and late in the summer season (ES, LS). Soil samples were collected before and after fire, and germinated in a chamber simulating successively autumn, winter, and spring conditions. Samples were kept moistened at all times. Fire intensity was similar between ES and LS. Several species of Cistus and herbs, mostly annuals, were dominant. Most germination occurred during the simulated-autumn period, with little subsequent germination during the following two periods. Germination speed (T (50)) during simulated-autumn was similar for shrubs and herbs, and independent of season or fire. Germination was lower for two shrubs (Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus salvifolius) and higher for herbaceous dicots in LS than in ES soils. Fire reduced monocots and enhanced Cistus. Germination period significantly interacted with fire and season in some groups or species, altering the simulated-autumn germination peak. We demonstrate that the seed bank can germinate swiftly under simulated-autumn conditions. Hence, water availability is the main controlling factor of germination. Fire season differentially affected some species or groups, and could affect the post-fire regeneration.

The parasitic plant is a socioeconomic problem that has forced some resource-poor farmers to abandon their farms due to high infestation. This study was designed in order to elucidate farmers' perceptions of Striga control measures and to determine their potential adoption in two villages in western Kenya. Participatory rural appraisals and individual interviews were conducted in 2009 and 2010 in a sample of 128 and 120 households in Kaura and Kogweno-Oriang villages in Homabay and Rachuonyo districts, respectively. The results revealed that crop production was the main occupation in most households. The farmers identified Striga as one of the major constraints to maize, sorghum, and finger millet production. According to the farmers, the most popular control measures were hand-pulling, crop rotation, and intercropping, even though rotational systems might need a longer timeframe to reduce the soil seed bank of Striga. Although the level of Striga infestation and damage were increasing in the farmers' fields, the adoption of the control options was limited. The reason for the low adoption level of the control methods by the farmers is because they are too risky as there is no guarantee of a direct pay-off in increased crop yield. Farmer-led evaluation and adaptation of the various Striga control technologies in real-life situations will facilitate the choice of appropriate options and facilitate their uptake.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				MAR	2012	12	1					53	62		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2012.00435.x							WOS:000301492700007

Influence of Grazing on Soil Seed Banks Determines the Restoration Potential of Aboveground Vegetation in a Semi-arid Savanna of Ethiopia	BIOTROPICA												Species composition, number of emerging seedlings, species diversity and functional group of the soil seed banks, and the influence of grazing on the similarity between the soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation, were studied in 2008 and 2009 in a semi-arid savanna of Ethiopia. We tested whether the availability of persistent seeds in the soil could drive the transition from a degraded system under heavy grazing to healthy vegetation with ample perennial grasses. A total of 77 species emerged from the soil seed bank samples: 21 annual grasses, 12 perennial grasses, 4 herbaceous legumes, 39 forbs, and 1 woody species. Perennial grass species dominated the lightly grazed sites, whereas the heavily grazed sites were dominated by annual forbs. Heavy grazing reduced the number of seeds that can germinate in the seed bank. Species richness in the seed bank was, however, not affected by grazing. With increasing soil depth, the seed density and its species richness declined. There was a higher similarity in species composition between the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation at the lightly grazed sites compared with the heavily grazed sites. The mean similarity between the seed banks and aboveground vegetation was relatively low, indicating the effect of heavy grazing. Moreover, seeds of perennial grasses were less abundant in the soil seed banks under heavy grazing. We concluded that restoration of grass and woody species from the soil seed banks in the heavily grazed areas could not be successful in semi-arid savannas of Ethiopia.																	0006-3606	1744-7429				MAR	2012	44	2					211	219		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2011.00780.x							WOS:000300941200010						
J	Cheib, AL; Garcia, QS				Cheib, Ana Loureiro; Garcia, Queila Souza			Longevity and germination ecology of seeds of endemic Cactaceae species from high-altitude sites in south-eastern Brazil	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The influence of light and temperature on germination behaviour and the longevity of seeds were evaluated in four taxa of the genus Arthrocereus (Cactaceae). Germination experiments were conducted at six constant temperatures with a 12-h photoperiod and in continuous darkness. For in situ storage tests, the seeds were buried in the soil where the species naturally occur, and germination experiments were performed for 14 months. Seeds were also stored dry at room temperature in the laboratory for 12 months. The results indicated that, in spite of the variations between the four taxa studied, there is a consistent pattern in their germination behaviour. The seeds are small, with an absolute requirement of light for germination. In the presence of light, we obtained high germinability at temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees C and low germination percentages at 10, 15 and 35 degrees C. This behaviour may represent an adaptive mechanism during seasons when environmental conditions in open rocky fields are not favourable for seedling survival. In general, germination was relatively slow, which would favour establishment during the rainy season. Dry storage did not significantly alter seed germination behaviour, and buried seeds, likewise, remained viable and retained high germination percentages. We can therefore infer that the seeds of the species studied here are able to form persistent soil seed-banks. All studied species are threatened with extinction, so their ability to form soil seed-banks, together with the possibility of ex situ seed preservation, will possibly give support for future conservation efforts.

Common and distinct responses in phytohormone and vitamin E changes during seed burial and dormancy in Xyris bialata and X. peregrina	PLANT BIOLOGY												Temperature and humidity are the main factors influencing seed viability, dormancy and longevity of buried seeds. Unfortunately, very little is known about such processes in species of tropical regions, where temperature does not show major seasonal variations. The extent to which germination capacity, phytohormones and vitamin E levels were altered after burial of seeds of Xyris bialata and X.peregrina (Xyridaceae), two species endemic to rupestrian fields of Brazil, was examined. After 2 months of burial, seed germination capacity remained constant, which is associated with decreases in ABA and IAA content in both species. During this period, zeatin levels also decreased in X.bialata, but not in X.peregrina, the latter showing much lower levels of ABA. During the summer (rainy season), seeds of both species experienced a progressive, but severe, decrease in germination capacity, which reversed at the end of the winter (dry season), thus suggesting secondary dormancy. This dormancy appeared to be caused by drastic decreases in GAs, rather than increases in ABA. Levels of GA4 decreased to non-detectable values during dormancy in both species. Furthermore, zeatin levels decreased in X.bialata but not in X.peregrina during this period. Both species accumulated ?-tocopherol as the major vitamin E form, and levels of this antioxidant remained constant or even increased during seed burial; however, X.bialata seeds showed a significant decrease in a-tocopherol during seed burial and dormancy. It is concluded that in X.peregrina and X.bialata, (i) burial causes significant changes in the phytohormone levels of seeds; (ii) secondary dormancy is induced in seeds; (iii) a GA4 decrease, rather than an ABA increase, seems to be involved in the induction of secondary dormancy; and (iv) reductions in a-tocopherol in buried seeds are not necessarily indicative of reduced germination capacity.

Seed banks on Attalea phalerata (Arecaceae) stems in the Pantanal wetland, Brazil	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Seeds can accumulate in the soil or elsewhere, such as on the stems of palms when these are covered by persistent sheaths. These sheaths could act as a safe site for some species. Here, we studied whether persistent sheaths of the palm Attalea phalerata (Arecaceae) are available sites for seed accumulation in the Pantanal wetland of Brazil. We also investigated whether the composition, richness and diversity of species of seeds in the persistent sheaths are determined by habitat (riparian forest and forest patches) and/or season (wet and dry). All accumulated material was collected from ten persistent sheaths along the stems of 64 A. phalerata individuals (16 per habitat and 16 per season). The material was then individually inspected under a stereomicroscope to record seed species and number. Of the 640 sheaths sampled, 65 contained seeds (n 3468). This seed bank included 75 species belonging to 12 families, and was primarily composed of small, endozoochoric seeds, with a few abundant species (Cecropia pachystachya and Ficus pertusa). Moraceae was the richest family (four species) and Urticaceae the most abundant (1594 seeds). Stems of A. phalerata in the riparian forest had 18 times more seeds and 13 times more species than those in forest patches. In the wet season we sampled 41 times more seeds and 22 more species on palm stems than in the dry season. Richness did not differ between habitats, but was higher in the wet season. Abundance was higher in forest patches and in the wet season. Attalea phalerata stems contain a rich seed bank, comparable to soil seed banks of tropical forests. As most of these seeds are not adapted to grow in flooding conditions, palm stems might be regarded as safe sites for seeds (and seedlings) to escape from the seasonal flooding of the Pantanal.

Current status and management options for invasive plants at the Mihintale Wildlife Sanctuary	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA												The present study describes the current spread of plant invaders and management efforts at Mihintale, Sri Lanka's first recorded Wildlife Sanctuary. Among the five land use zones identified, roadside (RS), village (VA) and reservoir associated (RA) zones were subjected to a detailed analysis of diversity and abundance of Invasive Alien Plants (TAP) using stratified random sampling plots of 20 m x 20 m (n=09). Encroachment of TAP into the forested (FO) zone was studied using three 50 m transects established from edge to interior of the forest. The above ground diversity of TAP was assessed via Margalef's, Shannon-Weiner, Shannon evenness, abundance and important value indices. Aquatic IAP were also identified. Below ground diversity of IAP was estimated by enumerating soil seed banks via seedling establishment method. A questionnaire (n=60) was used to assertain the invasion history, awareness on IAP, their interference on human activities, uses and control measures adopted by the villagers. Nearly half of the IAP reported for Sri Lanka were present in the Mihintale Sanctuary. Richness of IAP was high in RA but the abundance was high at RS zone. Lantana camara and Chromolaena odorata had the highest spread, extending even >25 m into the forests. Salvinia was the most abundant aquatic IAP. Top soil layer contained the highest number of germinable IAP seeds. The villagers were well aware of the impacts of TAP and indicated their attempts and potential in TAP management. The study revealed that spread of IAP at the Mihintale Sanctuary currently lies at a manageable level. Better awareness among villagers on "do's and dont's with IAP" would assist in opening up more opportunities for community participation in effective IAP management.																	1391-4588					MAR	2012	40	1					67	76									WOS:000302263700007

Testing metapopulation dynamics using genetic, demographic and ecological data	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The metapopulation concept is a cornerstone in the recent history of ecology and evolution. However, determining whether a natural system fits a metapopulation model is a complex issue. Extinction-colonization dynamics are indeed often difficult to quantify because species detectability is not always 100%, resulting in an imperfect record of extinctions. Here, we explore whether combining population genetics with demographic and ecological surveys can yield more realistic estimates of metapopulation dynamics. We apply this approach to the freshwater snail Drepanotrema depressissimum in a fragmented landscape of tropical ponds. In addition to studying correlations between genetic diversity and demographical or ecological characteristics, we undertake, for the first time, a detailed search for genetic signatures of extinctionrecolonization events using temporal changes in allele frequencies within sites. Surprisingly, genetic data indicate that extinction is much rarer than suggested by demographic surveys. Consequently, this system is better described as a set of populations with different sizes and immigration rates than as a true metapopulation. We identify several cases of apparent extinction owing to nondetection of low-density populations, and of aestivating individuals in desiccated ponds. More generally, we observed a frequent mismatch between genetic and demographical/ecological information at small spatial and temporal scales. We discuss the causes of these discrepancies and show how these two types of data provide complementary information on population dynamics and history, especially when temporal genetic samples are available.

Smoke and heat: influence on seedling emergence from the germinable soil seed bank of mesic grassland in South Africa	PLANT GROWTH REGULATION												We examined if germination and seedling emergence of species from the soil seed bank of mesic grassland in South Africa differed in their response to smoke or heat treatments alone or combined. Soil seed bank samples taken from 0 to 5 cm depth of the topsoil were treated with smoke-water solution, heat and heat + smoke-water combined and subsequent emergence of seedlings monitored over 90 days. In total, 790 individuals from 11 different plant families representing 37 graminoid (Poaceae) and non-graminoid species of flowering plants were identified. The most abundant plant families that emerged were Poaceae followed by Asteraceae. Grasses contributed 18% of the germinable seed bank, while non-grass (forbs and trees) species contributed > 80%. The most abundant grass species that emerged was Themeda triandra and the most common forb species was Centella asiatica. Compared to the control, smoke-water (SW) and/or smoke-water + heat (H + SW) treatment resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in mean number of seedling emergence. SW and H + SW treatment of soil seed bank also resulted in fourfold to fivefold greater biomass production. These results suggest that emergence of some smoke-responsive perennial grasses (e.g. Themeda triandra) from the soil seed bank can be enhanced using smoke techniques. Moreover, plant-derived smoke could potentially have a significant role in the restoration of degraded grasslands in South Africa and elsewhere.

J	Middleton, BA; McKee, KL				Middleton, Beth A.; McKee, Karen L.			Can elevated CO2 modify regeneration from seed banks of floating freshwater marshes subjected to rising sea-level?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Higher atmospheric concentrations of CO2 can offset the negative effects of flooding or salinity on plant species, but previous studies have focused on mature, rather than regenerating vegetation. This study examined how interacting environments of CO2, water regime, and salinity affect seed germination and seedling biomass of floating freshwater marshes in the Mississippi River Delta, which are dominated by C-3 grasses, sedges, and forbs. Germination density and seedling growth of the dominant species depended on multifactor interactions of CO2 (385 and 720 mu l l(-1)) with flooding (drained, +8-cm depth, +8-cm depth-gradual) and salinity (0, 6% seawater) levels. Of the three factors tested, salinity was the most important determinant of seedling response patterns. Species richness (total = 19) was insensitive to CO2. Our findings suggest that for freshwater marsh communities, seedling response to CO2 is species-specific and secondary to salinity and flooding effects. Elevated CO2 did not ameliorate flooding or salinity stress. Consequently, climate-related changes in sea level or human-caused alterations in hydrology may override atmospheric CO2 concentrations in driving shifts in this plant community. The results of this study suggest caution in making extrapolations from species-specific responses to community-level predictions without detailed attention to the nuances of multifactor responses.

Stability of weed suppression over years and main crops of potato, maize and soybean	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Interseeding cover crops is an alternative to laborious intertillages and hand weeding followed in organic farming. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilization and interseeding cover crops on the growth of main crops and weeds and the stability of weed suppression over years and main crop species under four-year rotational organic farming. Two cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), were interseeded in furrows of potato (Solarium tuberosum L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) at 3-5 weeks after planting the main crops. The number and dry weight of weeds were measured at the maximum plant height stage of main crops and main crop yields were recorded at their physiological maturity. The light competition between main crops, cover crops and weeds was analyzed by vertical community structure and vegetation cover ratio (VCR) of each crop. Since light competition of main crops with cover crops and weeds was not severe, main crop yields were not suppressed significantly by either cover crops or weeds. Weed growth was suppressed significantly by interseeding cover crops through increasing the VCR of main crops plus cover crops. This weed suppression by interseeding cover crops was stable to the main crop species in rotational cropping systems and to the various environmental conditions, because the cover crops compensated the low VCR of main crops alone at early growth stage especially when main crop growth was depressed by unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, input of compost and fermented organic fertilizer had positive effects on the main crop yield and weed suppression. It is concluded, therefore, that weeds can be suppressed effectively and stably without yield reductions of main crops by interseeding cover crops with sufficient fertilization in organic farming systems.

J	Huehne, PS; Bhinija, K				Huehne, Pattana Srifah; Bhinija, Kisana			Application of cryoprotectants to improve low temperature storage survival of orchid seeds	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												To improve the longevity of orchid seeds during long-term frozen storage, five cryoprotectants: glucose, honey, meso-inositol, mannitol and skimmed milk were used to simply treat the seeds of twelve orchid species. The most effective cryoprotectant was 5% (w/v) meso-inositol, followed by 7.5% (w/v) mannitol and 7.5% (w/v) glucose. When the seeds of Dendrobium crystallinum Rchb.f., Dendrobium virgineum Rchb.f., and Vanda Miss Joaquim, were coated with meso-inositol and preserved at -70 degrees C for one year, the germination percentage of the coated seeds was 50.7, 31.5 and 8.6%, respectively. After further storage for two to five years, the germination percentage remained stable at averages of 34.5, 17.4 and 4.1%, respectively and there was no effect on seedling development. However, the seeds coated with meso-inositol lost viability after being kept at 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C for one and two years, respectively. Success in using meso-inositol as a non-toxic cryoprotectant to extend the orchid seed viability would help to advance the knowledge of orchid seed bank development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Meers, TL; Enright, NJ; Bell, TL; Kasel, S				Meers, Trevor L.; Enright, Neal J.; Bell, Tina L.; Kasel, Sabine			Deforestation strongly affects soil seed banks in eucalypt forests: Generalisations in functional traits and implications for restoration	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We examined the potential role of the soil seed bank in restoration of an open eucalypt forest community following land-use change involving clearing of native eucalypt forest for grazing and subsequent abandonment, and for establishment of Pinus radiata plantation. We used plant functional traits responsive to disturbance and other traits associated with the capacity to re-colonise and form persistent seed banks as a means of assessing the effects of land-use change on soil seed banks. The soil seed bank and corresponding extant vegetation was surveyed within four replicated paired sites of fragmented native forest and abandoned farmland, and native forest and pine plantation. There was a significant difference in the composition of the soil seed bank for both land-use changes. Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling of plant attributes showed a clear separation of samples according to land-use type and between seed bank and extant vegetation. Cluster analysis of plant functional traits produced eight emergent groups. Phanerophytes were classified as either Ant-dispersed shrubs and herbs, Ericoid heaths or Eucalypts, perennial herbs were either Vertebrate-dispersed species, Barochorous annuals and herbs or Small-seeded hemicryptophytes and the remaining species were Wind-dispersed species or Small-seeded annuals. Small-seeded annuals dominated the soil seed banks and native phanerophytes with low specific leaf area, resprouting, ant-dispersal, large seed, and ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associations formed a minor component of the soil seed bank for all land-use types. Sorensen Similarity between the vegetation and soil seed bank was low across all land-use types and was explained by the dominance of annuals in the soil seed bank and perennial species in the extant vegetation. Indicator species analysis revealed an increase in Wind-dispersed species, Barochorous species and Small-seeded annuals in the soil seed bank relative to extant vegetation. Trait associations include a therophyte life form (of predominantly introduced species) with high specific leaf area, small round seed, a seeder fire response, and arbuscular or non-mycorrhizal associations. Underlying axes in trait variation indicate seed banks were dominated by traits associated with the rapid acquisition of resources or the ability to respond rapidly to disturbance that provided for large and persistent stores of introduced ruderal species. In contrast, species excluded from the seed bank shared traits associated with the conservation of resources or ability to withstand environmental stress and were typical of native phanerophytes. These generalisable patterns in plant traits make it unlikely that eucalypt communities can be restored from the native soil seed bank alone. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Maccherini, S; Santi, E				Maccherini, Simona; Santi, Elisa			Long-term experimental restoration in a calcareous grassland: Identifying the most effective restoration strategies	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Calcareous grasslands are among the most diverse habitats, supporting species-rich vegetation. Propagule limitation and availability of microsites for germination represent major constraints to the successful restoration of these grasslands. To date, little information is available on the effectiveness of seed addition and soil disturbance on the restoration success of encroached semi-natural calcareous grasslands. Here, we conducted a 1 year before - 9 year after control-impact (BACI) study aimed at testing the effect of the addition of seeds of native species and livestock grazing on calcareous grasslands. Each restoration measure and their combination differed in their impact on these communities and varied over time. Grazing had a significant, beneficial, impact on these communities, although the impact was species-specific. On average, grazed plots were characterized by a higher number of species and a lower vegetation cover. Nine years after treatment application, grazed site were dominated by Trifolium incarnatum subsp. molinerii, Xeranthemum cylindraceum, Orlaya grandiflora, Teucrium chamaechys and Bromus erectus while ungrazed sites were dominated by B. erectus, X. cylindraceum, O. grandiflora and Prunus spinosa. Only 8 out of 34 species responded significantly to disturbance or/and disturbance and seed addition while 22 species were significantly affected by the sampling year and 18 by a blocking factor. The low recruitment from added seeds and the fact that seed addition is a time-and labor-consuming activity suggests that an adequate level of disturbance and natural regeneration represent the most cost-effective approach to the restoration of these calcareous grasslands.

J	Ooi, MKJ				Ooi, Mark K. J.			Seed bank persistence and climate change	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The strong mechanistic relationship between climatic factors and seed dormancy and germination suggests that forecast climatic changes will significantly affect seed bank persistence. This review focuses on the potential impact of changing temperature, rainfall and fire regimes on the longevity of long-term persistent seed-banks. Currently, there are few studies investigating the mechanistic responses of demographic processes, such as seed-bank dynamics, to forecast climate change. However, from the work that has been published, several key points have been highlighted. First, increased air temperatures will produce significantly higher soil temperatures in open and sparsely vegetated habitats. Some evidence shows that this could accelerate the decline of seed viability and compromise bet-hedging strategies of species in dryland regions. Second, changes to rainfall season may determine the relative success of recruitment, with lower levels of success producing net losses to seed bank longevity. Finally, higher temperatures are likely to produce increased fire frequency, compromising the persistence of plant populations dependent on long-lived seed banks. Improving our understanding of both the mechanistic response and adaptive capacity of seed banks to climate change will provide a solid basis for improved predictions of future species distributions and risk of extinction, particularly in ecosystems subjected to temporally stochastic disturbances. It is necessary to develop functional groups based on key life-history trait responses to changing environmental conditions, to enable broader-scale predictions of distribution and persistence in the future.

Post-biological control invasion trajectory for Melaleuca quinquenervia in a seasonally inundated wetland	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The recruitment and mortality of Melaleuca quinquenervia seedlings were evaluated over a 3-year period in a seasonally inundated wetland in the western Everglades region. The mean (+/- SE) density of seedlings/saplings m (1) declined from 64.8 (+/- 4.5) to 0.5 (+/- 0.2) over the 3 years, a population reduction of 99.2%. Four distinct water regimes characterized this site: dry, dry to wet transition, flooded, and wet to dry transition. Seedling recruitment was highest in the dry to wet transition and lowest in the flooded water regime, while mortality was highest under flooded and dry water regimes. The mean estimate of population growth (lambda) across water regimes was 0.64 +/- 0.05 indicating negative population growth. Elimination of introduced insect herbivores using insecticides did not reduce mortality of recruited M. quinquenervia seedlings/saplings indicating that direct herbivory was not responsible for the decline in seedling density. On the other hand, a mean of only 0.2 (+/- 0.03) viable seeds m (2) d (1) fell into the plots, an amount considerably lower than in previous studies. We submit that change in the invasion trajectory M. quinquenervia was most likely caused by reduced seed inputs from aerial seed banks depleted by insect herbivory rather than direct herbivory on seedlings. This may indicate a fundamental alteration of M. quinquenervia population dynamics ultimately resulting in a less invasive and, therefore, less ecologically damaging species.

The results showed that the seed banks at different growing locations in the communities increased in the order of upper slope, middle slope, and lower slope; the seed storages of the seed banks in the different layers of the communities varied, much more higher in the litter layers than in 015?cm, and the seed storages of the seed banks in the seven types of forest communities ranked in the increasing order of Pinus tabulaeformis forest, Pinus shenkaneusis forest, Quercus liaotungensis forest, Populus davidiana forest, Betula platyphylla forest, scrub communities, and grassland communities; in the meantime, the seed storage of seed banks peaked in 3050 years old P. shenkaneusis forest, 3040 years old P. tabulaeformis forest, 1530 years old Q. liaotungensis, and P. davidiana and B. platyphylla forests, and 1015 years old scrub and grassland communities, and the ages of the communities varied with the seed storages of the seed banks in a significantly correlative manner following a fitted exponential equation. In addition, the soil seed banks of the seven types of communities consisted of rich and diverse species with the herbaceous and shrub species greatly outnumbering the arbor species; in general, the coniferous forests were composed of 31 kinds of plants, the deciduous and broadleaf forests consisted of 2029 plant species, the shrubs contained 27 plant species, and the herbaceous plants numbered 20 plant species; The various species compositions contained only 46 arbor species with most being foreign species. In each of the compositions, Bothriochloa ischemum was the grassland plant with the highest occurrence frequency, Sophora viciifolia and Hippophae reamnoides were the shrub plants with the highest occurrence frequencies, and Q. liaotungensis was the arbor plant with the highest occurrence frequency, and they followed by P. shenkaneusis and P. tabulaeformis. These results showed that soil seed banks and forest successions are better indicators for soil quality from natural successions.																	1863-0650					FEB	2012	40	2					140	147		10.1002/clen.201000377							WOS:000299467300005

Understanding of the processes building an extinction debt is fundamentally important for explaining present and future diversity patterns of species in fragmented landscapes. Few empirical studies, however, have examined the responses of different plant functional groups (PFGs) to historical landscape changes. We aimed to reveal PFG-based differences in species' persistence by focusing on their vegetative, reproductive, and dispersal traits. We examined whether the present distributions of PFGs of grassland species in the edges of remnant woodlands established on former semi-natural grasslands are related to the past surrounding landscapes at different time periods and spatial scales. The effects of past landscapes varied significantly among the PFGs. Richness of short, early flowering forbs and tall, late-flowering, wind-dispersed forbs showed significant positive relationships with the surrounding habitat proportions more than 50 years ago (the 1950s) and at wide spatial scales (more than 1 km(2)). Richness of tall, late-flowering forbs with unassisted and other types of dispersal mechanisms showed positive relationships with the surrounding habitat proportions in recent times (the 1970s) and at smaller spatial scales (0.25 km(2)). Our results suggested that plant growth form, flowering season and dispersal ability-with additional information on seed bank persistence-can be good indicators for identifying species' specific sensitivity to surrounding habitat loss. Trait-based approaches can be useful for understanding present and future distributions of grassland species with different persistence strategies in human-modified landscapes.

Seed germination cues and the importance of the soil seed bank across an environmental gradient in the Serengeti	OIKOS												Soil seed banks are an important source of new individuals for many plant populations and contribute to future genetic variability. In general, the size and persistence of soil seed banks is predicted to be greater where growth occurs in unpredictable pulses, where opportunities for disturbance-related recruitment are frequent and where the probability of recruitment failure is high. In savanna ecosystems, characterized by disturbance from fire and unpredictable water availability, soil seed banks should be relatively important sources of recruitment. However, the few studies conducted in savannas are inconclusive about the importance of soil seed banks and, more specifically, how seed banks should change across environmental gradients. We determined the number of viable seeds in the soil seed bank across savanna-grasslands in the Serengeti, an ecosystem characterized by frequent fire and seasonal drought. Soils were exposed to a combination of smoke and heat, cues which may be required to break seed dormancy in such ecosystems. Our a priori expectation was to observe large seed banks in regions characterized by seasonal drought and comparatively smaller seed banks in regions of higher moisture availability and high fire frequencies. In contrast to our hypothesis, seed germination increased strongly with precipitation and fire frequency. In addition, there was a significant interaction effect between fire and rainfall: low rainfall sites with frequent fire had greater seed germination than low rainfall sites with low fire frequency. Moreover, in laboratory experiments, heat had a negative, smoke a positive effect on final seed germination numbers. Together, these findings suggest that fire may be a key factor in driving herbaceous seed bank dynamics in tropical savannas.

J	Scott, AJ; Morgan, JW				Scott, Andrew J.; Morgan, John W.			Resilience, persistence and relationship to standing vegetation in soil seed banks of semi-arid Australian old fields	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Do soil seed banks of semi-arid grasslands reassemble after abandonment from cultivation? Do seeds of native and exotic species persist in the soil? Does time since abandonment affect compositional similarity between the vegetation and seed bank? Does the seed bank contribute to resilience in the vegetation? Location: Native grasslands in northern Victoria, Australia. Methods: Seed bank sampling was conducted in spring and autumn over 3 yrs, across a 100-yr chronosequence. Species richness, composition and germinant density were determined using the seedling emergence method. Seed persistence was assessed by comparing seed densities in spring and autumn. Seed bank composition was compared with the vegetation. Results: The spring seed bank was dominated at all stages by sedges and rushes; hence, native species richness and seed density were largely unaffected by abandonment. In autumn, grassland species contributed more to the seed bank, but richness was reduced after abandonment and showed little recovery, although seed density partially recovered. Seed bank composition showed some recovery in both seasons. Most species had low persistence in the soil. Compositional similarity between the vegetation and seed bank was greater in old fields than uncultivated grasslands in spring, but not autumn. Conclusions: Resilience varied among seed bank parameters and seed banks had low functional importance. Patterns in the seed bank followed, rather than caused, those in the vegetation. Thus, vegetation recovery cannot rely on the seed bank and persistent seeds were not the key mechanism of resilience in the vegetation.																	1402-2001					FEB	2012	15	1					48	61		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2011.01153.x							WOS:000299207600006						
J	Nicolai, N; Boeken, BR				Nicolai, Nancy; Boeken, Bertrand R.			Harvester ants modify seed rain using nest vegetation and granivory	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. In annual plant communities, the seed bank determines each generation's potential emergence and any factor that influences it could alter community structure. Harvester ants are common seed predators that may cause seed sources and seed rain composition to vary. 2. In semi-arid shrubland of the Negev desert of Israel, we hypothesised that the positive effects of dense vegetation on nests of the harvester ant Messor ebeninus Sant. would outweigh reduction by granivory. 3. To test whether nests were seed sources, we removed vegetation on 10 of 20 sampled nests prior to seeding. We tested the interaction between seed sources and granivory by locating seed traps at three locations: nests, foraging trails, and unvisited areas. Trapped seeds were recorded during spring and summer dispersal. Plant recruitment from the altered seed bank was recorded the following spring. 4. During April, seeds were more abundant near nests than the other locations and at uncut compared with cut nests. Foraging trails had fewer species and higher equitability compared with nests or unvisited areas. May and June to August had highest species richness at nests, but richness of cut and uncut nests were similar. Ordination of plant recruitment showed slightly lower vegetation community variation by diminished species in the cut seed bank. 5. While intact nest vegetation initially had high abundance of locally deposited seeds, it apparently blocked wind-dispersed seeds later in the summer. Conversely, granivory reduced seed species richness only on trails and decreased dominance structure by preferential removal of some species.																	0307-6946					FEB	2012	37	1					24	32		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01331.x							WOS:000299253000003

We analysed sediment seed banks and historical vegetation change data in Lake Dianchi, China, and aimed to develop a possible recovery trajectory of submerged vegetation. The results indicate that phosphorus concentrations have increased by 28 times in the lake since 1961 and macrophytes that used to grow at 5-6.5 m are now confined to water less than 3m deep. Many species had disappeared by 1978 and a former 17 species and 88% cover in 1961 was reduced to 9 species in three turbidity-tolerant communities with only 2% cover by 2010. The remaining seed bank was dominated by two species, still present in the lake and many former species, which had been very abundant, were not found as seeds. We suggest that macrophytes can be restored to areas shallower than 3m by using three turbidity-tolerant species, and that other formerly present species will need to be reintroduced when conditions have been further improved.

The investigated characteristics include plant composition structure, species diversity and community similarity in three kinds of Phragmites australis wetlands, i.e. restored P. australis wetlands (R1, R2, R3 and R4: restored in 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively), natural P. australis wetland (N) and degraded P. australis wetland (D) to assess the process of wetlands restoration. The coverage of the R1 was 99%, which was similar to natural wetland. Among all studied wetlands, the highest and lowest stem density was observed in R1 and R2, respectively, Plant height and stem diameter show the same trend as N > R2 > R1 > R3 > D > R4. Species diversity of restored P. australis wetlands became closed to natural wetland. Both species richness and Shannon-Wiener index had similar tendency: increased first and then decreased with restored time. The highest species richness and species diversity were observed in R2, while the lowest values of those parameters were found in natural P. australis wetland. Similarity indexes between restored wetlands and natural wetland increased with the restoration time, but they were still less than 50%. The results indicate that the vegetation of P. australis wetlands has experienced a great improvement after several years' restoration, and it is feasible to restored degraded P. australis wetlands by pouring fresh water into those wetlands in the Yellow River Delta. However, it is notable that costal degraded P. australis wetland in this region may take years to decades to reach the status of natural wetland.

Early evaluation of the physiological status of seeds is useful for selecting seed lots for conservation. To score seed quality, seeds from nine Cattleya species (Cattleya granulosa, Cattleya hegeriana, Cattleya intermedia, Cattleya mossiae, Cattleya purpurata, Cattleya sanguiloba, Cattleya tenuis, Cattleya tigrina and Cattleya walkeriana) were germinated on Knudson C medium and viability was measured using a tetrazolium (TZ) test following pre-conditioning in a 10% sucrose solution, both before and after storage at -18A degrees C for 3 mo. Tetrazolium test results were quantified using digital imaging of germinating seeds on a flatbed scanner. Seed viability (with or without pre-conditioning in sucrose), germination, Germination Velocity Index (GVI) and the correlation between viability measurements and germination were also evaluated. Both the tetrazolium test and the germination results showed that there was no loss of viability after storage, although in five seed lots, the GVI decreased. Pre-conditioning improved the correlation between viability exhibited in the tetrazolium test and seed germination. Image analysis proved to be a powerful tool for analysing these small seeds.

J	Toth, LA; van der Valk, A				Toth, Louis A.; van der Valk, Arnold			Predictability of flood pulse driven assembly rules for restoration of a floodplain plant community	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Community assembly rules were formulated to evaluate the restoration of wet prairie along the periphery of the floodplain of the Kissimmee River in central Florida. Restoration of this plant community is expected to be driven by the reestablishment of flood pulse hydrology following the ongoing dechannelization of the river. Assembly rules were assessed with plant species composition and cover data from 15 permanent plots on the restored floodplain and 6 control plots on the channelized floodplain. These sites were sampled biannually from 1998 to 2010. Mean annual hydroperiods and depths confirmed that the frequency, duration and amplitude of post-restoration flood pulses at study sites were similar to historic reference locations. Elimination of pasture grasses (primarily Paspalum notatum Flugge) following restoration of the flood pulse validated the hypothesized deletion rule for initial transformation of the wet prairie zone. Predicted increased dominance of obligate and facultative wetland species, a "community addition rule", also was confirmed. An index of weighted averages of wetland indicator taxa showed significant short-term responses to antecedent hydroperiods and depths, and a restoration trajectory for wetland plant species. As predicted, recruitment of wet prairie indicator species from the extant seed bank correlated with reestablishment of the flood pulse, but was greatest when inundation extended from the wet season into the dry season. Restoration of a wetland plant community did not result in the predicted increase in species richness and diversity. Colonization and expansion of the exotic grass, Hemarthria altissima (Poir.) Stapf & C. E. Hubb., disrupted community reassembly processes. By summer 2007, mean cover of this species and several other exotic grasses increased to 24%, and necessitated herbicide treatments. Assembly rules provided useful predictions for the initial restoration of wet prairie vegetation, but were eventually confounded by the spread of an exotic species that was new to the regional flora.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2012	20	1					59	75		10.1007/s11273-011-9241-3							WOS:000306130900005						
J	Penfield, S; Springthorpe, V				Penfield, Steven; Springthorpe, Victoria			Understanding chilling responses in Arabidopsis seeds and their contribution to life history	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Winter chilling is of central importance in the phenology of temperate annual and perennial plants. Chilling accelerates flowering through the process of vernalization and breaks both bud and seed dormancy, permitting the onset of growth in the spring. The quantitative effects of chilling in floral promotion in winter annual Arabidopsis accessions are well-documented, but very little is known about the basic physiology underlying summer annual responses to winter chilling, which acts on seeds within the soil seed bank. Here, we analyse the response of wild accessions to extended chilling in seeds, and explore the interaction between seed-maturation temperature and chilling responses. We show that two weeks of chilling induces secondary dormancy, and that this time period is not dependent on seed-maturation temperature. In addition, we found that seeds for most accessions set under simulated summer conditions in the laboratory are unable to overwinter in the soil seed bank, as they germinate without light during extended chilling treatments. This shows that these seeds are committed to re-establishment in the same growing season. Understanding how winter chilling affects the timing of Arabidopsis phenology will enable us to explore the genetics behind adaptation to changing climates, and inform rational approaches to breeding crops with improved performance under new climate scenarios and develop a systems ecology of Arabidopsis.

Based on the success of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, the Vero cell-based chemically inactivated EV71 vaccine candidate could be developed. Identification of EV71 vaccine strain which can grow to high titer in Vero cell and induce cross-genotype virus neutralizing antibody responses represents the first step in vaccine development. In this report we describe the characterization and validation of a clinical isolate E59 belonging to 84 sub-genotype based on VP1 genetic analysis. Before selected as the vaccine strain, the genetic stability of E59 in passage had been analyzed based on the nucleotide sequences obtained from the Master Virus Seed, Working Seed banks and the virus harvested from the production lots, and found to be identical to those found in the original isolate. These results indicate that E59 vaccine strain has strong genetic stability in passage. Using this vaccine strain the prototype EV71 vaccine candidate was produced from 20 L of Vero cell grown in serum-containing medium. The production processes were investigated, characterized and quantified to establish the potential vaccine manufacturing process including the time for virus harvest, the membrane for diafiltration and concentration, the gel-filtration chromatography for the down-stream virus purification, and the methods for viral inactivation. Finally, the inactivated virion vaccine candidate containing sub-microgram of viral proteins formulated with alum adjuvant was found to induce strong virus neutralizing antibody responses in mice and rabbits. Therefore, these results provide valuable information for cell-based EV71 vaccine development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mapping Genetic Diversity of Cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.): Application of Spatial Analysis for Conservation and Use of Plant Genetic Resources	PLOS ONE												There is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. Such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. For many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. Diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. This paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.), a Neotropical fruit tree species. We present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (SSRs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. We found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern Ecuador and northern Peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern Peru and especially in Bolivia were significantly lower. The application of GIS on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the Andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in Ecuador and Peru, respectively.

Methodologies for Strengthening Informal Indigenous Vegetable Seed Systems in Northern Thailand and Cambodia	I INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SUSTAINABLE VEGETABLE PRODUCTION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA	Acta Horticulturae				1st International Symposium on Sustainable Vegetable Production in Southeast Asia	MAR 14-17, 2011	Salatiga, INDONESIA	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)				Informal seed systems provide access to locally-adapted indigenous crops and constitute an essential component of sustainable production for resource-poor farmers in Southeast Asia. Research conducted with five ethno-linguistic groups in 12 villages in northern Thailand and Cambodia focuses on strengthening the indigenous informal vegetable seed system, including the conservation of knowledge surrounding that system. Through targeted village surveys and using photo card sorts to standardize responses across languages, our methodology documents and characterizes seed system species, pathways, and "germplasm gatekeepers" for indigenous annual and perennial vegetable crops important to northern Thailand hilltribe and Khmer communities. Additionally, farmer-innovated seed preservation and storage methodologies are documented, and farmer-saved seeds are tested using a village-based photovoltaic-powered growth chamber to determine baseline seed viability and vigor under local conditions. At the culmination of research in village clusters, seed and information exchange events occur that facilitate the inter-village exchange, preservation and dissemination of important genetic resources and best practices for seed saving and storage methodologies identified during the farmer community surveys. This research, which was completed in eight northern Thai villages and in four Cambodian villages, helped to build important linkages between under-represented Southeast Asia farmers of diverse ethnicities, a local innovative seed bank (ECHO Asia Impact Center), and a local university extension training system.																	0567-7572		978-90-66055-35-3				2012	958						67	74									WOS:000323599500006

Carduus nutans L. - nodding thistle	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS IN AUSTRALIA												Nodding thistle, Carduus nutans, native to Europe and North Africa, is a serious weed of pastures in the USA, Canada, New Zealand and Argentina. In Australia it was introduced relatively recently and is still more or less confined to parts of the tablelands of NSW, but with the potential to spread much more widely. With the benefit of considerable work already carried out for, or by, the USA, Canada and NZ, the Australian program concentrated on assessing the relative merits of the agents available, based on field studies in areas of the native range in southern Europe climatically similar to the target regions of Australia. Two populations of the receptacle weevil Rhinocyllus conicus from two such areas, plus a third population from NZ, originally from northern-central France, were released in Australia and their performances compared. The NZ population significantly outperformed the other two populations, though apparently climatically less well suited. The oviposition period of this weevil did not coincide with the main period of seed production of nodding thistle in Australia; to try to cover this period, the seed fly Urophora solstitialis was introduced and released. This was more effective, but still not effective enough to reduce seed production sufficiently. In addition, fly emergence was initially asynchronous with flowering and it was largely outcompeted by R. conicus early in the season, a result not expected from the native range studies. The rosette weevil Trichosirocalus horridus was introduced from NZ and released, with significant effects on rosette vigour and thus seed production. These three agents together reduced seed production by 81%; seed banks and rosette density subsequently declined. The success of this program was calculated to yield a benefit: cost ratio of 6.9.

Mimosa pigra L. - mimosa	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS IN AUSTRALIA												Mimosa pigra is a serious weed of agriculture and the environment in northern Australia, particularly the NT. It is a Weed of National Significance and is listed in the Global Invasive Species Database as one of the One Hundred of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species. It is a prickly, perennial, woody shrub which forms monocultures on floodplains and around wetlands. M. pigra has been the subject of a biological control program in Australia from 1979. Projects were also conducted in several south-east Asian countries. A large suite of agents were assessed but rejected for various reasons, and a total of 13 insects and two fungi were released in Australia to control M. pigra of which 10 insects and one fungus are known to have established. Two agents, Carmenta mimosa and Neurostrota gunniella, are currently inflicting severe damage, reducing both seed production and seed banks, and defoliating plants, which favours competing vegetation and leads to lower seedling survival and increasingly senescent stands. The impact of more recently released agents, particularly Malacorhinus irregularis and Macaria pallidata, appears to be substantial but has not been measured. Some agents were also released in Asia but their fate has barely been evaluated. The biological control program against this weed is characterised by the selection of challenging agents that might have been rejected for practical reasons in a less well-funded project. The experience gained in overcoming these challenges, for the flower-feeding agents and the green seed-feeders in particular, provides a model for the use of these types of agents in future programs. The M. pigra program also provides a leading example of how to measure the impact of biocontrol agents.

Ulex europaeus L. - gorse	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS IN AUSTRALIA												Gorse, Ulex europaeus, is one of the most invasive weeds in south-eastern Australia and is difficult to control by traditional methods. The annual cost of gorse management to agricultural industries alone has been estimated at $7 million. Biological control is being investigated as a cheaper and long-term control option to reduce the spread and impact of gorse, particularly in areas where it is widespread or inaccessible. Three foliage-feeding agents and a seed-feeder have now been released for its biological control in Australia. The gorse seed weevil Exapion ulicis, released in 1939, and the gorse spider mite Tetranychus lintearius, released in 1998, are now widespread across south-eastern Australia. The gorse thrips Sericothrips staphylinus, released in 2001, is now established and although initially slow to spread, populations have started to disperse exponentially in Tas. Establishment of the gorse soft shoot moth Agonopterix umbellana was confirmed in Tas in 2010 following its release in 2007. These four agents are expected to reduce plant vigour and seed output in the long term. Release of a second seed-feeding agent, the gorse pod moth Cydia succedana, will be dependent on the outcome of host-specificity tests. In combination with the gorse seed weevil, this species has the potential to reduce gorse seed banks below critical replacement levels in some areas. European surveys have found no new agents worth pursuing. Integrated control techniques offer the best prospects for long-term control in areas where gorse is actively managed, but the extent to which biological control will play a role will only be determined by future research once the complete guild of available agents is established.																			978-0-643-10420-4				2012							581	590									WOS:000321242400072

The bloom-forming cyanobacteria are capable of nuisance growth and produce toxins, resulting in serious threats to water safety and human health. This paper summarized physiological and ecological characteristics of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in their annual life cycle, internal regulation mechanisms and environmental factors for blooms formation. In winter, dormant period is regarded as the continuation of cyanobacteria populations, which conserve "seed bank" for the following year. In spring, recruitment can be defined as an inoculation of overwintering cyanobacteria to the pelagic phase after growth recovery under suitable conditions. Temperature, resuspension and bioturbation had been recognized to be the main driving factors for recruitment. Shortly after recruitment, cyanobacteria establish dominance by fast growth rate and colony enlargement strategy. Under suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions, cyanobacterial colonies aggregate and float up to form heavy blooms, which can lead to water supply crisis and ecological disaster. From late autumn, blooms disaggregate and decline. The sinking process is not only a periodic life cycle but also an irregular mechanical movement. Cyanobacteria accumulation areas in late autumn might highly related to the first occurence locality of blooms in the following year. This information could provide valuable information for the prediction and prevention of cyanobacterial blooms, so as to establish a more stable and healthy ecosystem in lakes.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-485-3				2012	209-211		1-3				1227	1230		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.209-211.1227							WOS:000319231000238

SHRUB SEED BANKS IN MIXED CONIFER FORESTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE ROLE OF FIRE IN REGULATING ABUNDANCE	FIRE ECOLOGY												Understory shrubs play important ecological roles in forests of the western US, but they can also impede early tree growth and lead to fire hazard concerns when very dense. Some of the more common genera (Ceanothus, Arctostaphylos, and Prunus) persist for long periods in the seed bank, even in areas where plants have been shaded out. To determine shrub seed density and investigate the feasibility of managing shrub abundance by regulating the size of the soil seed bank with fire, we sampled the seed bank in 24 mixed conifer forest stands throughout northern California. Twenty stands were unburned, two had recently burned in wildfires, and two (McCloud and Jennie Springs) were subjected to experimental prescribed fires with unburned controls. Seeds were extracted from duff and soil that was collected in six layers, to a depth of 10 cm in the mineral soil. Ceanothus seeds were the most abundant (mean = 246 seeds m(-2)), noted at all sites and at 88% of sampling locations within unburned sites. Arctostaphylos and Prunus seeds were less abundant (mean = 29 seeds m(-2) and 6 seeds m(-2), respectively), but still recorded at 64% and 45% of the unburned sites, respectively. The depth of seed burial varied at all unburned sites, but some seed was present even at the deepest (6 cm to 10 cm) soil layer, where seed mortality due to heat from burning is least likely. Seed density was substantially reduced, but not eliminated, by October prescribed burns at both McCloud and Jennie Springs, while seed density following July burns at Jennie Springs did not differ from the control. The abundance of buried seed indicates that restoring shrubs to forest understory should be possible even in areas where they are currently lacking. If preventing shrubs from colonizing a site is the management goal, the effectiveness of a single prescribed fire may be limited.																	1933-9747						2012	8	1					32	48		10.4996/fireecology.0801032							WOS:000319014200004

Focusing on the Mediterranean basin, we review the literature and propose conceptual models to explain the direct and indirect effects of fire on plant-pollinator interactions, seed dispersers, and predators, as well as the temporal changes in these systems along post-fire succession and ecosystem recovery processes. Post-fire plant communities change in their composition, structure, floral resources, as well as seed and fruit resources. Fire directly affects communities of pollinators, seed dispersers, and seed predators mainly by mortality, and indirectly through changes in the quality and quantity of food and nesting resources. Pollinators, seed-dispersers, and seed predators depend on plant community composition and on the flower, seed, and fruit resources they produce. As a consequence, their community composition, structure, and function are expected to vary in response to post-fire temporal and spatial changes in plant communities, which in turn depend on fire severity, frequency, scale, and the distance from fire-edge, as well as their foraging range. In return, the changes resulting from fire in pollinator, seed-disperser and seed predator communities may affect plant fecundity and plant community composition.

The study utilized Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired for scene 224/65 (path/row), for the following dates: 07/06/2000 (Geocover product), 08/02/2001, 08/29/2002, 07/04/2005 (Geocover product) and 08/08/2009. Deforestation data was obtained from the PRODES deforestation mapping program for the year 2001. The results showed a large and increasing area of forest regeneration within the area and period of study. The first year after deforestation showed the highest proportion of regeneration (20%), which can be attributed to the known pattern of less intensive land use in the initial years after vegetation removal, associated with stem regeneration and germination from the remaining seed banks. The proportion of regenerated area decreased over the years (through new deforestation of regenerating areas), but still occupied 13% of the area deforested in 2001 at the end of the eight-year period (2001-2009). Another important result showed that from the total area regenerated by 2009, 60% started the recovery process immediately after the 2001 deforestation event, and had no evidence of economic use during the studied period (i.e. no justification exists for the observed deforestation in the first place). These results emphasize the importance of better understanding and quantifying the role of biophysical and socio-economic factors in the dynamics of forest regeneration in the Amazon, and could help improve carbon emission and biodiversity studies in the region.

The role of the soil seed bank in the unpredictable habitat of Anthemis chrysantha J. Gay, a critically endangered species	FLORA												The ability of Anthemis chrysantha to form a soil seed bank (SB) was investigated in order to understand better the adaptation of this rare annual species to its arid and unpredictable natural habitat. The natural seed bank population was analyzed in five consecutive plant cohorts (2006-2010) by sampling at two different times: in May, after the germination period, and in October, after the first dispersal episodes due to the beginning winter rainfall. In addition, to determine the persistence in the soil of the two achene morphs of this species' (white and dark achenes), an artificial SB was created where achenes were buried and exhumed successively after each season, during two years. In all the cohorts studied, seedling emergence from May samples indicated the existence of a persistent seed bank (PSB). Moreover, the dark achenes were largely responsible for the permanent fraction because, after two years of burial in the artificial SB, 85.0% of them remained apparently healthy without having germinated, versus 9.9% of white achenes. Both types of buried achenes exhibited an annual conditional dormancy/non-dormancy cycle, induced by low winter temperatures. The PSB dynamics appeared to oscillate between the minimum values at the end of the germination period in spring (up to 2000 achenes per square meter) and the maximum values of the dispersal episodes in early autumn (up to 6000 achenes per square meter), with fluctuations of achene density due to the variability in annual rainfall. Hence, the SB showed a decline due to the failure of fruiting in the 2008 cohort, caused by drought, although the low value of ca. 560 achenes per square meter was able to establish the following population. Our study highlights the importance of the PSB, which, in "bad" years, may be critical for the persistence of this species. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Many others have much shorter storage potentials, which limits the usefulness of seed collections for germplasm conservation and breeding. Work at the NSW Seedbank is exploring the reproductive fitness, germination and storage potential of many taxa of conservation and economic importance, including members of the Proteaceae family such as the Waratah (Telopea speciosissima) which is cultivated for its cut-flowers. Telopea speciosissima seed has limited long-term storage capacity as there was a general trend towards loss of viability in accessions stored at 5 degrees C for 17 years or more. This paper presents an overview of this work with an emphasis on conservation and utilisation of genetic resources.																	0567-7572		978-90-66055-25-4				2012	937						801	810									WOS:000313517700098
