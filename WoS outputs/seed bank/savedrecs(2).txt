Early in 2003, it was recorded only once in the UAE, but presently it was found growing in different places in the country. It has been observed at two more locations in the UAE after a gap of 12 years from the first report. It is, however, possible that N. plumbaginifolia grows at other sites in the UAE, for which continuous surveys are underway. Based on its invasive nature and fast colonisation properties, there is a strong possibility that this species may naturalise and become a potential alien weed. The noticeable increase in the population size, since last few years warrants attention for its potential spread, as a weed, in farms and disturbed sites in the UAE.

A typology of seed banks	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												In recent decades, seed banks have spread out worldwide as essential institutions for biodiversity preservation, like new Noah's arks. However, little is known about the diversity of practices that are involved in them. The aim of this study is to reconstruct the dynamics of operation of the different seed banks, developing a typology of them worth providing. As sources for that aim, in-depth interviews to seed banks referents, documents and other materials related to seed banks have been used. First, we describe three stages which seed conservation has undergone until it became modern seed banks. The impact of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its debate context are considered. We analyze the knowledge involved in seed banks which turn them into more than just seeds reservoirs. Afterwards, we study how seed banks are used. From the functioning of seed banks and their objectives, we have identified three bank profiles: assistentialist, productivist and preservationist profiles. Finally, we analyze a series of cases that allow us to show the type of seed banks we have proposed. Policy implications are discussed.

Analysis of mating system and genetic structure in the endangered, amphicarpic plant, Lewton's polygala (Polygala lewtonii)	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Polygala lewtonii is a federally endangered, amphicarpic plant with a mixed mating system and three types of flowers: (1) aboveground, chasmogamous flowers (i.e., open-pollinated; CH), (2) aboveground, cleistogamous flowers (i.e., closed, selfing; CL) and (3) CL flowers on belowground stems (amphicarpy). Aboveground seeds are ant-dispersed, whereas belowground seeds are spaced across the length of the rhizome. Here, we collected individuals of P. lewtonii at both range-wide and fine geographic scales and genotyped them at 11 microsatellite loci. We analyzed patterns of genetic diversity and structure to understand: (1) the predominant mating system (selfing or outcrossing), (2) the movement of pollen and seeds across the landscape, and (3) the optimal strategy to conserve the full range of genetic variation. P. lewtonii reproduces predominantly by selfing or bi-parental inbreeding, but reproduction occurred through each of the three flower types. Some individuals produced by selfing/inbreeding were tightly clustered spatially, and were likely produced either by belowground flowers or by aboveground flowers with limited seed dispersal. Other selfed/inbred individuals were spatially separated (maximum of 15 m), and were likely produced by aboveground flowers followed by seed dispersal by ants. Fine-scale patterns of genetic structure indicate that some gene flow is occurring among aboveground CH flowers but both pollen and outcrossed seeds are moving limited distances (maximum of 0.5 km). Because genetic variation is structured at a fine spatial scale, protecting many populations is necessary to fully conserve the genetic variation in P. lewtonii. Conservation seed banking, if accompanied by research on seed germination requirements, may also contribute to the effective protection of genetic variation in P. lewtonii.

Here, we evaluated the FLORSYS model which quantifies the effects of cropping systems and pedoclimate on multispecific weed dynamics with a daily time step. We adapted existing validation methodologies and uncertainty analyses to account for multi-specific, multi-annual and diverse outputs, focusing on missing input data, incomplete and imprecise weed time series. Field data ranged from entirely monitored cropping system trials to annual snapshots recorded on farm fields by the French Biovigilance-Flore network. FLORSYS satisfactorily predicted weed seed bank, plant densities and crop yields, at daily and multi-annual scales, at well monitored sites. It overestimated plant biomass and underestimated total flora density. Missing processes (photoperiod dependency in flowering, crop:weed competition for nitrogen) and inadequately predicted scenarios (weed dynamics in untilled fields, floras with summer-emerging species) were identified. Guidelines for model use were proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet the recovery of AMF after severe anthropogenic disturbance such as cultivation has rarely been assessed. Here, to determine whether AMF root colonization recovers after such disturbance, we compared AMF root colonization in abandoned fields last cultivated 2, 35 and 150 years ago in the La Crau area (south-eastern France) with that of a grassland several thousands of years old (considered as the reference ecosystem). We measured AMF root colonization of four species (Carthamus lanatus, Carduus pycnocephalus, Brachypodium distachyon and Bromus madritensis) and performed surveys of plant communities and soil chemical properties. AMF root colonization was still significantly lower 35 years after disturbance for one species (B. distachyon) and two years after disturbance for one species (B. madritensis). The main soil chemical properties (soil pH, phosphorus and potassium content) were similar to the reference ecosystem 35 years after disturbance. Average vegetation height and cover recovered after 35 years whereas species richness recovered only on the field abandoned for 150 years. Vegetation composition and structure did not recover in any of the abandoned fields. Our results suggest that recovery of AMF root colonization is very low after a severe anthropogenic disturbance, despite the recovery of soil chemical properties.

J	Gupta, RK; Bali, K; Gani, M				Gupta, Rakesh K.; Bali, Kamlesh; Gani, Mudasir			Plant-herbivore asynchrony necessitates augmentative releases of the exotic beetle, Zygogramma bicolorata, to enhance the biological control of Parthenium hysterophorus	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Systematic information on the quantitative impact of Zygogramma bicolorata on the biology of Parthenium hysterophorus is crucial as the seeds of this weed continue to germinate from the accumulated soil seed bank throughout the year in the form of different germinating flushes, while the activity of the beetle ceases during winter as it enters diapause. Therefore, plant-herbivore interactions need to be explored to develop predictions of the overall impact of the introduced beetle on the weed. The findings revealed that defoliation by Z. bicolorata had a significant impact on the plant height, density and flower production in flushes F-3, F-4 and F-5, but not in F-1 and F-2 that exhibited longer periodicity, profuse branching, a longer flowering period and maximum flower production and contributed mostly to the existing seed soil bank. Therefore, total depletion of the existing soil seed bank was not possible. Consequently, the effect of augmentative field releases of laboratory-reared beetles was explored on F1 and F2 in February for three consecutive years (2011-2013). Before initiating the trial, random soil samples were taken from the plots that were assigned to the paired treatments (i.e. with the beetle and without the beetle [insecticide-treated]) and it was found that the seed bank in those samples did not differ. The single release of Z. bicolorata adults at five per plant at the six-leaf stage significantly reduced the soil seed bank, compared to without the biocontrol agent, irrespective of the flushes at the end of the season.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				DEC	2016	16	4					157	168		10.1111/wbm.12106							WOS:000393324600002						
J	Gallegos, SC; Beck, SG; Hensen, I; Saavedra, F; Lippok, D; Schleuning, M				Gallegos, Silvia C.; Beck, Stephan G.; Hensen, Isabell; Saavedra, Francisco; Lippok, Denis; Schleuning, Matthias			Factors limiting montane forest regeneration in bracken-dominated habitats in the tropics	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical montane forests are threatened by human-induced fires, resulting in forest patches surrounded by disturbed habitats frequently dominated by bracken fern (Pteridium spp.). In most disturbed habitats, natural forest regeneration is principally hindered by (i) seed limitation, due to a lack of seed dispersal, and (ii) establishment limitation, due to harsh abiotic conditions or competition with grasses and weeds. To our knowledge, the combined effect of seed limitation and establishment limitation on the entire regenerating plant community has never been tested in tropical bracken-dominated habitats. We experimentally assessed the effect of bracken fronds on natural seedling establishment in different distances from a tropical montane forest of the Bolivian Andes. At ten sites, we placed 240 m-long transects ranging from the forest interior to the disturbed habitat and installed paired plots at seven distances along each transect. In one plot of each pair, we applied a repeated vegetation removal treatment to assess the effect of bracken fronds on seedling establishment. We analysed the effect of bracken removal on seedling richness, seedling survival and growth of tree and non-tree species. We additionally compared patterns in seedling density and richness from the forest interior towards the disturbed habitat with patterns in seed density and richness in the seed rain and the soil seed bank. Species richness was higher in the forest than in the disturbed habitat. Tree species corresponded to approx. 25% of the species pool in the disturbed habitat and were only present at low densities. Density and species richness of seeds and tree seedlings consistently decreased from the forest edge towards the disturbed habitat, suggesting seed limitation. Seedlings of tree species had high survival probabilities in the disturbed habitat, especially under bracken fronds, suggesting a lack of establishment limitation. Bracken removal in the disturbed habitat did not affect species richness, but significantly reduced. seedling survival and growth of tree and non-tree species. Our results suggest that low seed dispersal hinders natural regeneration of bracken-dominated habitats in the tropics and that bracken fronds do not impede seedling establishment. Seed addition of tree species into the bracken vegetation may therefore be a promising strategy to accelerate forest regeneration, but long-term studies and multispecies experiments are needed for assessing the success of this restoration strategy.

J	Kennedy, AC				Kennedy, Ann C.			Pseudomonas fluorescens strains selectively suppress annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L., ABG) is a cool-season annual grass that is a major weed species in turf, turfgrass-seed and sod production, and golf courses of the western United States. The life cycles of ABG and TG are very similar, but ABG is typically more competitive. Because these plants are so similar, selective control using conventional methods is limited. Pseudomonas fluorescens biovar B strain XJ3, biovar B strain XS18, and biovar A strain LRS12 are naturally-occurring soil bacteria that suppress ABG growth. These bacterial strains do not inhibit the growth of desirable turf species, other crops, or native plants. When applied to the soil and/or seeds in the fall, the bacteria establish in the soil community and increase in numbers during the cool temperatures of fall and spring, coinciding with the early root growth of ABG. These bacteria grow along roots and deliver a compound that inhibits root formation, root growth, and tiller initiation of ABG. The bacteria can also be used in combination with herbicides to inhibit the growth and seed production of standing ABG. Bacteria that selectively suppress ABG can be used to reduce the weed-seed bank in golf courses, lawns, turf, and turf-seed production. These bacteria add a formidable tool in the toolbox to fight invasive grass weeds, while limiting the need for tillage and herbicides for weed control.

Reliable Method for Assessing Seed Germination, Dormancy, and Mortality under Field Conditions	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												We describe techniques for approximating seed bank dynamics over time using Helianthus annuus as an example study species. Strips of permeable polyester fabric and glue can be folded and glued to construct a strip of compartments that house seeds and identifying information, while allowing contact with soil leachate, water, microorganisms, and ambient temperature. Strips may be constructed with a wide range of compartment numbers and sizes and allow the researcher to house a variety of genotypes within a single species, different species, or seeds that have experienced different treatments. As opposed to individual seed packets, strips are more easily retrieved as a unit. While replicate packets can be included within a strip, different strips can act as blocks or can be retrieved at different times for observation of seed behavior over time. We used a high temperature glue gun to delineate compartments and sealed the strips once the seed and tags identifying block and removal times were inserted. The seed strips were then buried in the field at the desired depth, with the location marked for later removal. Burrowing animal predators were effectively excluded by use of a covering of metal mesh hardware cloth on the soil surface. After the selected time interval for burial, strips were dug up and seeds were assessed for germination, dormancy and mortality. While clearly dead seeds can often be distinguished from ungerminated living ones by eye, dormant seeds were conclusively identified using a standard Tetrazolium chloride colorimetric test for seed viability.																	1940-087X					NOV	2016		117							e54663	10.3791/54663							WOS:000397845800038	27842344

Ecological impacts of non-native tree species plantations are broad and heterogeneous: a review of Brazilian research	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Non-native tree plantations represent 7% of the world's forests and 1.24% of the Brazilian vegetation. Planted areas are expected to increase in the near future; thus, it is important to systematize existing knowledge on the ecological effects of plantations to aid forest management and biodiversity conservation. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the ecological literature associated with planted Pinus and Eucalyptus species in Brazil. We compared publication metrics with geographical distribution of species, ecosystems, biomes, studied taxa, and ecological impacts. We found 152 publications from 1992 to 2012. Number of publications positively correlated with area planted, number of plantations with forest certification, number of researchers, and richness of studied kingdoms. Most studies were in terrestrial ecosystems (92.1%), the Atlantic Forest biome (55.3%), and the kingdom Animalia (68.2%). Most impacts of non-native tree plantations were negative (55.9%), followed by positive (27%), and mixed (17.1%). Negative impacts were declines in species richness and abundance, seed bank diversity, and natural regeneration. Positive impacts were increase or mainteinance of seed bank diversity and natural regeneration. Mixed impacts were increases in abundance of native tree plantation pests. Taken together, results suggest forest management can help maintain biodiversity if it considers previous environmental conditions and integrates plantations with surrounding habitats.

J	Ren, L; Bai, YG				Ren, Lei; Bai, Yuguang			Smoke and Ash Effects on Seedling Emergence from Germinable Soil Seed Bank in Fescue Prairie	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Seedling recruitment plays a crucial role in recovering plant communities after disturbance. As a natural disturbance, fire canmediate species composition in fescue prairie. However, little was known about the effects of important fire cues on seedling recruitment in fescue prairie. Soil seed bank samples were taken from the top 5 cm of the soil profile and separated into litter, 0-to 1-cm, and 1-to 5-cm layers. Seedlings emerging from soil seed banks incubated in the greenhouse were examined after applying smoke, ash, and smoke plus ash in 2013 and 2014, to assess their effects on the density, richness, and composition of seedlings emerging from the soil seed bank in fescue prairie. Smoke plus ash significantly increased the number of Artemisia ludoviciana Nutt. seedlings emerging from 0- to 1-cm soil layer and Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist seedlings emerging from the litter layer (P < 0.05), while ash significantly increased the number of Artemisia frigida Willd. seedlings emerging from 0- to 1-cm soil layer (P < 0.05). Densities of total seedlings emerging from the 0- to 1-cm soil layer were increased by smoke plus ash in 2013 and by ash in 2014 (P < 0.05). Smoke plus ash and ash alone had more prominent effects on seedling density and richness of native forbs. Species composition was altered by ash in the 0- to 1-cm, 0- to 5-cm, and all layers combined in 2013 (P < 0.05). Direct fire cues appear to stimulate recruitment of some species, especially native forbs, contributing to potential changes in species composition of fescue prairie.

J	Catterall, CP				Catterall, Carla P.			Roles of non-native species in large-scale regeneration of moist tropical forests on anthropogenic grassland	BIOTROPICA												This paper presents a new synthesis of the role of native and non-native species in diverse pathways and processes that influence forest regeneration on anthropogenic grassland in the moist tropics. Because of altered species composition, abiotic conditions and landscape habitat mosaics, together with human interventions, these successional pathways differ from those seen in pre-clearing forests. However, representation of different functional life forms of plant (tree, vine, grass, herb and fern) and animal (frugivorous seed disperser, granivorous seed predator, seedling herbivore and carnivore) shows consistent global variation among areas of pasture, intact forest, and post-grassland regrowth. Biotic webs of interaction involve complex indirect influences and feedbacks, which can account for wide observed variation in regeneration trajectories over time. Important processes include: limitation of tree establishment by dense grasses; recruitment and growth of pioneer pasture trees (shading grasses and facilitating bird-assisted seed dispersal); and smothering of trees by vines. In these interactions, species' functional roles are more important than their biogeographic origins. Case studies in eastern Australia show native rain forest plant species diversity in all life forms increasing over time when pioneer trees are non-native (e.g., Cinnamomum camphora, Solanum mauritianum), concurrent with decreased grass and fern cover and increased abundance of trees and vine tangles. The global literature shows both native and non-native species facilitating and inhibiting regeneration. However conservation goals are often targeted at removing non-native species. Achieving large-scale tropical forest restoration will require increased recognition of their multiple roles, and compromises about allocating resources to their removal.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi negatively affect soil seed bank viability	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Seed banks represent a reservoir of propagules important for understanding plant population dynamics. Seed viability in soil depends on soil abiotic conditions, seed species, and soil biota. Compared to the vast amount of data on plant growth effects, next to nothing is known about how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could influence viability of seeds in the soil seed bank. To test whether AMF could influence seed bank viability, we conducted three two-factorial experiments using seeds of three herbaceous plant species (Taraxacum officinale, Dactylis glomerata, and Centaurea nigra) under mesocosm (experiments 1 and 2) and field conditions (experiment 3) and modifying the factor AMF presence (yes and no). To allow only hyphae to grow in and to prevent root penetration, paired root exclusion compartments (RECs) were used in experiments 2 and 3, which were either rotated (interrupted mycelium connection) or kept static (allows mycorrhizal connection). After harvesting, seed viability, soil water content, soil phosphorus availability, soil pH, and hyphal length in RECs were measured. In experiment 1, we used inoculation or not with the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis to establish the mycorrhizal treatment levels. A significant negative effect of mycorrhizal hyphae on viability of seeds was observed in experiments 1 and 3, and a similar trend in experiment 2. All three experiments showed that water content, soil pH, and AMF extraradical hyphal lengths were increased in the presence of AMF, but available P was decreased significantly. Viability of seeds in the soil seed bank correlated negatively with water content, soil pH, and AMF extraradical hyphal lengths and positively with soil P availability. Our results suggest that AMF can have a negative impact on soil seed viability, which is in contrast to the often-documented positive effects on plant growth. Such effects must now be included in our conceptual models of the AM symbiosis.

Brazil is considered the most important diversity center of the genus and is also the major producer of passion fruit. Besides the agronomical use, some of Passiflora species are widely cultivated due to the ornamental value of their flowers. In addition, different species are used in folk medicine, being considered as official drugs in Pharmacopeias of American and European countries. Conservation of Passiflora germplasm is usually carried out in seed banks or as live plants. However, seed renewal can be impaired by loss of germinative potential or specific seed characteristics. Therefore, complementary in vitro methodologies represent an important tool for ex situ conservation of Passiflora germplasm. In this work, we analyze the state of art of plant propagation and the use of in vitro conservation methodologies for Passiflora species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Vurro, M; Prandi, C; Baroccio, F				Vurro, Maurizio; Prandi, Cristina; Baroccio, Francesca			Strigolactones: how far is their commercial use for agricultural purposes?	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												Strigolactones are a class of natural and synthetic compounds that in the past decade have been exciting the scientific community not only for their intriguing biological properties but also for their potential applications in agriculture. These applications range from their use as hormones to modify and/or manage plant architecture, to their use as stimulants to induce seed germination of parasitic weeds and thus control their infestation by a reduced seed bank, to their use as biostimulants' of plant root colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, improving plant nutritional capabilities, to other still unknown effects on microbial soil communities. More recently, these compounds have also been attracting the interest of agrochemical companies. In spite of their biological attractiveness, practical applications are still greatly hampered by the low product yields obtainable by plant root exudates, by the costs of their synthesis, by the lack of knowledge of their off-target effects and by the not yet specified or properly identified legislation that could regulate the use of these compounds, depending on the agricultural purposes.

The parasite is a copious seed producer, and a huge seed bank develops soon after the onset of the initial infestation. To germinate, a Striga seed requires a pretreatment in a moist warm environment and a subsequent exposure to an exogenous stimulant. One approach to reduce the seed bank is artificially to induce germination of the seeds in the absence of or away from the host roots. A newly developed germination stimulant for S. hermonthica, designated as T-010, was evaluated for efficacy in greenhouse and field experiments under artificial Striga infestation. RESULTST-010 displayed germination-inducing activity in soil. Formulated T-010 applied at 0.1, 1 and 10 kg ai ha(-1) to potted soil containing S. hermonthica seeds, previously conditioned by judicious irrigation, reduced Striga emergence by 94-100%. Results of a field trial showed that formulated T-010, at the same rates as for the pot experiment, delayed and reduced Striga emergence by 33% and increased sorghum shoot and head dry weight by 18.7-40.2% and 187-241% respectively. CONCLUSIONThese findings demonstrated, for the first time, the technical feasibility of suicidal germination for controlling S. hermonthica. Optimising structure, formulation and application protocol of germination stimulants should be the main goal for further improvement of the technology.

Phthalimide-derived strigolactone mimics as germinating agents for seeds of parasitic weeds	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUNDBroomrapes attack important crops, cause severe yield losses and are difficult to eliminate because their seed bank is virtually indestructible. In the absence of a host, the induction of seed germination leads to inevitable death due to nutrient starvation. Synthetic analogues of germination-inducing factors may constitute a cheap and feasible strategy to control the seed bank. These compounds should be easy and cheap to synthesise, as this will allow their mass production. The aim of this work is to obtain new synthethic germinating agents. RESULTSNineteen N-substituted phthalimides containing a butenolide ring and different substituents in the aromatic ring were synthesised. The synthesis started with commercially available phthalimides. The complete collection was assayed against the parasitic weeds Orobanche minor, O. cumana, Phelipanche ramosa and P. aegyptiaca, with the synthetic strigolactone analogue GR24 used as a positive control. These compounds offered low EC50 values: O. cumana 38.3 M, O. minor 3.77 M, P. aegyptiaca 1.35 M and P. ramosa 1.49 M. CONCLUSIONSThe synthesis was carried out in a few steps and provided the target compounds in good yields. The compounds tested showed great selectivity, and low EC50 values were obtained for structures that were simpler than GR24.

J	Carta, A				Carta, Angelino			Seed regeneration in Mediterranean temporary ponds: germination ecophysiology and vegetation processes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Mediterranean temporary ponds (MTPs) are very specialised and threatened habitats found in Mediterranean-like bioclimates worldwide. MTPs have received considerable attention over the past years because of the multiple ecological roles they play in the landscape. Nevertheless, seed germination, dormancy, and desiccation tolerance of species living in MTPs are poorly investigated. Here, we reviewed these topics and found that seed germination data exist for only 48 species. While dormancy differs among the species, germination mostly depends on cool temperatures (< 15A degrees C) which are associated with the main rainfall season and on the light triggering germination in seeds located close to the soil surface and resulting in the persistence of buried seeds until disturbances occur. Most species seem amenable to seed banking as a means of ex situ conservation but a worldwide comparative study is required to better understand seed lifespan in MTPs. In general, these species exhibit a Mediterranean germination syndrome and plastic germination response that is typical of neither truly aquatic nor wetland plants. The importance of conducting ecologically meaningful germination studies, including germination experiments conducted in the field has been highlighted to gain further insights into the dynamic processes in the vegetation and to test for convergent evolution.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2016	782	1					23	35		10.1007/s10750-016-2808-5							WOS:000385175400003

Consequences of in-situ strategies for the conservation of plant genetic diversity	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Conservation biologists have drawn up a range of guidelines for the conservation of genetic diversity to maximise the chances that populations of threatened species persist, and to conserve this variation for its potential utility. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of conservation guidelines for maintaining genetic diversity in situ is limited. Furthermore, we lack information on how species-level variation in mating system affects these genetic conservation strategies. We used the British geographical ranges of eight widespread but declining plant species, varying in breeding system, as a model to assess the effectiveness of guidelines for the in-situ conservation of neutral genetic diversity. By applying simulated in-situ conservation scenarios to amplified fragment length polymorphism data, we show that the conservation of one population (the "minimum-set" approach) would retain similar to 70% of common allelic variation, but few or no rare alleles (alleles with frequency <= 0.05). Our results indicate that the conservation of >35% of populations would be needed to reach the Convention on Biological Diversity's recommendation to conserve 70% of genetic diversity in situ, as applied to rare alleles (similar to 10 populations within each species' British range). The capture of genetic variation in simulated conservation networks was insensitive to breeding system. However, a spatially stratified approach to population selection led to significantly greater capture rates for common alleles in two of our study species, relative to a spatially random strategy. Our study highlights the challenges of conserving genetic variation, and emphasises the vulnerability of genetic biodiversity to reductions in the extent of species' ranges. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In this study, five tillage systems viz. zero tillage (ZT), conventional tillage (CT), deep tillage (DT), bed sowing (60/30 cm with four rows; BS1) and bed sowing (90/45 cm with six rows; BS2) were evaluated in five different crop rotations viz. fallow-wheat (FW), rice-wheat (RW), cotton-wheat (CW), mungbean-wheat (MW) and sorghum-wheat (SW) for their effect on weed infestation and productivity of bread wheat. Interaction between different tillage practices and cropping systems had significant effect on density and dry biomass of total, broadleaved and grass weeds, agronomic and yield-related traits, and grain yield of bread wheat. The un-disturbed soils (ZT) under fallow-wheat or mungbean-wheat rotations favoured the weed prevalence (a total weed dry biomass of 72.4-109.6 and 105.6-112.1 g m(-2) in first and second year, respectively). Contrary to this, the disturbed soils (CT, DT, BSI and BS2) had less weed infestation with either of the rotations (a total weed biomass of 0.4-7.1 and 1.1-5.4 g m(-2) in first and second year, respectively). Sorghum-wheat rotation had strong suppressive effect on weed infestation in all tillage systems. The impact of crop rotation was more visible during second year of experimentation. Bed sown wheat (BS1 and BS2) in mungbean-wheat rotation had the highest wheat grain yield (6.30-6.47 t ha(-1)) compared to other tillage systems in different crop rotation combinations.

J	Wang, M; Wang, GD; Lu, XG; Jiang, M; Wang, SZ				Wang, Ming; Wang, Guo-dong; Lu, Xian-guo; Jiang, Ming; Wang, Sheng-zhong			Soil seed banks and their implications for wetland restoration along the Nongjiang River, Northeastern China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Soil seed banks provide seeds for the redevelopment of plant communities in wetlands. They can be important components of the ecological restoration of farmed wetlands, particularly if the seeds can survive periods of cultivation. We assessed if key structural dominant wetland plant species were present as seeds in farmed sedge meadows in northeastern China. We conducted a germination experiment in a greenhouse to compare the seed banks of four natural sedge meadows and four adjacent farmed fields along the Nongjiang River under drained and flooded conditions. We further conducted vegetation surveys in four natural sedge meadows. Sedges (Carex species) and the grass Calamagrostis angustifolia dominated plant communities in the natural sedge meadows. Many important sedge meadow species( > 30 species, e.g., Calamogrostis angustifolia and Potamogeton crispus) survived cultivation as seeds. Farmed fields converted from sedge meadows are nearly devoid of dominant Carex species, including two keystone tussock-forming species, Carex appendiculata and Carex meyeriana. Species of various life history types require either drawdown (emergent, e.g., Carex lasiocarpa and Calamogrostis angustifolia) or flooding (submerged, e.g., Potamogeton crispus and Ceratophyllum demersum) for successful germination. The structure of the seed bank was related to experimental water regime, and the field environments of latitude, number of years farmed, and field water depth based on Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling( NMDS) analysis. Our study indicated that, although certain critical components of the vegetation are not retained in seed banks, which made it difficult to replicate historic habitat via natural recolonization, the seed banks of farmed sedge meadows could still contribute toward the restoration of novel wetland vegetation assemblages under suitable environmental conditions. Carex reestablishment could rely upon artificial introduction if necessary. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study explored the relationship between standing vegetation and the soil seed bank representing four vegetation cover types on the shoreline of Lake Taihu (China) using a seed germination method. The vegetation cover types consisted of the fleabane lakeshore zone (Zone A), bush and grass lakeshore zone (Zone B), crop lakeshore zone (Zone C), and natural reed lakeshore zone (Zone D). The viability of the seeds of all species found during a survey of standing vegetation in the summer of 2010 was assessed using greenhouse germination trials. The fleabane, bush and grass, crop, and natural reed lakeshore zones had 4, 16, 8, and 6 species from the seed bank, respectively. Sorensen similarity coefficients resulting from comparisons of the species found in the seed bank and in the standing vegetation of those same four habitats were 0.250, 0.333, 0.143, and 0.154, respectively. Low similarity levels between standing vegetation and the seed banks indicate that we should increase work on wetland protection and management because of its potentially low recovery ability. Seed density was significantly lower in Zone B (4933 +/- 1683 number/m(2)) than in the other zones (Zone A: 1160 +/- 502 number/m(2); Zone C: 1360 +/- 587 number/m(2); and Zone D: 1200 +/- 961 number/m(2). The vertical distribution of seeds in the seed bank at the four zones showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing soil depth. The reserves of seeds in the topsoil seed bank accounted for 64.10%, 60.00%, 56.86%, and 68.89% of the entire seed bank in Zones A, B, C, and D, respectively. This research can promote to instruct and inform management practices in wetland protection, wetland management, and restoration and reconstruction in damaged wetlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kunz, SH; Martins, SV				Kunz, Sustanis Horn; Martins, Sebastiao Venancio			SOIL SEED BANK IN SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST AND ABANDONED PASTURE	REVISTA ARVORE												The objective of this study was to characterize the seed bank in the soil of different successional stages of Seasonal Semideciduous Forest and abandoned pasture in order to understand the natural regeneration potential of these areas. At each successional stage, 30 samples of soil were collected in the rainy and dry seasons to evaluate the qualitative heterogeneity of the forest, at the regeneration stage (FEA) forest, intermediate regeneration stage forest (ISF) and pasture (PAS). The species were classified according to the life form, successional group and dispersion syndrome. The number of individuals germinated was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the ISF and in the rainy season (15,949 individuals). Richness was higher in the pasture area ( 79 species), with a significant difference only between the environments. Most species are herbaceous (49.5%), pioneers (76.5%) and zoocory was the main dispersion syndrome (49% of species). The results show that seed bank in the fragment of the regeneration advanced stage forest presents the highest resilience potential, since it is formed by different life forms and, mainly, by early and late secondary species.

FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Despite broad recognition that forest machinery access systems impact plant diversity, previous studies have largely focused on skid trails. As a consequence, how tractor trails (dead-end single-use trails) influence plant diversity is poorly understood. In particular, knowledge is lacking on whether fine-scale understory diversity is better indicated by tractor-trail disturbance or by the environment. We investigated the relative importance of tractor-trail disturbance conditions and soil characteristics, as well as their effects on ground floral diversity in four oak forest types (a high forest and three coppice with -standard forests) in the northern half of France. Subplots representing five types of disturbance conditions were placed on both recent (<12 years) and older (>= 12 years) tractor trails at two locations - (trail center and wheel track), and an off-trail control subplot was added. At each subplot, we measured soil moisture, penetration resistance (PR) and bulk density (BD), and the last two were used as proxies for soil compaction. We also recorded the abundance of all vascular plants below 2 m in height on each subplot. Plant diversity was calculated based on CSR plant strategy (C-competitors, S-stress tolerators and R-ruderals), seed bank persistence, and light and moisture preference. We found that compared to controls, PR and BD were significantly greater on both old and recent tractor trails; soil moisture was greater on recent tractor trails. Comparing models showed that tractor-trail disturbance mattered more than did the soil characteristics for the diversity of most ecological groups (except for woody species richness). Compared to controls, tractor trails favored the richness of the short-term seed bank, C-strategy, CSR-strategy, heliophilous and hygrophilous herbaceous species; and abundance of heliophilous, CSR strategy and hygrophilous herbaceous species. Furthermore, compared to controls, both richness and abundance of mesophilous herbaceous species strongly increased on recent tractor trails and strongly decreased on old tractor trails. Concerning effects of soil characteristics, only one non-negligible (positive) relationship was found: between BD and the richness of heliophilous woody species. Since plant diversity is affected by tractor trails, and since plant recovery is very slow on trails, long-term studies on their impact are needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in grass plant populations and temporal soil seed bank dynamics in a semi-arid African savanna: Implications for restoration	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The re-colonization or recovery of grass species after disappearance due to heavy grazing depends on the presence of persistent soil seed banks that might be accumulated over time from the aboveground vegetation. Moreover, successful plant recruitment is a function of seed production, seed germination and seedling survival, which can be mechanistically understood through studying the life cycle processes of grass species populations under field conditions. Therefore, we studied the number of germinable seeds, species richness and life-forms in the soil seed banks under light and heavy grazing conditions, and the changes in grass species populations in a semi-arid savanna of Ethiopia. Accordingly, a total of 103 species (15 perennial and 29 annual grasses, 6 legumes, 52 forbs and 1 woody species) emerged from the soil samples collected. Lightly grazed sites had a higher seed density compared with heavily grazed sites. The seed density increased over the first three months of soil sampling and decreased thereafter. Perennial grasses dominated the light grazing sites, whereas annual species dominated the heavily grazed sites, indicating that perennial grasses were replaced by annual species in the soil seed bank through grazing. The mean mortality rate from the seedling stage to adult plants was 65%. The seed-to-seedling stage was found to be the most critical transitional stage for grass survival. High seedling mortality in the aboveground vegetation and depletion of seeds in the soil seed banks as a result of sustained heavy grazing can lead to local extinction and disappearance of perennial grasses in semi-arid Ethiopian savannas.

J	Shahzad, M; Farooq, M; Hussain, M				Shahzad, Muhammad; Farooq, Muhammad; Hussain, Mubshar			Weed spectrum in different wheat-based cropping systems under conservation and conventional tillage practices in Punjab, Pakistan	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Excessive tillage in conventional agriculture has led to soil and environmental degradation. Conservation agriculture (CA) has evolved as an alternate and sustainable crop production system. However, weed control is a serious issue in CA; nonetheless, allelopathy offers a viable option for weed management. This study was conducted to evaluate the shift in weed spectra in different wheat-based cropping systems under different tillage practices in Punjab, Pakistan. Wheat was planted in fallow-wheat, rice-wheat, cotton-wheat, mungbean-wheat and sorghum-wheat cropping systems with zero tillage (ZT), conventional tillage (CT), deep tillage (DT) and CT with beds sowing (BS; 60/30 and 90/45). The most important weeds identified were fat hen, common goosefoot, horseweed, garden spurge, broad-leaved dock, yellow sweet clover, false daisy, salt marsh, rabbit foot grass, bermuda grass, red sprangletop, corn spurry and littleseed canarygrass. Maximum diversity of weeds (number of weed species) was recorded in cotton-wheat under ZT; whereas the sorghum-wheat system had minimum diversity of weeds under DT. Fallow-wheat and mungbean-wheat systems had more grassy and broad leaf weeds, respectively, while sorghum-wheat had less density of these weeds. Likewise, ZT had higher while DT and BS had less density of grassy and broad leaf weeds. However, CT favored some broad leaf weeds like fat hen and common goose foot; DT stimulated only common goose foot; whereas ZT supported some broad leaf and all grassy weeds. Sorghum-wheat system suppressed most of the weeds, grasses in particular, and three grassy weeds (salt marsh, bermuda grass and red sprangletop) were absent owing to its strong allelopathic potential; however, this system favored littleseed canarygrass under ZT. In conclusion, divergent wheat-based cropping systems had different weeds spectra under different tillage practices; and choice of cropping sequence may help suppressing weeds. Inclusion of allelopathic crops, like sorghum, in the wheat-based cropping system may help managing weeds under conventional and conservation tillage practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The role of environmental conditions on driving beetle outbreaks is becoming increasingly important as global climatic change alters environmental factors, such as drought stress, that, in turn, govern tree resistance. Furthermore, dynamics between beetles and trees are highly nonlinear, due to complex aggregation behaviors exhibited by beetles attacking trees. Models have a role to play in helping unravel the effects of variable tree resistance and beetle aggregation on bark beetle outbreaks. In this article we develop a new mathematical model for bark beetle outbreaks using an analogy with epidemiological models. Because the model operates on several distinct time scales, singular perturbation methods are used to simplify the model. The result is a dynamical system that tracks populations of uninfested and infested trees. A limiting case of the model is a discontinuous function of state variables, leading to solutions in the Filippov sense. The model assumes an extensive seed-bank so that tree recruitment is possible even if trees go extinct. Two scenarios are considered for immigration of new beetles. The first is a single tree stand with beetles immigrating from outside while the second considers two forest stands with beetle dispersal between them. For the seed-bank driven recruitment rate, when beetle immigration is low, the forest stand recovers to a beetle-free state. At high beetle immigration rates beetle populations approach an endemic equilibrium state. At intermediate immigration rates, the model predicts bistability as the forest can be in either of the two equilibrium states: a healthy forest, or a forest with an endemic beetle population. The model bistability leads to hysteresis. Interactions between two stands show how a less resistant stand of trees may provide an initial toe-hold for the invasion, which later leads to a regional beetle outbreak in the resistant stand.

Soil seed bank dynamics under the influence of grazing as alternative explanation for herbaceous vegetation transitions in semi-arid rangelands	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Ecological studies have frequently stressed that the availability of seeds in the soil is important for the recovery of semi-arid rangelands. However, the crucial role of soil seed banks has not been incorporated into rangeland models to understand vegetation states and transitions in semi-arid rangelands. We developed and evaluated a novel model to show that the availability of seeds in the soil seed banks as a function of plant cover can trigger transitions from perennial to annual grasses and from annual grasses to bare soil with increasing grazing pressure. The model indicates that when grazing pressure is low, a high cover of perennial grasses and a large soil seed bank of these grasses may be present, whereas annual grasses with their seeds in the soil appear with increasing grazing. When grazing pressure further increases, vegetation cover and the soil seed bank size decline. We found that the positive feedback between plant cover and the size of the soil seed bank depends on seed traits, i.e., longevity and germination rate. This positive feedback is an alternative explanation for a sudden vegetation changes in rangelands, which are often explained by the positive feedback between plant cover and the infiltration rate of rain into the soil. In contrast to this latter positive feedback, our model can explain shifts in vegetation from perennials to annuals and vice versa on different soil types, which are often seen in semi-arid rangelands. Our model contributes therefore to the understanding of vegetation dynamics for the proper management and possible restoration of degraded semi-arid rangelands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Tarping and Inundation as Potential Control Mechanisms for Seed Banks of Red Sesbania (Sesbania punicea)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The exotic shrub red sesbania is an increasingly problematic weed in riparian and wetland ecosystems of California. Current control methods focus on manual removal, followed by herbicide application. Although this method effectively removesmature stands, the control is temporary because the presence of a large seed bank results in rapid germination and growth of new seedlings. We measured the density of seed banks beneath stands of varying densities and evaluated the potential of tarping and inundation for control of red sesbania seed banks. As expected, the abundance of viable red sesbania seeds in the soil was significantly greater beneath high-density stands than it was beneath low-density stands. Results for inundation and tarping experiments weremixed. Sustained inundation significantly decreased survivorship of germinated seeds compared with the control, as well as causing a statistically significant reduction in germination. Seven months after tarping, during the fall/winter growing season, there was no significant effect on red sesbania seedling abundance, stump resprout abundance, or height. Germination in the laboratory was significantly reduced by extended exposure to temperatures of 60 C, although lower temperatures did not reduce germination. Red sesbania appears to be resilient to tarping as a control method, at least in the settings studied.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT-DEC	2016	9	4					261	271		10.1614/IPSM-D-16-00026.1							WOS:000395995000004

We studied the effects of simulated flooding on richness and abundance of, and temporal variation in, seedling recruitment from the soil seed bank of a floodable savanna of the Pantanal wetland, under two conditions: 1) Post-flood = inundated for 30 days followed by irrigation; 2) Non-flooded = only irrigated. We recorded emerged seedlings biweekly for 120 days and found a total of 124 species for the two treatments, the most abundant species were annual herbs (e.g., Richardia grandiflora and Euploca procumbens) and annual graminoids (e.g., Digitaria ciliaris and Cyperus haspan). Flooding positively influenced seedling richness and abundance, while seedling emergence from the non-flooded soil was slower, but continued during all periods. The different temporal patterns between treatments showed that flooding increases the abundance of emerged seedlings and acts as a trigger for explosive recruitment shortly after water depletion.

However, forests are not always certain to regenerate after a wildfire. Whether they do depends on many factors, some of which may be influenced by land management activities. Failure to regenerate will cause a regime shift in the ecosystem, reducing the provision of ecosystem services and ultimately leading to desertification. How can we increase the resilience of Mediterranean forests to fire? Our approach to answering this question was twofold: first, we reviewed the literature to investigate chains of processes that allowed forests to regenerate (which we label Regeneration Mechanisms, or RMs); and second, we assessed the impact of selected management practices documented in the WOCAT database on these RMs. For the assessment, we evaluated the relation between the benefits and disadvantages of the land management practices on the one hand, and the hindering and supporting factors of the RMs on the other. We identified three distinct RMs that enable Mediterranean forests to recover, as well as the time frame before and after a fire in which they are at work, and factors that can hinder or support resilience. The three RMs enabling a forest to regenerate after a fire consist of regeneration (1) from a seed bank; (2) from resprouting individuals; and (3) from unburned plants that escaped the fire. Management practices were grouped into four categories: (1) fuel breaks; (2) fuel management; (3) afforestation; and (4) mulching. We assessed how and under what conditions land management modifies the ecosystem's resilience. The results show that land management influences resilience by interacting with resilience mechanisms before and after the fire, and not just by modifying the fire regime. Our analysis demonstrates a need for adaptive-i.e., context-and time-specific-management strategies.

Questions: 1) What is the most effective method for determining the composition and structure of the soil seed bank of Andean forests? 2) What is the composition and structure of soil seed banks in old-growth forest and shrubland sites in the Andean montane tropical forest of Colombia? Study site: Andean forest, Pamplona, Norte de Santander, Colombia Methods: We surveyed the soil seed bank in two successional stages of Andean forest and examined its structure using two sampling methods: direct separation and germination. Results: Soil seed bank density was higher (18-fold in old-growth forest and 666-fold in shrubland) with the direct separation method than with germination; however, under the germination method, we found four species that we did not detect through the direct separation method. Soil seed banks from shrublands were mainly dominated by species from disturbed areas (91 %), while those from the old-growth forest presented early, intermediate and late species; e.g., Miconia summa, Myrsine dependens and Solanum sp., respectively. In the old-growth forest (especially for late species), density increased with depth. This pattern was not observed in shrubland. Seeds obtained by using the direct separation method presented low (< 7 %) viability. Conclusion: We consider the two methods to be complementary and recommend the use of both for a thorough characterization of soil seed banks from Andean forests. At different successional stages in the Colombian Andean forest, the soil seed bank may contain early, intermediate and late species, and it therefore plays an important role in the regeneration of this threatened ecosystem.

Climate change may increase the occurrence of droughts and fires in the Amazon. Most of our understanding on how fire affects tropical ecosystems is based on studies of non flooded forest-savanna ecotones. Nonetheless, tropical floodplain forests in the Amazon can burn severely during extreme droughts. The mechanisms slowing down forest regeneration in these ecosystems remain poorly understood and have never been assessed in the field. 2. We studied the recovery of Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests after one and two fire events. We used Landsat images to map fire history and conducted field surveys to measure forest structure, tree species richness, tree seed bank and post-lire invasion of herbaceous plants. 3. Sites burnt once had on average 0% trees, 6% tree seed abundance, 23% tree seed species richness and 8 10 root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. In contrast, herbaceous cover increased from 0 to 72%. Nonetheless, forest structure and diversity recovered slowly towards pre-burn levels, except for tree seed banks that remained depleted even 15 years after fire. 4. Sites burnt twice had on average 0% trees, 1% tree seed abundance, 3% tree seed species richness and 1% root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. Herbaceous cover increased to 100%. Mean recovery of tree basal area was 50% slower and of root mat thickness 93% slower compared to recovery in sites burnt once. Tree seed banks did not recover at all, and herbaceous cover persisted close to 100% for more than 20 years after the second fire. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that after a second fire event. Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests lose their recovery capacity, and persist in a non-forested state dominated by herbaceous vegetation. Such fragility, implies that preventing human ignited fires during drought episodes is a particularly, important conservation strategy for these ecosystems.

Warmer seed environments increase germination fractions in Australian winter annual plant species	ECOSPHERE												Climate can influence plant demographic processes and life stages in different ways, but such details are often ignored in analyses that focus on adult life stages and annual climate averages. In particular, the effects of climate on seeds may be hugely important under climate change. Climate is known to influence seed survival and germination, which in turn can strongly affect population persistence and community dynamics. We investigated climate and other environmental effects on seed viability and germination probabilities of six winter annual plant species persisting in small, isolated habitat fragments in the Mediterranean-climate region of southwestern Australia. Seeds were collected from southern (cool) and northern (warm) bushland remnants and factorially placed into each location to assess the effects of natural dormancy alleviation via after-ripening. Seeds were then exposed to cool and warm germination treatments (representing average germination conditions in the two remnants). For five of the six species, seeds from warm maternal populations had higher germination probabilities (or germinated more seeds sooner). Regardless of maternal population, germination probabilities were higher (or germination was more rapid) for seeds that were after-ripened in the warm remnant for almost all species. For all species, germination was higher (or more rapid) under the warmer germination temperatures. We also found strong microsite effects on seed viability for some species. In the absence of adaptation in dormancy regulation and germination physiology, our results indicate that most of the winter annual species studied will germinate higher fractions of seeds under future climate conditions due to the cumulative effects of warmer maternal, after-ripening, and germination environments. The fate of isolated populations under climate change may therefore depend strongly on postgermination survival and reproduction to prevent seed bank depletion.

Seed bank and big sagebrush plant community composition in a range margin for big sagebrush	ECOSPHERE												The potential influence of seed bank composition on range shifts of species due to climate change is unclear. Seed banks can provide a means of both species persistence in an area and local range expansion in the case of increasing habitat suitability, as may occur under future climate change. However, a mismatch between the seed bank and the established plant community may represent an obstacle to persistence and expansion. In big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) plant communities in Montana, USA, we compared the seed bank to the established plant community. There was less than a 20% similarity in the relative abundance of species between the established plant community and the seed bank. This difference was primarily driven by an overrepresentation of native annual forbs and an underrepresentation of big sagebrush in the seed bank compared to the established plant community. Even though we expect an increase in habitat suitability for big sagebrush under future climate conditions at our sites, the current mismatch between the plant community and the seed bank could impede big sagebrush range expansion into increasingly suitable habitat in the future.

Are some species at particular risk? Do the impacts of wildfires on seed banks differ between heathlands and blanket bog? LocationNorthern Ireland, United Kingdom. MethodsVegetation surveys and seed bank sampling were conducted in 2012 at burned and unburned areas within six upland sites where large wildfires had occurred during spring 2011. Differences in seedling abundance, species richness and Jaccard similarity indices between burned and unburned areas were compared using GLMMs. Differences in the community composition were examined using pRDA. ResultsIn total, 24 of the 51 species in the vegetation were detected in the germinable seed bank. Species richness and the abundance of seedlings other than Calluna vulgaris were lower in areas where wildfires had occurred. Species composition of both germinable seed banks and vegetation differed between burned and unburned areas within sites; with negative associations between burned areas and some key indicator species including Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum, Empetrum nigrum, Narthecium ossifragum and Trichophorum germanicum. We did not find any evidence of significant interactions between burning and habitat, suggesting that wildfires had similar impacts on each species regardless of the habitat in which they occurred. ConclusionsThis study differs from other UK studies in that it examines impacts of wildfires at sites that have not been previously intensively managed by burning. In particular, we highlight potential impacts on N.ossifragum and D.rotundifolia, which are key components of the upland flora and, to our knowledge, were not present in previous UK studies.

Removal and Burial of Weed Seeds by Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) From the Soil Surface of a Cropped Area in Western Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Although granivorous ants are known to collect weed seeds from cropping areas in Australia, the fate of these seeds has not been adequately investigated. Seeds of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.) and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) were placed around the nests of five native ant species (Iridomyrmex greensladei Shattuck, Rhytidoponera metallica Smith, Melophorus turneri Forel, Monomorium rothsteini Forel, and Pheidole hartmeyeri Forel) and tracked continuously over a 24-h period. Removal rates and seed preference of the ant species were evaluated. Ant nests were then excavated to determine the placement of seeds that were taken into each nest. Seed preference, seed removal efficiencies, activity, and seed storage all varied between the ant species. Annual ryegrass seed was collected by three species of ants and was removed from the soil surface more efficiently than wild radish seed. Most ant species stored seed below ground at a depth that is inhibitory to emergence, thereby potentially removing that portion of seed from the seed bank, but some seed was placed at germinable depths. Pheidole hartmeyeri was identified as a likely biological control agent for annual ryegrass seeds and wild radish, while Me. turneri and Mo. rothsteini have potential as biocontrol agents for annual ryegrass, but further research is needed.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2016	45	5					1199	1204		10.1093/ee/nvw093							WOS:000386053100013	27497115

In that system, the agronomic practices and chemical weed management, based on the use of aryloxyphenoxy-propionates herbicides (i.e., quizalofop ethyl ester), were optimized to obtain a dual seed-forage production. Five of seven populations tested were confirmed resistant to quizalofop ethyl ester with resistance indexes ranging from 4.5 to >209. Both target- and nontarget-site resistance mechanisms were most likely involved. Three allelic variants were detected (Ile-1781-Leu, Trp-2027-Cys, and Ile-2041-Asn) in four resistant populations, whereas no known mutations were found in one resistant population. The herbicide treatment on Italian ryegrass plants at different phenological stages suggested that to control regrowth, it is necessary to use two to fives times the herbicide dose suitable for younger plants. This situation is encountered in fields when Italian ryegrass plants need to be controlled to maximize the alfalfa seed production, and it is comparable to using a sublethal herbicide dose, leading to the selection of herbicide-resistant biotypes. In such a situation, the cropping system is not sustainable, and integrated weed management should be implemented to deplete the soil weed seed bank and prevent new weed seed production.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				OCT-DEC	2016	64	4					683	694		10.1614/WS-D-15-00193.1							WOS:000386055100015

T.; Pichancourt, Jean-Baptiste; Gosper, Carl R.; Sanders, Angela; Chades, Iadine			Fire management strategies to maintain species population processes in a fragmented landscape of fire-interval extremes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Changed fire regimes have led to declines of fire-regime-adapted species and loss of biodiversity globally. Fire affects population processes of growth, reproduction, and dispersal in different ways, but there is little guidance about the best fire regime(s) to maintain species population processes in fire-prone ecosystems. We use a process-based approach to determine the best range of fire intervals for keystone plant species in a highly modified Mediterranean ecosystem in southwestern Australia where current fire regimes vary. In highly fragmented areas, fires are few due to limited ignitions and active suppression of wildfire on private land, while in highly connected protected areas fires are frequent and extensive. Using matrix population models, we predict population growth of seven Banksia species under different environmental conditions and patch connectivity, and evaluate the sensitivity of species survival to different fire management strategies and burning intervals. We discover that contrasting, complementary patterns of species life-histories with time since fire result in no single best fire regime. All strategies result in the local patch extinction of at least one species. A small number of burning strategies secure complementary species sets depending on connectivity and post-fire growing conditions. A strategy of no fire always leads to fewer species persisting than prescribed fire or random wildfire, while too-frequent or too-rare burning regimes lead to the possible local extinction of all species. In low landscape connectivity, we find a smaller range of suitable fire intervals, and strategies of prescribed or random burning result in a lower number of species with positive growth rates after 100 years on average compared with burning high connectivity patches. Prescribed fire may reduce or increase extinction risk when applied in combination with wildfire depending on patch connectivity. Poor growing conditions result in a significantly reduced number of species exhibiting positive growth rates after 100 years of management. By exploring the consequences of managing fire, we are able to identify which species are likely to disappear under a given fire regime. Identifying the appropriate complementarity of fire intervals, and their species-specific as well as community-level consequences, is crucial to reduce local extinctions of species in fragmented fire-prone landscapes.

However, information about the extent to which mulching affects the recovery of native vegetation is inconclusive. The soil seed bank plays an important role in the resilience of frequently disturbed shrubland communities but little is known about how it is affected by mulching treatments. In this study, we assessed the effects of straw mulching (2.0 Mg ha(-1)) on the recovery of vegetation after a wildfire in Galicia (NW Spain). For this purpose, we carried out a greenhouse and field-based study to evaluate the effects of mulching applied immediately after fire on the soil seed bank and recovery of vegetation cover in a shrubland area during the first year after wildfire. In the greenhouse, there were no differences in the total number of seedlings that emerged from the soil seed bank of mulched and untreated samples (634 seedlings m(-2) vs 731 seedlings m(-2)). Species richness increased from 22 in untreated burned soils to 24 species in the mulched, burned soils. In the field, straw mulching favoured plant establishment and recovery of vegetation cover. At the end of the first post-fire year, plant cover was significantly higher (63%) in the mulching treatment compared to the untreated one (44%). Mulching did not affect species composition, and there was little evidence of the presence of non-native species. The results indicate that, in the present case, straw mulching immediately after the fire favoured recovery of plant cover in the first year after the fire by conserving the soil moisture.

In 2015, plant richness had increased even further (to 40 species). Some rare, oligotrophic species, which formerly were common in the historical lake, have re-established populations (e.g. Elatine hydropiper and Lythrum portula). However, a larger number of meso-and eutrophic species have colonized the re-established lake, changing the character of aquatic macrophyte flora as compared to the historical lake. The very rare Baldellia repens, considered extinct species in Denmark, has become re-established with at least 13 subpopulations in the new Lake Fil. Also two species recently discovered in Denmark (Callitriche obtusangula and Lemna turionifera) were found. Half of the species may have colonized the re-established lake from now submerged drainage canals and from an upstream lake, while the other half presumably have colonized from more distant lakes. The high richness of aquatic macrophytes in the re-established Lake Fil is matched by only a few natural lakes in Denmark. According to predictions of species richness from environmental conditions and colonized area in 56 natural Danish lakes, the observed richness in Lake Fil is two-fold the expected. We attribute the high plant richness to: shallow waters, large open areas on grazed or physically exposed lake shores and high likelihood of species recruitment from neighboring lakes via dense populations of migratory waterfowl. High plant richness was established despite low transparency due to high release of dissolved organic matter and particles from flooded soils. We conclude that suitable bathymetry, physical disturbance, grazing by cattle and waterfowl in the littoral zone and high dispersal capacity of propagules may ensure rapid establishment of a rich aquatic vegetation in new lakes, even when nutrient-rich farmland is the starting point.

Interspecific variation in persistence of buried weed seeds follows trade-offs among physiological, chemical, and physical seed defenses	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Soil seedbanks drive infestations of annual weeds, yet weed management focuses largely on seedling mortality. As weed seedbanks increasingly become reservoirs of herbicide resistance, species-specific seedbank management approaches will be essential to weed control. However, the development of seedbank management strategies can only develop from an understanding of how seed traits affect persistence. 2. We quantified interspecific trade-offs among physiological, chemical, and physical traits of weed seeds and their persistence in the soil seedbank in a common garden study. Seeds of 11 annual weed species were buried in Savoy, IL, from 2007 through 2012. Seedling recruitment was measured weekly and seed viability measured annually. Seed physiological (dormancy), chemical (phenolic compound diversity and concentration; invertebrate toxicity), and physical traits (seed coat mass, thickness, and rupture resistance) were measured. 3. Seed half-life in the soil (t(0.5)) showed strong interspecific variation (F-10,F-30 = 15, p < .0001), ranging from 0.25 years (Bassia scoparia) to 2.22 years (Abutilon theophrasti). Modeling covariances among seed traits and seedbank persistence quantified support for two putative defense syndromes (physiological-chemical and physical-chemical) and highlighted the central role of seed dormancy in controlling seed persistence. 4. A quantitative comparison between our results and other published work indicated that weed seed dormancy and seedbank persistence are linked across diverse environments and agroecosystems. Moreover, among seedbank-forming early successional plant species, relative investment in chemical and physical seed defense varies with seedbank persistence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Strong covariance among weed seed traits and persistence in the soil seedbank indicates potential for seedbank management practices tailored to specific weed species. In particular, species with high t(0.5) values tend to invest less in chemical defenses. This makes them highly vulnerable to physical harvest weed seed control strategies, with small amounts of damage resulting in their full decay.

Fire effects on the seed bank of three Mediterranean shrubs: implications for fire management	PLANT ECOLOGY												To evaluate fire effects on the soil seed bank of a Mediterranean heathland, soil and litter samples were collected under the three dominant shrub species (Erica australis L., Erica umbellata Loefl. ex L., and Pterospartum tridentatum (L.) Willk) before and after an experimental fire. Target plants were selected near to 12 points regularly spaced in a grid layout in a 50 9 50 m plot. Soil heating by the fire was estimated using thermocouples installed at 1.5 cm depth. The soil seed bank was dominated by E. australis and E. umbellata. Erica australis having statistically significantly higher germination densities under their conspecific shrubs. Pterospartum tridentatum was extremely underrepresented in the viable seed bank, despite being the dominant species in the vegetation. Fire did not produce significant differences in the overall germination, but post-fire germination density of E. australis was related to maximum temperatures recorded at 1.5 cm depth. Special focus was given to the seed bank of the obligate seeder E. umbellata and its possible implications in population regeneration after recurrent fires. There was, however, no evidence that current fire frequency would imply a risk of population decline, since E. umbellata seed bank is abundant despite the scarcity of adult shrubs.

J	Wiltermuth, MT; Anteau, MJ				Wiltermuth, Mark T.; Anteau, Michael J.			Is consolidation drainage an indirect mechanism for increased abundance of cattail in northern prairie wetlands?	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In the Prairie Pothole Region of North America, disturbances to wetlands that disrupt water-level fluctuations in response to wet-dry climatic conditions have the potential to alter natural vegetative communities in favor of species that proliferate in stable environments, such as cattail (Typha spp.). We evaluated the effect of water-level dynamics during a recent fluctuation in wet-dry conditions on cattail coverage within semipermanently and permanently ponded wetlands situated in watersheds with different land use and amounts of wetland drainage. We found that ponded water depth increase was significantly greater in wetlands where water levels were not near the spill point of the topographic basin, where banks were steeper, and in larger wetlands where past dry conditions had less influence on change in pond area. Proportion of the wetland covered by cattail was negatively correlated with increased water depth, bank slope and pond area. Our observations provide evidence that cattail coverage in prairie wetlands is regulated by water-level fluctuations and that land use surrounding the wetland might have an indirect effect on cattail coverage by altering water-level response to wet-dry climate conditions. For example, drainage of smaller wetlands into larger wetlands that are characterized by more permanent hydroperiods, leads to stabilized water levels near their spill point and is therefore a potential mechanism for increased cattail abundance in the northern prairie region.

J	Greet, J				Greet, J.			The potential of soil seed banks of a eucalypt wetland forest to aid restoration	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Soil seed banks can play an important role in the regeneration of wetland vegetation. However, their potential role in the restoration of degraded wetland forests is less certain. I surveyed the soil seed bank and extant floras of four sites across a eucalypt wetland forest of variable vegetation condition. At each site, the extant vegetation was surveyed within two 5 x 5 m(2) quadrats, each from which five composite soil seed bank samples were collected. Across the four sites, 57 (including 18 exotic) species were identified in the extant vegetation, while from the seed bank samples 6379 seedlings emerged from 80 taxa, 33 of which were exotic species. The soil seed bank was dominated by native and exotic monocots, and contained very few seeds of wetland tree or shrub species. Overall, the similarity between the extant and seed bank floras was very low (similar to 24 %). Soil seed banks are likely to be of limited use in the restoration of degraded wetland forests, because the dominant species in such systems-woody and clonal plants-are typically absent from the soil seed bank. Wetland soil seed banks may contribute to the maintenance and diversity of understorey vegetation, however, they may also act as a source of exotic plant invasions, particularly when a wetland is degraded.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				OCT	2016	24	5					565	577		10.1007/s11273-016-9488-9							WOS:000384552800006						
J	Pusz, W				Pusz, Wojciech			Plants' healthiness assessment as part of the environmental monitoring of protected mountainous area in the example of Karkonosze (Giant) Mts. (SW Poland)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The aim of phytopathological monitoring is to check the healthiness of plants and observe the changes that occur in their populations. In the vast majority, these types of observations are conducted in agriculture and forestry. An interesting aspect of phytopathological monitoring is the assessment of the origin of the plant species. The research of fungal communities (including pathogens) in plants may, for example, indicate the relic nature of the plant species. Reduction of the occurrence or disappearance of fungi species associated with its host plant can evidence slow decline of their habitats. This applies mainly to arctic-alpine fungal species. On the other hand, for some plant hosts, colonization of their organs by polyphagous fungi is being recorded. One such example is the downy willow, on which six species of fungi were found in the Karkonosze Mts. In 2014, there were no fungi found on this plant. However, comparing the species composition of fungi associated with downy willow given by Schroeter (1908) to the contemporary one and to the study results of other researchers, a decrease in the number of fungi species is clearly visible. This may be related to the environmental pollution, which took place in the Sudetes in the second half of the twentieth century. For instance, the species of the genus Rhytisma colonize the leaves of trees and shrubs and are particularly sensitive to the concentration of SO2 in the air, but nobody has looked for this fungus on this host in the past. Yet, presently, we were able to find Rhytisma fungus in Karkonosze Mts. Phytopathological monitoring was conducted in the years of 2014-2015 in the sub-alpine zone of the Karkonosze (Giant) Mts. It has been shown that, compared to similar studies conducted in the 1990s of the twentieth century, the species composition of fungi infesting Rubus chamaemorus and Betula carpactica has changed. Is this the beginning of changes that will occur in populations of plants?

The Role of Host Demographic Storage in the Ecological Dynamics of Heritable Symbionts	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Heritable symbioses are widespread and ecologically important. Many host organisms have complex life cycles that include diverse opportunities for symbionts to affect their host and be lost during development. Yet, existing theory takes a simplified view of host demography. Here, we generalize symbiosis theory to understand how demographic "storage" in the form of dormant or prereproductive life stages can modify symbiosis dynamics. Using grass-endophyte symbioses as context, we developed models to contrast the role of the seed bank (a storage stage) against the reproductive stage in symbiont persistence and prevalence. We find that the seed bank is as important as or more important than the reproductive stage in driving symbiont dynamics, as long as passage through the seed bank is obligate. Flexible entry to the seed bank substantially weakens its influence on symbiont persistence but can modify prevalence in counterintuitive ways. Our models identify a role for legacy effects, where hosts that lose symbionts retain their demographic influence. The retention of benefits via legacy effects can reduce symbiont prevalence and even cause prevalence to decline with increasing benefits to hosts because symbiont-free hosts carry those benefits. Our results resolve connections between individual-level host-symbiont interactions and population-level patterns, providing guidance for empirical studies.																	0003-0147	1537-5323				OCT	2016	188	4					446	459		10.1086/687965							WOS:000383774400009	27622878					
J	Ho, A; Luke, C; Reim, A; Frenzel, P				Ho, Adrian; Lueke, Claudia; Reim, Andreas; Frenzel, Peter			Resilience of (seed bank) aerobic methanotrophs and methanotrophic activity to desiccation and heat stress	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												In seasonally changing environments, aerobic methanotrophs are exposed to elevated temperatures and drought. Prior exposure to adverse conditions (site history) may leave an imprint on the methanotrophic community composition in the form of a seed bank. While the significance of a microbial seed bank is established, the potential of this seemingly preserved community following emergence from inactive states and its sensitivity to adverse conditions are still lacking. We used a paddy soil representing an environment experiencing recurring desiccation and heat stress as per agricultural practice, and two lake sediments with sporadic/limited or no exposure to desiccation and heat stress as model systems. In a microcosm study, we induced drought combined with a heat treatment by air-drying the samples at ambient (25 degrees C) and elevated (75 degrees C) temperatures, designated as mild and severe stress, respectively. Fresh soil/sediment were used as reference. Upon rewetting, we followed the recovery of the methane uptake rate, and the population dynamics was monitored using qPCR assays and a diagnostic microarray analysis. Remarkably, methane uptake rates were not adversely affected even after severe stress, and activity recovered to levels comparable to the fresh soil/sediment incubations after 40 days. In particular, the alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs (Methylosinus-Methylocystis group) exponentially increased in population size upon rewetting. Interestingly, the qPCR and microarray analyses revealed that some gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs (e.g. Methylocaldum- and Methylosarcina-related methanotrophs) increased in relative abundance after the desiccation and heat stress, indicating the unexpected resistance of this subgroup to the stress treatment. Although the initial and recovering communities were significantly different, population abundance recovered over time. The shift in the trajectory of the recovering communities suggests that repeated exposure to adverse factors will change the seed bank's composition. Overall, the indigenous (seed bank) methanotroph populations showed remarkable recovery from the induced stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The assessments were performed 12 years after the settlement of the experiment in which five mixed stand models were tested. First, a general evaluation of the stand was performed when we surveyed the overstory and understory, seed bank and soil for chemical analysis. Then, the restoration indicators survival of planted trees, basal area and density of the tree community, litter accumulated on the soil and canopy closure index were utilized to compare the plantation models and to assess the influence the experimental factors on these parameters. In the general analysis, we found that the studied stand presents low diversity, poor regeneration, and seed bank dominated mostly by one planted exotic tree species and weeds, which may jeopardize the self-maintenance of the stand in the future. The factor that most influenced the models was the ecological group composition with the best performance found for models in which both pioneer and non-pioneer groups were used. Probably, the plantation arrangement and spacing did not have greater influence due to both plant mortality and natural regeneration that has developed to this age. Hence, it is not recommended the use of only pioneer species in the implantation of riparian forest and the proportion of 50% pioneers and 50% non-pioneers using as much species as possible is indicated for areas that might present constraints for the natural regeneration.

Assessing bias and knowledge gaps on seed ecology research: implications for conservation agenda and policy	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Sampling biases permeate ecological research and result in knowledge gaps that have vital consequences for conservation planning. The consequences of knowledge gaps on species identity and distribution (the Wallacean and Linnean shortfalls, respectively) have become apparent recently, but we know little about the extent that research biases and knowledge gaps on traits that influence species' niches (the Hutchinsonian shortfall) affect conservation policy. To examine whether knowledge of species' traits based on seed ecology is geographically, phylogenetically, and ecologically biased, we retrieved research data on seed germination, seed dormancy, seed dispersal, seed banks, seed predation, and seed removal from a database of 847 papers, 1648 species, and 5322 cases. Brazil was selected as a model system for megadiverse, undersampled countries. Kernel density maps showed that research was geographically biased towards highly populated sites, with vast areas remaining historically unexplored. We also show that research was clustered into protected areas. We detected a significant positive phylogenetic bias at genus-level, indicating research concentration in few genera and lower relative bias rates for many herbaceous genera. Unexpectedly, information on seed banking was available for only 74 (3.4%) of threatened species, which suggests that information deficits are highest for species with critical needs for ex situ conservation strategies. Tree, fleshy-fruited, and biotic dispersal species were disproportionately overstudied. Our data indicate that information deficits on seed ecology preclude our ability to effectively restore ecosystems and to safeguard endangered species. We call for a systematic improvement of environmental agenda in which policy makers and scientists target sites, clades, and functional groups historically neglected. Lessons from developed countries and collaborative efforts will be important for megadiverse, underdeveloped countries to achieve the targets of international agreements that depend on seed ecology knowledge aiming to secure biological diversity and ecosystem services.

J	Liu, XY; Zhou, W; Bai, ZK				Liu, Xiaoyang; Zhou, Wei; Bai, Zhongke			Vegetation coverage change and stability in large open-pit coal mine dumps in China during 1990-2015	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Ecosystem reconstruction via vegetation restoration is key to comprehensive renewal of the fragile ecological environment of an open-pit mine dump. To investigate vegetation coverage change and stability after mine dump land reclamation, three dumps in the Antaibao open-pit coal mine, northern Shanxi province, China, were used. This region has a typical temperate arid to semi-arid continental monsoon climate. Vegetation coverage was calculated from 11 Landsat remote images taken 1990-2015. Methods included calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), decomposition of mixed pixels, calculation of variation trends, and a transition matrix. The results show that vegetation coverage in the dumps increased dramatically from 1990 to 2015 (with NDVI rising from -0.02 to 0.02 in 1990 to 0.24 to 0.31 in 2015). The change in NDVI was classified mainly as significantly improved, to mostly moderately high coverage, by 2015. Water is a restrictive factor that greatly influenced the growth and development of vegetation. There was greater vegetation coverage and rate of improvement in coverage at higher elevations, and less coverage on steep slopes. Stability analysis of vegetation coverage succession and its recovery after a fire indicate that post-reclamation vegetation coverage in the dumps is relatively stable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates in a split plot. Treatments consisted of doses of the following herbicides: indaziflam, 75, 100, and 150 g a.i. ha(-1); indaziflam+metribuzin, 75 + 960 g a.i. ha(-1); and diuron+hexazinone, 936 + 264 g a.i. ha(-1); besides a clean area, used as a reference. The soil seed bank was analyzed in the 0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20-m soil layers. Emerged seedlings were counted and identified, and absolute and relative density, frequency and abundance, as well as the importance value index, were calculated. In the treatments 100 and 150 g a.i. ha(-1) indaziflam, there was a greater reduction in the total seed bank and in the importance value index of species of Poaceae and Asteraceae. The total seed bank, in the 0.10-0.20-m layer, and that of the species Portulaca oleracea, in both evaluated layers, are not affected by the herbicides. The use of pre-emergent herbicides during four consecutive harvests decreases the soil seed bank in the 0.00-0.10-m layer under a sugarcane crop.

The importance of recurrent reproductive events for Ruppia maritima seed bank viability in a highly variable estuary	AQUATIC BOTANY												Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) that recruits from seed may be favored over species that maintain populations through clonal reproduction as estuaries become more dynamic under upstream hydrologic changes and sea level rise. We examined recruitment in an SAV species Ruppia maritima (wigeongrass) at the hydrologically variable Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone. We hypothesized that the R. maritima seed bank depends upon large reproductive events occurring at least annually. Vegetation biomass, nutrient allocation, sexual reproduction, seed set and sediment seed bank viability were examined when reproductive meadows were present and following senescence. Within a meadow, total seed bank densities were high (>20,000 m(-2)). However, 85% of seeds had germinated, leaving a small persistent seed bank, and most germinations did not successfully produce seedlings. Only 25% of intact (potentially viable) seeds were viable (<768 seeds m-2) to create a persistent seed bank. As reproductive shoots senesced, all vegetation completely died and 2750 seeds m(-2) entered the seed bank (40 seeds g(-1) biomass), increasing total seed bank viability from <4 to similar to 20%. Reproductive R. maritima meadows can produce numerous seeds if not nutrient-limited during "windows of opportunity"; however, lack of a persistent seed bank, high germination rate and total vegetation mortality following reproduction indicate a reliance on reproductive events for population regeneration. Under lower hydrologic variability, perennial populations of R maritima and other SAV could be sustained through vegetative reproduction, thereby reducing dependence on sexual reproduction. Otherwise, SAV in variable environments like this ecotone will remain dependent recurrent reproductive events to sustain recruitment and vegetation maintenance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For plants, germination can time emergence with favourable conditions for later growth and reproduction (predictive germination), spread the risk of unfavourable conditions (bet hedging) or both (integrated strategies). Here we explored the adaptive value of within-and among-year germination timing for 12 species of Sonoran Desert winter annual plants. We parameterised models with long-term demographic data to predict optimal germination fractions and compared them to observed germination. At both temporal scales we found that bet hedging is beneficial and that predicted optimal strategies corresponded well with observed germination. We also found substantial fitness benefits to varying germination timing, suggesting some degree of predictive germination in nature. However, predictive germination was imperfect, calling for some degree of bet hedging. Together, our results suggest that desert winter annuals have integrated strategies combining both predictive plasticity and bet hedging.																	1461-023X	1461-0248				OCT	2016	19	10					1209	1218		10.1111/ele.12655							WOS:000382543100003	27515951

Grazing intensities affect weed seedling emergence and the seed bank in an integrated crop-livestock system	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are widespread worldwide. Although weeds can result in several types of losses, essential information regarding weed seedling emergence and seed banks is lacking in these systems for integrated weed management planning. This study investigated the effects of different grazing intensities (no grazing and grazed swards maintained at 10-, 20-, 30- and 40-cm sward heights) on weed seedling emergence and seed banks in a winter cover crop during the 15th year of an ICLS experiment under no-tillage management in subtropical Southern Brazil. We hypothesized that low grazing intensities would reduce weed interference and weed seed banks size in an ICLS. We determined treatment- effects on weed species richness, seed bank population-density, and seedling emergence during winter and summer. Higher sward heights in the winter-grazed cover crop reduced the number of weed species, the density of emerged weed seedlings, and the weed seed bank size compared with the non-grazed control. With a sward grazing height of 10 cm, the seed bank contained an average of 3151 seeds m-(2), and the weed population densities during the summer and winter were 11.8 and 21.7 plants m(-2) greater, respectively, compared with the sward grazing height of 40 cm. Fifteen years after adopting low grazing intensities (30- and 40-cm sward heights) in the ICLS, the size of the weed seed bank was reduced by 42.1% compared with the non-grazed treatment. Decreasing the grazing intensity reduced the number of weed species, the density of emerged weed seedlings, and the weed seed bank density; therefore, integrated weed management strategies should consider minimizing grazing intensities in an ICLS.

Vegetation resilience to mega-drought along a typical floodplain gradient of the southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: How diverse and resilient is vegetation following a decade of extreme drought along a typical floodplain gradient of semi-arid south-eastern Australia? How do mechanisms of resilience (i.e. persistence and soil seed banks) vary between major plant groups and spatially with respect to habitat type and position along a flood frequency gradient? Location: Southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Methods: We surveyed understorey vegetation and conducted germination trials to examine responses to re-wetting from soil seed banks of seven major habitat types along a typical floodplain gradient of the southern Murray-Darling Basin. We assessed abundance, species richness, functional diversity and composition, including exotic species, within and between extant and germinating assemblages. Results: Understorey vegetation was surprisingly diverse, although low in cover, following a decade of extreme drought, with considerable numbers of plant species (61) and functional plant groups represented. Historically drier habitats, towards floodplain margins, had higher species richness and cover overall and for exotic species. Plant assemblages exhibited high heterogeneity between habitats. Soil seed banks were very dissimilar from extant vegetation, comprising mainly amphibious and damp taxa as well as some terrestrial herbs, mostly annuals. Seed banks were most abundant and diverse in intermediate floodplain habitats, and their composition was very distinct between habitat types. Conclusions: Semi floodplain v likely to he highly resilient to prolonged drought. Plants persisting under dry conditions do not appear to rely on local soil seed banks for regeneration and may either tolerate drying in situ or arrive from neighbouring ecosystems. Soil seed banks allow understorey vegetation to respond to re-wetting, especially in intermediate floodplain habitats. Lake bed assemblages and aquatic/amphibious species lacking soil seed banks appear most vulnerable to drought. Vegetation resilience is promoted by landscape heterogeneity.

However, the management of invasive plants remains a challenge despite ever more resources being allocated to their removal. Often invasive plants targeted for 'eradication' are well-established, have multiple modes of reproduction, long-term seed banks, and strong associations with native and non-native mutualists that ensure dispersal and facilitate spread. The pantropical weed, Lantana camara (Lantana), is one of the most invasive woody plants globally. We illustrate that, for Lantana, eradication is an unrealistic management goal given the short-term removal approaches, irrespective of the effectiveness of removal methods. We assessed the role of dispersal by avian frugivores in the recolonization of managed areas by Lantana in the seasonally dry, tropical forests of northern and southern India. We estimated the distribution of Lantana, its dispersal potential and the proximity between managed areas and source populations. We found that Lantana was dispersed by many generalist frugivorous birds and that most managed areas were well within the median dispersal distance from source plants facilitating rapid recolonization of managed areas. We conclude that given the difficulty of eradicating long-established invasive plants, management practices should entail long-term monitoring and control in priority areas for as long as Lantana occurs in the landscape.

Broad-leaved weeds infested more toward maturity in 2006 than in 2005, particularly in directly seeded plots. Weed dry weights at pre-heading and/or maturity were consistently reduced by herbicide application and Phka Rumduol cultivar, while weed numbers increased under unflooded condition. The proportion of sedges was consistently larger in directly seeded and non-herbicide plots at pre-heading. Larger numbers and dry weights of sedges and total weeds in 2005 caused larger seed bank sizes of sedges and total weeds in 2006, which further caused their infestation in 2006. A greater weed dry weight at 62 days after sowing in 2005 resulted in larger seed banks of Cyperus iria and Fimbristylis miliacea, which were most severe under non-herbicide, direct-seeded treatment, while that at rice maturity resulted in larger seed banks of Cyperus difformis, Scirpus juncoides, and Lindernia antipoda. Overall, sedges shared the majority of the total weed seed bank, followed by broad-leaved weeds and then grasses. A lower yield in 2005 led to significantly larger seed bank sizes of sedges, but not of grasses or broad-leaved weeds. Rice yield reduction was consistently related to larger numbers of sedges by heading and those of grasses at maturity.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				SEP	2016	16	3					93	107		10.1111/wbm.12097							WOS:000388306100001

Spatial variation in reproductive effort of a southern Australian seagrass	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In marine environments characterised by habitat-forming plants, the relative allocation of resources into vegetative growth and flowering is an important indicator of plant condition and hence ecosystem health. In addition, the production and abundance of seeds can give clues to local resilience. Flowering density, seed bank, biomass and epiphyte levels were recorded for the temperate seagrass Zostera nigricaulis in Port Phillip Bay, south east Australia at 14 sites chosen to represent several regions with different physicochemical conditions. Strong regional differences were found within the large bay. Spathe and seed density were very low in the north of the bay (3 sites), low in the centre of the bay (2 sites) intermediate in the Outer Geelong Arm (2 sites), high in Swan Bay (2 sites) and very high in the Inner Geelong Arm (3 sites). In the south (2 sites) seed density was low and spathe density was high. These regional patterns were largely consistent for the 5 sites sampled over the three year period. Timing of flowering was consistent across sites, occurring from August until December with peak production in October, except during the third year of monitoring when overall densities were lower and peaked in November. Seagrass biomass, epiphyte load, canopy height and stem density showed few consistent spatial and temporal patterns. Variation in spathe and seed density and morphology across Port Phillip Bay reflects varying environmental conditions and suggests that northern sites may be restricted in their ability to recover from disturbance through sexual reproduction. In contrast, sites in the west and south of the bay have greater potential to recover from disturbances due to a larger seed bank and these sites could act as source populations for sites where seed production is low.

On the Canadian prairies, the tillage-based crop-fallow system has been replaced by no-till reduced input systems or tillage-based organic systems with more diversity in crop rotations but with no external inputs. However, the long-term effects of these alternative systems on weed and yield parameters have not been assessed. A study to examine weed and crop yield dynamics under diverse cropping systems was conducted within a 18-year cropping systems study near Scott, Saskatchewan. The trial was laid out in a split-split-plot design with four replicates. The main plots were three levels of inputs; a high input system (HIGH) that used tillage and inputs to maximize yield, a reduced system (RED) that used no-till practices and minimal inputs, and a tillage-based organic system(ORG) with no external inputs. The subplots were cropping diversity (rotations); fallow-annual grains (LOW), diversified annual grains (DAG), and diversified annuals and perennial forage (DAP). The sub-sub plots were the six phases of each rotation. There was an input by rotation interaction for weed biomass but not for weed density and crop yields. ORG systems had 7x and 4x greater weed density (107 plants m(-2)), 4x higher weed biomass (154 kg ha(-1)), and 32% and 35% lower yields (1052 kg ha(-1)) than RED and HIGH systems respectively. RED and HIGH input systems had similar crop yields and lower weed density than ORG. The LOW rotation had the lowest weed density. LOW and DAG rotations had similar yields, which were higher than in DAP. All systems showed an increase in weed density and biomass over time but did not impact on crop yields which was increasing over time likely influenced by a concurrent increase in rainfall. This study concludes that eliminating tillage and reducing agrochemicals is possible but eliminating agrochemicals requires better crop rotations for weed management as well as for nutrient management.

Kirigala forest fragments and the identity as a dipterocarp plantation or Hora Kele of Ingiriya	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA												Fragmentation has exposed the Kirigala forest to the influence of various neighbourhood land-use practices. The present study investigated the floristic, soil and micro-climatic conditions of the forest and demonstrated its degradation due to influences by human induced disturbances. Ten 50 m x 5 m gradsects each accommodating 3 pairs of 10 m x 5 m plots, a total of 60 soil samples and 20 seed traps provided floristic details, seedling emergence from seed bank and annual seed rain of the forest, respectively. Diversity of the edge and the forest interior were compared for the different neighbourhood land use types using the Shannon and Weiner (H) and Simpsons reciprocal (D) indices. Change in the forest structure was illustrated using profile diagrams. Differences in soil pH, soil moisture, nitrogen, available phosphorous and potassium, organic matter content, air temperature, humidity and light intensity between the forest edge and the interior were determined. Soil, microclimate and species richness were combined for clustering of similar areas. The site reported the presence of 55 tree, 12 shrub, 15 herb, 07 climber and 02 vine species including a total of 23 endemic species and 06 invasive species. A higher diversity was observed at the edge, and the highest was observed beside roads as indicated by both diversity indices H and D. Soil and microclimate of the forest varied significantly between the edge and the interior and reflected anthropogenic influences and neighbourhood land use practices. Dominance hierarchy of the trees was Dipterocaipus zeylanicus > Gaertnera vaginans > Aporusa lanceolata, while that for undergrowth/shrubs herbaceous species was Ochlandra stridula > Dracaena thwaitesii > Piper sylvestre. Annual seed rain contained propagules of 23 plant species, while invasive Alstonia macrophylla provided the highest density of seeds. Establishment of foot paths, selective removal of juveniles by root-balling technique and encroachment for crop cultivation have also facilitated the degradation process. It is vital to pay attention on maintaining the ecological stability of this forest before it loses its identity as the Hora Kele of Ingiriya.																	1391-4588	2362-0161				SEP	2016	44	3					313	327		10.4038/jnsfsr.v44i3.8012							WOS:000384631100010

Reproductive Biology of the Federally Endangered Clematis morefieldii Kral (Ranunculaceae)	CASTANEA												Successful management of rare plant species requires understanding of reproductive life history. To assess reproductive attrition, the status of all reproductive units (expressed in seven stages) on 40 plants at The Nature Conservancy's Keel Mountain Preserve (Madison County, Alabama) was recorded throughout 4 yr (2009-12). Floral herbivory by Lepidopteran larvae (Geometridae) and abortion of reproductive units was common, with few flower buds (< 12%) producing mature fruits and the greatest attrition occurring during the smallest flower bud stage. Reproductive output was positively correlated with peak growth season rainfall (April June); plants produced more fruits in wet years (2009 and 2011) than in drought years (2010 and 2012). Postdispersal achene predation assessed in a high-density Clematis area and a low-density Clematis area reached 15% after 1 wk and increased to 30% after 4 mo but did not significantly differ between high-density and low-density areas. Germination was documented by planting achenes in cages in high-density and low-density areas. Seeds remained dormant the first year and germinated in significantly greater amounts the second year (23%) compared to the third year (9%) after planting. Germination did not differ between high-density and low-density areas. This study documented high levels of floral herbivory, demonstrated the importance of growing season rainfall, revealed moderate levels of postdispersal achene predation, and confirmed the existence of a short-lived seed bank. Land managers can use these results to design management strategies to boost reproductive success of plants in declining or small populations.																	0008-7475	1938-4386				SEP	2016	81	3					175	187		10.2179/15-062							WOS:000384392700003

Seed dormancy, germination and seed storage in henna (Lawsonia inermis)	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Henna (Lawsonia inermis L.) is an important commercial plant of India grown mainly for its leaves used for dying hair, skin etc. The seeds of henna are small typically pyramidal, endospermic with a linear embryo. The freshly harvested seeds show endogenous non-deep physiological dormancy and pre-treatment of seeds, viz. leaching, chilling, priming, GA(3) and KNO3 co-application reduced dormancy. The physiological dormancy was transitory and disappeared during storage due to after-ripening. Seed storage studies revealed that seeds with 5 and 7 % moisture content did not show significant reduction in seed longevity up to 24 months in ambient storage in comparison to seeds with higher moisture content. Seed deterioration was slow at 15 and -20 degrees C storage temperatures. The seeds are desiccation as well as chilling tolerant, therefore, exhibit orthodox seed storage behaviour which makes them ideal for ex-situ conservation in seed banks for long term storage.																	0019-5022	2394-3319				SEP	2016	86	9					1201	1207									WOS:000384033700018

SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed dormancy is a critical factor in determining seed persistence in the soil and can create oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) volunteer problems in subsequent years. A 3-year field trial in south-west Germany investigated the effects of seed maturity on primary dormancy and disposition to secondary dormancy of ten oilseed rape varieties (lines) in 2009 and 2010, and of five imidazolinone-tolerant varieties (hybrids) in 2014. Fresh seeds were sampled weekly from about 30 d after flowering (DAF) until full maturity and tested for dormancy on the day of seed collection. Primary dormancy decreased from a high level of 70-99% at 30-40 DAF to 0-15% after 7-14 d, coinciding with embryo growth and depending on variety and year. For some oilseed rape varieties, 30-50% primary dormancy was still present in mature seeds. Depending on variety, disposition to secondary dormancy was nearly zero at the early stage of seed development, increased to its highest level during development, and decreased afterwards. Some varieties maintained a high level of secondary dormancy at maturity or during the entire seed development period. The correlation between primary dormancy and secondary dormancy was significantly positive at early seed development (r = 0.95, 50 DAF), but declined in mature seeds. Environmental conditions during ripening are also expected to affect dormancy dynamics. The deeper insights into dormancy formation of oilseed rape provide the possibility to improve harvest time and harvest method, and to better assess the potential for volunteer oilseed rape in following crops.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				SEP	2016	26	3					245	253		10.1017/S0960258516000118							WOS:000384412200004

Effect of water availability and seed source on physical dormancy break of Vicia villosa ssp villosa	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Physical dormancy (PY) plays a crucial role in the control of the reseeding process of Vicia villosa Roth, a winter annual species cultivated for pasture and hay, naturalized in several semi-arid temperate agroecosystems. As PY is considered a seed trait modulated by natural selection, populations from different origins are expected to show different responses to environmental regulatory factors. The present study aimed to determine the effect of: (1) water availability on PY-break dynamics of a naturalized population from Argentina (ASC) under both laboratory and field conditions; (2) the seed source on initial PY and dormancy release rate (wet storage at 20 degrees C) of ASC compared to 45 other populations of V. villosa, including wild, naturalized, landraces and cultivars. Water availability increased PY loss rate under both storage and field conditions. ASC PY-break dynamics was adequately described by a Gompertz model with a lower thermal-time requirement estimated for dormancy break under fluctuating soil water conditions compared to seeds buried inside impermeable bags. During the field burial experiment, a considerable proportion of seeds (similar to 70%) became water permeable during the summer season after dispersal, and retained low levels of residual PY for soil seed bank replenishment. Improved populations (i.e. breeding cultivars) showed the lowest percentages of initial PY compared to landraces, naturalized and wild populations. Naturalized populations of Argentina showed similar initial PY compared to landraces, although PY release rate was lower in the former and might be attributed to local environmental selection. Wild types showed the lowest PY release rates.

Ecology and Conservation of the Endangered Legume Crotalaria avonensis in Florida Scrub	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We collected data from 1998 to 2014 to describe the ecology of the highly endangered Florida scrub plant Crotalaria avonensis (Avon Park Harebells), and herein address several hypotheses based on what was known of its biology and the biology of co-occurring species. This perennial herbaceous legume occurs at 3 sites and prefers microsites with more cover by bare sand than vegetation. The population at an unprotected site has declined in size, but dynamics have been more stable at the 2 protected sites. Marked plants have shown high survival, slow and inconsistent growth, and occasional plant dormancy (usually 1-2 years). Avon Park Harebells is reproductively challenged, with very low rates of fruit set and infrequent visitation by required pollinators. The hardseeded fruits germinated at a rate of 13-56%; the germination speed seemed to increase after scarification, though the overall rate was less than for unscarified seeds. Unscarified seeds remained viable in the seed bank for at least 3 years. Seedlings recruited rarely, had moderate survival, began flowering at 4 years of age or later, and reached the size of median adult plants in 6-8 years. Herbivores affected 7-53% of plants in a given year, but plants showed rapid compensatory resprouting. Caging plants reduced herbivory and increased survival, growth, and flowering. Plants resprouted after fire and mechanical disturbance and exhibited high survival and growth, but repeated disturbances by vehicles caused increased mortality. Avon Park Harebells remains extremely endangered due to its limited range, small population sizes, and poor seedling recruitment. To help this species recover, we recommend fire management, protection from herbivory, introductions and augmentations, and further study of its pollination biology.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				SEP	2016	15	3					549	574		10.1656/058.015.0318							WOS:000384448300018						
J	Gordon, CE; Letnic, M				Gordon, Christopher E.; Letnic, Mike			Functional extinction of a desert rodent: implications for seed fate and vegetation dynamics	ECOGRAPHY												Population declines of once-abundant species have often preceded understanding of their roles within ecosystems. Consequently, important drivers of environmental change may remain undiagnosed because we simply do not know how species that are now rare or extinct shaped ecosystems in the past. Australia's desert rodents are thought to have little numerical impact on seed fate and vegetation recruitment when compared with ants or with desert rodents on other continents. However most research on granivory by Australian desert rodents has occurred in areas where rodents were rare or functionally extinct. Here we ask if the paradigm that rodents are relatively un-important granivores in Australian deserts is an artefact of their historical decline. In the Strzelecki Desert, the endangered rodent, Notomys fuscus is rare where introduced mesopredators are abundant but common where dingoes (an apex predator) suppress mesopredator populations. We used foraging trays to compare rates of seed removal for a common shrub (Dodonaea viscosa angustissima hopbush) between areas where N. fuscus, hopbush shrubs and their seedlings were rare and common and found that seed removal was consistently higher where rodents were common and hopbush rare. By excluding ants and rodents from foraging trays we show that ants removed more seeds than rodents where rodents were rare but rodents removed far more seeds than ants where rodents were common. By manipulating rodents' access to the soil seed-bank we show that hopbush seeds persisted in greater numbers where rodents were excluded than where they had access. Our results support the hypothesis that granivory by rodents may once have been a far more important process influencing the fate of seeds and shaping plant communities in arid Australia and suggest that dingo extirpation has cascading effects on shrub seeds. Our study highlights that functional extinction of rodents may be an under-appreciated driver of vegetation change.

However, transported seeds can be found rejected in refuse piles around their nests, making this ant a seed dispersal agent. This raises the following quesdons: Do refuse piles affect seed distribution? Do their small-scale seed composition, richness, and density in autumn and winter differ from those of areas without refuse piles? Are there differences in the vegetation found the following spring in refuse piles that have survived the winter or on sites where they have been destroyed, compared with control areas without refuse piles? In a Mediterranean steppe, we measured autumn and winter seed banks in a greenhouse, both in refuse piles and in controls. The following spring, in situ seedlings from refuse piles, from refuse piles artificially destroyed (sieved) in winter, and from controls without refuse piles were recorded. Seedling species richness and density were significantly higher in autumn in refuse piles than in controls. Nevertheless, no increased seedling contribution from the transient seed bank was detected in the winter refuse piles. The following spring, natural persistent refuse piles showed no seedlings. However, seedling species richness and density were significantly higher in places where refuse piles had been sieved before in winter. The construction of refuse piles by M. barbarus locally concentrates seed density and seed species richness; for the first time, a positive impact on seedlings is observed in places where refuse piles were sieved before winter and the potential bias of this methodology must be now compared with actions of natural agents (surface runoff) that destroyed refuse piles in winter.

Effects of including forage herbs in grass-legume mixtures on persistence of intensively managed pastures sampled across three age categories and five regions	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												To test the hypothesis that the inclusion of the forage herbs chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) or plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) or both in a grass-legume pasture mix improves persistence of sown vegetation and reduces weed and invertebrate pest ingress, a study was undertaken in 31-44 intensively managed pastures in each of five regions in New Zealand (Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki and Canterbury). The regions were stratified according to farm type (dairy or sheep and beef), pasture type (sown with grasses, legumes and herbs or grasses and legumes) and pasture age (young: 1-2 years old; medium: 3-4 years old; and old: 5+ years since sowing, n=171). Sown species ground cover and emergence from the soil seed bank was greater, and unsown species ground cover and emergence lower, in sheep and beef pastures sown with herbs than without herbs (78% vs 68% ground cover, respectively, averaged over all pasture ages), but there was no difference between pasture types on dairy farms. Invertebrate predator and parasitoid abundance was 65% greater under pastures sown with herbs than without herbs. The number and % dry matter contribution of sown species decreased, and that of unsown species increased, as pastures aged. Unsown species comprised 90% (sheep and beef) and 98% (dairy) of total seedling emergence. The inclusion of forage herbs increased persistence of sown species and reduced weed ingress, but only on sheep and beef farms.

Its gypsum substrate has been altered because of the extensive extraction of water, resulting in the destabilization of underground water systems and an increasing formation of sinkholes that are colonized by riparian species. Sinkholes represent a set of microenvironments that could improve germination and seedling establishment of riparian species. We studied the effect of light (in controlled conditions: 18/32 degrees C, 12/12 h photoperiod), collection season (rainy and dry seasons), and time of storage on the germination, in field and controlled conditions, of four riparian species (Samolus ebracteatus var. coahuilensis, Flaveria chlorifolia, Eustoma exaltatum, and Sabatia tuberculata) that colonize the sinkholes. Seeds of each species were enclosed in permeable nylon bags and fixed to the substrate of randomly selected sinkholes. From September 2009 to July 2010, three bags per species per collection season were recovered every two months, and germinated seeds were counted. Recovered ungerminated and lab stored (control) seeds were germinated in controlled conditions. The low germination probabilities in the field (<0.47) contrast with the high probabilities (0.8) maintained by control and recovered seeds, regardless of the collection season or the light treatment. All the species showed two germination peaks in the field, coinciding with moisture availability. These results suggest the presence of conditional dormancy and the distribution of germination in time, evading the unsafe synchronic germination in the disturbed Cuatrocienegas environment.

Bacterial wilt of dry beans, caused by Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens (Cff), is one of them. In Iran, this disease was first reported in 2012, which, since then, has rapidly spread across the major dry bean growing areas of the country causing severe yield losses. Previously, only two colony variants (yellow and orange) of the pathogen had been described from Iran in association with bacterial wilt of dry beans. In this study, we describe a new red-pigmented variant of Cff, isolated from dry bean seeds stored in seed banks of Khomein Bean Research Station, the major seed supplier in the region. Because Cff is a quarantine pathogen in Iran and elsewhere, with a potential threat for dry bean productions, more knowledge about the biology of this pathogen and epidemiology of the disease it causes are a prerequisite for the development of effective disease management strategies. Within this framework, we performed phenotypic and genetic characterization of the red-pigmented variant of the pathogen, in comparison with previously isolated yellow and orange variants, including pathogenicity, host range, bacteriocin production and genetic diversity. Our results showed a similar host range of different Cff variants although they differed in their aggressiveness. Yellow and orange variants of the pathogen were more aggressive on cowpea and common bean, respectively while the red variant showed the same level of aggressiveness on both hosts. Orange- and red-pigmented strains were separated from yellow-pigmented strains in the phylogeny of gyrB sequences. All orange- or red-pigmented strains were clustered in a separate branch from yellow-pigmented strains, except strain CffK31, in phylogeny based on rpoB sequences. In BOX-PCR analysis, Cff strains used in this study were clustered in two distinct genetic groups, with yellow variants of the pathogen separated from the orange and red variants. Overall, our results provide evidence of a remarkable diversity of Cff in Iran, which needs further in-depth investigation.				taghavi, seyyed mohsen/W-9140-2018; hamzehzarghani, habiballah/J-9855-2016	taghavi, seyyed mohsen/0000-0002-9972-5014; Lamichhane, Jay Ram/0000-0001-9780-0941; Osdaghi, Ebrahim/0000-0002-0359-0398; hamzehzarghani, habiballah/0000-0001-9046-6426												0929-1873	1573-8469				SEP	2016	146	1					129	145		10.1007/s10658-016-0900-3							WOS:000381224900011

On the basis of published literature and our field observations, we hypothesized that increased aridity might decrease the aerial seed bank as a plastic response, not necessarily adaptive. METHODS: We used a Pinus halepensis common garden replicated in three contrasted sites (mild, cold, and dry) to separate population differentiation from phenotypic plasticity of cone serotiny and canopy cone bank (CCB). Differences in growth among trees of the same provenance allowed us to include size effect as a proxy of ontogenetic age for the same chronological age of the trees. KEY RESULTS: Tree size had a strong negative effect on serotiny, but serotiny degree differed among trial sites even after accounting for size effects. As hypothesized, serotiny was lower at the harsh (dry and cold) sites compared with the mild site. Genetic variation for size-dependent cone serotiny and significant population x site interaction were confirmed, the latter implying different plasticity of serotiny among populations. Population differentiation for CCB showed an ecotypic trend, with positive correlation with temperature oscillation (continentality) and negative correlation with summer rainfall. CONCLUSIONS: Growth-limiting environments exacerbated the precocious release of seeds, contrary to the ecotypic trend found for the aerial cone bank, suggesting a counter-gradient plasticity. This plastic response is potentially maladaptive under a scenario of frequent wildfires.

As seed stage is particularly vulnerable to environmental conditions, characteristics of seed population should be needed to study for determining whether the recovery of natural vegetation is limited during this stage on the abandoned slopes in this region. The study was performed on three abandoned slopes in a watershed with an area of 8.27 km(2) in the Shaanxi province of China. The differences in soil seed banks were investigated in two different points in time, late March 2011 and early April 2013. Main factors of seed population dynamics, such as seed yield of dominant species, seed inputs by seed rain as well as seed outputs through seed loss by overland flow and seedling emergence, were monitored from late March 2011 to early April 2013. In this study, seed rain densities of the main later successional species, i.e., Lespedeza davurica (Laxm.) Schindl., Stipa bungeana Trin. and Artemisia gmelinii Web. ex Stechm., accounted for 51.5-71.6% of their own seed yields. The soil seed bank density in early April 2013 was larger than that in late March 2011. The density of seed inputs by seed rain was 10186 seeds m(-2), and the total seed bank, including seed rain and seeds present in the soil seed bank in late March 2011, reached a density of 15018 seeds m(2) during the study period. Seed densities of loss duo to overland flow and seedling emergence were 79 seeds m(-2) from 20 species and 938 seedlings m(-2) that belonged to 38 species during a study period, and the seed output through them accounted for 0.5% and 6.3% of the total seed bank, respectively. The study concluded that overland flow could not result in large numbers of seeds loss and seeds were accumulating in the soil seed bank due to seed rain, and vegetation succession might be limited by curbed spatial seed dispersal and seedling establishment.

J	Heydari, M; Faramarzi, M; Pothier, D				Heydari, Mehdi; Faramarzi, Marzban; Pothier, David			Post-fire recovery of herbaceous species composition and diversity, and soil quality indicators one year after wildfire in a semi-arid oak woodland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Disturbance and environmental heterogeneity are factors that affect forest ecosystems under different climates. Although fire is an important disturbance agent in deciduous oak forests of western Iran, its effects on vegetation composition are still poorly understood. This study examined the short-term impact of different fire intensities on the composition and diversity of herbaceous species, together with physical, chemical and biological soil properties. In sampling a large area that had burned in 2013, we surveyed the vegetation and soil properties in quadrats established in each of 25 plots that had been selected for each of three fire intensities. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed greater similarity in species composition between low-intensity fire (LFI) and unburned (Un) areas compared to LFI versus high-intensity fire (HFI). Compared to Un, LFI increased richness of annual and perennial herbaceous species, while HFI exerted the opposite effect. Moreover, the number of indicator species was decreased with increasing fire intensity. Higher soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) and basal respiration (BR), as well as microbial quotient (qMic) were found in Un compared to burned areas; these variables averaged 1098 mu g g(-1), 85.4 mu gg(-1), 17.08 mg CO2-C kg(-1) day(-1) and 1.96 mg Cmic/g C total, respectively. Also, Shannon indices of herbaceous species were positively related to these microbial responses. Overall, soil microbial characteristics were more sensitive indicators of fire intensity than soil physico-chemical properties. These results suggest that low intensity fires could be used effectively as a management tool to obviate the effects of intense fires in such semi-arid ecosystems, thereby reducing forest floor fuel loads while maintaining or even improving herbaceous plant richness.

An important step toward the understanding of patterns in species dominance and vegetation change at desert grassland-shrubland transitions is the study of environmental limitations imposed by the shrub-encroachment phenomenon on plant establishment. Here, we analyze the structure of soil seed banks, environmental limitations for seed germination (i.e., soil-water availability and temperature), and simulated seedling emergence and early establishment of dominant species (black grama, Bouteloua eriopoda, and creosotebush, Larrea tridentata) across a Chihuahuan grassland-shrubland ecotone (Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA). Average viable seed density in soils across the ecotone is generally low (200-400 seeds/m(2)), although is largely concentrated in densely vegetated areas (with peaks up to 800-1,200 seeds/m(2) in vegetated patches). Species composition in the seed bank is strongly affected by shrub encroachment, with seed densities of grass species sharply decreasing in shrub-dominated sites. Environmental conditions for seed germination and seedling emergence are synchronized with the summer monsoon. Soil-moisture conditions for seedling establishment of B. eriopoda take place with a recurrence interval ranging between 5 and 8 yr for grassland and shrubland sites, respectively, and are favored by strong monsoonal precipitation. Limited L. tridentata seed dispersal and a narrow range of rainfall conditions for early seedling establishment (50-100 mm for five to six consecutive weeks) constrain shrub-recruitment pulses to localized and episodic decadal events (9-25 yr recurrence intervals) generally associated with late-summer rainfall. Re-establishment of B. eriopoda in areas now domi-nated by L. tridentata is strongly limited by the lack of seeds and decreased plant-available soil moisture for seedling establishment.

A resurrection experiment finds evidence of both reduced genetic diversity and potential adaptive evolution in the agricultural weed Ipomoea purpurea	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Despite the negative economic and ecological impact of weeds, relatively little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that influence their persistence in agricultural fields. Here, we use a resurrection approach to examine the potential for genotypic and phenotypic evolution in Ipomoea purpurea, an agricultural weed that is resistant to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in current-day agriculture. We found striking reductions in allelic diversity between cohorts sampled nine years apart (2003 vs. 2012), suggesting that populations of this species sampled from agricultural fields have experienced genetic bottleneck events that have led to lower neutral genetic diversity. Heterozygosity excess tests indicate that these bottlenecks may have occurred prior to 2003. A greenhouse assay of individuals sampled from the field as seed found that populations of this species, on average, exhibited modest increases in herbicide resistance over time. However, populations differed significantly between sampling years for resistance: some populations maintained high resistance between the sampling years whereas others exhibited increased or decreased resistance. Our results show that populations of this noxious weed, capable of adapting to strong selection imparted by herbicide application, may lose genetic variation as a result of this or other environmental factors. We probably uncovered only modest increases in resistance on average between sampling cohorts due to a strong and previously identified fitness cost of resistance in this species, along with the potential that nonresistant migrants germinate from the seed bank.																	0962-1083	1365-294X				SEP	2016	25	18					4508	4520		10.1111/mec.13737							WOS:000383344400008	27357067

Environmental signals first impact with the seed at the seed coat. To investigate whether seed coats have a role in environmental sensing we investigated their ultraweak photon emission (UPE) under the variable temperature, relative humidity and oxygen conditions they could experience in the soil seed bank. Using a custom-built luminometer we measured UPE intensity and spectra (300-700 nm) from Phaseolus vulgaris seeds, seed coats and cotyledons. UPE was greatest from the internal surface of the seed coat. Seed coat UPE increased concomitantly with both increasing temperature and decreasing relative humidity. Emission was oxygen dependent and it was abolished by treatment with dinitrophenylhydrazine, demonstrating the key role of seed coat carbonyls in the phenomenon. We hypothesize that beneath the soil surface the attenuation of light (virtual darkness: low background noise) enables seeds to exploit UPE for transducing key environmental variables in the soil (temperature, humidity and oxygen) to inform them of seasonal and local temperature patterns. Overall, seed coats were found to have potential as effective transducers of key fluctuating environmental variables in the soil.

However, we observed a lack of information about the relationship between seed anatomy and seed morphology and its ecological implications. To fill this gap, we linked the anatomical features of diaspore coverings to morphological characteristics of free seeds and one-seeded fruits. We predicted that: (1) the thickness and anatomical complexity of seed coat and pericarp are related to diaspore size and shape; and (2) the presence or absence of the pericarp may influence seed-coat thickness and anatomy. In our study we investigated diaspores of 39 central-eastern European herbaceous species and recorded the thickness and anatomical complexity of their seed coverings, and we determined diaspore mass and shape. Our results indicate that diaspore mass is positively related to covering thickness, lignification degree and anatomical complexity. This might be the case because bigger diaspores tend to remain on the soil surface and are more exposed to predation risk and environmental threat than smaller diaspores. Furthermore, more round-shaped diaspores had disproportionately thicker and more lignified coverings than long or flat ones, probably because round-shaped diaspores much more frequently form seed banks and therefore persist for a long time in the soil. We also found that free seeds as diaspores have a thicker and more lignified seed coat than seeds enclosed in fruits. In one-seeded fruits, the pericarp takes the protective role', it is thick, and the seed coat is poorly developed.

J	Awan, TH; Chauhan, BS				Awan, Tahir Hussain; Chauhan, Bhagirath Singh			Effect of emergence time, inter- and intra-specific competition on growth and fecundity of Echinochloa crus-galli in dry-seeded rice	CROP PROTECTION												Since 2005, the evolution and spread of herbicide-resistant Echinochloa crus-galli biotypes have posed a serious threat to crop production in the Philippines. A comprehensive knowledge of E. crus-galli ecology and fecundity is fundamental in managing different biotypes of this weed. It was hypothesized that (a) high weed plant density produces more biomass and fertile seeds per unit area, (b) rice interference reduces the biomass and fecundity of the weed, and (c) a delay in weed emergence reduces the soil seed bank. In 2013, experiments were conducted in the wet season (WS) and dry season (DS), to understand the effect of E. crus-galli densities (40 and 80 plants m(-2)) on its growth, survival, and fecundity, with varying emergence times of 2, 15, 30, and 45 d after rice emergence (DARE). Relative to the weed plants grown without rice interference, E. crus-galli growth and seed production was lower in the presence of rice. Percent survival and plant height of E. crus-galli declined in a linear manner in the DS, and declined in a quadratic manner in the WS. Tiller number, inflorescence number, inflorescence biomass, and shoot biomass per plant declined in an exponential manner, with a delay in emergence of each cohort relative to rice. Across rice seeding rate, weed density, and emergence time, there was a linear relationship (y = 110x - 272 in the DS and y = 100x - 220 in the WS) between E. crus-galli shoot biomass and the number of seeds plant(-1). Relative to the late-emerging weed cohorts, E. crus-galli seed production (1320-1579 seeds plant(-1)), 1000-seed weight (2.2-2.9 g), and seed yield (2808-2334 kg ha(-1)) were higher when seedlings emerged with the crop (2 DARE). None of the seedlings that emerged 45 DARE produced viable seeds. Seed germination of the first two cohorts (2 and 15 DARE) ranged from 84 to 91%. The delay in emergence of E. crus-galli beyond 30 DARE reduced the percentage of germinable and viable seeds, and increased the percentage of non-viable seeds produced plant(-1). The results suggest that cultural weed management approaches that delay the emergence of E. crus-galli can reduce weed biomass and seed production, and is thus valuable for preventing seed rain to the seed bank by noxious weed biotypes in the field.

It is reported to the dug region the Penthorum chinense populations which is the threatened species the restored in 2001. Digging is done from 2000 to 2010 every year. Therefore, we investigated P. chinesne population of which extent to which region grew. As a result, it was shown some the growth of the plant of 200 individuals in the 2002 digging region, 4000 individuals in the 2001 digging region and 1000 individuals in the 2000 digging region, and so on. Though it is thought that the population formed in 2000 is seed bank origin, whether the populations formed in 2001 and later the burial seed origin or formed with the seed of an existing population, it is uncertain. Then we sampled 8 populations of the species form these areas, and studied them for allelic variation at 16 enzyme loci. There was no significant correlation between the actual population size and genetic diversity parameters, suggesting that the effective population size was very small even for the large populations. However, population that restored at the riverbed and population that approved on the embankment were able to distinguish obviously in the populations that had been approved in 2002. As for the population approved to the embankment, it was shown that genetic variation was very high in the population approved to the riverbed thought it was hardly admitted.

DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM regulates germination and maintains genome stability in seeds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Genome integrity is crucial for cellular survival and the faithful transmission of genetic information. The eukaryotic cellular response to DNA damage is orchestrated by the DNA damage checkpoint kinases ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM) and ATM AND RAD3-RELATED (ATR). Here we identify important physiological roles for these sensor kinases in control of seed germination. We demonstrate that double-strand breaks (DSBs) are rate-limiting for germination. We identify that desiccation tolerant seeds exhibit a striking transcriptional DSB damage response during germination, indicative of high levels of genotoxic stress, which is induced following maturation drying and quiescence. Mutant atr and atm seeds are highly resistant to aging, establishing ATM and ATR as determinants of seed viability. In response to aging, ATM delays germination, whereas atm mutant seeds germinate with extensive chromosomal abnormalities. This identifies ATM as a major factor that controls germination in aged seeds, integrating progression through germination with surveillance of genome integrity. Mechanistically, ATM functions through control of DNA replication in imbibing seeds. ATM signaling is mediated by transcriptional control of the cell cycle inhibitor SIAMESE-RELATED 5, an essential factor required for the aging-induced delay to germination. In the soil seed bank, seeds exhibit increased transcript levels of ATM and ATR, with changes in dormancy and germination potential modulated by environmental signals, including temperature and soil moisture. Collectively, our findings reveal physiological functions for these sensor kinases in linking genome integrity to germination, thereby influencing seed quality, crucial for plant survival in the natural environment and sustainable crop production.

Recommendations on Prosopis juliflora management in Afar, Ethiopia, from an interdisciplinary perspective	PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE												As one of the most invasive species of arid and semi-arid areas of East Africa, Prosopis juliflora has become a major threat to livelihoods of the Afar pastoral people and to the fragile ecosystems they live in. This paper comprises results from a multidisciplinary study on the spread of P. juliflora as an invasive species in the Ethiopian Afar Region and provides suggestions on its management and control. The study investigated spread of P. juliflora, ecological aspects (shifts in vegetation biomass and soil properties) and socio-economic aspects (livelihood impacts, management activities and potential) of P. juliflora invasion. Ecological methods included conducting destructive harvesting on vegetation; soil analyses and a soil seed bank assessment as well as using allometric equations to estimate the biomass and carbon contents of P. juliflora. Socio-economic data was collected based a survey of 490 pastoral households including 213 from Amibara, 177 from Gewane and 100 from Awash Fentale. Stated and revealed preference methods (RPM) were used because impacts of P. juliflora are both tangible and intangible. The study found that wetlands (flood plains in the Awash Basin) are highly susceptible to Prosopis invasion relative to drylands. Clearing invaded land and continuously using it for crop farming would reduce the invasion. The study also found that the available nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in the soil were high in highly invaded areas compared to less or non-invaded sites. However, the basal cover of native herbaceous vegetation and native tree diversity were found to be much reduced under high P. juliflora-invaded areas. Results from economic analyses also reveal that the benefits of the P. juliflora invasion in the Afar region are higher than the costs. However, some aspects such as increased risk of erosion, the impact of P. juliflora on the water table and long-term ecological changes were not examined, thus making the total economic valuation incomplete. Nonetheless, the study has captured most aspects of P. juliflora invasion in the Afar region and concludes that sustainable management and control of P. juliflora in the Afar region may be a better solution than eradication.																	2041-7136					AUG 19	2016	6								UNSP 14	10.1186/s13570-016-0061-1							WOS:000385957100001

Striga Biocontrol on a Toothpick: A Readily Deployable and Inexpensive Method for Smallholder Farmers	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Striga hermonthica (witchweed) is a parasitic weed that attacks and significantly reduces the yields of maize, sorghum, millet, and sugarcane throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Low cost management methods such as hand weeding, short crop rotations, trap cropping, or conventional biocontrol have not been effective. Likewise, Striga-tolerant or herbicide resistant maize cultivars are higher yielding, but are often beyond the economic means of sustenance farmers. The fungal pathogen. Fusanum oxysporum f.sp. strigae, has been the object of numerous studies to develop Striga biocontrol. Under experimental conditions this pathogen can reduce the incidence of Striga infestation but field use is not extensive, perhaps because it has not been sufficiently effective in restoring crop yield and reducing the soil Striga seed bank. Here we brought together Kenyan and US crop scientists with smallholder farmers to develop and validate an effective biocontrol strategy for management of Striga on smallholder farms. Key components of this research project were the following: (1) Development of a two-step method of fungal delivery, including laboratory coating of primary inoculum on toothpicks, followed by on-farm production of secondary field inoculum in boiled rice enabling delivery of vigorous, fresh inoculum directly to the seedbed; (2) Training of smallholder farmers (85% women), to produce the biocontrol agent and incorporate it into their maize plantings in Striga-infested soils and collect agronomic data. The field tests expanded from 30 smallholder farmers to a two-season, 500-farmer plot trial including paired plus and minus biocontrol plots with fertilizer and hybrid seed in both plots and; (3) Concerted selection of variants of the pathogen identified for enhanced virulence, as has been demonstrated in other host parasite systems were employed here on Striga via pathogen excretion of the amino acids L-leucine and L-tyrosine that are toxic to Striga but innocuous to maize. This overall strategy resulted in an average of >50% increased maize yield in the March to June rains season and >40% in the September to December rains season. Integration of this enhanced plant pathogen to Striga management in maize can significantly increase the maize yield of smallholder farmers in Kenya.																	1664-462X					AUG 8	2016	7								1121	10.3389/fpls.2016.01121							WOS:000380922900001	27551284

Temperature effects on Acrocomia aculeata seeds provide insights into overcoming dormancy in neotropical savanna palms	FLORA												Seed tolerance to the elevated temperatures of soils during the spring/summer seasons or due to the passage of fire is an important adaptation for Cerrado (neotropical savanna) seeds. The present work evaluated the influence of elevated temperatures on the seed viability and germination of the palm tree Acrocomia aculeata. The seeds were immersed in water at 70 degrees C (thermal shock) for 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 300, 420 and 600 s. In another experiment, seeds were maintained in dry (heat treatment) or moist (stratification) conditions, at temperatures of 35, 40, 20/30, 18/35 degrees C, or at room temperature (mean 22 degrees C) for 15, 30 or 60 days. The effects of these treatments on embryo viability as well as on seed germination were evaluated. Embryo survival was high until 300 s of exposure to thermal shock; high mortality was observed with longer exposures. Thermal shocks did not stimulate seed germination, and high rates of seed deterioration were observed with exposure to high temperature for 300 s or more. Heat treatments, at any temperature, did not stimulate germination, while stratification at 35 degrees C for 30 and 60 days resulted in increased germination (13 and 25% respectively). The temperature of 40 degrees C, in both dry and moist conditions, resulted in the loss of embryo viability. Acrocomia aculeata seeds have a considerable tolerance to high temperatures; furthermore, stratification at 35 degrees C is probably important in overcoming seed dormancy in soil seed banks and constitutes a successful propagation method for the species.

This article investigates the role of smoke in the comparative germination ecology of five Helianthemum taxa. Laboratory germination experiments were conducted using seeds collected in the field and stored in a seed bank. All seeds were mechanically scarified prior to testing. Various pre-treatments with smoke solutions and gibberellins were applied, and seeds were incubated in three germination temperature regimes (30/20 degrees C, 22/12 degrees C, 14/4 degrees C). In H. cantabricum, H. nummularium, H. oelandicum and H. urrielense germination was very high at the three temperatures, and no effect of smoke was detected. In H. tinetense germination was generally poor and a significant effect of smoke was found, but the effect size was small. The thermal niche of Helianthemum appears to follow an opportunistic strategy, being limited only by physical dormancy at the time of dispersal. H. tinetense follows a more conservative strategy, with physiological dormancy retarding germination. In the Mediterranean basin and surrounding areas, smoke appears to be one of a multitude of environmental signals controlling germination. The smoke effect might be more relevant in certain species such as H. tinetense. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Rebele, F; Lehmann, C				Rebele, Franz; Lehmann, Cornelia			Twenty years of woodland establishment through natural succession on a sandy landfill site in Berlin, Germany	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												This case study investigates natural colonization and woodland establishment over twenty years after beginning on bare ground on a sandy landfill site at Berlin-Malchow. The landfill, 6 ha in extent, was capped with an N-poor, but Ca-rich, mineral soil from a construction site nearby. This deposited soil originated from deep horizons and therefore contained no seed bank. The focus of the paper concentrates on woody species, due to their dominant role during succession. A total of 35 tree species colonized the landfill within twenty years which represent more than 60% of the native and introduced naturalized tree flora of the region. The first colonizers and the dominant tree species were willows and poplars, especially Salix x rubens Schrank. Most tree species arrived within the first 6 years and built a tree layer >5 m in height within the first decade. After 20 years of succession, mean species density from three 10 m x 20 m sample plots was 58 +/- 10.6 species/200 m(2). Nearly half of the species were woody species (20 +/- 3.6 tree species and 6 +/- 1.0 shrub species). Mean total cover of the tree layer was 78.3 +/- 2.9%, and mean height was 13.3 +/- 1.5 m. Mean basal area of trees >7 cm DBH (in total 2500 +/- 391 stems/ha) was 28.25 +/- 3.9 m(2)/ha. The herb layer was dominated by perennial grasses, especially Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth. The processes of colonization and succession on the landfill site show that effects of contingency, such as surrounding vegetation, year effects and priority effects act as drivers of vegetation dynamics. The N-poor substrate and the lack of a soil seed bank were no obstacles to the establishment of a woody vegetation cover in a relatively short time. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Despite growing recognition of the importance of water regimes in the regulation of plant growth and distribution, which components of water regimes that determine plant growth are not well known. To identify the causative components, 72 ramets of Carex brevicuspis were grown under six different water regime treatments (treatment A: constant 0 cm water level; treatment B: constant 30 cm water level; treatment C: 0 cm water level to 30 cm water level for 30 days, repeated 2 times; treatment D: 30 cm water level to 0 cm water level for 30 days, repeated 2 times; treatment E: 0 cm water level to 30 cm water level for 5 days, repeated 12 times; and treatment F: 30 cm water level to 0 cm water level for 5 days, repeated 12 times). Biomass accumulation, below: above ground biomass ratio, number of ramets, and proportions of spreading and clumping ramet were assessed. Biomass accumulation decreased only in relation to length of flooding. The highest biomass accumulation occurred in the 120-day. 0 cm water level treatment, it was intermediate in the four 60 day. 30 cm water level treatments, and lowest in the 120 day. 30 cm water level treatment. Likewise, the below: above ground ratio decreased only with increasing length of flooding. Ramet number was highest in the 120 day. 0 cm water level treatment, intermediate in the four 60 day. 30 cm water level treatments, and lowest in the 120 day. 30 cm water level treatment. The proportion of spreading ramets increased from 28.0% in the 120 day. 0 cm water level treatment to 76.4% in the 120 day. 30 cm water level treatment. These data suggest that the growth of C. brevicuspis was only limited by the duration of flooding. Reduction of the below: above ground ratio and change from phalanx to guerrilla growth form are effective strategies for C. brevicuspis to acclimate to flooding stress, because they allow the plant to grow above the water surface and escape from anoxic conditions. Our study provides experimental information on the role of different components of water regimes in regulating plant growth, and may assist in protection and restoration of the C. brevicuspis community.																	0107-055X	1756-1051				AUG	2016	34	4					435	441		10.1111/njb.00946							WOS:000383598600011

It is still unclear how these organisms colonize geographically distant hydrothermal environments. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, we compare the bacterial communities of sixteen Atlantic hydrothermal vent samples with our own and publicly available global open ocean samples. Analysing sequences obtained from 63 million 16S rRNA genes, the genera we could identify in the open ocean waters contained 99.9% of the vent reads. This suggests that previously observed vent exclusiveness is, in most cases, probably an artefact of lower sequencing depth. These findings are a further step towards elucidating the role of the open ocean as a seed bank. They can explain the predicament of how species expected to be endemic to vent systems are able to colonize geographically distant hydrothermal habitats and contribute to our understanding of whether 'everything is really everywhere'.

J	Kistenmacher, M; Gibson, JP				Kistenmacher, Michael; Gibson, J. Phil			Bet-hedging against larval herbivory and seed bank mortality in the evolution of heterocarpy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Bet-hedging strategies maximize long-term geometric fitness at the cost of reduced arithmetic fitness by off setting different mortality risks. Heterocarpic systems accomplish bet-hedging through the production of two or more fruit types that vary in dormancy and dispersal ability. It is unknown whether heterocarpy also off sets predispersal mortality risks. To address this question, we investigated whether heterocarpy in Grindelia ciliata (Asteraceae) also off sets mortality risks posed by a seed predator Schinia mortua (Noctuidae) to increase plant fitness. METHODS: We conducted two manipulative experiments to quantify critical life history components of this plant-insect interaction. We measured predispersal achene mortality from herbivory, postdispersal achene mortality in the seed bank, and seedling emergence. These measurements were then used in deterministic models to evaluate evolutionary consequences of predispersal seed mortality in G. ciliata. KEY RESULTS: Dormant achene types were less vulnerable to herbivory but more susceptible to mortality in the seed bank due to delayed seed emergence. Nondormant achene types experienced high predispersal mortality but low seed bank mortality due to rapid germination. Our herbivore-dependent model improved fit between observed and expected proportions of dormant and nondormant G. ciliata achenes and showed that heterocarpy could evolve in the absence of postgermination mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides empirical support of how predispersal herbivory can be equally important to postdispersal seed mortality risks in the evolution and maintenance of a heterocarpic reproductive system and expands understanding of how bet-hedging theory can be used to understand this unique reproductive strategy.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				AUG	2016	103	8					1383	1395		10.3732/ajb.1600078							WOS:000382167600002	27507839

We investigated its germination ecophysiology with the main aim of evaluating seed germination behaviour under controlled and natural conditions. Seeds from four natural sites were tested for germination requirements under a range of different temperatures, and by comparing the results with those obtained under both cold stratification at 5 degrees C and treatment with GA(3). We simultaneously carried out germination tests at each collecting site, and soil temperatures were recorded. Our results indicate that germination under controlled conditions is limited by high temperatures (25 degrees C), below which GA(3) has a remarkable effect on germination percentages. Cold stratification did not have an influence on the germination response, thus suggesting that a temperature of 5 degrees C is not sufficient to break seed dormancy; this result was supported by soil temperatures. Gentiana lutea created a short-term persistent seed bank, and seeds mainly germinated in their first year. The germination under controlled conditions was similar in all accessions, while different responses were found in the field, where a potential influence of the aspect was observed. These findings underscore the importance of understanding germination behaviour in the field to define the real thermal requirements of a taxon.

Deterministic and stochastic processes lead to divergence in plant communities 25 years after the 1988 Yellowstone fires	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Young, recently burned forests are increasingly widespread throughout western North America, but forest development after large wildfires is not fully understood, especially regarding effects of variable burn severity, environmental heterogeneity, and changes in drivers over time. We followed development of subalpine forests after the 1988 Yellowstone fires by periodically resampling permanent plots established soon after the fires. We asked two questions about patterns and processes over the past 25 years: (1) Are plant species richness and community composition converging or diverging across variation in elevation, soils, burn -severity, and post-fire lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) density? (2) What are the major controls on post-fire species composition, and has the relative importance of controls changed over time? For question 1, we sampled 10-m(2) plots (n = 552) distributed among three geographic areas that differ in elevation and substrate; plots spanned the spectrum of fire severities and were resampled periodically from 1991 to 2013. For question 2, we sampled 0.25--ha plots (n = 72), broadly distributed across areas that burned as stand-replacing fire, in 1999 and 2012. Richness and species composition diverged early on between infertile low-elevation areas (lower richness) and more fertile high-elevation areas (greater richness). Richness increased rapidly for the first 5 yr post-fire, then leveled off or increased only slowly thereafter. Only 6% of 227 recorded species were nonnative. Some annuals and species with heat-stimulated soil seed banks were associated with severely burned sites. However, most post-fire species had been present before the fire; many survived as roots or rhizomes and regenerated rapidly by sprouting. Among the 72 plots, substrate, temperature, and precipitation (the abiotic template) were consistently important drivers of community composition in 1999 and 2012. Post-fire lodgepole pine abundance was not significant in 1999 but was the most important driving variable by 2012, with a negative effect on presence of most understory species, especially annuals and shade-intolerant herbs. Burn severity was significant in 1999 but not in 2012, and distance to unburned forest had no influence in either year. The 1988 fires did not fundamentally alter subalpine forest community assemblages in Yellowstone, and ecological memory conferred resilience to high-severity fire.

Influence of different soil management practices on ground-flora vegetation in an almond orchard	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS												This paper reports a survey on the weed flora and seed bank in an almond orchard sited in Apulia region (Southern Italy), where the following soil management practices have been compared for over 30 yrs: no-tillage, keeping the soil totally weed-free throughout the year by using pre-emergence herbicides to prevent plant emergence or post-emergence herbicides in case of weeds already emerged; no-tillage, with post-emergence herbicides; no-tillage, with mowing of natural weed flora in spring; cover cropping, with faba bean sown in November and green manured in springtime; conventional soil tillage. The different management techniques influenced significantly the weed flora in experimental plots, both in terms of quantity and quality. The seed bank was clearly impoverished after the long-term applications of pre-emergence herbicides, both in terms of richness and of diversity. During the fall period, the plots of conventional tillage or pre-emergence herbicides had less natural ground-flora than the others. During springtime, prior to the sward control practices, the plots treated by foliar herbicides or mowing had the highest total weed cover. We conclude that post-emergence weed control by mowing or using chemical herbicides or the green manure of the cover crop may be proposed to reduce impact to the soil and to promote the growth of abundant and sufficiently diversified and balanced flora. If appropriately managed, this flora can provide potential ecological services, without competing with the orchard, as suggested by the literature. During the autumn, natural flora can uptake soil nitrogen thus preventing leaching in the rainy season. In springtime, after the sward has been destroyed, natural flora can supply a substantial amount of biomass to the soil. Indicator species analysis was also used to find the species characterizing each treatment and some of their combinations. Weeds belonging to the Poaceae botanical family were significantly associated with post-emergence herbicides and mowing treatments. These species produce a substantial amount of biomass and have bunched roots; consequently, they supply beneficial effects by improving porosity and structure of the soil and reducing erosion hazard.

J	Varma, V; Iyengar, SB; Sankaran, M				Varma, Varun; Iyengar, Siddharth B.; Sankaran, Mahesh			Effects of nutrient addition and soil drainage on germination of N-fixing and non-N-fixing tropical dry forest tree species	PLANT ECOLOGY												To develop generalised predictions regarding the effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition on vegetation communities, it is necessary to account for the impacts of increased nutrient availability on the early life history stages of plants. Additionally, it is important to determine if these responses (a) differ between plant functional groups and (b) are modulated by soil drainage, which may affect the persistence of added nutrients. We experimentally assessed seed germination responses (germination proportion and germination energy, i.e. time to germination) of commonly occurring N-fixing and non-N-fixing tropical dry forest tree species found in India to simulated N and P deposition in well-drained soils, as well as soils with impeded drainage. When soils were not allowed to drain, germination proportion declined with nutrient addition, while germination energy remained unchanged. Stronger declines in germination proportion were observed for N-fixing species. In free-draining soils, nutrient addition did not affect germination proportion in either functional group. However, we detected a trend of delayed germination with nutrient addition, especially in N-fixers. Our results suggest that nutrient deposition can lead to potential shifts in functional dominance and tree community composition of tropical dry forests in the long term through its effects on early life stages of trees, although the mechanisms underlying the observed germination responses remain unclear. Further, such effects are likely to be spatially variable across the geographic range in which tropical dry forests occur depending on soil drainage properties.

Effects of salinity and flooding on post-hurricane regeneration potential in coastal wetland vegetation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												REMISE OF THE STUDY: The nature of regeneration dynamics after hurricane flooding and salinity intrusion may play an important role in shaping coastal vegetation patterns. METHODS: The regeneration potentials of coastal species, types and gradients (wetland types from seaward to landward) were studied on the Delmarva Peninsula after Hurricane Sandy using seed bank assays to examine responses to various water regimes (unflooded and flooded to 8 cm) and salinity levels (0, 1, and 5 ppt). Seed bank responses to treatments were compared using a generalized linear models approach. Species relationships to treatment and geographical variables were explored using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. KEY RESULTS: Flooding and salinity treatments affected species richness even at low salinity levels (1 and 5 ppt). Maritime forest was especially intolerant of salinity intrusion so that species richness was much higher in unflooded and low salinity conditions, despite the proximity of maritime forest to saltmarsh along the coastal gradient. Other vegetation types were also affected, with potential regeneration of these species affected in various ways by flooding and salinity, suggesting relationships to post-hurricane environment and geographic position. CONCLUSIONS: Seed germination and subsequent seedling growth in coastal wetlands may in some cases be affected by salinity intrusion events even at low salinity levels (1 and 5 ppt). These results indicate that the potential is great for hurricanes to shift vegetation type in sensitive wetland types (e.g., maritime forest) if post-hurricane environments do not support the regeneration of extent vegetation.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				AUG	2016	103	8					1420	1435		10.3732/ajb.1600062							WOS:000382167600005	27539261

Evaluation of non-native species policy development and implementation within the Antarctic Treaty area	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Antarctic non-native species legislation is contained within the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, with 2016 marking the 25th anniversary of its adoption. We take this opportunity to evaluate the Antarctic Treaty signatory Parties' collective development and implementation of non-native species policy. In general, scientific and policy outputs have increased in the past decade. However, data detailing Parties' current implementation of biosecurity practices are not readily available. Little widespread, internationally coordinated or systematic monitoring of non-native species establishment has occurred, but available data suggest that establishment of non-native micro-invertebrates may be greatly underestimated. Several recent small-scale plant eradications have been successful, although larger-scale eradications present a greater challenge due to seed bank formation. Invertebrate establishment within research station buildings presents an increasing problem, with mixed eradication success to date. The opportunity now exists to build on earlier successes, such as the 'CEP Non-native Species Manual', towards the development of a comprehensive response strategy based upon the principles of prevention, monitoring and response, and applicable to all Antarctic environments. To help facilitate this we identify areas requiring further research and policy development, such as to reduce anthropogenic transfer of indigenous Antarctic species between distinct biogeographic regions, avoid microbial contamination of pristine areas and limit introduction of non-native marine species. A response protocol is proposed for use following the discovery of a potential non-native species within the Antarctica Treaty area, which includes recommendations concerning Parties' initial response and any subsequent eradication or control measures.

J	Stevens, CJ				Stevens, Carly J.			How long do ecosystems take to recover from atmospheric nitrogen deposition?	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is a considerable threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function globally. Many experimental N additions and studies using gradients of ambient deposition have demonstrated impacts on plant species richness, diversity and composition in a broad range of habitats together with changes in soil biogeochemistry. In the last two decades levels of N deposition have begun to decline in some parts of Europe but it is currently difficult to assess the extent to which reductions in N deposition will result in recovery within semi natural habitats. There have been a number of investigations using the cessation of N additions in long-term experiments, monitoring in areas where ambient deposition has declined, transplants to situations with lower N inputs and roof experiments where rain is collected and cleaned. This review collates evidence from experiments in grasslands, forests, heathlands and wetlands where N additions have ceased or where N inputs have been reduced to assess how likely it is that habitats will recover from N deposition. The results of the majority of studies suggest that vegetation species composition, below-ground communities and soil processes may be slow to recover whereas some soil variables, such as nitrate and ammonium concentrations, can respond relatively rapidly to reductions in N inputs. There are a number of barriers to recovery such as continued critical load exceedance and lack of seed bank or local seed source, and, there is the potential for vegetation communities to reach an alternative stable state where species lost as a consequence of changes due to N deposition may not be able to recolonise. In these cases only active restoration efforts can restore damaged habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seed Selection by the Harvester Ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Coastal Sage Scrub: Interactions With Invasive Plant Species	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Harvester ants can be the dominant seed predators on plants by collecting and eating seeds and are known to influence plant communities. Harvester ants are abundant in coastal sage scrub (CSS), and CSS is frequently invaded by several exotic plant species. This study used observations of foraging and cafeteria-style experiments to test for seed species selection by the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus Emery (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in CSS. Analysis of foraging behavior showed that P. rugosus carried seeds of exotic Erodium cicutarium (L.) and exotic Brassica tournefortii (Gouan) on 85 and 15% of return trips to the nest (respectively), and only a very few ants carried the native seeds found within the study areas. When compared with the availability of seeds in the field, P. rugosus selected exotic E. cicutarium and avoided both native Encelia farinosa (Torrey & A. Gray) and exotic B. tournefortii. Foraging by P. rugosus had no major effect on the seed bank in the field. Cafeteria-style experiments confirmed that P. rugosus selected E. cicutarium over other available seeds. Native Eriogonum fasciculatum (Bentham) seeds were even less selected than E. farinosa and B. tournefortii.

Plant recruitment from the soil seed bank depends on topsoil stockpile age, height, and storage history in an arid environment	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The topsoil native seed bank is a valuable resource in post-mining rehabilitation capable of providing a cost-effective means for restoring plant diversity. However, the value of the native soil seed bank is affected by topsoil management practices especially long-term stockpiling. Salvaged topsoil is usually stockpiled until mining operations are completed and landforming has been performed. This study compared the germinable soil seed bank of freshly harvested topsoil against the effects of stockpile age (stored for 1 and 3 years) and depth (top and bottom 50 cm of 2-m-high stockpiles). Total native seedling emergence was greater from the 1-year-old stockpile but was dominated by annuals including species commonly found on disturbed sites. Seedling emergence of perennial species was more than 4-fold greater in fresh topsoil than in the 1-year-old stockpiles, and 2-fold greater than the bottom 50 cm of 3-year-old stockpiles, with no difference in the top 50 cm of the 3-year-old stockpiles. Although there was no difference in total emergence between the top and bottom of stockpiled topsoil, there was greater emergence of the ecologically important Triodia grass genus from the top than bottom of 3-year-old stockpiles. Species composition of the seed bank in the 1-year-old stockpile was different to fresh topsoil and the 3-year-old stockpile possibly reflecting differences in species composition of vegetation present when topsoil was initially salvaged for stockpiling, confounding comparisons between years. This study demonstrates the importance of conducting soil seed bank analysis of stockpiled topsoil to be used in restoration programs.

Management of weed emergence and weed seed bank in response to different tillage, cropping systems and selected soil properties	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The agronomic practices used to manage the soil play an important role in the maintenance of biological diversity within crop fields. Conservation agriculture technology has been extensively adopted in dry land conditions. In these systems, the relationship between soil properties and weed density and soil weed seed bank has not been explored deeply. We conducted this study in order to: (1) examine the cumulative impact of tillage systems (CT, MT and NT) on weed emergence on the field; (2) test the effects of different tillage and crop systems on weed species density and diversity (Shannon's index, Pielou index and species richness) within the transient and persistent seed bank of the soil; and (3) analyse the impact of two soil parameters on weeds: water stable aggregates (WSA) and particulate organic matter content (C-POM). The highest weed density was recorded in conservation tillage systems (MT and/or NT) several years after the implementation of these systems. Additionally, the cumulative effects of conservation tillage techniques were found to have increased the seed density and species diversity in soil seed bank, which was probably due to particular conditions created in the soil; a low or negligible level of soil disturbance (as is expected with MT and NT) possibly allowed seeds to keep in the soil seed bank and remain dormant, due to, among other reasons, improved water stable aggregates and organic matter content. Results from the study confirm the complexity of the matrix formed by weed-seed bank-soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Schemer, A; Melander, B; Kudsk, P				Schemer, Ananda; Melander, Bo; Kudsk, Per			Vertical distribution and composition of weed seeds within the plough layer after eleven years of contrasting crop rotation and tillage schemes	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Tillage methods and crop rotation are probably the two most important cropping factors affecting weed communities, particularly when herbicide use is restricted. This study examined weed dynamics following eleven years of different tillage and crop rotation treatments. The aboveground grass weed flora was recorded each year and the content and vertical location of individual weed seeds within the plough layer (0-20 cm) were determined after 11 years of continuous mouldboard ploughing (P), pre-sowing tine cultivation to 8-10 cm soil depth (H8-10) and direct drilling (D). The content of weed seeds, especially grass weeds, was determined for three distinct soil layers (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm), reflecting the cultivation depths of the tillage treatments. The annual grass weeds, Apera spica-venti and Vulpia myuros, were promoted by non-inversion tillage and in the case of V. myuros also by frequent cropping of winter cereals. The two non-inversion tillage treatments caused a strong stratification of weed seeds within the plough layer, with the majority of the seeds being accumulated in the upper soil layers, at 0-5 and 510 cm, and markedly less so in the 10-20 cm layer. Ploughing resulted in a more even distribution between the three layers. It is suggested that in cases where severe grass weed problems have built up in a non-inversion tillage system and where changes in crop rotation are ineffective or undesirable, inversion of the upper soil layer with the lower one could be considered a management option.

We attempted to exhaustively map this rare biosphere in two water samples by performing an exceptionally deep pyrosequencing analysis (similar to 500,000 final reads per sample). Species data were derived by a 97% identity criterion and various parametric distributions were fitted to the observed counts. Using the best-fitting Sichel distribution we estimate a total species richness of 1,568-1,669 (95% Credible Interval) and 5,027-5,196 for surface and deep water samples respectively, implying that 84-89% of the total richness in those two samples was sequenced, and we predict that a quadrupling of the present sequencing effort would suffice to observe 90% of the total richness in both samples. Comparing the HTS results with a culturing approach we found that most of the cultured taxa were not obtained by HTS, despite the high sequencing effort. Culturing therefore remains a useful tool for uncovering marine bacterial diversity, in addition to its other uses for studying the ecology of marine bacteria.

Understanding how dry and wet cycle events might influence the metabolic state of indigenous soil microbes is crucial for predicting forest soil responses to environmental change. We used 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR to address how present (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) soil bacterial communities might response to the changes in water availability across three different forest types located in two continents (Africa and Asia) under controlled drying and rewetting cycles. Sequencing of rRNA gene and transcript indicated that Proteobacteria. Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria were the most responsive phyla to changes in water availability. We defined the ratio of rRNA transcript to rRNA gene abundance as a key indicator of potential microbial activity and we found that this ratio was increased following soil dry-down process whereas it decreased after soil rewetting. Following rewetting Crenarchaeota-like 16S rRNA gene transcript increased in some forest soils and this was linked to increases in soil nitrate levels suggesting greater nitrification rates under higher soil water availability. Changes in the relative abundance of (1) different microbial phyla and classes, and (2) 16S and amoA genes were found to be site- and taxa-specific and might have been driven by different life-strategies. Overall, we found that, after rewetting, the structure of the present and potentially active bacterial community structure as well as the abundance of bacterial (16S), archaeal (16S) and ammonia oxidizers (amoA), all returned to pre-dry-down levels. This suggests that microbial taxa have the ability to recover from desiccation, a critical response, which will contribute to maintaining microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems under environmental perturbations, such as significant changes in water availability.

Pomel (branched broomrape) is a holoparasitic plant that reproduces on crops and also on weeds, which contributes to increase the parasite seed bank in fields. This parasite extracts all its nutrients at the host's expense so that host-parasite trophic relationships are crucial to determine host and parasite growth. This study quantified the intensity with which P ramosa draws assimilates from its host and analyzed whether it varied with host species, host phenological stage and host growth rate. A greenhouse experiment was conducted on three host species: the crop species Brassica napus (L.) (oilseed rape) and two weed species, Capsella bursapastoris (L.) Medik. and Geranium dissectum (L.). Plants were grown with or without P ramosa and under three light levels to modulate host growth rate. The proportion of host biomass loss due to parasitism by P ramosa differed between host species (at host fructification, biomass loss ranged from 34 to 84%). B. napus and C. bursa-pastoris displayed a similar response to P ramosa, probably because they belong to the same botanical family. The sensitivity to P ramosa in each host species could be related to the precocity of F? ramosa development on them. Host compartments could be ranked as a function of their sensitivity to parasitism, with the reproductive compartment being the most severely affected, followed by stems and roots. The proportion of biomass allocated to leaves was not reduced by parasitism. The proportion of pathosystem biomass allocated to the parasite depended on host species. It generally increased with host stage progression but was constant across light induced-host growth rate, showing that F? ramosa adapts its growth to host biomass production. The rank order of host species in terms of sink strength differed from that in terms of host sensitivity. Finally, for B. napus, the biomass of individual parasite shoots decreased with increasing their number per host plant, regardless of host growth rate. Results will be incorporated into a mechanistic model in order to analyze the effect of parasitic plant species on weed community assembly and to design new cropping systems for controlling P ramosa.

Too Many Is Too Bad: Long-Term Net Negative Effects of High Density Ungulate Populations on a Dominant Mediterranean Shrub	PLOS ONE												Plant-animal interactions imply costs and benefits with net balance depending on interacting species and ecological context. Ungulates, in particular, confer costs (e.g., plant leaf consumption, flower bud predation) and benefits (e.g., plant overcompensation, seed dispersal) to plants. Magnitude of costs and benefits may be altered by habitat management or ecological conditions favoring high density ungulate populations. Little is known however on whether plant costs or benefits predominate over the years, or the long-term outcomes of plant-animal interactions in habitat types sustaining high density ungulate populations. We investigated how high density ungulate populations alter plant costs and benefits by quantifying ungulate long-term effects on the shrub Cistus ladanifer (Cistaceae) individual size, seed weight and number, seed bank, and population density, through a 12-year ungulate exclusion experiment in a Mediterranean scrubland. We monitored plant size and flower buds in plants exposed or protected from ungulates and number of developed capsules and seeds consumed (potential seed dispersal) by ungulates during three reproductive seasons. We found that ungulates negatively affected shrub size and led to a dramatically decline of shrub reproductive structures and seed production, affecting the plant reproductive cycle. Number of buds was 27 times higher and number of developed seed 5 times higher in ungulate-excluded as compared to ungulate-exposed plots. After 9 years of ungulate exclusion, the C. ladanifer seed bank was 2.6 times higher in ungulate-excluded plots. The population density of C. ladanifer was 4 times higher in ungulate-excluded plots. Our long-term experiment showed that high density ungulate populations can alter plant-animal interactions by reducing plant benefits and increasing plant costs.

Mississippi River Plume Enriches Microbial Diversity in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The Mississippi River (MR) serves as the primary source of freshwater and nutrients to the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM). Whether this input of freshwater also enriches microbial diversity as the MR plume migrates and mixes with the nGOM serves as the central question addressed herein. Specifically, in this study physicochemical properties and planktonic microbial community composition and diversity was determined using iTag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in 23 samples collected along a salinity (and nutrient) gradient from the mouth of the MR, in the MR plume, in the canyon, at the Deepwater Horizon wellhead and out to the loop current. Analysis of these datasets revealed that the MR influenced microbial diversity as far offshore as the Deepwater Horizon wellhead. The MR had the highest microbial diversity, which decreased with increasing salinity. MR bacterioplankton communities were distinct compared to the nGOM, particularly in the surface where Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria dominated, while the deeper MR was also enriched in Thaumarchaeota. Statistical analyses revealed that nutrients input by the MR, along with salinity and depth, were the primary drivers in structuring the microbial communities. These results suggested that the reduced salinity, nutrient enriched MR plume could act as a seed bank for microbial diversity as it mixes with the nGOM. Whether introduced microorganisms are active at higher salinities than freshwater would determine if this seed bank for microbial diversity is ecologically significant. Alternatively, microorganisms that are physiologically restricted to freshwater habitats that are entrained in the plume could be used as tracers for freshwater input to the marine environment.

Therefore, an outdoor experiment was performed in Sweden in 2008, to evaluate the effect of root fragmentation on generative reproduction of S. arvensis. Two artificial populations of S. arvensis with the same total root length per area but with different initial root lengths and different numbers of root fragments were planted. Cumulative numbers of flower receptacles which had shed mature seeds over the season were assessed. Changes in the number of seeds per flower receptacle and average seed weight were monitored over time during the late season. Plants from long root fragments produced more flower receptacles than plants from short ones. Per area, however, the number of mature flower receptacles did not differ. The number of seeds per flower receptacle and individual seed weight were not affected by initial root length for the first cohort of shoots which sprouted from the initially planted roots. A second cohort, from roots produced during the season, resulted, irrespective of its initial root length, in fewer flower receptacles per plant and per area, with less seeds per receptacle, but with the same average seed weight as the first cohort. The number of seeds per flower receptacle was higher in mid-September than earlier or later. Average seed weight slightly decreased over time. The weight of seeds produced in early September was inversely related to the number of seeds per receptacle, but this trade-off disappeared over time. Root fragmentation alone in pure populations of S. arvensis does not impede generative reproduction, but is likely to decrease input of seeds to the seed bank, when combined with crop competition.																	0906-4710	1651-1913				JUL 3	2016	66	5					391	398		10.1080/09064710.2015.1134637							WOS:000373954400004

Kuntze, Blepharocalyx salicifolius (Kunth) O. Berg and Ilex paraguariensis A. St.Hil. in different environmental and disturbance conditions in the National Forest of Sao Francisco de Paula, RS state. Six conglomerates of one hectare were used, with 16 plots (20 x 20 m) each, where the species were sampled in three size classes. The size class II (SC II -diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 9.55 cm) was sampled in 96 plots, the SC I (4.8 <= DBH < 9.55 cm) in 36 subplots of 10 x 10 m, and the established natural regeneration (ENR) (1 <= DBH < 4.8 cm) in 36 cells of 3.16 x 3.16 m. The seedling bank (SB -height >= 30 cm and DBH < 1 cm), the seed rain (SR) and the soil seed bank (SSB) were sampled in all plots of 20 x 20 m. The data were analysed by taking into account all the different vegetation groups together and separately for each cluster identified in a previous study. For SC II, the frequency distribution of DBH was analysed combined with the analysis of absolute density and frequency for all life stages (SR, SSB, SB, ENR, SC I and SC II). The results indicated high variability in density of these species among the different life stages and environmental conditions. Araucaria angustifolia presented gaps in the regeneration process in areas that had low past disturbance, not showing the "reverse-J" distribution (SC II) and with lower regeneration capacity in relation to the other species (SR, SSB and SB). Ilex paraguariensis and Blepharocalyx salicifolius showed higher population stability in environment with low level of human interference (SC II). The first species demonstrated preference for soils with good drainage, while the second species for humid soils. Moreover, gaps in the regeneration process of different populations were detected, which changed according to environmental conditions and disturbance levels. Therefore, the results suggest the importance of taking into account the different vegetation groups, the species autecology and to apply possible interventions that aim to improve regeneration and balance the population dynamics of these species.

Seed banks are the most common method of ex situ conservation; however, coffee seeds can not be stored by conventional methods. Cryopreservation is a viable alternative for long-term conservation of species that produce intermediate or recalcitrant seeds, as coffee. The aim of this work was to cryopreserve Coffea arabica L. cv Catual Vermelho IAC 144 zygotic embryos, and analyse the effects of dehydration prior cryopreservation and osmotic rehydration after thawing, in embryos germination and seedlings formation after cryopreservation. Prior to cryopreservation, different dehydration times (0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min) were tested. Dehydrated embryos were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for 1 hour, and after thawing were rehydrated by osmotic solutions. Dehydrated and non-cryopreserved embryos were also analysed. The test with 2,3,5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was used to evaluate the embryos viability. Non-dehydrated embryos did not survive after freezing. Embryos that were dehydrated until 20% of the moisture content did not germinate when osmotic rehydration was not performed. In contrast, cryopreserved embryos with the same moisture content presented 98% germination when they were rehydrated slowly in osmotic solution. According to tetrazolium tests, embryos presented maximum viability (75%) after dehydration for 60 minutes (23% moisture content). Therefore, coffee zygotic embryos (Coffea arabica L. cv. Catual Vermelho) can be successfully cryopreserved using physical dehydration in silica gel for 60 minutes (23% moisture content), followed by osmotic rehydration after thawing. This method allowed a germination of 98% of cryopreserved zygotic embryos.

Dandy related to patch formation following feral swine rooting disturbance	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Understanding plant reproductive traits is important to discerning underlying mechanisms of patch formation by clonal plants after soil disturbance. Reproductive traits that are likely important to patch formation include regeneration ability of rhizomes, seed production and long-term germination ability, and seed presence in the seedbank. In this study, reproductive traits of the clonal plant Lachnanthes caroliniana (Lam.) Dandy that were dominating patches disturbed by feral swine were assessed. The study assessed the ability of rhizomes to resprout in relation to rhizome size (10 cm to 20 cm or 20 cm to 30 cm) and burial depth (buried or surficial). Field surveys were conducted in monocultures to measure the density of inflorescences and seed production. A seed germination and longevity growth chamber experiment was conducted to test the effect of moist or submersed conditions. Finally, a seed bank assay measured the field germination ability of L. caroliniana. Rhizomes had, on average, 81% survival rate and 100% buried rhizomes; rhizome size did not affect survival. Seed production was high with 126,579 seeds per m(2), but in the growth chamber germination was low (0.5%) and short-lived, with nearly all germinates occurring by 51 days and one germinant at 129 days. Only one seedling of L. caroliniana germinated from the seed bank of soil collected prior to the current year's seed rain, also supporting a short-lived seed bank, as suggested by the timeline of the seed germination study results. These results suggest that reproductive traits of rhizome resprouting and high production of seeds (approx. 600 germinants per m(2)) may give this species a competitive advantage to form dense patches following feral swine rooting disturbance. Since feral swine continuously return to patches of L. caroliniana, it is likely that this plant and other disturbance-adapted clonal species could increase at the landscape scale as feral swine populations continue to rapidly expand.

BANK OF WEED SEEDS IN AGROSYSTEMS IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO	PLANTA DANINHA												The seed bank is the reserve of viable seeds found in the soil and is related to diversity and abundance of species that make up the weed populations. This study aimed to determine the seed bank in four distinct environments (grazing area, area of vegetables, annual crop area and perennial crop area) in two seasons (rainy and dry season). To determine the seed bank, each environment was divided into four sub-areas of 0.2 hectares, considering that each area was a repetition, totaling 16 experimental units. Samples of 0.8 kg were taken from each area, and each sample was distributed on a plastic tray and allowed to germinate in a greenhouse. The density of the individuals was determined by observing the number of emerging seedlings in the trays, performing the counting at every 18 days. Evaluations were made for ninety days in each season. The germination curve was calculated, as well as the Shannon diversity index (H'), the Sorensen similarity index and the relative importance. The seven main species identified in the environments were Cyperus rotundus, Nicandra physaloides, Galinsoga parviflora, Alternanthera tenella, Panicum maximum, Portulaca oleracea and Eleusine indica. Among the studied environments, during the rainy season, the highest number of individuals was found in annual crop and the greatest diversity in the evergreen environment.

In Malaysia, a combination of agricultural practices such as direct seeding and shared use of machinery has contributed to the rapid proliferation of weedy rice across paddy fields in recent decades. Here, we report on the morphological characterization of weedy rice populations and inferred origin(s) of different morphotypes present in Peninsular Malaysia. Eight weedy rice morphotypes were distinguished based on a combination of traits such as awn presence/absence and hull color, from 193 accessions collected in 17 locations. Results showed a high proportion of awnless accessions (strawhull-, intermediate strawhull-, and brownhull-colored morphotypes, together composing 65% of sampled accessions), with awned accessions represented by strawhull, brownhull, and blackhull forms. Clustering and PCA analyses revealed four major clusters: (1) O. rufipogon and the majority of awned, blackhull, and brownhull-suggestive of a type of weedy rice originating from wild Oryza populations; (2) elite indica cultivar rice and the majority of strawhull weeds-supporting a previous proposal that weedy rice from Malaysia mainly evolved from indirect selection on cultivars for easy-shattering feral forms; (3) the majority of brownhull; and (4) a mixture of other weedy morphotypes-potentially reflecting multiple origins and subsequent admixture. The combination of key morphological descriptors will be useful for advising farmers appropriately in strategies for controlling the spread of weedy rice, including periodic manual weeding to reduce buildup of the seed bank in the fields.

The experiment was carried out in a soil classified as Red Nitosol. Seven different amounts of sugarcane straw soil cover were assessed (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 ha(-1)). SP83-2847 variety straw was used. The experiment was arranged in a randomized blocks design, with four replications. Each experimental unit contained three species, which were allocated in the center of each plot, sown at 1 cm depth in a demarcated area. Different amounts of straw were distributed in this area. The sowing rate was used in order to obtain 1200 plant m(-2). Two phases comprised the study. In the first phase, weeds emerged in sugarcane straw cover soil were assessed at 9, 12, 19, 34 and 43 days after sowing (DAS) and the second phase assessed plant emergence after straw removal, at 89, 130, 175, 196, 217 and 234 DAS. Seedlings that had over 1 cm shoot and were visible in all assessments were considered emerged. Soil cover sugarcane straw amount influenced the different species germination dynamics. In the first phase, species differential response was observed regarding used straw amount. In the second phase, after straw removal, there was higher germination for B. plantaginea and D. nuda, while P. maximum showed lower emergency, regardless of the used straw amount.

Dispersal by rodent caching increases seed survival in multiple ways in canopy-fire ecosystems	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Seed-caching rodents have long been seen as important actors in dispersal ecology. Here, we focus on the interactions with plants in a fire-disturbance community, specifically Arctostaphylos species (Ericaceae) in California chaparral. Although mutualistic relationships between caching rodents and plants are well studied, little is known how this type of relationship functions in a disturbance-driven system, and more specifically to systems shaped by fire disturbance. By burying seeds in the soil, rodents inadvertently improve the probability of seed surviving high temperatures produced by fire. We test two aspects of vertical dispersal, depth of seed and multiple seeds in caches as two important dimensions of rodent-caching behavior. We used a laboratory experimental approach to test seed survival under different heating conditions and seed bank structures. Creating a synthetic soil seed bank and synthetic fire/heating in the laboratory allowed us to have control over surface heating, depth of seed in the soil, and seed cache size. We compared the viability of Arctostaphylos viscida seeds from different treatment groups determined by these factors and found that, as expected, seeds slightly deeper in the soil had substantial increased chances of survival during a heating event. A key result was that some seeds within a cache in shallow soil could survive fire even at a depth with a killing heat pulse compared to isolated seeds; temperature measurements indicated lower temperatures immediately below caches compared to the same depth in adjacent soil. These results suggest seed caching by rodents increases seed survival during fire events in two ways, that caches disrupt heat flow or that caches are buried below the heat pulse kill zone. The context of natural disturbance drives the significance of this mutualism and further expands theory regarding mutualisms into the domain of disturbance-driven systems.																	2045-7758					JUL	2016	6	13					4298	4306		10.1002/ece3.2156							WOS:000379344400006	27386076

These hills are economically valuable mineral reserves; mining activities represent therefore a threat to the long-term persistence of these communities. Ex situ conservation program was set up by a mining company to rescue and conserve the diversity of Cu-Co communities until restoration activities are initiated. Two kinds of Cu-Co communities: the steppe and the steppic savanna, were translocated using topsoil spreading and whole-turf translocation. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of these two techniques in conserving Cu-Co communities and their potential use in future restoration programs. More than 2 years after the translocation, whole-turf translocation appeared to be the better technique for ex situ conservation of endemic Cu-Co species. Not only did whole-turf successfully translocate numerous target species that were not present in the topsoil areas, but it also resulted in fewer ruderal and non-target species compared to topsoil spreading. Topsoil spreading recorded low seedling emergence from seed bank due to large proportions of dormant seeds or the absence of a seed bank, especially for the steppic savanna. Restoration of the steppe is currently more successful than for steppic savanna where the lack of dominant and structuring species likely contributed to divergence in species composition compared to reference ecosystem. Our study stresses the fact that tropical old-growth grasslands, which require probably several centuries to assemble, are difficult to restore or translocate.

J	Zylka, JJ; Whelan, CJ; Molano-Flores, B				Zylka, Jason J.; Whelan, Christopher J.; Molano-Flores, Brenda			Restoration Implications of Land Management Legacy on Aboveground and Seed Bank Composition of North American Grasslands	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												A variety of nonprairie landscapes, including pastures, crop fields, and unmanaged seral ground, are being restored to native prairie on a yearly basis. Seldom is the seed bank associated with these nonprairie lands taken into account in the restoration process. We examine the seed bank potential of nonprairie lands and the relationship between aboveground vegetation and seed bank composition at the largest grassland restoration east of the Mississippi River, the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie (U.S.A.), by surveying six land management histories: remnant prairie, restored prairie, new pasture, active pasture, old field, and crop field. Both aboveground vegetation and seed bank composition varied with land management history. However, species composition of aboveground vegetation differed significantly from the species composition of the seed bank irrespective of land management history. Aboveground vegetation carried a higher proportion of the seed bank flora than vice versa. In contrast to seed banks of other types of grasslands, the seed bank of historical prairie lands in the U.S. Midwest, irrespective of subsequent land-use history, is not a viable source of species for restoration of tallgrass prairie. A deficiency of many species in the seed bank flora, coupled with an abundance of weedy, often nonnative species, limits the potential contribution of the seed bank to restoration of a prairie vegetation community. Nevertheless, seed bank studies can provide a cost effective method to detect problematic species (i.e., weedy and/or invasive species) and therefore provide a window into the restoration potential of nonprairie lands.

Seasonal determinations of algal virus decay rates reveal overwintering in a temperate freshwater pond	ISME JOURNAL												To address questions about algal virus persistence (i.e., continued existence) in the environment, rates of decay of infectivity for two viruses that infect Chlorella-like algae, ATCV-1 and CVM-1, and a virus that infects the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina parva, CpV-BQ1, were estimated from in situ incubations in a temperate, seasonally frozen pond. A series of experiments were conducted to estimate rates of decay of infectivity in all four seasons with incubations lasting 21 days in spring, summer and autumn, and 126 days in winter. Decay rates observed across this study were relatively low compared with previous estimates obtained for other algal viruses, and ranged from 0.012 to 11% h(-1). Overall, the virus CpV-BQ1 decayed most rapidly whereas ATCV-1 decayed most slowly, but for all viruses the highest decay rates were observed during the summer and the lowest were observed during the winter. Furthermore, the winter incubations revealed the ability of each virus to overwinter under ice as ATCV-1, CVM-1 and CpV-BQ1 retained up to 48%, 19% and 9% of their infectivity after 126 days, respectively. The observed resilience of algal viruses in a seasonally frozen freshwater pond provides a mechanism that can support the maintenance of viral seed banks in nature. However, the high rates of decay observed in the summer demonstrate that virus survival and therefore environmental persistence can be subject to seasonal bottlenecks.

Fine sediment retention can be accompanied by deposition of seeds transported by water dispersal, i.e. by hydrochory. We tested the hypothesis that pioneer riparian trees significantly control seed deposition on gravel bars by forming sediment obstacle marks. We described the seed bank structure and compared samples collected from obstacle marks and bare coarse-grained bar surfaces. At the surface (at 2 cm depth), seed abundance (N) and richness (S) (expressed as mean +/- sd) were significantly higher in areas directly affected by riparian trees, i.e. obstacle marks, (N : 693 +/- 391; S : 17 +/- 3) than in bare surfaces (N : 334 +/- 371; S : 13 +/- 5). Surface and sub-surface (at 20 cm depth) samples were also significantly different, with the sub-surface samples almost devoid of seeds (respectively N : 514 +/- 413; S : 15 +/- 5 and N : 3 +/- 6; S : 1 +/- 2). These results suggest a biogeomorphic feedback between sediment and associated seed retention mediated by hydrochory, vegetation growth and local seed dispersal mediated by barochory. Such feedback may improve plant diversity resilience on gravel alluvial bars of high-energy rivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quantifying the seed bank of an invasive grass in the sub-Antarctic: seed density, depth, persistence and viability	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												A native to Europe, Poa annua now has a cosmopolitan distribution and is invasive in the sub-Antarctic. As a major weed in temperate turf, there has been considerable investment in research of the species, but little is known about its ecology in the sub-Antarctic, particularly its reproductive ecology and population dynamics. We characterised the seed bank of this invasive species in the sub-Antarctic, by quantifying seed density, depth, persistence and viability. Poa annua seed bank density was correlated with elevation, animal disturbance, soil wetness and soil depth, but most strongly with P. annua cover. Seed bank density was greatest (132,000 seeds m(-2)) at low altitude coastal sites where P. annua is abundant but declined with increasing altitude to <2600 seeds m(2). Seed was most abundant within the top 3 cm of the soil and decreased with soil depth. Seed viability declined over time, from an initial viability of 81 to <3 % after 2 years in the soil. This study demonstrates that whilst P. annua seed banks can be dense, the seed bank is shallow (<10 cm) with low persistence and viability. This first detailed study on the in situ seed bank profile of P. annua in the sub-Antarctic helps us understand the distribution and persistence of this invasive weed and is essential information for the development and implementation of future management. These findings, such as low seed bank persistence, challenge current thinking about eradication or control feasibility in the region.

The delicate balance of the components of the forest ecosystem has been altered largely by the landuse systems which have resulted in the disappearance of some species and the introduction of new ones. In order to understand the influence of human disturbance caused by artisanal mining on plant biodiversity and the physical environment, this study assessed changes in vegetation characteristics using plant functional groups, such as invasive, pioneer and understory species. The study was conducted at two sites in two Southwestern states of Nigeria, Itagunmodi in Atakumosa West Local Government Area of Osun State and Olode in Oluyole Local Government Area of Oyo State. Complete enumerations of woody, non-woody and herbaceous plant species were carried out in 20 m by 20 m plots selected using stratified random sampling as representative of landuse classes: freshly mined (< 6 months), abandoned mine (> 6 months) and a control plot (secondary forest). The results showed that the control plot in Itagunmodi had undergone degradation as indicated by the presence of Alchornea laxiflora, Geophilia obvallata, Musa sapientum, Elaeis guineensis and Keetia hispida. However, if left undisturbed, it has the potential of regeneration back to its original state because of its woody tree species composition and lianas (Triclisia gilletii). In addition the forest soils in the mines had been exposed to direct insolation for a long period, and the soil structure and texture have been affected, consequently altering the viability of the seed bank. Poaceae and Papilionoideae were the most common in the freshly mined plots while invasive species were the most common in abandoned mined plots. In conclusion, the floristic composition in the mining sites has been altered and there was no clear evidence that regrowth would bring restoration of the lost ecosystem services.

Climate drivers of seed production in Picea engelmannii and response to warming temperatures in the southern Rocky Mountains	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Seed production by Picea engelmannii was monitored at 13 sites distributed across a 670m elevation gradient for 40years. Time series of annual seed output was investigated for evidence of masting behaviour and trends in seed abundance over time. We used regression models in a likelihood framework to examine climate effects on seed production for critical periods in the species' reproductive cycle. We rigorously evaluated the performance of two gridded climate data sets, PRISM and TopoWx, before using associated variables as predictors in the seed models. Seed production at these sites does not strictly conform to the classic masting concept. Seed abundance was highly variable over time and strongly synchronized among sites, but mast years could not be objectively identified due to intermediate levels of seed output. Model results indicate that climate conditions across multiple years cumulatively determine reproductive output. High seed rain is associated with elevated summer temperatures in the year that seeds are dispersed, low spring snowfall in the year preceding seed dispersal when buds are initiated, and reduced spring snowfall in a so-called priming year two years prior to seed dispersal. Low spring precipitation putatively increases growing season length and resource accumulation in seed trees. Linear models identified significant positive trends in seed output over time. Anomalous aridity and summer warmth in the latter half of the study period were highly favourable for seed production and were associated with increases in seed abundance.Synthesis. The increases in seed output observed in this study may promote population fitness of P. engelmannii in the face of changing climate regimes and increasing frequencies of fire- and insect-related tree mortality in the Rocky Mountains. Since this species lacks a persistent seed bank, re-colonization of disturbed areas or dispersal to shifting habitats depends on adequate production of seed by surviving trees, which according to these analyses may be moderately enhanced by current climate trends. However, some evidence also indicates that increases in seed output will ultimately be constrained by threshold high temperatures in the seed maturation year.

AQUATIC SCIENCES												The identification of factors promoting biodiversity and, more specifically, the causes that contribute to beta diversity is a central and growing issue in ecology. In this study, we used long-term data (1999-2007, including a pronounced drawdown in 2000) to assess the beta diversity partitioning of aquatic macrophyte assemblages in five arms of the Itaipu reservoir. We partitioned beta diversity (beta(sor)) into two components: nestedness (beta(nes)) and species turnover (beta(sim)). To check whether environmental variables (electrical conductivity, water transparency, and fetch) were correlated with the components of beta diversity, we used a permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Over the study period (1999-2007), we observed high values of beta diversity and prevalence of spatial turnover of the species. They were correlated with all environmental factors studied, which demonstrated significant interactions. Dendritic-shaped arms, high shore development, local physical and chemical conditions of the water, and biotic interactions could be determining factors for the prevalence of spatial turnover of aquatic macrophyte assemblages. The drawdown promoted an enormous quantity of dead macrophyte biomass, specifically submerged species that preferentially colonized shallow margins of the reservoir. On the other hand, large open areas were available for colonization of ruderal species and seed bank germination. This dynamic led to an increase of beta diversity and turnover values in the year of the drawdown compared to the 1999 and 2001. This pattern remained until the end of the study, characterizing the aquatic macrophytes of the Itaipu reservoir as an assemblage with high beta diversity and prevalence of species turnover over nestedness, among and within arms.

Assessment of post-burn removal methods for Acacia saligna in Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, with consideration of indigenous plant recovery	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot threatened by the impacts of habitat transformation and invasive alien species. Cape Flats Sand Fynbos (CFSF) is a critically endangered vegetation type occurring within the GCFR, and its largest remaining fragment is the focus of a large-scale invasive plant control and biodiversity restoration project. Acacia saligna is a highly problematic invasive in CFSF and the main target of the control. To mitigate damage caused by this species, stands are removed and burned, which stimulates both the large invasive seed-bank and the indigenous seed-bank in the soil. Although there are no clear methods on how to manage the re-invasion at this stage without damaging indigenous plant recovery, three post-burn removal methods have the potential to be effective: (1) cutting the Acacia saplings below the coppicing point, (2) cutting the saplings and applying herbicide to the stumps, and (3) foliar herbicide spray. The aims of this study were to (i) find the most effective post-burn A. saligna control treatment, (ii) find the treatment that causes the least harm to indigenous plant recovery, (iii) determine the most cost-effective treatment, and (iv) establish which treatment is the most suitable for large-scale use. Cutting below the coppicing point of the A. saligna provided the most effective removal and was also the least damaging to indigenous vegetation recovery. The foliar spray treatment, however, saved the most time and costs. The best method is therefore dependent on the project goals, scale, and density of the A. saligna invasion. These results may be applicable to other types of fynbos and to other fire-stimulated invasive Acacia species. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We observed the transition of dominant annuals over several years during the recovery period after a drought in the Mongolian steppe, and we hypothesized that the transition was a result of the difference in germination characteristics among those species. Germination of five major annuals in the Mongolian steppe, Bassia dasyphylla, Chenopodium acuminatum, Chenopodium album, Chenopodium aristatum, and Salsola collina, was, examined at seven temperatures ranging from 5 to 35 degrees C under three light conditions (red, far-red light, and dark). The germination percentage was very high for S. collina irrespective of temperature and light condition. In contrast, the two Chenopodium species, C album and C. aristatum, showed a low germination percentage irrespective of temperature and light conditions, demonstrating that these species were dormant and formed seed banks. Scarification improved the germination percentage of the two Chenopodium species; however, the improvement was mostly nullified under far-red light and dark conditions in C. album. These germination characteristics contributed to the transition of dominant annuals after the drought. Two Chenopodium annuals that were highly dormant and formed seed banks emerged in large numbers during the first year after the drought, and S. collina with high germinability and no seed banks subsequently succeeded the Chenopodium annuals. We concluded that the germination characteristics of the annuals were a key factor driving vegetation dynamics during early recovery after the drought. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we conceptualize and apply a new decision framework for modelling assisted colonization of plant species prior to in situ realization. Three questions were examined: a) Is species translocation useful in a certain area? b) where, and c) how long will it be successful in the future? Applying our framework to Carex foetida in Italy at the core of its distribution and its southern edge revealed that assisted colonization could be successful in short-term (2010-2039) climate conditions, partially in medium (2040-2069) but not in long-term (2070-2099) scenarios. We show that, for some species, it is likely that assisted colonization would be successful in some portions of the recipient site under current and short-term climate conditions, but over the mid-and long-term, climate changes will make species translocation unsuccessful. The proposed decision framework can help identify species that will need different conservation actions (seed banks and/or botanical gardens) when assisted colonization is unlikely to be successful. Furthermore it has broad applicability, as it can support planning of assisted migration in mountainous areas in the face of climate change.

In this paper, we propose a model for the coexistence of autumn and spring seedlings within one species of annual plants-intraspecific niche complementarity of a two-year life history cycle. There is an unsynchronized germination behavior in some species exhibiting a two-year life history cycle in which one population produces coexisting autumn and spring seedlings. Our soil seed bank coexistence model predicts that the optimal autumn germination fraction must maximize the harmonic mean of the number of seeds that germinate in two different seasons. Moreover, we extended classic annual soil seed bank dynamic models using evolutionary stability and density dependent theory. Our model can be applied not only to winter or spring annuals but also to autumn- and spring-seedling plants coexisting in one population. Under an evolutionarily stable coexistence of autumn- and spring-seedling plants within one population, our model suggests that the greater the ratio of seeds produced by a plant germinated in spring relative to the seeds germinated in autumn, the greater is the germination fraction in autumn. The germination behaviors of plants with unsynchronized two-year life history cycles are a new example of intraspecific niche differentiation in annuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Bacterial Dormancy Is More Prevalent in Freshwater than Hypersaline Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Bacteria employ a diverse array of strategies to survive under extreme environmental conditions but maintaining these adaptations comes at an energetic cost. If energy reserves drop too low, extremophiles may enter a dormant state to persist. We estimated bacterial dormancy and identified the environmental variables influencing our activity proxy in 10 hypersaline and freshwater lakes across the Western United States. Using ribosomal RNA:DNA ratios as an indicator for bacterial activity, we found that the proportion of the community exhibiting dormancy was 16% lower in hypersaline than freshwater lakes. Based on our indicator variable multiple regression results, saltier conditions in both freshwater and hypersaline lakes increased activity, suggesting that salinity was a robust environmental filter structuring bacterial activity in lake ecosystems. To a lesser degree, higher total phosphorus concentrations reduced dormancy in all lakes. Thus, even under extreme conditions, the competition for resources exerted pressure on activity. Within the compositionally distinct and less diverse hypersaline communities, abundant taxa were disproportionately active and localized in families Microbacteriaceae (Actinobacteria), Nitriliruptoraceae (Actinobacteria), and Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Our results are consistent with the view that hypersaline communities are able to capitalize on a seemingly more extreme, yet highly selective, set of conditions and finds that extremophiles may need dormancy less often to thrive and survive.																	1664-302X					JUN 9	2016	7								353	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00853							WOS:000377359300001	27375575					
J	Alpsancar, S				Alpsancar, Suzana			Plants as Digital Things The Global Circulation of Future Breeding Options and their Storage in Gene Banks	TECNOSCIENZA-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY STUDIES												Seeds have traditionally been collected according to their reproductive cycles, i.e. the time when they lose their potential of becoming a real plant. Therefore, the locations of botanic gardens or seed banks imply the vicinity of agricultural land. This article exemplifies the transformation of plant collections into gene and data banks by investigating the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) in Norway and the German Genebank for Fruit Crops (DGO). It shows that international efforts to safeguard biodiversity by intertwining them with bioinformatics infrastructure transform seeds and other plant genetic material into digitalized objects. The almost virtual genetic material, now stored without the neighborhood of acres or gardens, is, at the same time, seen as "options" for new high-tech plants, which might be transplanted to a future territory. Consequently, plant varieties are circulating around the globe in form of genetic material and data. The article shows that the digitalization induces a specific distinction between the material and the digital flows of plants.																	2038-3460					JUN	2016	7	1	1		SI		45	66									WOS:000393481400004

Fire-vegetation feedbacks and alternative states: common mechanisms of temperate forest vulnerability to fire in southern South America and New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In the context of global warming and increasing impacts of invasive plants and animals, we examine how positive fire-vegetation feedbacks are increasing the vulnerability of pyrophobic temperate forests to conversion to pyrophytic non-forest vegetation in southern South America and New Zealand. We extensively review the relevant literature to reveal how these temperate southern hemisphere floras have generated similar positive fire-vegetation feedback mechanisms resulting in increased vulnerability to anthropogenically altered fire regimens. For the two regions, we address the following questions. 1. What are the major plant species, physiognomic types and functional types characteristic of pyrophytic versus pyrophobic vegetation types and how do their traits affect flammability, resistance to fire and recovery after fire? 2. What are the roles of herbivory and microclimate in enhancing fire-vegetation feedbacks? 3. Are there similarities in trends of cover type transitions in relation to altered fire regimens? 4. How are climate change, land-use trends and the effects of introduced plants and animals affecting the vulnerability of these ecosystems to fire-induced transitions to alternative stable states? Most temperate forests of New Zealand and southern South America evolved under conditions of low fire frequencies so few taxa became adapted to recurrent fire. Current dichotomous landscapes consisting of juxtaposed pyrophobic and pyrophytic vegetation types are the outcome of the expansion of fire-resilient and fire-promoting species associated with the arrival of humans. Despite considerable differences in human history and biogeographic history, the case studies presented here show remarkable parallels in life-history traits of the key pyrophobic taxa, fire-vegetation feedback mechanisms, overall ecosystem responses to anthropogenic alteration of fire regimens, and likely vulnerability to expected global change influences on future fire regimens.

J	Peralta, AML; Sanchez, AM; Luzuriaga, AL; Escudero, A				Lopez Peralta, Ana Maria; Maria Sanchez, Ana; Luzuriaga, Arantzazu L.; Escudero, Adrian			Factors driving species assemblage in Mediterranean soil seed banks: from the large to the fine scale	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Many studies have analysed the mechanisms that determine plant coexistence in standing vegetation, but the determinants of soil seed bank species assemblies have rarely been studied. In gypsum soil communities, aerial vegetation and seed banks are tightly connected in space and time, but the mechanisms involved in their organization may differ. The aim of this study is to understand the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil seed bank composition and structure. Methods Persistent and complete (i.e. persistent plus transient) soil seed banks were investigated at two spatial scales in a very species-rich semi-arid community dominated by annuals. A water addition treatment equivalent to 50 % annual increase in average precipitation (abiotic factor) was applied for two consecutive years, and the relationships of the soil seed bank to the biological soil crust (BSC), above-ground vegetation and the presence of Stipa tenacissima tussocks (biotic factors) were simultaneously evaluated. Key Results As expected, the standing vegetation was tightly related to seed abundance, species richness and composition in both seed banks. Remarkably, BSC cover was linked to a decrease in seed abundance and species richness in the persistent seed bank, and it even determined complete seed bank composition at the fine spatial scale. However, this effect disappeared at coarser scales, probably because of the high spatial heterogeneity induced by BSCs. In contrast to findings on standing vegetation, Stipa and the irrigation treatment for two consecutive years had no effect on soil seed banks. Conclusions Soil seed bank assemblies in our semi-arid plant community were the result of above-ground vegetation dynamics and of the direct filtering processes on seed fate operated by the spatially heterogeneous BSCs. Cover of BSCs was negatively correlated with seed abundance and species richness, and affected seed species composition in the soil. Changes in species composition and enrichment when the BSC cover is low suggest that BSCs promote a fine scale niche differentiation in the soil seed bank and thereby potentially enhance species coexistence and high species diversity in these communities.																	0305-7364	1095-8290				JUN	2016	117	7					1221	1228		10.1093/aob/mcw039							WOS:000379733800012	27085181

Seed longevity and dormancy state in a disturbance-dependent forest herb, Ageratina altissima	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Does seed dormancy allow disturbance-oriented forest herbs such as Ageratina altissima to persist in heterogeneous natural communities? To document seed longevity and dormancy state, Ageratina seeds were buried in nylon mesh bags in second-growth forest stands in south-eastern Ohio, USA. Bags were recovered at 2-month intervals, and seeds were tested for viability and germinability in the lab. Live seed numbers declined rapidly, with seed banks exhausted in an estimated 33-37 months. Seeds showed a strong dormancy polymorphism, with 71-84% of live seeds germinable between March and July, the season of natural seedling emergence. At other dates, most seeds appeared to be in a state of induced dormancy, allowing little (0-21%) germination. The slope aspect of the burial site, an important factor controlling above-ground vegetation, had no effect on seed longevity or dormancy condition. Dormancy in Ageratina appears to be adapted to allow opportunistic germination in late spring-early summer, but to prevent germination in less benign periods. Seed longevity is shorter than the natural frequency of gaps in mesophytic forest. We conclude that a long-term dispersal/dormancy trade-off is probably an oversimplification of the spatial ecology of this species. The primary function of dormancy appears to be short-term tracking of seasonal variation.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				JUN	2016	26	2					148	152		10.1017/S0960258516000052							WOS:000378721200006

Cytological aspects of recalcitrance in dormant seeds of Mauritia flexuosa (Arecaceae)	ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM												We evaluated the physiological and cytological aspects of the embryos of the palm tree Mauritia flexuosa, whose seeds show a rare association of recalcitrance and dormancy. Seeds were subjected to dehydration, or stored with stabilized water contents for 420 days. Seed viability and germination, as well as the anatomy, cytochemistry and ultrastructure of the embryos were evaluated using standardized methodologies. Under initial conditions (seeds with water contents of 44.6 %), viability was as high as 94 %, although without germination. Seeds dehydrated to water contents of 20 % lost all viability, whereas 87 % of the seeds stored while hydrated remained viable and 25 % germinated. Embryonic cells showed characteristics associated with recalcitrance in other palms species, such as the presence of large vacuoles and the absence of lipidic reserves, but also had abundant protein bodies and terpenoids in their cytoplasm as well as carbohydrate and protein reserves in their vacuoles-conditions found in the embryo cells of palms having orthodox seeds. Dehydration caused invagination of the cell walls, retraction of the plasma membrane, proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum and autophagic vacuoles, and increased the densities of vacuolar contents-culminating in the collapse of the protoplast. Stored seeds showed preserved cell structures. M. flexuosa seeds are sensitive to dehydration, but will retain viability if kept hydrated, allowing dormancy to be overcome in seed banks in the swampy soils where this species occurs. The accumulations of secondary metabolites, vacuolation and the storage of carbohydrates and proteins in the vacuole all have important roles in the modulation of recalcitrance.

Fire severity mediates seedling recruitment patterns in slender mulga (Acacia aptaneura), a fire-sensitive Australian desert shrub with heat-stimulated germination	PLANT ECOLOGY												Members of the widespread arid Australian mulga (Acacia aneura) complex are fire-sensitive shrubs or small trees that can resprout epicormically following low-severity burning, but are readily killed by high-severity fire. The seeds of many species of mulga are stimulated to germinate by heat during burning, although post-fire regeneration rates are unpredictable. Here, we investigated whether variability in post-fire mulga recruitment relates to the relationship between fire severity and soil heating during fire, which may kill, leave unaffected, or stimulate the germination of buried seeds. This hypothesis was examined in central Australia on slender mulga (A. aptaneura), by experimentally investigating (a) seedling recruitment rates under different fire severity classes, (b) the germination and lethal temperature thresholds of seeds, (c) soil temperatures during fires of different severity classes and (d) the emergence depths of seedlings beneath high- and low-severity burnt plants. We found that post-fire recruitment was significantly lower beneath low-severity burnt and unburnt plants than high-severity burnt plants. This result was explained by the finding that maximum germinability of mulga seeds occurs after heating to between 80 and 100 A degrees C, and that these temperatures are not achieved in unburnt patches or low-severity burns at depths where the majority of the seed bank is known to occur. Despite the increased regeneration observed after high-severity fire, post-fire recruitment was highly variable between sites, independent of fire severity. This indicates that while heat-stimulated germination may confer on mulga a risk-spreading strategy to a range of fire severities, post-burn recruitment may not always offset high adult death rates following high-severity fire.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				JUN	2016	217	6					789	800		10.1007/s11258-015-0550-0							WOS:000379166900017

Summer water in a restored native grassland flushes annual grass seed bank but fails to increase native perennial cover	ECOSPHERE												Natural and artificial flushing of the weed seed bank, followed by killing of seedlings, is a common practice in agricultural and prerestoration settings, but its application for post-restoration management has not been tested in the context of restored native plants. Summer watering at already restored sites could reduce exotic annual grass cover by decreasing the seed bank, thereby increasing native perennial success in subsequent growing seasons. Five replicated watering treatments of 11.35 L per watering event were applied for up to a 4 week period, with watering events ranging from once daily for a minimum or four and maximum of 16 d, or twice daily for 4 d, for a total of 45.4-181.7 L water applied in each 1-m(2) plot. Two of the watering treatments triggered significant flushing of annual grasses: watering for a total of 16 d once per day, and 4 d twice per day. Although this conferred a short-term reduction in annual grass emergence at the start of the subsequent rainy season, it did not reduce total annual cover at peak flowering in the growing season, or provide a longer term advantage to native perennial grasses. It is possible that there are sufficient seeds in the seed bank that this at least partly compensated for the seed bank reduction and did not result in a reduction in final cover, or that lower densities of seedlings are sufficient to achieve "total" cover. Perennial grass cover increased in response to all watering treatments, but this did not result in significantly increased cover the following year. These results suggest that even watering treatments that produce large flushes of exotic annual grasses are insufficient to reduce exotic cover longer term. It should be explored whether more water, applied more frequently, could be effective in reducing the exotic grass seed bank enough to confer a long-term reduction in exotic cover and a benefit to native perennial grasses.																	2150-8925					JUN	2016	7	6							e01309	10.1002/ecs2.1309							WOS:000378523100009

Compared with S0, three more species in the soil seed bank at depths of 0-30 cm and one more plant species in the community was detected in S12. Seed density within the topsoil (0-5 cm) was five times higher in S12 than that in S0. Plant densities in S7 and S12 were triple and quadruple than that in S0. Plant coverage was increased by 1.5 times (S4), double (S7), and triple (S12) compared with S0. Sorensen's index of similarity in species composition between the soil seed bank and the plant community were high (0.43-0.63), but it was lower in short-term restoration sites (S4 and S7) than that in no and long-term restoration sites (S0 and S12). The soil seed bank recovered more slowly than the plant community under passive restoration. Passive restoration is a useful method to recover the soil seed bank and vegetation in degraded grasslands.				周, 振兴/X-2681-2019													2071-1050					JUN	2016	8	6							581	10.3390/su8060581							WOS:000378776800078

J	Herrera, CM; Bazaga, P				Herrera, Carlos M.; Bazaga, Pilar			Genetic and epigenetic divergence between disturbed and undisturbed subpopulations of a Mediterranean shrub: a 20-year field experiment	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Little is known on the potential of ecological disturbance to cause genetic and epigenetic changes in plant populations. We take advantage of a long-term field experiment initiated in 1986 to study the demography of the shrub Lavandula latifolia, and compare genetic and epigenetic characteristics of plants in two adjacent subplots, one experimentally disturbed and one left undisturbed, 20 years after disturbance. Experimental setup was comparable to an unreplicated 'Before-After-Control-Impact' (BACI) design where a single pair of perturbed and control areas were compared. When sampled in 2005, plants in the two subplots had roughly similar ages, but they had established in contrasting environments: dense conspecific population ('Undisturbed' subpopulation) versus open area with all conspecifics removed ('Disturbed' subpopulation). Plants were characterized genetically and epigenetically using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and two classes of methylation-sensitive AFLP (MSAP) markers. Subpopulations were similar in genetic diversity but differed in epigenetic diversity and multilocus genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Epigenetic divergence between subpopulations was statistically unrelated to genetic divergence. Bayesian clustering revealed an abrupt linear boundary between subpopulations closely coincident with the arbitrary demarcation line between subplots drawn 20 years back, which supports that genetic and epigenetic divergence between subpopulations was caused by artificial disturbance. There was significant fine-scale spatial structuring of MSAP markers in both subpopulations, which in the Undisturbed one was indistinguishable from that of AFLP markers. Genetic differences between subpopulations could be explained by divergent selection alone, while the concerted action of divergent selection and disturbance-driven appearance of new methylation variants in the Disturbed subpopulation is proposed to explain epigenetic differences. This study provides the first empirical evidence to date suggesting that relatively mild disturbances could leave genetic and epigenetic signatures on the next adult generation of long-lived plants.

Targeted grazing of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) and Syrian thistle (Notobasis syriaca) by goats: Preference following preconditioning, generational transfer, and toxicity	APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE												Nitrophilic thistles such as milk thistle (Sylibum marianum) and Syrian thistle (Notobasis syriaca) encroach rangeland areas where animals gather and defecate, in particular around watering and feeding points. High densities of milk and Syrian thistles (MST) diminish forage yields and detract from the amenity value of these areas. The aims of the present study were: (i) to test the safety of feeding MST to adult goats; (ii) to determine if preconditioning adult goats to MST, by feeding it indoors together with concentrate, enhances preference for MST when they graze MST-rich pastures; and (iii) to test for generational transfer by comparing the propensity to consume MST and the preference for MST over clover hay for weaned kids that previously suckled from does that were, or were not, preconditioned to consume MST fed as green fodder. We found that eating MST was not toxic to adult goats. Over six observation sessions of one hour, preconditioned goats devoted 50% more time to consuming MST than non-conditioned counterparts (30.3% versus 20.6%, respectively; P = 0.0005), and kids that experienced the preconditioning period together with their does tended (P = 0.08) to show a greater preference for MST over clover hay than their counterparts born to non-conditioned adults. Although the efficacy in depleting the seed bank has yet to be verified, from the point of view of the animal, goats may be used in targeted grazing of milk and Syrian thistles.

Invasive earthworms as seed predators of temperate forest plants	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Soil seedbanks play a key role in forest plant communities, contributing to regeneration and acting as a refuge from seed predators. This study provides evidence that seeds entering the soil seed-bank are vulnerable to granivory by invasive earthworms in temperate forests. Overall, 73 % of seeds of 6 ecologically important forest species were removed from the soil surface over 2 weeks in a Lumbricus terrestris microcosm experiment; 30 % vanished entirely, and presumably were destroyed. The invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, was subject to the highest rates of removal. In contrast, results from a field exclosure experiment using 23 species of seed indicate that while seed predation by worms is still detectable, predation by rodents often may mask impacts of earthworms under natural conditions. Worms and rodents preferred different sizes of seeds: while seed predation by rodents was high in mid-to large-seeded species, earthworms tended to prefer smaller seeds. These findings suggest that although rodents are the main driver of seed predation, invasive earthworms may act as an additional ecological filter, and potentially may further influence the species composition of forest plant communities.

In semiarid regions, forest regeneration is highly affected by seasonal and interannual variations in precipitation, because these variations may affect the composition, species richness, and density of seeds in the soil. This study aimed to characterize and compare these parameters of the germinable seed bank in fragments of young and mature Caatinga forest between various seasons and over consecutive years. A total of 105 soil samples were collected in 20 x 20 x 5 cm plots in each forest (Young and Mature) at the end of the rainy and dry seasons over 4 years (2009-2012), totaling 840 samples. The composition, species richness, and density of seeds were determined by the method of seedling emergence. Over the 4 years, 121 species emerged from the soil seed bank, 86 in the young forest, and 109 in the mature forest. Significant differences in the composition, richness, and density were recorded between forests, seasons, and years, with a significant interaction between them. Relationship between rainfall and age of forests affects the dynamics of the soil seed bank in semiarid environments, which are important distinctions for the maintenance of these areas.

The results show that the upper grain in a spikelet is larger than the bottom grain, and either germinates in the season following dispersal, or dies. In contrast, a substantial fraction of the bottom grains do not germinate in the first season, but remain dormant in the soil seed bank for 1 and, very rarely, 2 years. This pattern was observed in seeds of all origins, but the bottom grains from the most arid location had the lowest, and from the least arid location, the highest germination fraction in the 1st year and vice versa in the 2nd year. This difference in germination fraction was observed under controlled irrigation conditions but not in the field experiment. These mixed results suggest that seed dimorphism is a life history trait with a complicated evolutionary history and wide adaptive implications. Seed dimorphism in T. dicoccoides could initially be an adaptation for reducing competition in productive (i.e., high precipitation) environments. In addition to this, seed dimorphism under increasing aridity could become a bet-hedging trait allowing a population to survive periods of insufficient rainfall through dormancy.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				JUN	2016	181	2					401	412		10.1007/s00442-016-3576-7							WOS:000376296000008	26868523

Origin of and resulting floristic composition from seedbanks in agroforestry systems of Tome-Acu, Eastern Amazon	WEED RESEARCH												The objective of this study was to verify the origin of and resulting floristic composition from seedbanks in different agroforestry systems in Tome-Acu, Brazil. The seedbanks were sampled in three smallholder farmers (Demonstration Units = DU), each with three agroforestry treatments and secondary forest as control. Seedling emergence in a glasshouse was used to quantify and identify the seeds collected in 2008. The floristic composition of the above-ground community was characterised with annual floristic surveys from 2008 to 2011. The total densities and diversity of the seedbanks were not different among the treatments within a given DU, but differences occurred among DU. The most abundant woody species had higher seed densities in the secondary forests than in DU. Conversely, among the herbaceous species, two groups were differentiated: species with similar densities between the DU and the secondary forest and species with higher density in the DU. In the DU, the similarity between the floristic composition of the seedbank and the flora surveyed in 2008 was high, but decreased in subsequent years. The species present in the seedbank of agroforestry systems are highly influenced by the secondary forest, but provide little information about the floristic composition that will arise in the future.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				JUN	2016	56	3					219	228		10.1111/wre.12201							WOS:000375937000004

The species was considered to exclusively reproduce through vegetative means, until ex situ germination was recorded from a single locality in Belgium. We assessed whether this seed viability holds on a wider scale, by testing 16 populations from The Netherlands, Belgium, northern France, eastern England and northern Germany in a greenhouse germination experiment. Seedlings were observed from all populations but two, and from each of the five countries. Although most fruits were lacking seeds and the inferred germination percentages were overall low, germinable seed numbers are considerable given the high density of flowering stems. An in situ test revealed seeds to make it through normal winter conditions without signs of physical damage and with retention of germinability. Our results suggest that reproduction by seed is a relatively cryptic but widespread phenomenon throughout western Europe. The persistency of seed banks requires further investigation. Nonetheless, these findings already challenge the efficacy of techniques currently applied in C. helmsii control.

J	Benvenuti, S				Benvenuti, Stefano			Seed ecology of Mediterranean hind dune wildflowers	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												There is an increasing need for the landscape conservation of the threatened biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. This work studies the seed ecology (germination, dormancy, self-burial, seedlings emergence and seed bank disposition) of various Mediterranean hind dune wildflowers in a perspective of landscape protection and restoration. The deep dormancy of most species (overall Fabaceae, Brassicaceae and Calystegia soldanella) was eliminated or reduced after some seed treatments selected to simulate some natural events (washing, cold stratification, scarification, etc). "In situ" seed bank analysis was carried out by collecting sand samples in different dune ecosystems of Tuscany and Sardinia. Indeed the seed vertical distribution plays a crucial role in the germination dynamics on buried seeds. The vertical distribution of the seed bank of 20 selected species was confined to the upper 0-12 cm layer of sand dune. Their burial depth was found to be inversely related to the 1000 seed weight of the different species ranging by 0.01 g of Centaurium maritimum to 47.58 of C. so ldanella. Roughly 80% of the seed bank is accumulated in the shallowest sand layer (0-3 cm) and the only very little seeds of C. maritimum and Silene colorata were capable to reach the deeper layer of 9-12 cm. Seedling emergence from increasing burial depth has been studied in pots "ex situ". In spite of the respective seed dormancy-breaking treatments, their germination was progressively inhibited by burial depth increasing in the sand matrix. Calculation of the depth able to halve emergence established an inverse relationship between seed weight and depth mediated inhibition. In addition, the ex situ capacity for self-burial (mediated by winter rains), ranging between 1 and 3.5 cm, showed a similar, but inverse, relationship between seed weight and self-burial performance. Seed bank of herbaceous perennial species appears to be a good indicator of an ecosystem's health and the perspective of environmental restoration, by using native wildflowers, should be carried out by sowing treated seeds, with a light burial, behind the natural or artificial foredunes.

Sedge/Grass Meadow Restoration on Former Agricultural Lands along a Lake Ontario Drowned-River-Mouth Tributary	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Restoration of sedge/grass meadow habitat was implemented on former agricultural lands adjacent to a Lake Ontario drowned-river-mouth tributary at an elevation that historically supports this community type. Four hectares of land were disked in spring and seeded with diverse wetland mixes containing sedges, grasses, and f orbs, with additional Calamagrostis canadensis (bluejoint) and Carex stricta (upright sedge) seeds added. Seedling plugs of C. canadensis and C. stricta were also planted. Mowing at a height of 45 cm to control tall, invasive annual weeds prior to seed-set was conducted as an adaptive management practice. Three years after implementation, C. canadensis and C. stricta were not found, but seeded Carex vulpinoidea (fox sedge) was dominant, and seeded Carex lupulina (hop sedge) and Carex lurida (shallow sedge) were also present. Most invasive annuals were rare, but canopies created by larger perennials may pose future problems. Although a greenhouse seed-bank emergence study was conducted, field sampling suggested that plants growing on adjacent lands were a better predictor of future plant communities, with select seeded species serving as a secondary predictor. Failure of some sedges to survive after seeding likely was not related to stratification or diurnal temperature range. However, inadequate soil moisture related to soil type and a second-year drought likely played a role, as might loss of viability of seeds during storage. Future efforts on similar lands might use fresh Carex seeds broadcast in autumn for over-winter stratification, and specially developed seed mixes could focus on species that established at the site and native species found nearby, while avoiding some potential problem species.																	1543-4060	1543-4079				JUN 1	2016	34	2					135	146		10.3368/er.34.2.135							WOS:000456494900009

Small-scale barriers mitigate desertification processes and enhance plant recruitment in a degraded semiarid grassland	ECOSPHERE												Anthropogenic desertification is a problem that plagues drylands globally; however, the factors which maintain degraded states are often unclear. In Canyonlands National Park on the Colorado Plateau of southeastern Utah, many degraded grasslands have not recovered structure and function >40 yr after release from livestock grazing pressure, necessitating active restoration. We hypothesized that multiple factors contribute to the persistent degraded state, including lack of seed availability, surficial soil-hydrological properties, and high levels of spatial connectivity (lack of perennial vegetation and other surface structure to retain water, litter, seed, and sediment). In combination with seeding and surface raking treatments, we tested the effect of small barrier structures ("ConMods") designed to disrupt the loss of litter, seed and sediment in degraded soil patches within the park. Grass establishment was highest when all treatments (structures, seed addition, and soil disturbance) were combined, but only in the second year after installation, following favorable climatic conditions. We suggest that multiple limiting factors were ameliorated by treatments, including seed limitation and microsite availability, seed removal by harvester ants, and stressful abiotic conditions. Higher densities of grass seedlings on the north and east sides of barrier structures following the summer months suggest that structures may have functioned as artificial "nurse-plants", sheltering seedlings from wind and radiation as well as accumulating wind-blown resources. Barrier structures increased the establishment of both native perennial grasses and exotic annuals, although there were species-specific differences in mortality related to spatial distribution of seedlings within barrier structures. The unique success of all treatments combined, and even then only under favorable climatic conditions and in certain soil patches, highlights that restoration success (and potentially, natural regeneration) often is contingent on many interacting factors.

J	Chaplot, V; Dlamini, P; Chivenge, P				Chaplot, Vincent; Dlamini, Phesheya; Chivenge, Pauline			Potential of grassland rehabilitation through high density-short duration grazing to sequester atmospheric carbon	GEODERMA												According to the World Resources Institute (2000), a relative increase of carbon (C) stocks in world soils by 0.4% per year would be sufficient to compensate all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Several land management practices such as the suppression of tillage in agroecosystems and livestock exclusion in grasslands had initially been thought to store more carbon into the soil, but recent research puts this into question. In a context where finding effective C sequestration methods is urgent, the main objective of this study was to assess the ability of an innovative grassland management practice based on high density and short duration (HDSD) grazing to sequester atmospheric C into soils. The study was performed in a degraded communal rangeland in South Africa where soil organic C (SOC) depletion ranged from 5 to 95% depending on the degradation level, which varied from non-degraded (ND; with grass above ground coverage, Coy of 100%), degraded (D1; 50 < Coy < 75%), D2 (25 < Cov < 50%) and HD (highly degraded: Coy < 5%). The ability of HDSD (1200 cows ha(-1) for 3 days a year) to replenish SOC stocks was compared to four commonly used strategies: (1) livestock exclosure (E); (2) livestock exclosure with topsoil tillage (ET); (3) livestock exclosure with NPK fertilization (2:3:3, 22 at 0.2 t ha(-1)) (EF); (4) annual burning (AB); all treatments being compared to traditional free grazing control. A total of 540 soil samples were collected in the 0-0.05 m soil layer for all treatments and degradation intensities. After two years, topsoil SOC stocks were significantly increased under EF and HDSD, by an average of 33.4 +/- 0.5 and 12.4 +/- 2.1 g C m(2) y(-1), respectively. In contrast, AB reduced SOC stocks by 3.6 +/- 3.0 g C m(2) y(-1), while the impact of E and ET was not significant at P < 0.05. HDSD replenished SOC stocks the most at D1 and D2 (6.7 and 7.4% y(-1)) and this was explained by grass recovery, i.e. a significant increase in soil surface coverage by grass and grass production. HDSD is cost-effective, and thus has great potential to be widely adopted by smallholder farmers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Historical land use by domestic grazing revealed bythe soil seed bank: a case study from a natural semi-arid grassland of NW Patagonia	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												Livestock can affect the soil seed bank through various mechanisms associated with changes in vegetation. We sampled vegetation and seed banks of Patagonian grasslands, in areas with different historical use by grazing (exclosure, moderate use and high use) to evaluate to what extent changes in vegetation are reflected in the seed bank. We also evaluated the effect of historical grazing on horizontal spatial seed distribution by sampling under shrubs and in between plant gaps. We focused the study on functional groups, and on the palatable Poa ligularis, an indicator of grassland status. In general, the proportional changes in composition and abundance of functional groups produced in grazed sectors (relative to each exclosure) were bigger for the seed bank than for the aboveground vegetation. Impacts on seed bank were led by a decrease (moderate use), or total disappearance (high use) of perennial grasses, results clearly reflected by P.ligularis. Although shrubs were represented in vegetation, they were undetected in the seed bank through germination, probably due to the lack of the conditions required for breaking seed dormancy. Intensive grazing produced homogenization in seed spatial distribution. Our work revealed a poor contribution of the seed bank to vegetation regeneration at increasing historical use by grazing. We recommend sampling the seed bank when monitoring the conservation status of grasslands to obtain consistent management guidelines.																	0142-5242	1365-2494				JUN	2016	71	2					315	327		10.1111/gfs.12187							WOS:000376001900013

Plant species composition was determined for each plot during the flowering stage of herbaceous species in June 2011. The seedling emergence method was used to estimate SSB composition.Results: A total of 45 species (23 annuals and 22 perennials) emerged from the soil samples of the grazed area, while the number of species emerged from the soil samples of the previously grazing area was 76 (37 annuals and 39 perennials). The removal of grazing led to a significant increase in species richness and seed density in the SSB. Species turnover of AGV was higher, and that of the SSB was similar for grazed areas compared with areas that were formerly grazed. Detrended correspondence analysis ordination of AGV composition showed a clearly separate structure between grazed plots and plots where grazing has been removed, while the segregation was less clear for SSB composition.Conclusions: We concluded that restoration of locally degraded sites cannot rely on the SSB when grazing is stopped simultaneously and unvegetated gaps are colonised by vegetative growth rather than by seed.

To assess this possibility, we monitored tree seedling dynamics of other tree species, the understory microenvironment, and seed availability following heavy thinning (50 % by volume) in two hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) plantations in Shikoku, southwestern Japan. Conventional (35 % by volume) and row thinning (50 % by volume) treatments were also applied at one of the sites. Diffuse transmittance in the understory dramatically increased after all thinning treatments then rapidly decreased, except after row thinning. Heavy thinning accelerated recruitment of small seedlings (with stems < 30 cm high) at one of the sites. However, the densities of these seedlings declined sharply, and increases in the densities of larger seedlings recorded in subsequent surveys were very small. Furthermore, at the other site, recruitment of small seedlings under heavy thinning was equivalent to that under conventional thinning and lower than that under row thinning. Abundant species in the recruited seedlings were pioneer or subcanopy species found in the soil seed bank. Low seed rain density at both sites appeared to be responsible for the poor recruitment of canopy tree species. Our results suggest that heavy thinning had limited effects on the seedling recruitment of other tree species in these hinoki plantations due to insufficient seed rain and rapid canopy closure.																	1341-6979	1610-7403				JUN	2016	21	3					131	142		10.1007/s10310-016-0522-9							WOS:000375415700003

Such studies are rare for species-rich and strongly structured environments, especially those of the southern hemisphere. For two sympatric, perennial shrubs of the south-west Western Australian semi-arid zone, Grevillea globosa and Mirbelia sp. Bursarioides, we assessed historical and contemporary genetic diversity and structure, demographic processes and ratios of pollen to seed dispersal. Phylogeographical structure was not detected and haplotype networks were star-like. Number of haplotypes, nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity, and allelic diversity were statistically significantly lower for G.globosa than for M. sp. Bursarioides. Levels of haplotype divergence and more contemporary genetic divergence and expected heterozygosity were lower for G.globosa than for M. sp. Bursarioides, but differences were not statistically significant. Both species exhibited signals of isolation by distance and low pollen to seed dispersal ratios (5.26:1 and 6.88:1). Grevillea globosa displayed signals of historical and contemporary demographic expansion. Results imply an important role for aspects of seed ecology that impact population demography, as well as direct dispersal and a significant contribution of seed dispersal to genetic connectivity in a semi-arid landscape.

Will a rising sea sink some estuarine wetland ecosystems?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Sea-level rise associated with climate change presents a major challenge to plant diversity and ecosystem service provision in coastal wetlands. In this study, we investigate the effect of sea-level rise on benthos, vegetation, and ecosystem diversity in a tidal wetland in west Wales, the UK. Present relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were investigated through 50 plots at which vegetation (species and coverage), hydrological (surface or groundwater depth, conductivity) and soil (matrix chroma, presence or absence of mottles, organic content, particle size) data were collected. Benthic communities were sampled at intervals along a continuum from saline to freshwater. To ascertain future changes to the wetlands' hydrology, a GIS-based empirical model was developed. Using a LiDAR derived land surface, the relative effect of peat accumulation and rising sea levels were modelled over 200 years to determine how frequently portions of the wetland will be inundated by mean sea level, mean high water spring and mean high water neap conditions. The model takes into account changing extents of peat accumulation as hydrological conditions alter. Model results show that changes to the wetland hydrology will initially be slow. However, changes in frequency and extent of inundation reach a tipping point 125 to 175 years from 2010 due to the extremely low slope of the wetland. From then onwards, large portions of the wetland become flooded at every flood tide and saltwater intrusion becomes more common. This will result in a reduction in marsh biodiversity with plant communities switching toward less diverse and occasionally monospecific communities that are more salt tolerant. While the loss of tidal freshwater wetland is in line with global predictions, simulations suggest that in the Teifi marshes the loss will be slow at first, but then rapid. While there will be a decrease in biodiversity, the model indicated that at least for one ecosystem service, carbon storage, there is potential for an increase in the near future.

PLOS ONE												Restoration is important for biodiversity conservation worldwide, but surprisingly little is known about its efficiency in a long-term perspective. In this study, we re-examined Swedish semi-natural grasslands 12-20 years after the restoration, by comparing field inventories of vascular plant species diversity made in 2001 with follow-up inventories in 2012. We also analysed restoration effect in relation to six environmental factors and used continuously managed semi-natural grasslands as references of desired state after restoration. We found that total species richness increased over time but not to reference levels, while there were no significant changes in species density or number of grassland specialists. However, the overall species composition in the restored sites, as well as grassland specialist composition, now largely resembled reference conditions. Fertilisation and time between abandonment and restoration were the only environmental variables that affected total species composition change, while site area affected change in grassland specialist composition. Our results show that restoration of semi-natural grasslands can contribute to conservation of semi-natural habitats and their associated biodiversity. Yet, due to the vague restoration goals for these sites, it is difficult to evaluate the restoration success, which emphasise the general need for clear and measurable goals.

ECOSISTEMAS												There is currently a great interest in studying functional traits in plants that aid to predict ecological interactions and responses of species to environmental or anthropological changes in ecosystems. Seeds'morphological traits play a relevant role along the whole life cycle of plants. However, they have not been well studied from functional perspective in different habitats especially in tropical dry areas, where there is great diversity of species at high risk of threat. The Tumbesian dry forests occurring in the southwestern of Ecuador and northwestern of Peru, are considered as hotspots owing to their high biodiversity and endemism. However, this ecosystem is highly threatened and some tree and shrub species have already been included in red for this reason, it is urgent to generate information that may promote the conservation of forest genetic resources of tropical dry forests. One of the most practical and immediate alternative is the collection and ex situ storage of seeds. However, in tropical dry habitats, the morphological, physiological and ecological traits of seeds are largely unknown which may prevent the performance of ex situ conservation strategies. This knowledge is important in order to efficiently collect and storage seeds that can be used in active restoration plants. In this article we provide information about morphological seeds traits of Tumbesian woody species and how such traits influence the process of seed collection and storage.

A plant traits approach to managing legacy species during restoration transitions in temperate eucalypt woodlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Degraded communities often contain a subset of the species that comprised the predisturbance community. These represent an important legacy of the predisturbance state, yet restoration treatments may be detrimental to them. This study examined the potential of leaf traits and life form to predict whether restoration treatments can maintain legacy swards of Austrostipa bigeniculata (hereafter Austrostipa) while controlling exotic annuals in temperate eucalypt woodlands. Treatments included carbon addition to reduce soil nitrate, both with and without burning or pulse grazing to deplete exotic seed pools. We compared leaf traits of Austrostipa with a native grass (Themeda triandra) known to be advantaged, and 8 exotic annual species known to be disadvantaged by these treatments. Leaf traits indicated potentially greater negative impacts of carbon addition on exotic annuals compared to Austrostipa, and on Austrostipa compared to Themeda, suggesting a net restoration benefit. Similarly, burning or pulse grazing is expected to have little negative impact on perennial resprouting grasses (hemicryptophytes; Austrostipa and Themeda) compared with annual exotics (therophytes) with short-lived seed banks. Treatment responses were largely consistent with predictions: treatments that significantly reduced exotic annuals had no net disadvantage to Austrostipa swards despite significant reductions in Austrostipa seedling growth with carbon addition. Indeed by Year 3, Austrostipa mortality in untreated plots led to 46% lower Austrostipa abundance than in treated plots at one site, potentially due to litter build-up or other mechanisms. We conclude that plant traits provide a useful framework for designing restoration transitions that retain native legacy species while controlling exotics.

(buffel grass) population of the Sonoran Desert under various environmental conditions	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Cenchrus ciliaris is one of the most important invasive plants in northwestern Mexico and southwestern United States, threatening the conservation of desert and thorn scrub. Our knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie its capacity for invasion is limited. Here, we evaluate the effect of light, temperature, gibberellic acid, osmotic potential, heat shock and experimental fire on caryopses germination from an invader population, exploring the hypothesis that fast germination under a wide range of environmental conditions facilitates survival in a plant species that invades desert environments. Results showed that caryopses of invasive plants were light-indifferent, and germinate under a wide range of temperatures (10 degrees C-40 degrees C). Germination initiates in less than 24 h, reaching a maximumin 3-6 days at 25 degrees C, with lower germination recorded below 15 degrees C. Germination occurred at osmotic potentials ranging from 0 to -1.6 MPa. Some of the caryopses germinated only after the lemma and palea were removed and a fraction did not germinate even after covers were removed, suggesting the existence of physiological dormancy in these caryopses. Other seeds did not germinate even after gibberellins treatment. This variation in dormancy may promote a seed bank, increasing possibilities for persistence in time. Plasticity in germination responses to temperature and osmotic potential, as well as fast germination, might facilitate the invasion of buffel grass in arid and semiarid areas. (C) 2016 SAAB.

Mexican alpine plants in the face of global warming: potential extinction within a specialized assemblage of narrow endemics	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Alpine ecosystems occur under extreme climatic conditions and, as a result, house a unique and vulnerable biota. They are very scarce at tropical latitudes; in Mexico occur mainly along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, where species richness is not high but narrow endemics stand out. We investigate the effects of climate change under hypothesized contrasting climate warming scenarios using ecological niche modeling of five microendemic alpine species. Occurrence data was obtained mainly from field trips, but herbaria were also examined. A total of 21 climatic and topographic variables, as well as individual selections of 12-16 variables were employed to construct models with Maxent and GARP. Depending on the number of occurrences, current models were validated with Partial-ROC or Jackknife procedures; and projections to 2050 and 2070 were made using two Representative Concentration Pathways and two Global Circulation Models. All species' models showed a clear pattern of contraction under the explored scenarios; over 58 % of contemporary climatic distribution disappeared, suggesting that analyzed species face imminent extinction due to climatic habitat loss. The models are useful in representing the endemic component of Mexican alpine grassland by reciprocal correspondence in geographic distribution, and we consider it as a highly endangered ecosystem due to climate change, which is probably applicable to other tropical alpine ecosystems. The Pico de Orizaba volcano seems the best option to preserve due to its extension and elevation. However, further studies at finer scales are needed to improve in situ preservation and conservation strategies that include translocation, assisted migration and seed banking.

Shifting targets: spatial priorities for ex situ plant conservation depend on interactions between current threats, climate change, and uncertainty	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Few strategies for conservation seed banking consider current and climate threats simultaneously and few-if any-represent uncertainty inherent in the assessment process. Here we evaluate the vulnerability of 5148 populations of 71 rare plant species in the North American Central Highlands to current threat, threat from climate change, and their combination. We calculated priorities based on current threat using existing conservation status and protection, and priorities based on climate threat using ecological niche models and species-level traits related to reproduction and dispersal. Current- and climate-based priorities were integrated using a weighted average of rank priority. We managed uncertainty using either a precautionary strategy that avoids any extinctions or a resource-conservative strategy that directs attention to species known to be vulnerable with high certainty. Priorities based on current threats highlighted presently rare species while priorities based on climate threat emphasized presently common species. The location of geographic "hotspots" providing opportunities for efficient seed banking depended strongly on the weight of the climate module relative to the current module, the strategy used to handle uncertainty, and emissions scenario. Integrating threats highlighted some hotspots that were not identified using just current or climate threat, indicating the importance of considering current and climate threats simultaneously. Only the Central Basin of Tennessee, a known center of endemism, was consistently emphasized. We urge (1) integrating current and climate threats when designing seed-banking strategies; and (2) reporting of uncertainty in a manner that allows decision-makers to choose actions based on available resources and tolerable risk.

Tree establishment at treelines requires favorable climate, suitable microsites, and viable seeds. But most researches have been addressed treeline microclimate and its effects on tree regeneration, the knowledge of seed quantity and quality and its controls on seedling recruitment were limited. We measured seed rain, soil seed bank, seed germination rate and seedling recruitment in natural forests in combination with seed transplanting manipulation to evaluate the controls of seed quantity and quality on seedling recruitment of Abies georgei var. smithii (smith fir) along altitudinal gradient, with focus on treeline ecotone in the Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Both seed quantity and seed quality of smith fir decreased with increasing altitude and was thereby associated with decline in seed germination rate. Seed quantity and seedling recruitment were better in north-facing slope than in south slope. The treeline ecotone above 4200 m appeared as the threshold altitude to sharply decrease seed quality and seedling recruitment. The emergence and overwintering rates of transplanting seeds from 3600-3800 m also went down remarkably above 4200 m at north-facing slope. It also underpins the fact that treeline ecotone is the bottleneck of seedling recruitment. Our results suggest that seed quantity and quality are the principal limitation of treeline upward advance. This study also provides evidence to support stable treeline position in southeastern Tibetan Plateau.

Seed survival of the tropical tree Cryptocarya aschersoniana (Lauraceae): Consequences of habitat disturbance	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Seed survival in soil could be strongly influenced by habitat characteristics, but little is known about the behaviour of seeds sensitive to desiccation in seed banks installed in natural or disturbed habitats. Cryptocarya aschersoniana seeds disperse at the end of the rainy season but do not germinate immediately; thus, they may form seed banks in soil. This study evaluated the behaviour of C.aschersoniana seed banks induced in the natural environment of the species and in a disturbed area. Recently harvested C.aschersoniana germination units were characterized according to their water content, germination and viability. In 2011 and 2012, seed banks were established by burying samples of seeds in the understory of a semi-deciduous forest. In 2012, samples were also buried in a disturbed area. The seed banks were sampled at certain time intervals, and the samples were characterized as described above. Precipitation and air temperature data were collected. As a result, seeds in the seed bank established in the natural environment form a transient seed bank and showed the same behaviour in both years studied. A germination peak was observed starting 210 days after burial (coinciding with the onset of the rainy season) and reached germination percentages higher than 80% at the end of the experiment for both years. Seed mortality did not exceeded 28% in the natural environment. However, in the disturbed environment, the seeds lost their viability more rapidly, with 90% of the seeds becoming unviable 240 days after burial. Germinated seeds in the disturbed environment (maximum 21%) were not able to establish seedlings. These results underscore the importance of maintaining a natural, undisturbed forest for the conservation of this species.

Ectomycorrhizal fungal spore bank recovery after a severe forest fire: some like it hot	ISME JOURNAL												After severe wildfires, pine recovery depends on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal spores surviving and serving as partners for regenerating forest trees. We took advantage of a large, severe natural forest fire that burned our long-term study plots to test the response of ECM fungi to fire. We sampled the ECM spore bank using pine seedling bioassays and high-throughput sequencing before and after the California Rim Fire. We found that ECM spore bank fungi survived the fire and dominated the colonization of in situ and bioassay seedlings, but there were specific fire adapted fungi such as Rhizopogon olivaceotinctus that increased in abundance after the fire. The frequency of ECM fungal species colonizing pre-fire bioassay seedlings, post-fire bioassay seedlings and in situ seedlings were strongly positively correlated. However, fire reduced the ECM spore bank richness by eliminating some of the rare species, and the density of the spore bank was reduced as evidenced by a larger number of soil samples that yielded uncolonized seedlings. Our results show that although there is a reduction in ECM inoculum, the ECM spore bank community largely remains intact, even after a high-intensity fire. We used advanced techniques for data quality control with Illumina and found consistent results among varying methods. Furthermore, simple greenhouse bioassays can be used to determine which fungi will colonize after fires. Similar to plant seed banks, a specific suite of ruderal, spore bank fungi take advantage of open niche space after fires.

The plant secondary metabolite citral alters water status and prevents seed formation in Arabidopsis thaliana	PLANT BIOLOGY												Based on previous results, which showed that the secondary metabolite citral causes disturbances to plant water status, the present study is focused on demonstrating and detailing these effects on the water-related parameters of Arabidopsis thaliana adult plants, and their impact on plant fitness. Clear evidence of effects on water status and fitness were observed: plants treated with 1200 and 2400m citral showed decreased RWC, reduced (s), increased (w) and reduced stomatal opening, even 7days after the beginning of the experiment. Plant protection signals, such as leaf rolling or increased anthocyanin content, were also detected in these plants. In contrast, 14days after beginning the treatment, treated plants showed signs of citral-related damage. Moreover, the reproductive success of treated plants was critically compromised, with prematurely withered flowers and no silique or seed development. This effect of citral on fitness of adult plants suggests a promising application of this natural compound in weed management by reducing the weed seed bank in the soil.

Four plots were selected to represent the degradation gradients of alpine meadow on Tibetan plateau, namely normal meadow, lightly-degraded meadow, moderately-degraded meadow, and severely-degraded meadow. Soil cores were collected in two seasons, November of 2004 (after seed dispersal) and April of 2005 (before seedling emergence). Soil seed banks were examined by a seedling emergence method. Totals of 56 and 57 species were identified from soil seed bank of four plots in November and April, respectively. The mean size of the soil seed bank on the four plots varied between 2662 and 8026 seeds m-2 in November, and between 3744 and 9773 seeds m-2 in April. The difference in soil seed bank size between the two sampling times (November and April) was not significant within plots. Soil seed banks and above-ground vegetation presented the same trend with vegetation succession across the differently degraded meadows. In all plots, hemicryptophytes accounted for the majority of species and produced the largest number of seeds, of which the majority was weeds. In degraded meadows, the significant increase in weeds (species richness, plant density) changed species composition of soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation along degrading trend. The soil seed bank has important implications for vegetation succession and the restoration of species-diverse alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aims to evaluate the composition of seed banks in three successional stages of the lower montane peri-urban forest in Veracruz, Mexico, and experimentally determine the role of an exotic grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) in suppressing seed bank expression. For this, soil samples were collected from an abandoned pasture (P), a young secondary forest (SF), and an old secondary forest (F), and grass was experimentally removed in P. Seed density (seeds/m(2)) was higher in P (12,189 +/- A 2421), followed by SF (2825 +/- A 347) and F (3552 +/- A 865) with 76, 75 and 78 species, respectively. Tree seeds accounted for 1689 (P), 126 (SF) and 265 (F) emerged seedlings of 6, 8 and 6 tree species, respectively. The highest percentage of pioneer tree species was recorded in P seed banks (99 %). Similarity in tree species composition of the seed banks was higher between P and SF (Jaccard = 0.8) than between P and F (0.5). Similarity between soil seed bank tree species and tree standing vegetation was higher in P than in SF and F. Aboveground (1810 g/m(2)) and belowground (508 g/m(2)) biomass of C. plectostachyus is suppressing the emergence of individuals from the seed bank: when the grass was removed, nine woody species became established. Exotic grass removal in small nuclei may trigger early forest recovery through allowing the establishment of the tree species already present in the soil seed bank.

The riparian seasonal hydrological environment also has changed from summer flooding with winter drought to summer drought with winter flooding. The changes of riparian seed bank and vegetation were investigated to determine the effects of the seasonal flooding on the composition and spatial distribution of riparian soil seed bank and the similarity of seed bank to standing vegetation. Case description: We conducted intensive riparian soil sampling (525 samples) along altitude gradient in the Shanmu River, a tributary of the Yangzi River in the reservoir region of China. Seed bank density, species richness and composition of soil seed bank were examined using the seedling-emergence method. The seasonal hydrological conditions resulted in a decrease in species diversity and an increase in the distribution heterogeneity of the soil seed bank. The soil seed bank was composed of 48 species from 22 families and 40 genera. Most species were annual and perennial herbaceous Polygonaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae. Rumex dentatus was the predominant species accounting for 27.0 % of the total seeds. Diversity and composition of the seed bank changed along an altitude gradient and soil depth. Maximum species richness was found in the top soil layer at 165 m and 175 m above sea level. The mean overall seed density of the soil seed bank was 13,475.3 ind m(-2). Density and the number of seeds increased initially and then decreased with increased altitude. Maximum seed density (22,500.2 ind m(-2)) was found at 165 m above sea level in the intermediately flooded riverbank, with the seed number accounting for 27.8 % of the total soil seed bank. Average seed density declined significantly with soil depth. The similarity of seed bank to standing vegetation was relatively high. Discussion and Evaluation: The environmental heterogeneity created by the wide range and seasonal flooding led to the changes in biodiversity and seed density along altitude gradient. The seasonal flooding also led to the increase in the similarity of seed bank to standing vegetation as their composition both degraded. Conclusions: The seasonal flooding due to the dam reshape the composition and spatial distribution of riparian soil seed bank and limit the vegetation to a grassland dominated by a few annuals and perennials in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region.																	2193-1801					APR 21	2016	5								492	10.1186/s40064-016-2121-9							WOS:000375702500002	27186456					
J	Altenfelder, S; Kollmann, J; Albrecht, H				Altenfelder, Sara; Kollmann, Johannes; Albrecht, Harald			Effects of farming practice on populations of threatened amphibious plant species in temporarily flooded arable fields: implications for conservation management	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Intensification of land use has led to a severe decline of arable plants in the past decades, particularly among species of marginal habitats, such as temporarily flooded fields. Few studies have focused on the factors controlling the population dynamics of these species, and on suitable strategies for more effective conservation. To investigate the effects of farming practice on plant populations of temporarily flooded fields, we determined above-ground and below-ground densities of four annuals (Elatine alsinastrum, Limosella aquatica, Myosurus minimus and Peplis portula) in a 3-year on-farm experiment. A fully-factorial experiment combined the treatments soil tillage, presence of crops, fertilisation and herbicide application. Soil tillage had a positive effect on plant establishment, whereas herbicide application had a negative effect on the establishment of all study species. Plant densities were controlled by application of fertilisers and herbicides, with the most significant effects on L aquatica and M. minimus. Soil seed densities were mainly affected by environmental factors, but tillage also significantly reduced the seed densities of E. alsinastrum and P. portula. Other farming practices had a minor impact. Thus, reduced management can help in maintaining populations of rare amphibious plant species. The effect of different crops, crop rotation and the timing of management will help in developing the most appropriate management strategies for conservation of these plant species.

Tillage as a driver of change in weed communities: a functional perspective	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The adoption of non-inversion tillage practices has been widely promoted due to their potential benefits in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse emissions as well as improving soil fertility. However, the lack of soil inversion usually increases weed infestations and changes the composition of the weed community. Weed management is still a main drawback for the wider adoption of reduced tillage practices. However, it is not entirely clear whether these changes in weed communities are a consequence of non-random filters on the functional attributes of weed species and may thus affect the potential weed-crop competition relationship. Here, we analyse the changes in weed diversity, community composition, and the functional attributes of weed communities under reduced (non-inversion) and conventional (inversion) tillage. We discuss their potential effects on the competitiveness against crop production using data from two crops of seven on-going organic and low-input field trials in different climatic regions across Europe. Weeds were evaluated after post-emergence weed control methods. We used the community weighted mean values of the life form (annuals versus perennials), specific leaf area, seed weight, canopy height, seed bank longevity, soil nutrient conditions affinity, beginning of flowering and flowering span. Moreover, the effect of the crop type on the functional attributes was also evaluated. Overall, the tillage system affected the composition and functional attributes of the weed communities. Weed community changes may imply a reduction in weed-crop competition under both tillage systems. For instance, weed communities under reduced tillage were potentially less competitive because they were shorter and had less affinity to nutrients. On the other hand, weed communities under conventional tillage had potentially less seed production and a lower abundance of perennial species. Our study thus supports tillage as an important driver of the functional attributes of weed communities, but both tillage systems can have their downside. However, the crop type was overall more relevant than the tillage in determining most of the trait values of the weed communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aims to: (1) interpret the survival mechanisms of plants in arid desert ecosystems, especially for pioneer species; (2) interpret the links among distribution pattern, stress-gradients, and water use traits; (3) discuss the mechanisms and probable succession processes under natural fixation for artificial ecosystem rehabilitation; and (4) discuss the possibility of recognizing quantified water use traits as a predictor to compare the variations in adaptability among different species. We classified seven psammophytes into three major types in terms of water use: prodigal, moderate, and frugal plants. Results showed that vegetation cover of all the dominant species, including shrubs and herbs, was negatively correlated with diurnal transpiration at rhizosphere moisture (P<0.01, R-2=0.94). Herbaceous pioneer species (e.g., Agriophyllum squarrosum) survive harsh environments (shifting, hot and arid surface of dunes) by prodigal water use (high transpiration rate), low species cover, and fast production (high water use efficiency, which peaks at low soil moisture). By contrast, intrusive species (e.g., Eragrostis poaeoides) behaved as frugal plants to survive drought, thereby maintaining high vegetation cover and biomass, as well as soil water equilibration.																	1532-4982	1532-4990				APR 2	2016	30	2					166	180		10.1080/15324982.2015.1090498							WOS:000372085000004

WEED OCCURRENCE IN SUGARCANE AS FUNCTION OF VARIETY AND GROUND STRAW MANAGEMENT	PLANTA DANINHA												This study aims to verify the effect of crop varietal architecture and straw removal from planting rows in the occurrence of weeds in sugarcane and infer about the sustainability of the production system with no herbicide application. The experiment was established in 2011 in a randomized block design with split plots and four replications. Main plots were varieties IACSP95 5000 and SP91 1049. In the sub-plots there the straw removal was allocated (evenly scattered in the area, or concentrated in inter-rows). Assessments were conducted in 2012 and 2013 and the absolute levels of infestation, density, frequency and dominance of weed species were obtained. Areas were intra-characterized by the coefficients of Simpson and Shannon-Weiner and sustainability inferred by the SEP coefficient. Areas were grouped by the similarity coefficient of Jaccard. Other factors besides leaf architecture were more significant for level of infestation. Treatments with straw removal from planting rows were more infested than those with evenly scattered straw. In the second year of cultivation, those species most adapted to the system increased their importance value. Wild poinsettia was the dominant weed in all treatments, deserving attention from pre-planting on, to reducing its occurrence in the soil seed bank. Species diversity was higher where straw was evenly scattered due to the occurrence of species other than wild poinsettia. Sustainability was reduced from the first to the second year, indicating that only cultural practices are not enough, even with high shading provided by crop and straw production, demanding herbicides.

Mexico is center of this diversification, however studies that analyze the life cycles of these species are needed to help in population diagnostics and provide management information for their conservation. Mammillaria humboldtii is an endemic species of Hidalgo, currently listed as "threatened" by Mexican legislation (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010) and the IUCN lists it as "critically endangered". The study employed matrix projection models to evaluate a population of M. humboldtii within the Metztitlan Canyon Biosphere Reserve. A one year transition matrix was constructed from which the finite population growth rate (X) was determined. Changes in matrix elements corresponding to the permanence in the seed bank, transition from seed to seedling and adult stasis were simulated. The population growth rate was below unity (k = 0.7931, CI = 0.7797-0.8050) indicating a decreasing population over time. Stasis (S = 70.05 %) was the process that contributed the most towards k, followed by growth (G = 15.69 %). The highest reproductive value was for those adults in size class 3, and the simulations showed that increasing seedling establishment and survival of adults increased the value of lambda > 1, suggesting these processes as the main bottlenecks in the dynamics and population growth. Any management strategy for the in situ conservation of this species should consider long term monitoring of the population to ensure seedling establishment and survival or adults.

Genetic Diversity and Population Structure of the Endemic Disjunct Species, Helenium virginicum (Asteraceae)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Helenium virginicum is a narrowly endemic federally protected species, disjunct between Virginia and Missouri. To study the magnitude and distribution of genetic diversity within this species, we determined ISSR fingerprints and cpDNA haplotypes of plants in nine Virginia and eight Missouri populations. We found high ISSR diversity at the species level, with higher diversity in Virginia than Missouri. Additionally, moderately low diversity at the population level and high population structure suggests low gene flow among populations. Mean divergence between Virginia and Missouri populations was greater than between populations in either region. Missouri populations were more structured than Virginia populations. We found six distinct cpDNA haplotypes distributed among H. virginicum populations, with one found in both regions, two only in Virginia, and three only in Missouri. High genetic divergence among populations and between regions, the demographic asynchrony of populations, and self-incompatibility of the species suggest that clusters of populations in Missouri and Virginia be protected. These data will assist federal and state agencies deciding whether to delist and how to manage this species.																	0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2016	175	2					242	260									WOS:000376749200009

During exposure to the high temperatures of summer, seeds buried in the field became nondormant, but low water potential and supra-optimal temperatures (constant not alternating) induced them into secondary dormancy. The threshold temperature for dormancy induction (TTDI) was about 19 degrees C when water was not limiting germination, and it decreased with a slope of 10 degrees C per MPa as water potential decreased. Seeds had minimum dormancy (D-min) when T < TTDI, and D-min decreased by 81.5% per MPa increase in water potential. Dormancy induction increased linearly with a slope of 13.23% for each additional centimetre of burial depth from 1.0 to 5.19 cm. Dormancy was induced to its highest level (96%) in seeds buried at a depth of >= 5.19 cm; the remaining seeds were dead or were presumed to be dead Sinapis arvensis can form a persistent soil seed bank, and either water stress or conditions associated with increased burial depth can promote induction of secondary dormancy in the seeds.

Directional selection for flowering time leads to adaptive evolution in Raphanus raphanistrum (Wild radish)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Herbicides have been the primary tool for controlling large populations of yield depleting weeds from agro-ecosystems, resulting in the evolution of widespread herbicide resistance. In response, nonherbicidal techniques have been developed which intercept weed seeds at harvest before they enter the soil seed bank. However, the efficiency of these techniques allows an intense selection for any trait that enables weeds to evade collection, with early-flowering ecotypes considered likely to result in early seed shedding. Using a field-collected wild radish population, five recurrent generations were selected for early maturity and three generations for late maturity. Phenology associated with flowering time and growth traits were measured. Our results demonstrate the adaptive capacity of wild radish to halve its time to flowering following five generations of early-flowering selection.Early-maturing phenotypes had reduced height and biomass at maturity, leading to less competitive, more prostrate growth forms. Following three generations of late-flowering selection, wild radish doubled its time to flowering time leading to increased biomass and flowering height at maturity. This study demonstrates the potential for the rapid evolution in growth traits in response to highly effective seed collection techniques that imposed a selection on weed populations within agro-ecosystems at harvest.

Mathematically, our seed-bank coalescent appears as scaling limit in a Wright-Fisher model with geometric seed-bank age structure if the average time of seed dormancy scales with the order of the total population size N. This extends earlier results of Kaj, Krone and Lascoux [J. Appl. Probab. 38 (2011) 285-300] who show that the genealogy of a Wright-Fisher model in the presence of a "weak" seed-bank effect is given by a suitably time-changed Kingman coalescent. The qualitatively new feature of the seed-bank coalescent is that ancestral lineages are independently blocked at a certain rate from taking part in coalescence events, thus strongly altering the predictions of classical coalescent models. In particular, the seed-bank coalescent "does not come down from infinity," and the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample of size n grows like log log n. This is in line with the empirical observation that seed-banks drastically increase genetic variability in a population and indicates how they may serve as a buffer against other evolutionary forces such as genetic drift and selection.

J	Pinno, BD; Errington, RC				Pinno, Bradley D.; Errington, Ruth C.			Burn Severity Dominates Understory Plant Community Response to Fire in Xeric Jack Pine Forests	FORESTS												Fire is the most common disturbance in northern boreal forests, and large fires are often associated with highly variable burn severities across the burnt area. We studied the understory plant community response to a range of burn severities and pre-fire stand age four growing seasons after the 2011 Richardson Fire in xeric jack pine forests of northern Alberta, Canada. Burn severity had the greatest impact on post-fire plant communities, while pre-fire stand age did not have a significant impact. Total plant species richness and cover decreased with disturbance severity, such that the greatest richness was in low severity burns (average 28 species per 1-m(2) quadrat) and plant cover was lowest in the high severity burns (average 16%). However, the response of individual plant groups differed. Lichens and bryophytes were most common in low severity burns and were effectively eliminated from the regenerating plant community at higher burn severities. In contrast, graminoid cover and richness were positively related to burn severity, while forbs did not respond significantly to burn severity, but were impacted by changes in soil chemistry with increased cover at pH >4.9. Our results indicate the importance of non-vascular plants to the overall plant community in this harsh environment and that the plant community is environmentally limited rather than recruitment or competition limited, as is often the case in more mesic forest types. If fire frequency and severity increase as predicted, we may see a shift in plant communities from stress-tolerant species, such as lichens and ericaceous shrubs, to more colonizing species, such as certain graminoids.

They cause damage to biodiversity through loss, increased mortality or 'in situ' selection phenomena in natural flora. Spartium junceum is a Mediterranean shrub that is not native in most areas of the Iberian Peninsula, although it is extensively grown for the rehabilitation of roadsides. We have investigated the effect on the native vegetation of an old S. junceum (Fabaceae) plantation in a conservation area in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula: the Cuenca Alta del Manzanares nature reserve in Madrid. Methods We compared S. junceum stands with the native nanophanerophytic Cistus ladanifer community at different ecosystem properties: soil properties, temporal soil seed bank contents, standing vegetation and net primary production of annual grasslands growing in these shrublands. Important Findings The results highlighted S. junceum's ability to become established in the new environment (marginal areas of the nature reserve) and ensure its successful growth. This is more apparent in northern and eastern exposures where this formation contacts with the core of the best conserved native vegetation in the nature reserve. Soils under Spartium showed a higher nitrogen content, indicating its capacity-in common with other legumes-to fix N, and conferring an advantage over Cistus, which is N-limited. Other soil nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium and calcium and water availability are also higher in Spartium soils than in Cistus. Phosphorus is usually a constraint for N-fixers, but in our study, it is the most significant soil variable in both shrub formations and is important to the success of Spartium. Water availability is a key factor for Mediterranean vegetation, and particularly in autumn when soils are recharged. The Spartium formation is able to retain water as its growth produces a closer canopy than Cistus, thereby preventing water evaporation and contributing to the success of this species. Perennials are more frequent in the standing vegetation than in the seed bank, whereas therophytes are similar. The standing vegetation has therophytes and chamaephytes as the predominant growth forms in Spartium sites, and hemicryptophytes and phanerophytes in Cistus. Therophytes are dominant in Spartium and Cistus seed banks, although the first formation has more species. Spartium has a higher number of hemicryptophytes and Cistus is higher in phanerophytes. Northern and eastern aspects show significant differences in richness-with a predominance of annual weed species in Spartium-and in aboveground net primary production, probably as a consequence of the nutrients present in the soils. Ruderal annual species under Spartium (Bromus tectorum, Chenopodium album) have higher germination rates in the greenhouse than in the standing vegetation, suggesting they are at potential risk if environmental conditions change.

J	Fernandez-Pascual, E				Fernandez-Pascual, Eduardo			Comparative seed germination traits in bog and fen mire wetlands	AQUATIC BOTANY												Mires are continental wetlands of high scientific and conservation interest. Knowing the seed germination traits of mire species is essential for understanding their regeneration ecology and conducting active restoration policies. Here, a comparative study of seed germination traits was performed with 34 plant species from bog and fen communities, including many European indicators of these habitats. Freshly collected seeds were exposed to a laboratory germination experiment designed to characterize their response to (1) cold stratification and (2) simulated field temperatures. Germination strategy groups were interpreted according to these responses, and the relation between these groups and different mire types was discussed. Seeds of all tested species had physiological dormancy. Most of them showed conditional type 2 non-deep physiological dormancy: fresh seeds could germinate only at warm temperature, but attained the ability to germinate at colder temperature as they lost dormancy. Most mire species from bogs, poor fens and base-rich fens followed a warm germination strategy analogous to that of other wetland species. Species from this warm group responded to very warm temperatures which rarely occur in the field, and this was interpreted as a gap-detecting mechanism. In contrast, species from calcareous springs and flushes had a cold germination strategy, which would fit with the cold and stable soils where they occur. Finally, a group of species associated with the pioneer Rhynchosporion vegetation of bare peat areas had very low germination, suggesting an intermediate or deep seed dormancy and a long term seed bank.

An annual eelgrass bed was found bordering the perennial meadow. We monitored the morphology, growth and survival of Z. marina in both annual (AB, disturbed site) and perennial beds (PB, reference site) in Moon Lake from December 2012 to January 2014. Nearly all eelgrass shoots in AB were removed or buried in sediments due to clam harvesting, which occurred during low tides in the winter and early spring of 2012-13. Seedlings were observed in February 2013 right after the end of the clamming season. They were less abundant but exhibited higher survival rates in AB than in PB. In June, the newly established seedlings in the AB formed numerous patches, indicating that the disturbed site recovered via seedling recruitment. However, these annual plants could not survive the winter of 2013-14 as perennials did, including those free from clamming disturbance in experimental enclosures. The annual Z. marina bed had smaller plant size and much lower biomass, density and potential seed production than the perennial stand. The recovery of the disturbed bed probably mainly depended on seeds recruited from the nearby perennial bed where the potential seed production was much higher. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The precious coral Corallium rubrum is one of the most vulnerable resources in the Mediterranean Sea because of the high levels of human-related and natural mortality rates. The aim of the present study was to document the diversity and connectivity patterns among Sardinian Corallium rubrum populations focusing, in particular, on deep populations (> 80m depth) where the commercial exploitation is concentrated. 2. Microsatellite markers revealed high levels of inbreeding, heterozygote deficits, and significant genetic differentiation between and within areas at different depths, with an associated ` isolation by distance' pattern. 3. These results indicated that for precious coral populations in Sardinia the ` deep reef refugia hypothesis', that envisages the capacity for deep corals to act as seed banks for the shallower impaired (over-harvested) populations, is not supported. 4. The highest genetic diversity recorded in Sardinia for all areas and depths with respect to other Mediterranean areas indicates that the strict local management has been effective, since harvesting has not yet led to a substantial erosion of the genetic pool. 5. Possible causes for the high levels of observed diversity in Sardinia are discussed in relation to hydrological conditions, its geographical position and its proximity to some putative glacial refugia. 6. Thus, given the occurrence in Sardinia of highly diverse and differentiated deep-water populations of C. rubrum whose genetic diversity are important for the long-term resilience of the species, the results of the present study strongly support the close monitoring of harvesting, along with the maintenance or even strengthening of the current management and conservation measures (no-take protected areas) already in place in the area.

It is reported to the dug region the Penthorum chinense populations which is the threatened species the restored in 2001. Digging is done from 2000 to 2010 every year. Therefore, we investigated P. chinesne population of which extent to which region grew. As a result, it was shown some the growth of the plant of 200 individuals in the 2002 digging region, 4000 individuals in the 2001 digging region and 1000 individuals in the 2000 digging region, and so on. Though it is thought that the population formed in 2000 is seed bank origin, whether the populations formed in 2001 and later the burial seed origin or formed with the seed of an existing population, it is uncertain. Then we sampled 8 populations of the species form these areas, and studied them for allelic variation at 16 enzyme loci. There was no significant correlation between the actual population size and genetic diversity parameters, suggesting that the effective population size was very small even for the large populations. However, population that restored at the riverbed and population that approved on the embankment were able to distinguish obviously in the populations that had been approved in 2002. As for the population approved to the embankment, it was shown that genetic variation was very high in the population approved to the riverbed thought it was hardly admitted.

We hypothesize that dew deposition also assists in the non-mucilaginous seed germination of annual desert species. A common field dew treatment experiment was conducted in the Linze Inland River Basin Research Station to investigate the effects of dew deposition on the seed germination of four annual species, including Agriophyllum squarrosum, Corispermum mongolicum, Bassia dasyphylla and Halogeton arachnoideus. The results showed that the presence of dew significantly increased seed germination percentages and decreased the nonviable seed percentages of B. dasyphylla and H. arachnoideus, whereas there was no such trend for the seeds of C. mongolicum and A. squarrosum. The ecological effects of dew on the seed germination and viability of the annual desert plants were species specific. Although dew wetting is insufficient to cause seed germination, it may help in priming the seeds.																	1674-6767	2194-7783				APR	2016	8	2					264	271		10.1007/s40333-015-0014-3							WOS:000373138000010						
J	Torra, J; Royo-Esnal, A; Recasens, J				Torra, Joel; Royo-Esnal, Aritz; Recasens, Jordi			Temperature and Light Requirements for Germination and Emergence of Three Arable Papaveraceae Species	WEED SCIENCE												This research investigated the temperature and light requirements for seed germination and emergence patterns of pinnate poppy, violet horned-poppy, and nodding hypecoum, three annual Papaveraceae species found in arable lands in the Mediterranean region. Two experiments performed in growth chambers (1) analyzed light (complete darkness or 12 h light) and temperature (10/5, 15/5, and 20/10 C day/night temperatures) requirements for germination, and (2) determined base temperature (T-b) for germination. An outdoor pot trial was also set up to study emergence patterns. All species showed higher germination in complete darkness than they did with a light regime, irrespective of dormancy level, time of the year, and temperature regime under which germination was tested, illustrating better germination when seeds are buried. T-b ranged from -2.6 to 0 C, depending on the species, indicating low temperature requirements for germination. Given their higher germination in daily fluctuating, rather than constant temperatures, the three Papaveraceae species should have the capacity to form persistent seed banks. These species behaved as winter annuals (from November to February) in the pot experiment and had difficulties to emerge in spring.

Germination rates of weedy radish populations (Raphanus spp.) altered by crop-wild hybridisation, not human-mediated changes to soil moisture	WEED RESEARCH												Cultivated plants are known to readily hybridise with their wild relatives, sometimes forming populations with weedier life-history strategies than their progenitors. Due to altered precipitation patterns from human-induced global climate change, crop-wild hybrid populations may have new and unpredictable environmental tolerances relative to parental populations, which would further challenge farming and land-management weed control strategies. To recognise the role of seed dormancy variation in weed invasion, we compared seedbank dynamics of two cross-type populations (wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, and crop-wild hybrid radish, R.raphanistrumxR.sativus) across a soil moisture gradient. In a seed-burial experiment, we assessed relative rates of seed germination, dormancy and seed mortality over twoyears across cross types (crop-wild hybrid or wild) and watering treatments (where water was withheld, equal to annual rainfall, or double annual rainfall). Weekly population censuses in 2012 and 2013 assessed the frequency and timing of seedling emergence within a growing season. Generally, germination rates were two times higher and seed dormancy was 58% lower in hybrid versus wild populations. Surprisingly, experimental soil moisture conditions did not determine seedbank dynamics over time. Yet, seed bank dynamics changed between years, potentially related to different amounts of annual rainfall. Thus, variation in seedbank dynamics may be driven by crop-wild hybridisation rates and, potentially, annual variation in soil moisture conditions.

Diuron tolerance and potential degradation by pelagic microbiomes in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon	PEERJ												Diuron is a herbicide commonly used in agricultural areas where excess application causes it to leach into rivers, reach sensitive marine environments like the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon and pose risks to marine life. To investigate the impact of diuron on whole prokaryotic communities that underpin the marine food web and are integral to coral reef health, GBR lagoon water was incubated with diuron at environmentally-relevant concentration (8 mu g/L), and sequenced at specific time points over the following year. 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling revealed no significant short-or long-term effect of diuron on microbiome structure. The relative abundance of prokaryotic phototrophs was not significantly altered by diuron, which suggests that they were largely tolerant at this concentration. Assembly of a metagenome derived from waters sampled at a similar location in the GBR lagoon did not reveal the presence of mutations in the cyanobacterial photosystem that could explain diuron tolerance. However, resident phages displayed several variants of this gene and could potentially play a role in tolerance acquisition. Slow biodegradation of diuron was reported in the incubation flasks, but no correlation with the relative abundance of heterotrophs was evident. Analysis of metagenomic reads supports the hypothesis that previously uncharacterized hydrolases carried by low-abundance species may mediate herbicide degradation in the GBR lagoon. Overall, this study offers evidence that pelagic phototrophs of the GBR lagoon may be more tolerant of diuron than other tropical organisms, and that heterotrophs in the microbial seed bank may have the potential to degrade diuron and alleviate local anthropogenic stresses to inshore GBR ecosystems.

Lack of Host Specialization on Winter Annual Grasses in the Fungal Seed Bank Pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda	PLOS ONE												Generalist plant pathogens may have wide host ranges, but many exhibit varying degrees of host specialization, with multiple pathogen races that have narrower host ranges. These races are often genetically distinct, with each race causing highest disease incidence on its host of origin. We examined host specialization in the seed pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda by reciprocally inoculating pathogen strains from Bromus tectorum and from four other winter annual grass weeds (Bromus diandrus, Bromus rubens, Bromus arvensis and Taeniatherum caput-medusae) onto dormant seeds of B. tectorum and each alternate host. We found that host species varied in resistance and pathogen strains varied in aggressiveness, but there was no evidence for host specialization. Most variation in aggressiveness was among strains within populations and was expressed similarly on both hosts, resulting in a positive correlation between strain-level disease incidence on B. tectorum and on the alternate host. In spite of this lack of host specialization, we detected weak but significant population genetic structure as a function of host species using two neutral marker systems that yielded similar results. This genetic structure is most likely due to founder effects, as the pathogen is known to be dispersed with host seeds. All host species were highly susceptible to their own pathogen races. Tolerance to infection (i.e., the ability to germinate even when infected and thereby avoid seed mortality) increased as a function of seed germination rate, which in turn increased as dormancy was lost. Pyrenophora semeniperda apparently does not require host specialization to fully exploit these winter annual grass species, which share many life history features that make them ideal hosts for this pathogen.																	1932-6203					MAR 7	2016	11	3							e0151058	10.1371/journal.pone.0151058							WOS:000371990100086	26950931

Strategies for ex situ conservation of Centaurea cineraria subsp. circae (Asteraceae), an endemic plant from Lazio (Italy)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Centaurea cineraria subsp. circae is an endemic plant with a distribution area limited to Circeo mountain (Lazio, Italy), whose population was estimated in a very low number of individuals. The aim of this work was to investigate ex situ conservation strategies such as achene collection and in vitro plant propagation, which will permit to carry out restoration programmes. The test carried out on the achenes demonstrated that only 5.5% of them were morphologically healthy. Seed germination tests showed that seeds do not display dormancy and that germination does not require pre-treatments. The higher germination rate (67.5%) was observed under a photoperiod of 12/12h (light/dark) and temperature regime +20/+10 degrees C. The in vitro studies demonstrated that micropropagation, acclimatization and the transfer outdoors of C. cineraria subsp. circae are not particularly difficult: 74% of shoot explants in a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium added with 0.5mg/l benzylaminopurine and 2mg/l kinetin formed multiple shoots; 100% of shoots rooted in the MS medium added with 0.5mg/l indole-3-butyric acid and over 90% survived the acclimatization phase. After been transferred outdoors, the totality of in vitro-propagated plants bloomed and appeared morphologically indistinguishable from wild plants. Preliminary chemical analyses showed a similar profile for in vitro-propagated and wild plants.

ROLE OF DISPERSAL TIMING AND FREQUENCY IN ANNUAL GRASS-INVADED GREAT BASIN ECOSYSTEMS: HOW MODIFYING SEEDING STRATEGIES INCREASES RESTORATION SUCCESS	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Seed dispersal dynamics strongly affect plant community assembly in restored annual grass-infested ecosystems. Modifying perennial grass seeding rates and frequency may increase perennial grass establishment, yet these impacts have not yet been quantified. To assess these effects, we established a field experiment consisting of 288 plots (1 m(2)) in an eastern Oregon annual grass-dominated shrubsteppe ecosystem. In this study, the amount, timing, and frequency of perennial grass seeding events, soil moisture availability, and annual grass seed bank density were manipulated. We found that more frequent perennial grass seeding events combined with high perennial grass seeding rates produced the highest perennial grass density and biomass 2 years following seeding. However, we also found that if annual grass seed density was 1500 seeds . m(-2) or higher, perennial grass density and biomass decreased, regardless of seeding strategy. Because of this finding, it appears that a threshold is crossed between 150 and 1500 annual grass seeds . m(-2). Adding water in the first growing season initially facilitated perennial grass establishment but only produced higher perennial grass density following the second growing season when annual grass density was lowest. Assessing the existing annual grass seed bank prior to seeding can likely forecast restoration outcomes because high annual grass seed densities likely interfere with and reduce perennial grass recruitment. In addition, if annual grass seeding density is 1500 seeds . m(-2) or lower, modifying the temporal patterns of perennial grass seed arrival will increase the likelihood that a perennial grass seed finds a safe-site.

J	Kurova, J				Kurova, Jana			The impact of soil properties and forest stand age on the soil seed bank	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												The chemical composition and mechanical attributes of soil directly influence the environment in the soil seed bank, and both of these properties change with the age of the forest stand. This study, which addresses the impact of soil properties and stand age on the structure of the soil seed bank, was conducted in the forest district of Valtice in the southern Czech Republic. The soil seed bank was sampled across different ages of forest stands. The soil properties were measured for each sample, and a seed separation method was used. A total of 14,340 seeds from 94 species were found. Three species, Urtica dioica, Circaea lutetiana and Moehringia trinervia, dominated the soil seed bank, accounting for 62 % of the total seeds. Four variables influenced the composition of the soil seed bank: soil porosity, volumetric moisture content, forest stand age and total cover of trees. Seed density and species richness in the soil seed bank decreased with increasing age of the forest stand. The results show that the soil seed bank is much more strongly influenced by forest age and total cover of the tree layer than by the tested soil properties.																	1211-9520	1874-9348				MAR	2016	51	1					27	37		10.1007/s12224-016-9236-1							WOS:000380142100003

Bringing together knowledge from literary, historical, religious, medical, and scientific sources, we trace the ways in which the plant's cultural story has been informed by its cultivation (accidental and otherwise) by humans. Darnel is a man-made plant that evolved from a perennial progenitor and was subject to the same human-mediated selection pressures as the ancestral cereal species it infested. The toxicity of darnel grains is due to a cocktail of phytochemicals secreted by genetically complex endophytic fungi of the genus Epichloe, closely related to ergot (Claviceps purpurea). We show how darnel's reputation as a poisonous cereal mimic that corrupts the food-chain made the plant a symbol of malign subversion, notably invoked in crises around religious heterodoxy and political subversion. We consider the ways in which literary allusions, from Shakespeare to Dickens, identified the corrupting influence of darnel with psychological and social breakdown. Darnel is classified as extinct in the United Kingdom and other developed countries with intensive agriculture, and its significance as a food chain contaminant and literary and religious symbol is vanishing from experience and understanding. This paper, then, is intended to serve as a textual seed bank to collect darnel's cultural traces, and to demonstrate the ways in which the plant has annotated key debates and moments of crisis in human history.																	0278-0771	2162-4496				MAR	2016	36	1					29	44		10.2993/0278-0771-36.1.29							WOS:000377539900003

"USEFUL TO US IN UNKNOWN WAYS": SEED CONSERVATION AND THE QUEST FOR NOVEL HUMAN-PLANT RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY												Contemporary environmental threats inspire the formation of new global communities and relationships: networks that both transcend nations and local environmental interactions and forge novel assemblages of human and non-human collaborations in a bid to "reset their modes of being" (Scott 2013: 864). The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership (MSBP), for example, is the largest ex situ plant conservation project in the world and brings together partners from over 80 countries in an endeavor to conserve seeds from rare, wild plant species. As the potential use of the wild plant becomes increasingly central to the conservation relationship at the MSBP and implicated within a wider discourse on the neoliberalization of conservation, this paper explores how the term "use" may in fact encompass a nascent desire to reframe the human-plant relationship. By critically evaluating the values and intentions behind the quest for novel plant-uses by those who work within the MSBP, this paper examines the implications of seed-saving within a contemporary conservation institution. For those involved, rather than objectifying and creating a utilitarian relationship with nature, the concept of use is indicative of an aspiration to foster intimate, reciprocal relationships with their non-human counterparts, operating within an ontology in which humans and plants are interdependent. This paper argues that at a time when sustaining ontological diversity is key to ensuring cultural resilience and adaptation to environmental challenges, it is vital that ethnobiologists engage not only with traditional models, but also explore what innovative, intentional relationships with nature may be emerging from within conservation.																	0278-0771	2162-4496				MAR	2016	36	1					66	84		10.2993/0278-0771-36.1.66							WOS:000377539900005

Roads with high traffic densities in urban regions may facilitate the invasion of alien plants. The present study examined the effects of road type and distance to the city centre on native and alien plant species in both the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank of road verges in originally dry steppe grasslands in the surroundings of Pavlodar, Western Siberia, Kazakhstan. This region is characterized by a recent change of land use and rapidly expanding urbanization. Vegetation surveys were conducted at 12 sites distributed along roads with different traffic densities (national and local roads) and at two distances to the city centre (city edge and rural surroundings). The seedling-emergence method was used to examine the soil seed bank at each site. We found a larger percentage of alien species along national roads (42 % in the aboveground vegetation, 57 % in the soil seed bank) than along local roads (20 and 44 %, respectively), which can be explained by differences in traffic density, location from which the vehicles come and habitat conditions. More alien species were found in the road verges at the city edge than in the rural surroundings along both road types, probably due to the spread of propagules from residential areas. Our study demonstrates that national roads are important pathways for the introduction of alien species in this Western Siberian region.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				MAR	2016	217	3					241	252		10.1007/s11258-016-0565-1							WOS:000376271900002

Local population of Eritrichium caucasicum as an object of mathematical modelling. I. Life cycle graph and a nonautonomous matrix model	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												For the plant species, which is considered a short-lived perennial, we have composed a scale of ontogenetic stages and the life cycle graph (LCG) according to annual observations on permanent sample plots in an Alpine lichen heath during the 2009-2014 period. The LCG that reflects seeds reproduction has been reduced to the one that avoids the stage of soil seed bank, yet preserves the arcs,of annual recruitment. The corresponding matrix model of stage-structured population dynamics has four stages: juvenile plants (including seedlings), virginal, generative, and 'terminally generative' (the plants die after seed production). Model calibration reduces to directly calculating the rates of transition between stages and those of delays within stages from the data of only one time step, while keeping the two reproduction rates uncertain, yet confined to the quantitative bounds of observed recruitment. This has enabled us to determine a feasible range for the dominant eigenvalue of the model matrix, i.e., the quantitative bounds for the measure of how the local population adapts to its environment, at each of the five time steps, resulting in a formally nonautonomous model. To obtain 'age-specific parameters' from a stage-classified model, we have applied the technique that constructs a virtual absorbing Markov chain and calculates its fundamental matrix. In a nonautonomous model, the estimates of life expectancy also depend on the time of observation (that fixes certain environmental conditions), and vary from two to nearly seven years. The estimates reveal how specifically short lives the short-lived perennial, while their range motivates the task to average the model matrices over the whole period of observation. The model indicates that Eritrichium caucasicum plants spend the most part of their life span in the virginal stage under each of the environment conditions observed, thus revealing the place retention strategy by C. Korner (2003), or the delayed-development strategy by L.A. Zhukova (1995). We discuss the prospects of model experiments with a logically nonautonomous model to forecast the long-term dynamics of E. caucasicum under a scenario of climate changes.					, Iya/0000-0001-6512-677X; Logofet, Dmitrii/0000-0001-5229-6534												0044-4596					MAR-APR	2016	77	2					106	121									WOS:000375628400002	27266016

In this study, we analyzed the quality and germination behavior of seeds from different populations' located on a west-east annual precipitation gradient (500 to 150 mm) in four species of native Patagonian forage grasses (Bromus setifolius, Festuca pallescens, Hordeum comosum and Poa ligularis), from NW Chubut. We observed differences in weight and percentage of filled seeds at inter- and intra-specific level. The seeds were sown in a common environment and the germination percentage and emergence speed were calculated for species and populations. We present data related to the germination of seeds (harvested in 2015) of these four species and we discuss primarily the results obtained from P. ligularis, the species that presented the highest inter-populational variability. In P ligularis, a large percentage of seeds from the population of the driest site germinated/emerged in fewer days. This characteristic could be associated with these plants adapting physiologically to germinate, emerge and establish themselves quickly in response to the limited availability of water in this area. The genotypes of this particular population could be used for restoration programs in arid environments with annual rainfall less than 150 mm. Finally, due to the variability observed at least in P. ligularis, it is suggested for future breeding programs with these native species it would be necessary to analyze a greater number of populations to select potential seed banks.																	1851-2372					MAR	2016	51	1					89	98		10.31055/1851.2372.v51.n1.14417							WOS:000375176300008

Overwintering seeds as reservoirs for seedling pathogens of wetland plant species	ECOSPHERE												Seed germination and seedling establishment are central to the distribution and abundance of plant species in wetlands. While fungal and oomycete pathogens are known to affect seed viability and emergence, relatively little is known about which fungi and oomycetes are associated with seeds in the soil or how these species affect seeds and seedlings. We characterized the fungi and oomycetes associated with overwintering seeds in wetlands and determined their potential to influence seed germination and subsequent seedling mortality. Fungi and oomycetes did not affect seed germination, despite the isolation of high frequencies of known seed and seedling pathogens in the fungal genera Alternaria, Peyronellaea, Epicoccum, and Fusarium. However, many of the most frequently isolated fungal species from overwintering seeds were highly virulent to seedlings. While both native and nonnative plant species were tested, we did not observe consistent differences in either seed germination or seedling susceptibility based on the invasive status of plants tested, contrary to what we expected given several established hypotheses for invasive success. The high seedling virulence of fungi from overwintering seeds coupled with the differential abundance of some of the more pathogenic fungi among seeds of different plant species, led us to the conclusion that the fungal pathogens that colonize seeds in the seed bank over winter are likely to strongly impact subsequent seedling establishment in wetlands the following spring despite not reducing overwintering seed germination in the seed bank or differently effecting invasive plant species.																	2150-8925					MAR	2016	7	3							e01281	10.1002/ecs2.1281							WOS:000374896800034

A leading, practical obstacle to their widespread use is producing plant-based vaccines that meet governmental regulatory requirements. Here, we report the first production according to current Good Manufacturing Practices of a rice-based vaccine, the cholera vaccine MucoRice-CTB, at an academic institution. To this end, we established specifications and methods for the master seed bank (MSB) of MucoRice-CTB, which was previously generated as a selection-marker-free line, evaluated its propagation, and given that the stored seeds must be renewed periodically. The production of MucoRice-CTB incorporated a closed hydroponic system for cultivating the transgenic plants, to minimize variations in expression and quality during vaccine manufacture. This type of molecular farming factory can be operated year-round, generating three harvests annually, and is cost-and production-effective. Rice was polished to a ratio of 95 % and then powdered to produce the MucoRice-CTB drug substance, and the identity, potency, and safety of the MucoRice-CTB product met preestablished release requirements. The formulation of MucoRice-CTB made by fine-powdering of drug substance and packaged in an aluminum pouch is being evaluated in a physician-initiated phase I study.																	0721-7714	1432-203X				MAR	2016	35	3					667	679		10.1007/s00299-015-1911-9							WOS:000371241100014	26661780					
J	Cochrane, A				Cochrane, Anne			Can sensitivity to temperature during germination help predict global warming vulnerability?	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed germination is vital for persistence in species that rely on seeds for post-disturbance regeneration. It is a high-risk phase and vulnerable to environmental parameters. Here, I assessed temperature sensitivity for germination in Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae) from south-western Australia, screening all 38 endemic obligate seeder species. A bi-directional temperature gradient plate with 49 temperature combinations (constant and fluctuating) between 5 and 40 degrees C was used to profile germination temperature requirements and identify upper and lower temperature thresholds for germination. Using these data the impact of increasing temperatures on germination in these species was modelled under high and low greenhouse gas scenarios for 2050 and 2070. The results suggest that many Banksia species from the region have wide physiological tolerance for high germination temperatures, although a number of common, but geographically restricted species, such as B. praemorsa, B. oreophila and B. quercifolia, have more narrow temperature windows for germination than at least one of the rarer species (B. verticillata). Only B. dryandroides is expected to decline in germination in the future; however, the optimal germination timing for many species is predicted to occur later under climate warming. In conjunction with declining rainfall, this germination delay will place seedlings closer to the summer dry in this seasonal Mediterranean-climate ecosystem and thus they will be more vulnerable to desiccation. The framework developed here can be used to identify vulnerable species for monitoring of early population decline.																	0960-2585	1475-2735				MAR	2016	26	1					14	29		10.1017/S0960258515000355							WOS:000371157600002

Environmental drivers of demographic variation across the global geographical range of 26 plant species	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Understanding how rates of reproduction and survival respond to environmental variation across species' geographical ranges is a key task for both basic and applied ecology. So far, however, environmental drivers of range-wide demographic variation have only been studied in a few plant species without considering the potentially confounding effects of population density on demographic rates. We present a large-scale demographic study of 26 shrub species (Proteaceae) from the Cape Floristic Region. All study species have a fire-dependent life cycle and are serotinous: they exclusively form a canopy seed bank which contains the seeds produced since the last fire. Fire triggers seed release from the canopy so that recruitment is largely limited to a short period after fire. Across the global geographical ranges of the study species, we collected 3454 population-level records of total fecundity since the last fire (size of individual canopy seed banks), per-capita recruitment (ratio between post-fire recruits and pre-fire adults) and adult fire survival. We used linear regressions to quantify how climate, population density, fire interval and soil nutrients affect demographic variation. A trade-off between survival and reproduction is evident throughout the geographical ranges of our study species: resprouting species with fire-protected buds had much higher fire survival than nonsprouters without fire-protected buds (97% vs. 2%) but they also had substantially lower fecundity and recruitment rates. We found little intraspecific variation in fire survival rates but considerable intraspecific variation in fecundity and recruitment. Range-wide variation in fecundity was dominated by fire interval whereas recruitment was mostly climate-driven. Population density and soil nutrients generally had smaller effects but were important for the fecundity and recruitment of several species. Effects of fire interval on fecundity were consistent across species, but other demography-environment relationships showed substantial interspecific differentiation.Synthesis. This study extends demographic research beyond the population to cover the geographical ranges of multiple species. Such large-scale studies are a necessary first step of a research agenda that aims to understand how range dynamics emerge from first principles of demography, how they are shaped by functional traits and macroevolution and how they will be impacted by global change.

Persistence versus extinction for a class of discrete-time structured population models	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												We provide sharp conditions distinguishing persistence and extinction for a class of discrete-time dynamical systems on the positive cone of an ordered Banach space generated by a map which is the sum of a positive linear contraction A and a nonlinear perturbation G that is compact and differentiable at zero in the direction of the cone. Such maps arise as year-to-year projections of population age, stage, or size-structure distributions in population biology where typically A has to do with survival and individual development and G captures the effects of reproduction. The threshold distinguishing persistence and extinction is the principal eigenvalue of provided by the Krein-Rutman Theorem, and persistence is described in terms of associated eigenfunctionals. Our results significantly extend earlier persistence results of the last two authors which required more restrictive conditions on G. They are illustrated by application of the results to a plant model with a seed bank.

J	Rijal, S; Cochard, R				Rijal, Samridhi; Cochard, Roland			Invasion of Mimosa pigra on the cultivated Mekong River floodplains near Kratie, Cambodia: farmers' coping strategies, perceptions, and outlooks	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Mimosa pigra, an alien woody weed, invaded the Mekong River Basin since similar to 1970 and now covers vast floodplain areas in virtual monocultures. The prickly plants produce abundant seeds which are dispersed annually by the floods. Mimosa thus represents a burden to farming communities in Cambodia where agricultural capacities are weak. To obtain information on infestations as well as farmers' management practices and perceptions, 81 farmers were interviewed on their fields (using questionnaires) in affected areas near Kratie municipality. Data on infestations were collected at landscape and field levels. Furthermore, villagers' groups and key informants were interviewed (open questions). Infestations covered similar to 30 % of the land near fields. On average, farmers spent 11 days per hectare annually clearing mimosa. The weed represented a major cost, but other issues (animal pests, water shortages, lack of resources) were equally important; these may be connected with mimosa invasion. Farmers mostly expressed support for ideas to combat surrounding infestations, but support depended on experiences and assets at stake. Most were unconvinced that mimosa could be eliminated from the study site. Conceivable benefits of mimosa were regarded as insignificant. Given the currently few realistic options for significantly improving management, further research is suggested within adaptive management frameworks.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				MAR	2016	16	3			SI		681	693		10.1007/s10113-015-0776-3							WOS:000370178000009

El Nino Southern Oscillation drives conflict between wild carnivores and livestock farmers in a semiarid area in Chile	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The warm phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events results in greatly elevated rainfall in north-central Chile, with dramatic effects on small mammals and vertebrate carnivore abundances. In ensuing cool phases of ENSO, plant cover decreases, followed by small mammal densities, in turn affecting the resource availability for their predators. Wild carnivores such as foxes are one of the main predators of small mammals; when the latter decline, foxes could exhibit functional responses, increasing their consumption of domestic livestock. To our knowledge, the influence of native prey abundance on livestock predation has not been assessed. We hypothesize that periods of scarce native prey increases conflicts between carnivores and farmers outside protected areas, especially during drought years. From 1990 to 2005 we used live trapping to determine monthly density of small mammals in a national park (Bosque Fray Jorge National Park, BFJNP) in north-central Chile; rainfall was also monitored. We calculated an index of predation as the number of sheep predated by foxes annually on one farm (encompassing ca. 45,000 ha) located in the vicinity of BFJNP: Path analysis was carried out to assess factors influencing sheep predation by wild foxes. Factors included precipitation and small mammal density. Small mammal density correlated positively with two years moving average of rainfall. Sheep predation by foxes increased after of two years of low rainfall. Our findings suggest that wild carnivores employ functional responses in response to varying prey availability, shifting from wild to domestic prey during periods of drought, which could have important conservation and management implications.

Using Remotely Sensed Imagery to Document How Land Use Drives Turbidity of Playa Waters in Texas	REMOTE SENSING												Sedimentation (primarily from human land use) is a major threat to runoff-fed wetlands of the Great Plains of North America (playas), but it is unknown how many playas are turbid, how prevalence of turbidity has changed over time, and how turbidity is related to surrounding land use. We used remotely sensed imagery to assess sedimentation in the waters of over 7700 playa basins in Texas on four dates during a 29-year span: 25 July 1986 (a regionally wet time), 3 May 2014 (during drought), 4 June 2014 (after the drought was broken), and 25 July 2015 (one year post-drought). Even on the wettest date examined, 64% of playa basins did not hold water. Turbidity varied over time, was already present in over half of the basins examined in 1986, and prevalence of turbidity was not simply proportional to overall wet playa abundance. There was an increase in total and irrigated cropland in our focal region and a statistically significant association between sedimentation and land use within 100 m of a playa: clear playas were associated with more urban development and pasture/grassland, and turbid playas were surrounded mostly by cropland.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030192							WOS:000373627400079

Identifying and ameliorating nutrient limitations to reconstructing a forest ecosystem on mined land	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Nutrient deficiency is commonly a limiting factor in reconstructing ecosystems on disturbed areas such as mines, quarries, and construction sites. An open-cut coal mine in southeastern Australia is being used as a model to explore strategies for reconstructing a sustainable forest ecosystem on a spoil substrate. This study aimed to identify the nutrients limiting forest establishment and ways of ameliorating these. A pot trial, using two endemic Myrtaceae tree species, found that nitrogen was the most growth-limiting nutrient followed by phosphorus. To overcome these spoil nutrient deficiencies, a field trial compared the application of forest topsoil to the addition of two rates of inorganic fertilizer, gypsum, or biosolids on the response of a range of native forest plant species directly seeded into the substrate. Only biosolids significantly increased total nitrogen levels in the spoil. However, all treatments significantly decreased spoil pH, thereby increasing nutrient availability. Topsoil produced the highest plant density of native species due to contributions from its seed bank. Biosolids increased growth of Corymbia maculata. The higher rate of fertilizer addition improved seedling establishment of Mimosaceae and the survival of Myrtaceae species. High nutrient treatments increased weed and grass densities, which may have reduced the nutrient benefit for native species. In conclusion, biosolids and the high rate of fertilizer application ameliorated the nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency of spoil to support growth and survival of reintroduced native species. However, potential benefits were attenuated by competition from accompanying weed growth that could be managed by implementing a control program.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	2016	24	2					202	211		10.1111/rec.12294							WOS:000372282900009

Underground Mechanisms of Parasitism and Associated Strategies for their Control: A Review	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Broomrapes are plant-parasitic weeds which constitute one of the most difficult-to control of all biotic constraints that affect crops in Mediterranean, central and eastern Europe, and Asia. Due to their physical and metabolic overlap with the crop, their underground parasitism, their achlorophyllous nature, and hardly destructible seed bank, broomrape weeds are usually not controlled by management strategies designed for non-parasitic weeds. Instead, broomrapes are in current state of intensification and spread due to lack of broomrape-specific control programs, unconscious introduction to new areas and may be decline of herbicide use and global warming to a lesser degree. We reviewed relevant facts about the biology and physiology of broomrape weeds and the major feasible control strategies. The points of vulnerability of some underground events, key for their parasitism such as crop-induced germination or haustorial development are reviewed as inhibition targets of the broomrape-crop association. Among the reviewed strategies are those aimed (1) to reduce broomrape seed bank viability, such as fumigation, herbigation, solarization and use of broomrape-specific pathogens; (2) diversion strategies to reduce the broomrape ability to timely detect the host such as those based on promotion of suicidal germination, on introduction of allelochemical interference, or on down-regulating host exudation of germination-inducing factors; (3) strategies to inhibit the capacity of the broomrape seedling to penetrate the crop and connect with the vascular system, such as biotic or abiotic inhibition of broomrape radicle growth and crop resistance to broomrape penetration either natural, genetically engineered or elicited by biotic- or abiotic-resistance-inducing agents; and (4) strategies acting once broomrape seedling has bridged its vascular system with that of the host, aimed to impede or to endure the parasitic sink such as those based on the delivery of herbicides via haustoria, use of resistant or tolerant varieties and implementation of cultural practices improving crop competitiveness.

Lack of fine-scale genetic structure and distant mating in natural populations of Fucus vesiculosus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) within populations reflects the dispersal behaviour of genes and individuals. Here we studied very small-scale SGS and mating patterns in the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus, a dioecious marine broadcast spawner with immediate settlement upon gamete release, which is predicted to strongly restrict gene flow. We estimated SGS, inbreeding and kinship for adults and recruits from habitats with contrasting exposures and patchiness (open coast and estuarine ecosystems) using microsatellite loci. Heterozygote deficiency was found for most adult populations but it was even higher for recruits, indicating inbreeding depression. At the fine spatial resolution of this study there was no spatial genetic structuring for 3 of the 5 populations studied across different habitats. Habitat could not explain the unrestricted gene flow in some populations. In the kinship analyses, we identified more putative mothers than fathers, suggesting that male gamete dispersal mediates gene flow at broader distances. However, the vast majority of the parents of the recruits could not be found among the adults sampled nearby, indicating unrestricted gene flow at these small scales. We propose 3 nonexclusive hypotheses for our findings: (1) unrestricted gene flow, (2) inbreeding depression eliminating most inbred individuals resulting from nearby related parents, (3) temporal Wahlund effects, mediated by a hypothetic genetic pool of a bank of microscopic forms persisting from previous generations.

Seeds are generally considered to be the main method for this species to colonise new habitat, but little is known quantitatively about the seed dispersal capacity and post-dispersal fate (i.e., germination and survival time). We measured the duration of seed flotation, seed persistence and seed germination of S. alterniflora in three intertidal zones [low intertidal zone (LIT), middle intertidal zone (MIT) and high intertidal zone (HIT)] in the Yangtze Estuary on the eastern coast of China. The results showed that (1) the flotation time of S. alterniflora seeds ranged from 3 to 13 days, and the values were higher in HIT and MIT than in LIT; (2) the period of seed germination was from February to June, mainly in March and April, and seed source affected seed germination as the values for seeds from HIT and MIT were much higher than those from LIT, while burial sites had no effect on germination percentages, and (3) the seed persistence was less than a year regardless of seed source, which was characterised by a transient seed bank, with values being higher in HIT and MIT than in LIT. Our results suggested that low marsh plants were far less able to produce successful seeds, or conversely, that the mid-marsh location had plants with the greatest seed production and seed mass, and the high- and mid-marsh plants had good seed floatation ability, germination and survival. Thus, plants in the mid-and high-marsh may contribute disproportionally to an invasion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recovery is typically evaluated or monitored by using a few easily identified species groups, but this may not be sufficient as unmonitored groups of equivalent ecological importance are unlikely to respond in a similar manner due to physiological or dispersal differences. Aims: We compared four groups of plants: large trees, shrubs and saplings, herbs and ferns in a forest recovering from disturbance. We quantified the relative importance of disturbance history and local environmental conditions in determining species richness and community composition of these groups and assessed whether the groups could act as surrogate indicators for one another. Methods: Vegetation was surveyed on a gradient of disturbance intensity and recovery time (20-60years) in Mabira Forest, Uganda. We looked for correlations between species groups in richness or composition across sites and used constrained ordinations to identify important environmental variables. Results: Neither species richness nor composition patterns were correlated between groups. All groups were weakly related to disturbance history; trees and shrubs were related to soil, herbs to microhabitat and ferns to microclimate. Conclusions: No group acted as an indicator for another. The relative influence of disturbance and local environmental effects varied in the manner predicted, with disturbance stronger for trees and environment stronger for ferns.

The role of Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf) on the seed bank of the endangered Brazilian Cerrado	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The native bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum) often occurs in mono-specific stands in the Brazilian Cerrado, and this dominance can impact on both the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank. This study investigated how invasion by this species over a 20-year period changed the seed bank and the relationship between the seed bank and litter mass. We extracted soil samples from three replicated invaded and uninvaded sites, and followed seedling emergence for six months. We collected the above-ground biomass and litter of P. arachnoideum in ten 1m(2) plots from three invaded sites. There was no difference between invaded and uninvaded areas in seed bank richness, diversity or overall abundance. The most abundant family was the Melastomataceae, followed by the Poaceae. The Melastomataceae was more abundant in uninvaded sites, but the most common species of this family (Tibouchinastenocarpa) was not affected. The grasses were more common in invaded sites in the rainy season and were affected by heterogeneity in the litter layer. The seed bank could play a role in the recovery of these invaded areas, but the presence of weeds and invasive grasses could constrain their use as a management strategy.

J	Limon, A; Peco, B				Limon, Angeles; Peco, Begona			Germination and emergence of annual species and burial depth: Implications for restoration ecology	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Due to the high content of viable seeds, topsoil is usually spread on ground left bare during railway and motorway construction to facilitate the regeneration of vegetation cover. However, during handling of the topsoil, seeds are often buried deeply and they cannot germinate or the seedlings cannot emerge from depth. This study experimentally explores the predictive value of seed mass for seed germination, mortality and seedling emergence at different burial depths for 13 common annual species in semiarid Mediterranean environments. We separate the effect of burial depth on germination and emergence by means of two experiments. In the germination experiment, five replicates of 20 seeds for each species were buried at depths ranging from 0 to 4 cm under greenhouse conditions. Germinated and empty or rotten seeds were counted after 8 weeks. In the emergence experiment, five replicates of four newly-germinated seeds per species were buried at the same depths under controlled conditions and emergence was recorded after 3 weeks. The effect of burial depth on percentage of germination and seedling emergence was dependent on seed size. Although all species showed a decrease in germination with burial depth, this decrease was greater for small-than large-seeded species. Percentage of emergence was positively related to seed mass but negatively related to burial depth. Seed mortality was higher for small-than large-seeded species, but there was no general effect of burial depth on this variable. Thus, the current practice of spreading 30 cm deep layers of topsoil in post-construction restoration projects is unadvisable. In this restoration scenario, thinner layers of topsoil should be used to achieve the maximum potential of the topsoil for germination and seedling establishment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Pulse seedling recruitment on the population dynamics of a columnar cactus: Effect of an extreme rainfall event	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Demographic studies on the Cactaceae have highlighted several threats which are clearly human induced (e.g., disturbance) or intrinsic to their biology (e.g., infrequent recruitment). Most demographic studies suggest that early life stages of germination and seedling recruitment are crucial and often a limitation for population growth. The population dynamics of Neobuxbaumia polylopha (DC) Backeb. was modeled for a three-year period to assess the contribution of the early life cycle stages on population growth rate (A). Two annual size-classified matrix population models were constructed for standard analysis, applied a life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis to explore the contributions of demographic processes, plant size, and temporal variability (years) to lambda and changes in the matrix elements were simulated including a seed bank, and seed-to-seedling transition using observed and experimental data. The population growth rates for 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 were 0.9916 (0.9906-0.9929) and 1.0216 (1.011-1.0280) respectively, suggesting two opposite growth rates for the studied period. The increase in lambda in 2013-2014 was driven primarily by the increased growth and seedling recruitment and survival of small individuals. The rate of recruitment was higher in 2013-2014 with a left-skewed stable size distribution. Elasticity values were high for matrix entries corresponding to individuals remaining in the same category (stasis), followed by growth, retrogression and fecundity. The simulations show that the seed bank has a minor effect in comparison with the seed-seedling transition which became the population bottleneck under the assumption that seeds are not limited, so programs designed to preserve N. polylopha populations must focus on seedling establishment.

J	Liot, Q; Constant, P				Liot, Quentin; Constant, Philippe			Breathing air to save energy - new insights into the ecophysiological role of high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenase inStreptomyces avermitilis	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												The Streptomyces avermitilis genome encodes a putative high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenase conferring the ability to oxidize tropospheric H-2 in mature spores. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomic and mutagenesis approaches to shed light on the potential ecophysiological role of the enzyme. First, S. avermitilis was either exposed to low or hydrogenase-saturating levels of H-2 to investigate the impact of H-2 on spore transcriptome. In total, 1293 genes were differentially expressed, with 1127 and 166 showing lower and higher expression under elevated H-2 concentration, respectively. High H-2 exposure lowered the expression of the Sec protein secretion pathway and ATP-binding cassette-transporters, with increased expression of genes encoding proteins directing carbon metabolism toward sugar anabolism and lower expression of NADH dehydrogenase in the respiratory chain. Overall, the expression of relA responsible for the synthesis of the pleiotropic alarmone ppGpp decreased upon elevated H-2 exposure, which likely explained the reduced expression of antibiotic synthesis and stress response genes. Finally, deletion of hhySL genes resulted in a loss of H-2 uptake activity and a dramatic loss of viability in spores. We propose that H-2 is restricted to support the seed bank of Streptomyces under a unique survival-mixotrophic energy mode and discuss important ecological implications of this finding.																	2045-8827					FEB	2016	5	1					47	59		10.1002/mbo3.310							WOS:000371259500004	26541261

We present the first comprehensive reproduction study for this perennial key species that adopts a molecular approach and tests how sexual and vegetative reproduction, as well as ploidy, relate to survival and dominance under harsh conditions. Methods We assessed inflorescence numbers of K. pygmaea across two Tibetan alpine pastures with differing grazing regimes. Germination was tested in untreated diaspores and then following mechanical and chemical scarification. In a 4-year experiment, we assessed diaspore viability and seed bank formation. Using eight microsatellite markers, we recorded multilocus genotypes in hierarchical grids and measured their ploidy using flow cytometry. Adjusted analysis of variance models were used to analyse data on sexual reproduction, while the complement of the Simpson index and the Shannon diversity index were used to characterize the spatial distribution of multilocus genotypes and clonal richness. Important Findings Inflorescence production was high and differed significantly between years (2010: 617 +/- 460 SD; 2012: 2015 +/- 1213 SD) but not between grazing regimes. Diaspore viability was high (94%) and gradually decreased after 3 and 4 years of storage in the soil. Diaspores not exposed to further scarification failed to germinate, while mechanical and chemical (H2SO4) scarification increased germination to 9 and 44%, respectively. Clonal diversity was high, although in situ germination was rarely observed. Multilocus genotypes intersected and covered a mean area of 0.74 m(2). Most individuals were found to be tetraploid, with only 0.8% of all ramets being triploid. We conclude that K. pygmaea survives on the Tibetan Plateau by employing a mixed reproduction strategy involving both sexual and clonal propagation. The species' adaptability and dominance is further facilitated by its polyploidy. As pasture restoration using diaspores would be difficult, existing Kobresia pasture should be managed more sustainably.																	1752-9921	1752-993X				FEB	2016	9	1					87	99		10.1093/jpe/rtv035							WOS:000371183700010						
J	Postma, FM; Lundemo, S; Agren, J				Postma, Froukje M.; Lundemo, Sverre; Agren, Jona			Seed dormancy cycling and mortality differ between two locally adapted populations of Arabidopsis thaliana	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Intraspecific variation in seed bank dynamics should contribute to local adaptation, but is not well studied. The extent to which genetic and environmental factors affect dormancy cycling and seed mortality was investigated in the annual herb Arabidopsis thaliana by conducting a reciprocal seed burial experiment. Methods Seeds from two locally adapted populations (from Italy and Sweden) were buried at both of the sites of origin, and seed mortality and germinability were determined during the following 2 years for initially non-dormant glasshouse-matured seeds and dormant field-matured seeds. Key Results Mean soil temperature was higher at the Italian site compared with the Swedish site throughout the year, and the germination proportions were in general higher for seeds buried in Italy than in Sweden. The rate of secondary dormancy induction of the Italian genotype was faster than that of the Swedish genotype at both sites, while the opposite was true for the rate of dormancy release, at least at the Swedish site. The comparison of nondormant glasshouse seeds with dormant field seeds demonstrated that A. thaliana seeds can adjust their dormancy levels to current environmental conditions, and suggests that maternal environmental conditions have only minor effects on dormancy cycles. At both sites, locally produced seeds had low germinability in the first year compared with the second year, suggesting that a considerable fraction of the seeds would enter the seed bank. In Italy, but not in Sweden, seed mortality increased rapidly during the second year of burial. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of intraspecific genetic differentiation in the annual seed dormancy cycle of any species, and the documented difference is likely to contribute to local adaptation. The results suggest that the contribution of a seed bank to seedling recruitment should vary among environments due to differences in the rate of seed mortality.

Mexico lacks long-term time series to determine trends for major eelgrass populations and has made no conservation efforts. Therefore, we present the first report on the historic presence of this annual coastal ecosystem in two wetlands of the Gulf of California (GC), the Infiernillo Channel (CIF, largest Z. marina population inside GC) and Concepcion Bay (BCP, the only eelgrass population along GC's west coast), combining field surveys (1999-2010), aerial photography (2000-2010), satellite imagery (1972-2005), and published reports (1994-2007). Three parameters were used as indicators of conservation status: shoot density, seed banks, and aerial coverage. Average shoot density in the CIF (741 shoots m(-2)) was 3.8 times higher than in BCP (194 shoots m(-2)), and average seed bank density was similar in both wetlands (17,442 seeds m(-2) vs. 17,000 seeds m(-2)). Opportunistic seagrass Ruppia maritima was observed in both wetlands, with higher abundance in summer when Z. marina disappears due to high water temperatures. Eelgrass coverage was three orders of magnitude greater in the CIF (9725 ha) than in BCP (3 ha). The striking difference between these wetlands is the lack of environmental protection for BCP and the protection of the CIF by the Seri indigenous community, which increases human pressure in the former, putting it at high risk of disappearing. Conservation of eelgrass meadows is not only necessary to preserve their ecosystem services but to insure the survival of migratory populations (Pacific brant goose, Branta bernicla), endangered species (Black turtle, Chelonia mydas), and fisheries-related species.

In 2007 and 2008, seed densities with regard to dune position, soil depth and season were investigated on an active and a stabilized sand dune of northeastern Inner Mongolia, China. Seeds in the 0-10cm topsoil layer accounted for 60% of total soil seed bank on the stabilized sand dune, while more than 40% of seeds were stored in the 50-100cm layers on the active sand dune. Seed density declined significantly with soil depth on the stabilized sand dune, but it was relatively constant across the 0-100cm soil profile on the active sand dune. Seed density fluctuated with soil depth on the active sand dune suggesting that seeds were either relocated upward or downward over time. Seeds of annual non-psammophytic species accounted for the majority of soil seed bank on the stabilized sand dune, while pioneer psammophytes contributed more to the soil seed bank of the active sand dune. Our data suggest that seeds in the deep soil layers of active sand dunes account for a large proportion of the whole soil seed bank. Because of the effect of wind erosion, seeds in deep soil could be gradually exposed to shallow soil layers and potentially contribute to population recruitment and vegetation restoration on active sand dunes.

J	Astrin, JJ; Betsou, F				Astrin, Jonas J.; Betsou, Fay			Trends in Biobanking: A Bibliometric Overview	BIOPRESERVATION AND BIOBANKING												Biobanks have become indispensable tools for a wide array of life and environmental sciences, and biotechnology. To evaluate trends in biobanking, 20,000 bibliographic records were retrieved and analyzed between 1939 and 2014 from the Scopus database using a series of biobank-related search terms within titles and keywords. Since the 1990s, the field of biobanking has been, and still is, experiencing above-average growth in terms of publications, journals, and thematic orientations. Almost two-thirds of all indexed biobanking documents have been published in the last decade, with now >1,000 publications in 600 distinct journals per year. Around 50,000 individual authors can be identified who have so far contributed to the field of biobanking, with an average of 1.5 publications per author. Author affiliations follow an uneven distribution: 42% of the authors are based in Europe, 33% in North America, 13% in Asia, 5% in South America, 4% in Australasia, and 2% in Africa. Analyzing the most common title words revealed (as did the journals) a strong focus on blood banking, but other biospecimen typesespecially seeds, cells, and tissueshave been gaining increasing weight recently. Among medical applications, transfusion dominates, followed by transplantation. While a noticeable increase in disease and especially health occurred at the beginning of the millennium, cohort and consent seem to have become high-relevance topics only in this decade. In terms of banked organisms, human dominates, followed by viruses and plants (especially represented through seed banking). A very rough estimate based on subject categories suggests that a third of all publications in biobanking focus on organisms other than humans. However, animal, fungal, and microbial biobanking are still underrepresented, especially when considering their shares in global biodiversity.

Dimorphic seeds of Salicornia ramosissima display contrasting germination responses under different salinities	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In the present study we tested, under controlled conditions, the combined effect of seed dimorphism and salinity on the germination responses of Salicornia ramosissima. Results evidenced that the dimorphic seed bank of wild S. ramosissima could successfully germinate at a salinity range from 0 to 25 approximate to 428 mM NaCl. However, germination responses were higher at salinities lower than 15 approximate to 257 mM NaCl, showing also a lower variability within seed type, indicating that for an optimized response this salinity should be considered as a threshold in combination with a sustainable use of freshwater resources. As variability in germination responses tends to increase with salinity, under scenarios of higher salinity and freshwater scarcity, seed selection should be considered in order to optimize seed germination output.

A cohort-based stochastic model of the population dynamic and long-term management of Conyza bonariensis in fruiting tree crops	CROP PROTECTION												Conyza bonariensis is currently a frequent and abundant weed in fruiting tree crops associated with non-tillage in Mediterranean climate areas, such as citrus groves and olive orchards. Because of the mild winters characteristic of this climate, an extended season of seedling emergence, from early autumn to early spring, is often found for this species, this leading to multiple annual cohorts. In this work, a cohort-based stochastic model of C bonariensis population dynamics was developed and used to simulate the behaviour of the seed bank in Mediterranean fruiting tree crops under ten contrasting management strategies, including single or integrated herbicide and non chemical control measures. The demographic impact of tillage system (ploughing vs. no-till), the use of cover, and timing of herbicide applications was simulated. The model was parameterized with information taken from the literature. In the absence of any control and under no-tillage the modelled seed bank reached an average equilibrium density of 378,092 +/- 10,865 seeds m(-2). The most effective management strategy integrated no-till, the use of cover and early and late applications of herbicides, which reduced the equilibrium densities of the seed bank by 78.7%. A sensitivity analysis indicated that C bonariensis populations in Mediterranean fruiting tree crops are particularly sensitive to small changes in the demographic parameters associated with the earlier cohort and to the efficacy of early herbicide treatments. A diversified, integrated approach including different interventions of chemical and cultural nature appears to be the most successful strategy at the field level for controlling C bonariensis in Mediterranean fruiting tree crops.

This study examines whether the high genotypic diversity found in the Baltic cyst pool of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii is coupled to phenotypic variability that could aid short-term adaptation. Growth rates, cellular toxicities and bioluminescence of 34 genetically different clones isolated from cyst beds of four Baltic bloom sites were determined in batch culture experiments along temperature and salinity gradients covering present and future conditions in the Baltic Sea. For all parameters a significant effect of genotype on the response to temperature and salinity changes was identified. General or site-specific effects of the two factors remained minor. Clones thriving at future conditions were different from the best performing at present conditions, suggesting that genotypic shifts may be expected in the future. Increased proportions of highly potent saxitoxin were observed as a plastic response to temperature increase, indicating a potential for higher toxicity of future blooms. The observed standing variation in Baltic seed banks of A.ostenfeldii suggests that the population is likely to persist under environmental change.

Current availability of seed material of enset (Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae) and its Sub-Saharan wild relatives	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												Crop wild relatives are an important source of new genetic diversity for plant breeding and crop improvement. Enset (Ensete ventricosum) is mainly cultivated as a multipurpose crop in Ethiopia, supplying food to 13 million people. To improve the agronomic traits of enset clonal lines, sexual propagation can be of key importance, in particular crossbreeding landraces with populations of undomesticated Ensete wild relatives. We investigated the availability of stored seed material of the enset genepool represented by three African Ensete species (E. homblei, E. livingstonianum, E. ventricosum) in gene bank facilities across the world, and also the possibility to obtain freshly collected, undried seed material for conservation and research purposes. We queried the main plant genetic resources databases and contacted 27 gene and seed banks, research centres and several individual researchers. Only one seed bank seemed to hold a seed accession of only one of the three species, E. ventricosum (Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew). Available seed accessions of the other two species (E. homblei, E. livingstonianum) do not seem to exist. The lack of stored seed material of the three Ensete species and the difficulties in obtaining fresh seeds make it impossible to use seeds for breeding and crop improvement. We consider the existing seed conservation measures of the enset crop and its wild relatives as insufficient. A collection, research and ex situ conservation programme targeting Sub-Saharan Ensete seeds is needed considering the potential value of these species for food security across Africa.

To investigate the contribution of soil seed banks to vegetation restoration in moving sand dune systems, we compared seed structure and species similarity between soil seed banks and standing vegetation among moving sand dunes, ecotones and dune slacks in northeast China. Average seed density in dune slacks was greater than in ecotones or moving sand dunes. Seed density in the soil layer of 0-10 cm was greater than at 10-20 cm both in the moving sand dunes and the ecotones, but seed densities were similar at depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm in moving sand dunes. Moreover, the spatial autocorrelation of seed density on moving sand dunes was weak but was strong on the ecotones and dune slacks. The species in the soil seed bank of moving sand dune systems were nearly all annuals, and the low similarity was mainly due to the lack of perennial species that were common in standing vegetation. Consequently, vegetation restoration cannot mainly rely on the soil seed banks in the moving sand dunes and more attention should be paid to protection of the dune slacks because they are the main source of seed disperse and seedling recruitment in moving sand dune systems.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				FEB	2016	27	1					75	80		10.1007/s11676-015-0166-1							WOS:000367520300009

This has implications for population and community dynamics, as recognised by ecological and evolutionary theory. In contrast, the conservation and restoration literature often find seed banks to be depauperate, weedy and without much conservation value or restoration potential. One explanation for these contrasting views might lie in a systematic bias in the sampling of seed banks versus established plant communities. We use the species-area relationship as a tool to assess and compare the per-area species richness and spatial structuring of the diversity of the established plant community versus soil seed banks. To allow this direct comparison we extensively survey the species-area relationship of the vegetation and underlying seed bank of a grassland community across twelve sites spanning regional bioclimatic gradients. We also compile a global dataset of established vegetation and seed banks from published sources. We find that seed banks have consistently higher intercepts and slopes of the relationship, and hence higher diversity at any given spatial scale, than the vegetation both in the field and literature study. This is consistent across habitat types, climate gradients, and biomes. Similarity indices are commonly used to compare vegetation and seed bank, and we find that sampling effort (% of the vegetation area sampled for seed bank) was the strongest predictor of vegetation-seed bank similarity for both the SOrensen (R-2 = 0.70) and the Raup-Crick (R-2 = 0.25) index. Our study suggests that the perception that seed banks are intrinsically less diverse than established plant communities has been based more on inadequate sampling than on biological reality. Across a range of ecosystems and climatic settings, we find high diversity in seed banks relative to the established community, suggesting potentially important roles of seed banks in population dynamics and diversity maintenance.

J	Peres, S				Peres, Sara			Saving the gene pool for the future: Seed banks as archives	STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE PART C-STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGICAL AND BIOMEDIAL SCIENCES												Ensuring the salvage of future sources is a challenge for plant geneticists and breeders, as well as historians and archivists. Here, this suggestion is illustrated with an account of the emergence, in the mid-20th century, of seed banks. These repositories are intended to enable the conservation of the world's crop genetic diversity against the 'genetic erosion' of crops, an unintended consequence of the global uptake of new high-yielding Green Revolution agricultural varieties. Plant breeders and scientists advocated a strategy of freezing and long-term storage of seed which enabled the salvage of genetic diversity for future users without requiring the continual cultivation of old varieties: seed banking could preserve valuable genetic material and enable agricultural modernisation to proceed. This account of crop genetic conservation therefore shows how breeders and geneticists sought to create their own seed archives from whence the evolutionary history of crops could be made accessible in ways that are useful for the future. This analysis suggests that conservation practices are informed by ideas about the future use of material, indicating that there is value in exploring concurrently the archival and historiographical issues relating to the biomolecular big biosciences.

Nutrient versus seed bank depletion approaches to controlling exotic annuals in threatened Box Gum woodlands	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Control of exotic annuals is often a priority when restoring degraded grasslands or shrublands. This study evaluated combinations of nutrient-depleting (carbon addition) and seed bank-depleting approaches for controlling exotic annuals, and compared the seed bank depletion technique of spring burning with the more easily applied technique of pulse grazing. Treatments were applied in two Box Gum woodlands over 4 years. Consistent with earlier studies, carbon addition dramatically reduced exotic annuals and available nutrients in all 3 years at both sites. Exotic annual grass abundance was significantly reduced in burnt plots following the first year and in grazed plots following the second year of application. Spring burning or grazing did not reduce available nutrients or exotic annual broadleaf abundance at either site. The effect of carbon addition on exotic annuals and available nutrients was so powerful that no additional benefit of the combination treatments was found, although at one site burning and grazing slightly reduced the effectiveness of carbon addition in suppressing broadleaf exotic annuals. We conclude that nutrient-depleting approaches are most effective because they control both exotic annual grasses and broadleaf exotics annuals, but given their expense seed bank-depleting approaches may be more practical where exotic annual grasses dominate. In particular, pulse grazing is readily applied across large areas, offering a relatively simple tool that if appropriately implemented could enhance outcomes of restoration investments in vegetation communities invaded by exotic annual grasses.

Long-term perennial weed control strategies: Economic analyses and yield effect in hazelnut (Corylus avellana)	CROP PROTECTION												Weeds limit hazelnut productivity through competition and interference. Field experiments were conducted from spring 2010 through 2013 to evaluate string trimming alone or combined with herbicides in hazelnut orchards to control mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.), purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L), and burning nettle (Urtica urens L.). Treatments were mowing with a string trimmer (ST) alone, or ST followed by glyphosate, glyphosate + diflufenican, and glyphosate + carfentrazone-ethyl. These combinations also were applied with pendimethalin and oxyfluorfen as pre-emergence applications. The experiments were conducted in Fatsa-Ordu, Turkey, on a sandy clay soil with multi-stemmed trees (ocak). The combination treatments improved weed control compared to ST alone. Glyphosate plus carfentrazone-ethyl application 15 days after ST was the most effective treatment for control of these weeds. This combination was more effective in reducing seed bank reserves of A. vulgaris, C rotundus and U. urens than herbicides applied alone or in mixtures throughout all seasons. Hazelnut yield was not significantly affected by herbicide treatments in 2010 or 2011. Hazelnut yield increased during the latter half of the experimental period, in 2012 and 2013. In a mixed population of A. vulgaris, C. rotundus and U. urens, 89 plants per m(2) caused 12.1% yield loss. When the density increased to 256 plants per m2, yield losses increased to 29.7%. Hazelnut treated with ST followed by glyphosate plus carfentrazone-ethyl had the highest financial return. Post-emergence weed management systems in hazelnut should include ST followed by glyphosate plus carfentrazone-ethyl applications for maximum returns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hamasaki, K; Taniguchi, A; Tada, Y; Kaneko, R; Miki, T				Hamasaki, Koji; Taniguchi, Akito; Tada, Yuya; Kaneko, Ryo; Miki, Takeshi			Active populations of rare microbes in oceanic environments as revealed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and 454 tag sequencing	GENE												The "rare biosphere" consisting of thousands of low-abundance microbial taxa is important as a seed bank or a gene pool to maintain microbial functional redundancy and robustness of the ecosystem. Here we investigated contemporaneous growth of diverse microbial taxa including rare taxa and determined their variability in environmentally distinctive locations along a north-south transect in the Pacific Ocean in order to assess which taxa were actively growing and how environmental factors influenced bacterial community structures. A bromodeoxyuridine-labeling technique in combination with PCR amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes gave 215-793 OTUs from 1200 to 3500 unique sequences in the total communities and 175-299 OTUs nearly 860 to 1800 sequences in the active communities. Unexpectedly, many of the active OTUs were not detected in the total fractions. Among these active but rare OTUs, some taxa (2-4% of rare OTUs) showed much higher abundance (>0.10% of total reads) in the active fraction than in the total fraction, suggesting that their contribution to bacterial community productivity or growth was much larger than that expected from their standing stocks at each location. An ordination plot by the principal component analysis presented that bacterial community compositions among 4 sampling locations and between total and active fractions Were distinctive with each other. A redundancy analysis revealed that the variability of community compositions significantly correlated to seawater temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. Also, a variation partitioning analysis showed that the environmental factors explained 49% of the variability of community compositions and the distance only explained 4.0% of its variability. These results implied very dynamic change of community structures due to environmental filtering. The active bacterial populations are more diverse and spread further in rare biosphere than we have ever seen. This study implied that rare microbes are important as an active part of microbial communities functioning ecosystems. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Tamura, A				Tamura, Atsushi			Potential of soil seed banks in the ecological restoration of overgrazed floor vegetation in a cool-temperate old-growth damp forest in eastern Japan	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Damp forests are vulnerable ecosystems and have peculiar species compositions. Deer can cause severe damage to damp forest composition and structure. However, little is known about the effect of deer on soil seed banks of damp forests and the restoration potential of soil seed banks. I surveyed the compositions of the soil seed bank and floor vegetation both inside and outside a deer exclosure in an old-growth damp forest in eastern Japan using the seedling emergence method. Floor vegetation was composed of 71 % palatable and 1 % unpalatable species inside the exclosure but 6 % palatable and 83 % unpalatable species outside the exclosure. Forty-four species and 642 seeds m(-2) germinated inside the exclosure, whereas 39 species and 985 seeds m(-2) germinated outside the exclosure. Seed bank composition was 29 % palatable and 43 % unpalatable species inside the exclosure and 1 % palatable and 73 % unpalatable species outside the exclosure. Percentage similarity between the soil seed bank outside and the floor vegetation inside the exclosure was very low. These results indicate that the soil seed bank outside the exclosure has little potential to aid the recovery of floor vegetation. Conservation measures, such as deer exclosures and deer control, must be introduced before the floor vegetation is retrogressed by sika deer grazing.

The structure and composition of plant and soil communities during wheat crop were different from those found in the fallow years, although the effect of wheat crop on soil bacteria was still noticeable in the 1st year of fallow. The main changes in the structure of microbial communities happened between the first and second year of fallow, probably due to changes in the quality and quantity of litter inputs. As expected, we observed an overall decrease in plant diversity in the wheat stage. Fallows had a positive effect on plant species diversity by allowing the maintenance of a seed bank and controlling the simplification of weed communities. However, the impact of fallow on microbial communities is more complex: bacterial diversity was higher during the wheat stage while fungal diversity was either higher or unchanged. These results suggest that the rotation stage is the main driver of the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities, probably through changes in the plant community that deserve further examination. Inter-annual fluctuations in rainfall had a stronger impact on plant communities than on microbial communities indicating that the later are likely adapted to the characteristic fluctuation of annual rainfall in areas under Mediterranean climate.

J	Martinkova, J; Klimesova, J				Martinkova, Jana; Klimesova, Jitka			Enforced Clonality Confers a Fitness Advantage	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												In largely clonal plants, splitting of a maternal plant into potentially independent plants (ramets) is usually spontaneous; however, such fragmentation also occurs in otherwise non-clonal species due to application of external force. This process might play an important yet largely overlooked role for otherwise non-clonal plants by providing a mechanism to regenerate after disturbance. Here, in a 5-year garden experiment on two short-lived, otherwise non-clonal species, Barbarea vulgaris and Barbarea stricta, we compared the fitness of plants fragmented by simulated disturbance (-enforced ramets") both with plants that contemporaneously originate in seed and with individuals unscathed by the disturbance event. Because the ability to regrow from fragments is related to plant age and stored reserves, we compared the effects of disturbance applied during three different ontogenetic stages of the plants. In B. vulgaris, enforced ramet fitness was higher than the measured fitness values of both uninjured plants and plants established from seed after the disturbance. This advantage decreased with increasing plant age at the time of fragmentation. In B. stricta, enforced ramet fitness was lower than or similar to fitness of uninjured plants and plants grown from seed. Our results likely reflect the habitat preferences of the study species, as B. vulgaris occurs in anthropogenic, disturbed habitats where body fragmentation is more probable and enforced clonality thus more advantageous than in the more natural habitats preferred by B. stricta. Generalizing from our results, we see that increased fitness yielded by enforced clonality would confer an evolutionary advantage in the face of disturbance, especially in habitats where a seed bank has not been formed, e.g., during invasion or colonization. Our results thus imply that enforced clonality should be taken into account when studying population dynamics and life strategies of otherwise non-clonal species in disturbed habitats.

This research is aimed at exploring the diversity characteristics of SSBs and the relationships between SSBs and soil properties. Methods Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was adopted to describe the ordination of SSBs on soil properties' gradients; multiple linear regressions were adopted to analyze the relationship between average growth height and soil properties, density and soil properties. Results Experimental groups of mixed substrate (the mixture of organic and inorganic substrates) had high diversity indexes, especially the Shannon-Wiener Index compared with those of single substrate. Meanwhile, a higher number of species and increased density were also noted in those of mixed substrate. The best test group, No. 16, had the highest diversity indexes with a Shannon-Wiener of 1.898, Simpson of 0.633 and Pielou of 0.717, and also showed the highest density of 14000 germinants / m(2) and 21 species. In addition, an improvement of the soil's chemical and physical properties was noted when the substrates were mixed. The mixed substrate of turfy soil and perlite could effectively enhance the soil moisture content, whilst a mixed substrate of rice husk carbon and vermiculite could improve the content of available potassium (AK) and phosphorus (AP) and strengthen soil fertility. The germinated plants also reflected obvious regularities of ordination on soil factor gradients. Three distinct cluster groups were presented, of which the first cluster was distributed in an area with a relatively higher content of AK and AP; the second cluster was distributed at places with relatively higher soil moisture content; and the third cluster of plants didn't show any obvious relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. Through CCA analysis, AK and AP were considered the most important soil factors to influence the SSB, which was illustrated in regression analysis with a high correlation coefficient when dependent values were growth height and density respectively. The linear regression equations with: growth height = 142.728 - 1.514TC + 30.218AP - 5.083TN + 10.839AK + 1.234mc; density = -68.216 - 4.609TC + 9.566AP - 35.492TN + 19.779AK - 1.591mc. were established by multiple linear regression. Conclusions (1) The mixed substrates showed a greater advantage for SSBs than single substrates, both in improving the number of species, density and diversity indexes. (2) The germinated plants reflected an obvious preference to different soil conditions, which different mixed substrates could improve accordingly. (3) AK, AP were important soil factors to influence SSBs, especially in the growth of plants and density.

Recovery pathways from small-scale disturbance in a temperate Australian seagrass	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Recovery from disturbance is a key element of ecosystem persistence, and recovery can be influenced by large-scale regional differences and smaller local-scale variations in environmental conditions. Seagrass beds are an important yet threatened nearshore habitat and recover from disturbance by regrowth, vegetative extension and dispersive propagules. We described recovery pathways from small-scale disturbances in the seagrass Zostera nigricaulis in Port Phillip Bay, a large embayment in southeastern Australia, and tested whether these pathways differed between 5 regions with different hydrodynamic conditions and water quality, and between sites within those regions. Recovery pathways were broadly consistent. When aboveground biomass was removed, recovery, defined as the point at which disturbed areas converged with undisturbed controls, took from 2 to 8 mo, but when we removed above-and below-ground biomass, it took between 2 and 13 mo. There was no evidence of recovery resulting from sexual reproduction at any sites regardless of the presence of seeds in the sediment or flower production. We found no differences in recovery at the regional scale, but we found substantial differences between local sites. At some sites, rapid recovery occurred because seagrasses grew quickly, but at others, apparent recovery occurred because regrowth coincided with overall declines in cover of undisturbed areas. Recovery time was unrelated to seagrass canopy height, biomass, percentage cover, stem density, seed bank density, epiphyte cover or sediment organic matter in seagrass adjacent to disturbance experiments. This study highlights the importance of understanding fine-scale variation in local recovery mechanisms, which may override or obscure any regional signal.

Martin; Xiao, Hongyan			Suitability of Taxodium distichum for Afforesting the Littoral Zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir	PLOS ONE												The littoral zone ecosystem of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has become significantly degraded by annual cycles of prolonged winter flooding and summer drought. For purposes of flood control and sediment management, the water level in the reservoir is lowered by 30 m during the summer monsoon season and raised again to 175 m above sea level each year at the end of the monsoon period. To explore an effective way to promote biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, we examined Taxodium distichum as a species for afforesting the littoral zone. Sapling growth variations were measured after two rounds of winter flooding. Dominant influence factors were determined by redundancy analysis. Herb community similarities between the experimental afforested areas and nearby control areas were assessed to detect the ecosystem influence of the experimental afforestation. 94.5% of saplings planted at elevations above 168 m survived. All measured growth indices (tree height, diameter at breast height, crown width and foliage density) decreased as the flood depth increased. Completely submerged saplings had a mean dieback height of -0.65 m. Greater initial foliage density led to increased tree height and stem diameter. Shannon-Wiener indices were not significantly different between plots in experimental and control areas, but the low similarity of herb communities between experimental and control areas (0.242 on average) suggested that afforestation would enrich plant community structure and improve littoral zone ecosystem stability. Because littoral zone afforestation provides several ecosystem services (habitat, carbon sink, water purification and landscaping), it is a promising revegetation model for the TGR.

Seed banks as a source of vegetation regeneration to support the recovery of degraded rivers: A comparison of river reaches of varying condition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic disturbance has contributed to widespread geomorphic adjustment and the degradation of many rivers. This research compares for river reaches of varying condition, the potential for seed banks to support geomorphic river recovery through vegetation regeneration. Seven river reaches in the lower Hunter catchment of south-eastern Australia were assessed as being in poor, moderate, or good condition, based on geomorphic and ecological indicators. Seed bank composition within the channel and floodplain (determined in a seedling emergence study) was compared to standing vegetation. Seed bank potential for supporting geomorphic recovery was assessed by measuring native species richness, and the abundance of different plant growth forms, with consideration of the roles played by different growth forms in geomorphic adjustment. The exotic seed bank was considered a limiting factor for achieving ecological restoration goals, and similarly analysed. Seed bank native species richness was comparable between the reaches, and regardless of condition, early successional and pioneer herbs, sedges, grasses and rushes dominated the seed bank. The capacity for these growth forms to colonise and stabilise non-cohesive sediments and initiate biogeomorphic succession, indicates high potential for the seed banks of even highly degraded reaches to contribute to geomorphic river recovery. However, exotic propagules increasingly dominated the seed banks of moderate and poor condition reaches and reflected increasing encroachment by terrestrial exotic vegetation associated with riparian degradation. As the degree of riparian degradation increases, the resources required to control the regeneration of exotic species will similarly increase, if seed bank-based regeneration is to contribute to both geomorphic and ecological restoration goals.

Evidence for indirect effects of pesticide seed treatments on weed seed banks in maize and soybean	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Use of pesticide seed treatments (coating seeds with insecticides and/or fungicides) is a common practice in conventional maize and soybean production. Despite their widespread use, however, little is known about how this practice affects soil food webs and their associated ecosystem services. We conducted a two-year field experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA in which identical genotypes of maize (2013) and soybean (2014) were planted with and without pesticide seed treatments in a completely randomized design with five replications. We sampled the weed seed bank during both the corn (fall 2013) and soybean (summer 2014) phases of the rotation. After each sampling event, soil samples were transported to a temperature-controlled greenhouse facility and weed seed bank composition and density was assessed over a period of four months via the direct germination method. Seed bank data were analyzed with ANOVA and several multivariate techniques to determine the effect of pesticide seed treatments on seed bank density, diversity, and species composition. We hypothesized that pesticide seed treatments reduce the abundance of natural enemies (e.g., soil-dwelling seed predators and pathogens) that damage or destroy weed seeds in the soil, and therefore seed banks in treated plots would be larger and less diverse than those in untreated plots. In accordance with our hypothesis, weed seed banks were significantly less diverse in treated compared to untreated control plots (Shannon and Simpson's indices of diversity, p < 0.05). While not statistically significant, differences in mean germinable weed seed bank density, richness, and evenness were also in the direction that we hypothesized. These data provide the first evidence that we are aware of that weed seed banks, and hence weed populations, may be indirectly affected by pesticide seed treatments. Additional research will be necessary to determine the generality of these responses and their underlying mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In Denmark, the DSS includes all major crops and available herbicides. The background for developing CPO-Weeds was a political motivation for reducing pesticide use and the concept of factor-adjusted doses. It was never the intention to build a sophisticated scientific model, but rather to design a simple user-friendly system. It is a knowledge-driven DSS, which offers herbicide dose suggestions based on a large database of the existing knowledge of herbicides and herbicide efficacies. The required weed control level in CPO-Weeds is based on expert evaluations, a herbicides dose-response model and an additive dose model to calculate possible mixtures of herbicides targeted a specific weed population. The herbicide dose model is a two parameter dose-response model, which is modified to include the effects of temperature, weed growth stage and influence of drought. The development has been driven by an ambition of offering a robust system with relatively low amounts of input variables and limited need for experimental parameter generation. CPO-Weeds offers overview and guidance for field specific spraying solutions, and the system has proved able to recommend herbicide doses with considerable reductions compared to label rates. Furthermore, CPO-Weeds offers a variety of tools that summarises knowledge of herbicides for a wide range of questions asked by practical weed managers, e.g. efficacy profiles of each herbicide, efficacy of users own herbicide mixtures, weed identification key and guidance for spraying strategy. The experiences have shown that even though CPO-Weeds are considered robust and trustworthy by both farmers and advisors there is a relatively low number of farmers subscribing to the system. A survey revealed that the DSS falls in between the strategies of many farmers; either the farmers relies completely on own experiences or advisory services or they considers the full crop rotation in their weed management. The latter is not supported by CPO-Weeds, which focus on a single season. The long term consequences of herbicide recommendations is only included in the need to limit input to soil seed bank. Another limiting factor for an increased practical use of CPO-Weeds is the need for field monitoring of weed populations, which can be a time consuming task and requires extensive weed recognising abilities of the farmer at the very early growth stages of weeds. The intention of CPO-Weeds was to provide recommendations for the full spraying season of a field, but experiences have shown that the system has several uses. Many farmers spray with a standard solution in the autumn in winter crops and then use the DSS for spring sprayings. The relatively simple input requirements also make the DSS suitable for teaching purposes and for farmers starting to grow new crops in their rotation as a learning tool.

J	Milakovic, I; Karrer, G				Milakovic, Ivana; Karrer, Gerhard			The influence of mowing regime on the soil seed bank of the invasive plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.	NEOBIOTA												Ambrosia artemisiifolia is an invasive annual herb infamous for the high allergenicity of its pollen, which is related to increasing medical costs. Additionally, it can cause serious yield losses as agricultural weed. Common ragweed seeds accumulate in the soil and can remain therein viable for decades, which poses a problem for the sustainable management of these populations. A long term management should thus target a reduction of the soil seed bank. We observed the influence of four different mowing regimes on the ragweed soil seed bank at six roadside populations in eastern Austria. The mowing regimes were based on methods from common roadside management practice and specifically adapted to reduce seed production. After three years of application, the soil seed bank was indeed reduced by 45 to 80 percent through three of the four mowing regimes tested. Therefore, we suggest that the best mowing regime for the most effective reduction of the size of the soil seed bank is the one consisting of one cut just after the beginning of female flowering (around the 3rd week of August in Eastern Central Europe), followed by a second cut 2-3 weeks later.																	1619-0033	1314-2488					2016		28					39	49		10.3897/neobiota.28.6838							WOS:000368502300002

CMPA consists of a seed bank (in vitro preservation and in vivo or ex situ conservation), herbarium, DNA bank, database, and active germplasm banks from species or genera with potential interest for the development of cultivars. In addition to providing didactic opportunities, the CPMA plays a vital role in seed storage, genetic conservation, exchange of genotypes, and distribution for producers and researchers. Presently, the introductions are from different regions of Brazil and other continents with 2,444 accessions (1,546 species and 156 botanic families). One of the plants of major interest in the CPMA is Baccharis dracunculifolia (Asteraceae), a native and widely distributed shrub that develops rapidly and can be potentially used in restoration programs as a successful colonizer of poor, acid soils. It is also the source of green propolis, a natural resinous substance collected from buds and exudates of B. dracunculifolia, produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera). To evaluate the diversity in B. dracunculifolia, several accessions have been genotyped using simple sequence repeat markers. The results showed little genetic diversity, despite genotyping collections from three different regions of natural occurrence in Brazil. Presently, a strategy to acquire new collections in areas of extreme altitudes has been adopted in the hope of finding diversity amongst members of the species.

We examined the germination rate of B. dracunculifolia seeds that were newly collected, submitted to medium-term storage conditions (6 degrees C, original moisture content), or to long-term storage conditions (-20 degrees C, moisture content reduced to 3%) to verify the viability of its genetic conservation in seed bank. The seeds were germinated in controlled conditions (paper with nystatin 500 UI L-1, 20 degrees C, 12-h photoperiod) and in seedling substrate (at greenhouse) in four replicates of 25 seeds each. The germination rate of newly collected seeds was 50% and the highest rate found was 68% after nine months of medium-term storage conditions. Seeds subjected to long-term storage conditions showed 49% germination rate, statistically equal to the newly collected seeds rate (p <= 0.05). In order to allow conservation of the B. dracunculifolia seeds' characteristics, which in turn enables greater production of green propolis, understanding medium and long-term storage is key. This is also vital for preserving seedlings for reforestation.																	0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62611-31-3				2016	1125						263	267		10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1125.33							WOS:000406634100033

Buried seeds contribute greatly to vegetation recovery and ecological succession in general. Knowing the impact of tsunamis on seed banks and drift seeds is important in estimating the recovery of destroyed vegetation, but such information is lacking. Therefore, we examined buried seed and drift seed populations to elucidate the potential for the recovery of species diversity on sandy beaches. We collected samples of sandy sediment and debris in Iwate and Aomori prefectures, northern Tohoku, Japan. We estimated the seed populations in these samples using both the germination and seed-floating methods. In December 2011, the species composition of buried seeds in sandy sediment was very simple; ruderal plants comprising Chenopodium, Compositae, and Gramineae were remarkable. Although we found no coastal plant seeds in December 2011 sediment, eight coastal plants, Atriplex subcordata, Salsola komarovii, Setaria viridis var. pachystachys, Boehmeria splitgerbera, Leymus mollis, Linaria japonica, Carex kobomugi, and Glehnia littoralis, emerged in November 2012. Concerning alien plants, four species were observed in 2011-Bidens frondosa, Erigeron canadensis, Erigeron annuus, and Atriplex prostrata-and Plantago lanceolata was seen in 2012. The coastal species S. komarovii and the alien species Cakile edentula occurred in a debris sample in 2011. In the following year, we identified many types of coastal plants, alien plants, and other species. The seed bank that existed before the tsunami appears to have been mostly lost, and its contribution to vegetation recovery in 2011 would therefore have been small. The species composition and diversity of the seed bank after the tsunami will depend on the introduction of dispersed seeds directly from living vegetation and/or via the ocean.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							289	309		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_18	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5						WOS:000402094400019

Arable lands and coastal forests in lowlands areas were seriously and extensively damaged by the tsunami and by land subsidence. Although most salt marshes and back marshes were probably seriously damaged, new marshes have emerged in the lowlands. The vegetation on sandy beaches disappeared or was reduced in many areas. Sand dune vegetation at some sandy beaches survived the disaster and showed remarkable recovery. The influence of the tsunami and land subsidence on the plant communities of the coastal cliffs and on weed communities along roadsides and in vacant lots was limited. Threatened species, especially Potamogeton pusillus and Eleocharis parvula, appeared in inundated paddy fields and residential areas, in ponds and in wet areas within surviving coastal forest. The origin of these newly appeared plants has not been confirmed, but the possibilities include germination from the seed banks, transport from another location by the tsunami and seed dispersal from another area. Alternatively, the presence of the plants before the disaster might simply have been overlooked. Many infrastructure reconstruction projects were planned with little consideration for biodiversity. Most of the new tidal flats and salt marshes containing some threatened plants have already been lost due to infrastructure reconstruction and the resumption of cultivation on inundated arable land. Some attempts have been made to include biodiversity conservation in plans for infrastructure reconstruction.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							311	335		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_19	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5						WOS:000402094400020						
S	Mahoro, S		Urabe, J; Nakashizuka, T		Mahoro, Suzuki			Flora of Freshwater Wetlands in the Tsunami-Affected Zone of the Tohoku Region	ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF TSUNAMIS ON COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS: LESSONS FROM THE GREAT EAST JAPAN EARTHQUAKE	Ecological Research Monographs											The Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami broke open seawalls, levees, and channels on the Pacific coast of the Tohoku region, creating temporary marshes and pools at sites that had been dry before the earthquake. In ponds, paddy fields, and canals that had existed before 2011, the tsunami disturbed sediments, deposited sand, and soil and changed the growth environments of wetland plants. After the 2011 tsunami, plant researchers and lay botanists made observations in freshwater and brackish water wetlands, where the flora recovered for the first time in decades. Many threatened, extirpated, and newly recorded species were listed by them. In this study, literature on vegetation and floristic studies of the regions of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima Prefectures that were inundated by the 2011 tsunami was reviewed, focusing on studies of inland waters. Wetland plants that appeared after the tsunami likely germinated from seed banks in the soils of the flooded areas, rather than from seeds transported from surrounding regions by dispersal vectors. They were previously common weeds in the floodplain, especially in agricultural environments. The reported appearance frequencies for rare species are considerably higher than those for common species because the aim of most taxonomic publications is to report first findings or rare species. Herbarium specimens and literature records focus disproportionately on rare species. These wetlands are vanishing rapidly as restoration of housing and agriculture proceeds with the infilling of wetlands. Therefore, on-site conservation of threatened aquatic and wetland species is extremely difficult.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							361	382		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_21	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5						WOS:000402094400022

This resulted in some wild orchids being threatened. In order to maintain the orchid genetic resources, development of proper methods for the long-term preservation is urgent. Low temperature or dry storage methods for the preservation of orchid genetic resources have been implemented but are not effective in maintaining high viability of certain orchids for long periods. Cryopreservation is one of the most acceptable methods for long-term conservation of plant germplasm. Orchid seeds and pollens are ideal materials for long-term preservation (seed banking) in liquid nitrogen (LN) as the seeds and pollens are minute, enabling the storage of many hundreds of thousands of seeds or pollens in a small vial, and as most species germinate readily, making the technique very economical. This article describes cryopreservation of orchid genetic resources by desiccation and a case study of Bletilla formosana. We hope to provide a more practical potential cryopreservation method for future research needs.																			978-953-51-2780-2; 978-953-51-2779-6				2016							201	217		10.5772/65302	10.5772/62605						WOS:000399351500013

Assessing the conservation value of ex situ collections is needed in order to identify the gaps in gene banks and to determine the baseline situation. Selection of the target species for conservation followed the Regional Responsibility criterion, as the first-order of priority at the local level with highest ranking given to species whose distribution is endemic to the study area. Data analysis was performed on 85 species listed in the Valencian Catalog of Threatened Plant Species (VCTPS) stored in the Germplasm Bank Collections of Valencian Flora, Spain. Our results show that conservation value of an ex situ collection will depend on whether the analysis is based on the representation of species (i.e. the presence or absence of species in an ex situ collection) or based on their representativeness (i.e. how well the collected and stored natural populations represent the "theoretical" species genetic diversity and what is the potential to produce plants for recovery actions, summarized in the proposed index R4). For 85 species listed in VCTPS the existing ex situ seed bank collections keep samples of 91.8% (78 species), indicating good representation. However, the criteria accounting for number of populations collected and quality of the stored germplasm revealed that less than 50% of the listed species are properly preserved in the ex situ collections.

Effect of cattle grazing on forage seed bank of espinal native forest	CIENCIAS AGRONOMICAS												The soil seed bank (SSB) represents the regenerative potential of plant communities to environmental changes. The aim was to evaluate the effect of cattle grazing on the SSB of forage species in native forests in Espinal (Argentina). Two treatments were evaluated: native forest excluded from grazing for 15 years (NF) and grazed native forest (GNF). Soil samples were collected at two depths: 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm. Total seed density (TD) and forage species seed density were determined in the SSB, classifying them according to their response to grazing in "increasers" and "decreasers". The similarity between the SSB and vegetation was estimated. Grazing significantly modified TD in the first 10 cm of the soil. Total seed density in GNF was 11,917 seeds. m(-2), 45% higher than in NF. In the surface layer of soil, the density of seed forage species in GNF was 3.244 seeds. m-2and 764 seeds. m(-2) in BN; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Eleven forage species were identified in the SSB in each treatment, "increasers" being dominant in both cases. Piptochaetiumstipoides and Setariaparviflora were the most important forage species in NF bank while the largest contribution in BNP corresponded to S. parviflora. The level of similarity between the SSB and established vegetation was low in both treatments; with a rate of 10.7% in NF and 38.64% in GNF. Grazing, as disturbance of these plant communities, did not affect the reservoir of forage species propagules. These results support the ability of the SSB to maintain forage aptitude of native forests.																	1853-4333	2250-8872					2016		27					17	23									WOS:000393520500004

Evaluation of Pseudoraphis spinescens (Poaceae) seed bank from Barmah Forest floodplain	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Use of environmental water allocations to conserve floodplain and wetland plants is becoming an increasingly common management tool. In south-eastern Australia, Pseudoraphis spinescens (R.Br.) Vickery has historically covered extensive areas within Barmah Forest where it is deemed to be ecologically significant and of high conservation value. The areal extent of P. spinescens significantly declined throughout the forest during the Millennium drought (1996-2010). Natural flooding (2010-2012) failed to elicit an expected increase in the extent of P. spinescens, suggesting that this species may not have a viable long-lived seed bank. We investigated the presence and viability of the seed bank of P. spinescens by (1) germination trials, (2) identification of seeds within the sediment and (3) estimates of seed viability. No plants were identified as P. spinescens during the germination trial. Seeds of P. spinescens were identified as present in the sediment, but the majority (98%) were not viable. In contrast, 16% of seeds collected from mature seed heads were found to be viable. The present study demonstrated the absence of a persistent long-lived seed bank of P. spinescens in Barmah Forest.

There are remnants of the natural forest stands, with near-natural tree species composition and shrub and herb layers which reflect the locality type and conditions have been preserved here. The windstorm in the summer of 2008 caused extensive gale - disaster areas, the large number of trees was felled. This event provided opportunity to monitor the natural renewal of the forest ecosystem. Our research included phytosociological survey and survey of soil seed bank on 3 study areas affected by windstorm and 3 control areas positioned in untouched parts of forest. Phytosociological data was processed in the TURBOVEG for WINDOWS and evaluated in JUICE, attention has been focused on diversity (Shannon - Wiener index, evenness). Evaluation of soil seed bank was conducted by method of a) cultivation and determination of germinating plants in the soil samples and b) extraction and determination of seeds from soil samples. We compared phytosociological data, especially species incidence and species diversity with data from analysis of soil seed bank. In our opinion, results of the research can contribute to understanding natural forest regeneration, especially in terms of plant diversity.																	1314-2704		978-619-7105-65-0				2016							807	814									WOS:000391519100108

FIRE RESILIENCE OF AQUATIC CRUSTACEAN RESTING STAGES IN PLAYA WETLANDS, OKLAHOMA, USA	FIRE ECOLOGY												Prescribed burns and wildfires maintain prairie vegetation by limiting tree growth and promoting prairie grasses and forb production. Previous studies have shown that fire causes mixed effects on the prairie fauna, promoting some organisms while negatively affecting other organisms. Playa wetlands are interspersed within some semi-arid prairie landscapes, and are thereby subject to fire. These temporary wetlands can remain dry for years and less mobile aquatic taxa survive dry periods as drought resilient resting stages. We experimentally examined the effect of fire on the subsequent hatching of crustacean resting stages found in playa wetlands. Soil collected from four western Oklahoma playa wetlands was mixed and left unburned or exposed to burning (at three fuel levels: 0.5 time, 1 time, and 3 times the natural vegetation biomass) to simulate different fire intensities. We rehydrated soil taken from two depths (0 cm to 1 cm and 1 cm to 2 cm) for two weeks and examined hatched invertebrates and algal biomass. We did not find any significant difference in invertebrate richness and abundance or algal biomass from treated (burned) and untreated (unburned) soil in either of the soil layers. The resting stages of invertebrates are tolerant to a wide range of environmental factors and, consequently, are apparently tolerant (as a population) to increased soil temperatures resulting from low intensity burning.

Lippold	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Cascabela thevetia (L.) Lippold is a garden ornamental in northern Australia and two biotypes, the peach and the yellow, are recognised. In some areas it has naturalised and now has environmental and economic effects. As part of a broader research program into the ecology of C. thevetia, a field study was undertaken in northern Queensland to quantify seed fall and seed predation (by avian wildlife) of the peach biotype. The amount of twigging caused by birds while they fed on the seeds and the level of litter production were also recorded. Seed fall, seed predation, twigging and litter production occurred in all months of the year. Seed fall increased slowly over late spring and summer before peaking in mid-to late autumn (April-May) and then declining until October. Mean (+/- s.e.m.) estimated total annual seed fall was 19 140 +/- 2880 and 17 030 +/- 2930 seeds ha(-1) in the first and second years respectively. Seed predation by birds was substantial, with 57% of all seeds predated. Birds also chewed an average of 600 twigs ha(-1) year(-1). Litter production varied from 430 to 950 kg dry weight (DW) ha(-1) month(-1). In total, 7900 +/- 640 and 7390 +/- 1420 kg (DW) litter was produced during the first and second years respectively. Although seed production of C. thevetia is less than a lot of other rangeland weeds, seed predation by birds further reduces the number of seeds entering the soil seed bank. The stem damage that occurred in conjunction with seed predation contributed to overall litter production and warrants further investigation in terms of its effect on plant growth.

Schott) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) farms were completed. For the weed survey, ten farms were randomly selected and in each farm ten quadrats were sampled using a zigzag method of sampling. Five farms were randomly selected from the ten farms surveyed, and in each of these five farms four quadrats were sampled for a soil seed bank study. An average of 12 weed species were found in the above-ground weed community in taro and cassava farms. The most predominant weed was an introduced species, Spermacoce latifolia Blume which had a density of 42%, frequency of 98% and has the largest germinable soil seed bank. Farmers should aim to reduce the size of the soil seed bank of S. latifolia to ensure its impact on crop yields and potential spread is minimised. This could be achieved by eliminating S. latifolia plants on the farm before they reach flowering stage.																	0567-7572		978-94-62611-27-6				2016	1123						215	219		10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1123.30							WOS:000391239300030

In this paper, a greenhouse germination method was used to explore the effect on germination characteristic of soil seed bank by adding different inorganic substrates, such as activated carbon, perlite and vermiculite. The results showed that perlite and vermiculite can effectively promote the germination of soil seed bank, but also significantly promote Shannon-Wiener diversity index. When vermiculite mixed with the topsoil in 40%, the germination effect of soil seed bank was more obviously than other groups; at this time, the density of soil seed bank reached 6 x 10(5) plants/m(2), Shannon Wiener diversity index reached 1.4354. Therefore, it was more conducive to improve the soil seed bank density and species diversity by adding 40% vermiculite in the topsoil.

In disturbed environments, seed banks can either favor regeneration of native species, or enhance colonization and expansion of exotic species. In Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), Celtis tala forests are the main wooded community. They have experienced strong anthropogenic disturbances that made them vulnerable to invasion from the exotic tree Ligustrum lucidum. The objective of this work was to study the seed bank composition in Celtis tala forests in "El Destino" Reserve (Magdalena, Buenos Aires) and its relation with the standing vegetation in areas with distinct degrees of invasion. Five plots were stablished in two wooded cordons, covering four types of environments. In each plot, a soil sample was taken and standing vegetation was studied. Seed bank composition was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively during four months in a Ciudad Universitaria's greenhouse. Invaded environments were characterized by having less diversity, richness and evenness than those presented by non-invaded environments. Non-invaded environment's seed banks exhibited a larger proportion of herbaceous species while in invaded seed banks, Ligusrtrum lucidum dominated. This result shows that invasion has exceeded the threshold of reversibility, consolidating as neo-ecosystems dominated by L. lucidum.																	0717-9200						2016	37	3					581	590		10.4067/S0717-92002016000300015							WOS:000388785500015

Desiccation tolerance and longevity of germinated Sesbania virgata (Cav.) Pers. seeds	JOURNAL OF SEED SCIENCE												Seed desiccation tolerance (DT) and longevity are necessary for better dissemination of plant species and establishment of soil seed bank. They are acquired by orthodox seeds during the maturation phase of development and lost upon germination. DT can be re-induced in germinated seeds by an osmotic and/or abscisic acid treatment. However, there is no information on how these treatments affect seed longevity. Germinated Sesbania virgata seeds were used as a model system to investigate the effects of an osmotic treatment to re-establish DT on seed longevity. Longevity of germinated S. virgata seeds treated and non-treated by an osmoticum was analysed after storage or artificial ageing. The radicle is the most sensitive organ, the cotyledons are the most resistant, and the ability to produce lateral roots is the key for whole seed survival. Germinated S. virgata seeds with 1mm protruded radicle tolerate desiccation and storage for up to three months without significant losses in viability. An osmotic treatment can improve DT in these seeds, but not longevity. Germinated S. virgata seeds are a good model to study DT uncoupled from longevity. Further studies are necessary to unveil the molecular mechanisms involved in both DT and longevity.

Reintroduction of salt marsh vegetation and phosphorus fertilisation improve plant colonisation on seawater-contaminated cutover bogs	MIRES AND PEAT												Coastal bogs that are used for peat extraction are prone to contamination by seawater during storm events. Once contaminated, they remain mostly bare because of the combination of high salinity, low pH, high water table and low nutrient availability. The goal of this research was to investigate how plant colonisation at salt-contaminated bogs can be accelerated, in order to prevent erosion and fluvial export of the peat. At two seawater-contaminated bogs, we tested the application of rock phosphate and dolomitic lime in combination with five plant introduction treatments: transplantation of Carex paleacea; transplantation of Spartina pectinata; transfer of salt marsh diaspores in July; transfer of salt marsh diaspores in August; and no treatment (control). The effects of different doses of lime on the growth of C. paleacea and S. pectinata were also investigated in a greenhouse experiment. In the field, phosphorus fertilisation improved plant growth. Transplantation of C. paleacea resulted in the highest plant colonisation, whereas salt marsh diaspore transfer led to the highest species diversity. Lime applications did not improve plant establishment in either the field or the greenhouse. To promote revegetation of seawater-contaminated cutover bogs, adding P is an asset, Carex paleacea is a good species to transplant, and the transfer of salt marsh diaspores improves plant diversity.

Pomel in processing tomato crops	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												The root-parasitic weed Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel represents a major problem for processing tomato crops. The control of this holoparasitic plant is difficult, and better understanding of treatment methods is needed to develop new and specific control strategies. This study investigated 12 agronomic, chemical, biological and biotechnological strategies for the control of this parasitic weed, in comparison with the untreated situation. The trial was carried out in 2014 at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Environment of the University of Foggia (southern Italy), using processing tomato plants grown in pots filled with soil from a field that was heavily infested with P. ramosa. After transplantation, top dressing was performed with 70 kg ha(-1) nitrogen. A randomised block design with 3 replicates (pots) was adopted. During the growing cycle of the tomato, at 70, 75, 81 and 88 days after transplantation, the number of parasitic shoots (branched plants) that had emerged in each pot was determined, and the leaf chlorophyll of the plants was measured using a soil-plantanalysis-development meter. At harvesting on 8 August 2014, the major quanti-qualitative yield parameters were determined, including marketable yield, mean weight, dry matter, soluble solids, and fruit colour. The results show lower chlorophyll levels in the parasitised tomato plants, compared to healthy plants. None of the treatments provided complete control against P. ramosa. However, among the methods tested, Radicon (R) biostimulant (Radicon, Inc., Elk Grove Village, IL, USA), compost activated with Fusarium oxysporum, nitrogen and sulphur mineral fertilisers, Enzone (TM) soil fumigant (Elliott Chemicals Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand), and a resistant tomato genotype mitigated the virulence of the attacks of this parasite. These effects should be improved by combining some of these treatments, especially for gradual and continued reduction in the seed bank of the parasite in the soil. For the tomato yields across the different treatments, there were no significant differences seen; however, the yields showed an improving trend for treatments with lower presence of the P. ramosa weed.

In the present study, the effects of nitrogen additions on seed germination and seedling biomass of Calamagrostis angustifolia freshwater marsh were tested in a greenhouse study. Seed bank soil was exposed to different N additions (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 g/m(2)) under non-flooded water regime. Results revealed that, low level of N additions (less than 10 g/m(2)) did not significantly affect the species richness and seedling density, while the seedling biomass at 5 g/m(2) of N addition was higher than other nutrient conditions. But species richness, seedling emergence and biomass decreased significantly at high level of N additions (20-40 g/m(2)). The responses were species-specific. High level of N additions had negative impacts on seed germination, seedling growth and biomass of dominant species Eleocharis ovata, Calamagrostis angustifolia, Juncus effusus in the seed bank. To protect and restore the wetland vegetation community in the Sanjiang plain, fertilization, irrigation and land management strategies will need to be implemented to reduce the nutrient input from the agricultural land to the wetlands.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	10					3915	3922									WOS:000386746100009

Moq. is a New World temperate, subtropical, and tropical maritime species that typically occurs 1.0-1.5 m above the mean high tide mark. It is a facultative annual that occurs on saturated substrates consisting of unconsolidated sand, shell fragments, and slightly elevated saline clays and sandy clays. Also known as sea blite, it is found in salinity conditions ranging from 10 to 50 parts per thousand. Sexual reproduction is the only mechanism of reproduction. Seed production is prolific and seed banks are well-supplied with this species. Seeds are dimorphic, and germination is high in both full sun and in shaded conditions.																	0167-9406		978-3-319-27093-7; 978-3-319-27091-3				2016	48						73	84		10.1007/978-3-319-27093-7_5	10.1007/978-3-319-27093-7						WOS:000387124200008

Genetic Variability of Three Annual Halophyte Species in an Inland Salt Marsh Through Time	SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS VOL V: THE AMERICAS	Tasks for Vegetation Science											Soil seed banks have been proposed to be a repository of genetic information and reported to be more genetically diverse than a single population at any given point in time. Genetic diversity of three annual autogamous halophytic species (Atriplex prostrata, Salicornia depressa, and Spergularia salina) from an inland salt marsh community was compared within and among three cohorts representing populations from 1981, 1998, and the persistent seed bank of 2000 using Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) analysis. Genetic variation was assayed using three primers on 30 samples (individuals) for each cohort of each species. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) showed that cohorts were significantly different for each species. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) indicated a high degree of separation for the three cohorts of each species, indicating a turnover in genetic composition over the 17-year period and between above-and belowground cohorts. Percent polymorphic loci indicated the 2000 seed bank of S. salina and S. depressa were less diverse than either cohort representing 1981 or 1998 (the seed bank of S. salina was monomorphic), but the persistent seed bank from 2000 of A. prostrata was more diverse than either the 1981 or 1998 aboveground cohorts. Overall diversity increased from 1981 to 1998 for S. salina and A. prostrata, but decreased for S. depressa. Our findings show that seed banks are not always a long-term repository of genetic information and can be less genetically diverse than any one population. Genetic diversity may increase or decrease for a given population over time. More multi-year or cross-decade investigations on seed banks and aboveground vegetation in wetland species, especially those found in extreme habitats such as inland salt marshes, are needed.																	0167-9406		978-3-319-27093-7; 978-3-319-27091-3				2016	48						105	118		10.1007/978-3-319-27093-7_7	10.1007/978-3-319-27093-7						WOS:000387124200010

The Seed Bank of a Hypersaline Shrub Community in the Bahamas	SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS VOL V: THE AMERICAS	Tasks for Vegetation Science											Along the Fresh Lake causeway on San Salvador Island, the Bahamas, the seed bank was compared to the above ground vegetation in May 2006. Vegetation was dominated by a shrub canopy of Conocarpus erectus. A 49 m transect was run along the south side of the Fresh Lake causeway, and 10 secondary transects were randomly run from it towards Fresh Lake. Percent above ground cover was determined, and soil cores were taken along secondary transects at 0, 1, and 2 m. Percent above ground cover was calculated in 15 x 15 cm quadrats, and 6.0 cm diameter x 7.5 cm deep soil samples (n = 30) were collected. Species diversity was low, with only Borrichia arborescens (1.7 %), Sporobolus virginicus (16.8 %) and a member of the Poaceae (< 1 %) representing aboveground vegetation. Only Conocarpus erectus represented the canopy. The majority of each quadrat along the secondary transects was bare ground. Percent above ground vegetation along the transects was determined and compared to number of seeds present. Only 43 (15,208 seeds/m(2)) Conocarpus erectus seeds were present in the entire seed bank, and were found at plots 2, 8, and 10. Shrubs of this species were found at plots 1, 2, 7, and 10. No seeds of any other species were found in any transect. Tidal action may be the main force in distributing seeds along the causeway and out of the sampled area. A second factor accounting for low seed numbers may have been that seeds germinated but seedlings died before being recruited into the canopy.																	0167-9406		978-3-319-27093-7; 978-3-319-27091-3				2016	48						251	259		10.1007/978-3-319-27093-7_13	10.1007/978-3-319-27093-7						WOS:000387124200016

Factors restricting seed germination and seedling recruitment of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus: an evergreen shrub endemic to cold deserts in China	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Knowledge of abiotic and biotic stress regulating seedling recruitment of desert shrubs is limited. Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, we determined (1) the interactive effect of soil moisture and temperature on seed germination; (2) the effect of burial depth on seedling emergence and seed survival; and (3) the effect of simulated seedling herbivory on seedling establishment of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an endangered evergreen shrub of the cold deserts of northwest China. Low water potential inhibited germination and increased seed death more at high than at low temperatures. No seeds sown on the soil surface germinated, whereas 52 and 34% of those buried in soil at 20 and 50 mm soil depth, respectively, did germinate. Most seeds sown on the soil surface died, whereas seeds buried 50 mm deep germinated but the seedlings subsequently died. A small portion of seeds was viable after 1.5 years burial on the surface in the field; thus, A. mongolicus can form at least a short-lived persistent seed bank. Seed predation had no effect on seedling emergence, whereas it significantly reduced seedling survival. Seedling biomass, height and survival rate decreased significantly as cotyledon removal ratio increased. These results may have potential value for conservation and restoration of A. mongolicus in its cold desert habitat.																	0251-0952	1819-5717					2016	44	2					253	266		10.15258/sst.2016.44.2.07							WOS:000385989500002

Structure and genetic diversity of natural Brazilian pepper populations (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH												In the face of a possible loss of genetic diversity in plants due the environmental changes, actions to ensure the genetic variability are an urgent necessity. The extraction of Brazilian pepper fruits is a cause of concern because it results in the lack of seeds in soil, hindering its distribution in space and time. It is important to address this concern and explore the species, used by riparian communities and agro-factories without considering the need for keeping the seeds for natural seed banks and for species sustainability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure and the genetic diversity in natural Brazilian pepper populations (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi). Twenty-two alleles in 223 individuals were identified from eight forest remnants located in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe. All populations presented loci in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium deviation. Four populations presented six combinations of loci in linkage disequilibrium. Six exclusive alleles were detected in four populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed the absence of diversity between regions and that between the populations (G(ST)) was 41%. Genetic diversity was structured in seven clusters (Delta K7). Brazilian pepper populations were not structured in a pattern of isolation by distance and present genetic bottleneck. The populations Sao Mateus, Canastra, Barbacena, and Ilha das Flores were identified as management units and may support conservation projects, ecological restoration and in implementation of management plans for Brazilian pepper in the State of Sergipe.

A comparative framework of the Erythrina velutina tree species in reforested land and native populations	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH												Erythrina velutina Willd. (Fabaceae: Papillionoideae) is a pioneer species found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world that has medicinal properties and that is used in reforestation projects. This species is rare in some areas of northeastern Brazil. This study aimed to characterize and compare genetic structures of natural and restored populations of E. velutina, with a focus on the selection of tree seeds. A total of 108 individuals from five natural populations and one restored population were analyzed using ISSR markers, resulting in 407 polymorphic fragments. A high rate of polymorphism was observed in the restored population. The highest genetic variability was identified within populations (82%). Genetic bottleneck tests were significant for the Carmopolis/Rosario do Catete and Laranjeiras natural populations along with the Laranjeiras restored population. Genetic distances significantly correlated with spatial distance. Only the restored population retained unique alleles. Similarly, increased genetic distance was observed in individuals of the restored populations compared to the other populations. Observed genetic variation in both natural and restored populations of E. velutina was moderate, thus enabling selection of divergent trees from those trees supplying seeds. Environmental protection and management of these areas is necessary for the maintenance of these individuals and subsequent reproduction. We recommend suggestions for E. velutina conservation, since the restoration model adopted in this study did not promote the development of the specimens until the reproductive stage in a fashion that aims to augment the soil seed bank supply, as is suggested for pioneer species.

J	Hunter, JT				Hunter, John T.			Differences in disturbance type and nutrient availability favour different functional traits across three co-occurring montane wetland systems in eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Three co-occurring temperate montane non-riparian freshwater wetland communities of the New England Batholith of eastern Australia were chosen to test differences in resource allocation to select functional traits. Each of the wetlands was tested against inferred gradients of nutrient availability, fire and disturbance frequency. Collated functional trait data on 563 native vascular plant taxa known to occur in bogs, fens and lagoons were used against a centrally weighted means redundancy analysis. Traits included life form, plant height, leaf area, fruit size, seed size, mono- or polycarpy, storage organs, fruit type, vegetative spread and geographic range size. Where disturbances were moderate to low in frequency and habitats persistent, tolerance and in-situ permanence traits were favoured. With high nutrient availability and a low disturbance regime polycarpic species with large leaves that allow for larger fruit development were more common. Under low nutrient availability and a moderate disturbance regime, persistence was shifted to a longer lived polycarpic life history that includes woody taxa with increased seed size and a greater diversity of fruit types. In frequently inundated habitats, with shifting windows of available habitats, avoidance was the best strategy. Here persistence shifts to long-lived soil stored diaspores and a monocarpic life history with rapid vegetative growth to capture above ground spatial resource within temporary habitats.

Impact of heat on seed germination of three perennial grasses in the semiarid region in Central Argentina	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Fire is an important factor affecting the viability and germination of seeds in the soil seed bank. We evaluated the effects of heat on germination and seed viability of three native perennials winter grasses of central Argentina. Seeds of two palatable grasses Piptochaetium napostaense (Speg.) Hack, Nassella tenuis (Phil.) Barkworth and a non-palatable Jarava ichu Ruiz & Pav. were exposed to different heat shock treatments resulting from a combination of temperature: 70, 90, 120, 140 and 170 degrees C and three exposure times (5, 10 or 20min) and a control (no heat) treatment. All control treatments had a high percentage of seed viability (> 97%). Germination of P. napostaense was not affected by mild heat shock (70 and 90 degrees C) but it was sensitive to higher temperatures: no seeds survived the exposure to 140 and 170 degrees C. Seeds of this species have awns that facilitate the burring of seeds in the soil, which can reduce fire exposure. N. tenuis and J. ichu were less sensitive to heat. High heat shock reduced seed germination but not seed viability. These experiments show that seeds of P. napostaense, the target species for management on these grasslands, were the most sensitive to heat treatments. Our results show that heat shock can have a negative effect on the soil seed bank of P. napostaense (palatable and dominant species), but does not have significant effects on J. ichu seeds (unpalatable species). Thus, we suggest that the current management recommendations for the use of controlled fire to promote palatable species may not be optimal for these species.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2016	64	5					451	455		10.1071/BT15238							WOS:000383165400008						
J	Boydak, M; Caliskan, S				Boydak, Melih; Caliskan, Servet			Effects of heat shock on seed germination of Turkish red pine (Pinus brutia)	BOSQUE												Fire plays an important ecological role in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Many Mediterranean plant species exhibit enhanced germination capacity when exposed to heat. In the present study, the effect of high temperatures and exposure times on germination of Turkish red pine (Pinus brutia) was analyzed in order to reveal the response of seeds to fire and the implications on species regeneration. Seeds were heated to a range of temperatures (from 75 to 170 degrees C) and exposure times (from 30 seconds to 30 minutes) similar to those obtained in surface soil layers during natural fires. In total, twenty treatments were performed. Seed germination percentages and germination values were calculated for each treatment. The results of ANOVA performed for germination values showed that temperature had a significant effect. Germination percentages increased in thermal treatments at 70 degrees C for 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min; at 105 degrees C for 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, and at 130 degrees C for 1 and 2 min. The increase in both temperature and exposure times generally decreased the germination percentage especially at 130 degrees C and over in comparison with the control. Maximum germination percentage was reached in the treatment at 130 degrees C for 1 min while the minimum germination was reached at 130 degrees C for 10 min.

Lutz			Effect of expansive species on seed rain and soil seed bank of mountain mesic meadows	TUEXENIA												The degradation of species-rich mountain meadows has been observed in many parts of Central Europe in the last few decades. It is reflected in decreasing species numbers and changes in the proportions of plant species in the aboveground vegetation. Some species are increasing in abundance and eventually dominate the meadow vegetation. There is still a lack of studies explaining how this process is reflected in the soil seed bank. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to test whether expansive species that degrade aboveground vegetation of mountain meadows also influence, quantitatively and qualitatively, seed rain and seed bank. Soil samples were taken from 14 plots in degraded patches and another 14 plots in non-degraded patches. Nearly the same numbers of seedlings were recorded in both meadow types. In both cases, low similarities between aboveground vegetation and soil seed rain and seed bank were observed. Expansive species causing meadow degradation (Calamagrostis epigejos, Festuca rubra, Deschampsia cespitosa and Lupinus polyphyllus) reached cover values of 60-83% in the aboveground vegetation, and a share of up to 36% in the seed rain and seed bank. The mean species richness in the aboveground vegetation and the soil of degraded meadows was lower than in the non degraded plots. However, the seed bank may buffer degradation to some extent since the degradation of aboveground vegetation was faster than impoverishment of seed bank. Consequently, seed rain and seed bank of degraded meadows still contained typical mesic meadow species in similar proportions as non-degraded meadows. This indicates that seed rain and seed bank may contribute to the restoration of degraded meadows after the removal of expansive species from the aboveground vegetation.

Sowing low-diversity seed mixtures is widely used in grassland restoration because of its high predictability and fast, promising results. Generally, the sown perennial grasses establish within a few years and form a dense sward, which effectively suppresses weeds. Unfortunately, these grasslands are often species-poor because the sown grasses hamper the colonisation of target grassland forbs. Our aim was to test a novel approach to increase the diversity of species-poor grasslands. We selected eight 8-year-old grasslands restored by low-diversity seed sowing where we created 32 establishment gaps by breaking up the grass sward and sowing a high-diversity seed mixture (35 native species). Altogether, we established three grazed gaps (1 to x 1 m, 2 m x 2 m and 4 m x 4 m) and one fenced gap (4 m x 4 m) per site and monitored the presence and abundance of sown and non sown species within a time frame of two years. We asked the following questions: (1) Which target species establish most successfully? (2) What is the effect of establishment gap size on the establishment success of target species and weeds? (3) What is the effect of management (grazed versus not managed) on the species composition of the establishment gaps? Our results showed that by creating establishment gaps and sowing diverse seed mixtures, we were able to overcome microsite and propagule limitation, successfully introducing target species into the species-poor grasslands. We found that all sown species established in the gaps, and the majority of the species maintained or even increased their first-year cover in the second year. Smaller gaps were characterised by lower cover of sown species and a quite stochastic development compared to the larger ones. Weed cover was moderate in the first year and decreased significantly in the second year, regardless of gap size. Therefore, in restoration practice, the use of larger establishment gaps is recommended. We found that the cover of sown species and weeds were similar in the grazed and unmanaged gaps during our study. However, management by extensive grazing might be crucial in the long-term because livestock can disperse target species propagules and create microsites. Our study shows that establishment gaps can serve as biodiversity hotspots. Further studies need to clarify to what extent they can improve the restoration success across the entire grassland.

SEEDS IN AN INDUCED SOIL SEED BANK	CERNE												This work studied the behavior of G. americana L. (Rubiaceae) seeds in an induced soil seed bank. This study was conducted in Lavras-MG in a seasonal semideciduous forest of the Federal University of Lavras. Seeds collected in the area were cleaned and analyzed (water content, viability and desiccation tolerance). Soil banks were installed in two distinct areas (top of hill and riparian forest) located in the understory of the forest. Seeds were placed in nylon nets and covered with a thin litter layer that was previously removed for this purpose. Monthly assessment of germination, seedling emergence, seed and soil water content, and the characterization of the initial seedling growth was performed. It was observed that G. americana seeds forms a transitory seed bank, with maintenance of its viability until the fourth month after disposal in natural environment. In general, the seed bank located in the riparian forest area showed the best potential for seedling establishment in a natural environment, which supports the ecological behavior of this species.

J	Mokotjomela, TM				Mokotjomela, Thabiso Michael			Patterns of granivory in Acacia cyclops stands under biological control at Langebaanweg, South Africa	NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO												Low seed abundance associated with effect of biological control agents in an invasive shrub Acacia cyclops may limit its seed banks and further spread of the remaining seed crop in the South western Cape, South Africa. However, there is a limited knowledge on how a reduced seed abundance, and vegetation cover which is positively correlated to seed bank size, affects patterns of granivory in A. cyclops stands. To fill this knowledge gap, granivory rates were measured using seed exclosure cages located both in closed and open A. cyclops tree canopy covers at Langebaanweg. Fresh seeds of A. cyclops were presented in tens per cage, and monitored in four-hour intervals of the day during the seeding season (December-July, 2013). Seed removal by rodents (74%) was not affected by vegetation cover suggesting an increased demand of the scarce seeds of A. cyclops. Conversely, seed removal by invertebrates (16%) was lowest among treatments, and was restricted in low tree canopy cover possibly due to competition for seeds under shady canopy. About 10% of the remaining seeds were consumed by vertebrates during the afternoon times associated with limited dispersal chances. In combination, biological control agents and rodents' seed predation may effectively reduce seed banks of A. cyclops and invasion of this species in South Africa.

Three categories of seasonal wetlands were evaluated: reference condition, converted cropland, and excavated. Vegetation surveys were conducted in the wet meadow and shallow marsh zones of 39 seasonal wetlands located in Benson, Eddy, Towner, and Wells Counties, North Dakota. Visual obstruction readings were taken at various heights in order to assess habitat quality. There were no geographic differences in the reference wetland plant communities. However, there were significant treatment differences between the plant communities of the wet meadow and shallow marsh zones. In general, excavated wetlands showed vegetation trends similar to reference wetlands, whereas the converted cropland wetlands tended to be more cattail-choked. Visual obstruction scores and mean percent cover of hybrid cattail (Typha X glauca) were considerably higher in converted cropland sites than in excavated and reference sites, indicating that the excavated and reference sites provide the potential for higher quality wildlife habitat. Actively restoring wetlands through excavation is a promising technique that deserves further implementation and investigation.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JAN	2016	36	1					48	58		10.3375/043.036.0110							WOS:000377433900006

Analysis of the ex situ conservation of the Greek endemic flora at national European and global scales and of its effectiveness in meeting GSPC Target 8	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												We examine the extent to which the rich endemic flora of Greece, a country in the Mediterranean hotspot, and particularly that part facing an extinction risk, is effectively conserved ex situ. We detected 3067 accessions of 523 taxa representing 37.2% of the Greek endemics in 213 botanic gardens (BGs, 439 taxa) and 14 seed banks (SBs, 344 taxa) of 36 countries; 46.7% of these accessions are in Greek institutions. Seeds are available for only 23.8% of the taxa in SBs. Of the 558 threatened and near-threatened endemics, 268 are conserved ex situ. Of these, 44.8% are accessioned in a single BG and 48.9% in a single SB; in the latter, 25% are represented by a single accession number. Based on major concerns, for a taxon to be considered as effectively conserved ex situ, we propose that it be represented by no less than five accessions deposited in two institutions of two countries, at least. This criterion is met by only 6.4% of the taxa in SBs. There is still a long way to go so as to achieve Target 8 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC).

Attract them anyway: benefits of large, showy flowers in a highly autogamous, carnivorous plant species	AOB PLANTS												Reproductive biology of carnivorous plants has largely been studied on species that rely on insects as pollinators and prey, creating potential conflicts. Autogamous pollination, although present in some carnivorous species, has received less attention. In angiosperms, autogamous self-fertilization is expected to lead to a reduction in flower size, thereby reducing resource allocation to structures that attract pollinators. A notable exception is the carnivorous pyrophyte Drosophyllum lusitanicum(Drosophyllaceae), which has been described as an autogamous selfing species but produces large, yellow flowers. Using a flower removal and a pollination experiment, we assessed, respectively, whether large flowers in this species may serve as an attracting device to prey insects or whether previously reported high selfing rates for this species in peripheral populations may be lower in more central, less isolated populations. We found no differences between flower-removed plants and intact, flowering plants in numbers of prey insects trapped. We also found no indication of reduced potential for autogamous reproduction, in terms of either seed set or seed size. However, our results showed significant increases in seed set of bagged, hand-pollinated flowers and unbagged flowers exposed to insect visitation compared with bagged, non-manipulated flowers that could only self-pollinate autonomously. Considering that the key life-history strategy of this pyrophytic species is to maintain a viable seed bank, any increase in seed set through insect pollinator activity would increase plant fitness. This in turn would explain the maintenance of large, conspicuous flowers in a highly autogamous, carnivorous plant.

However, no studies have addressed how sexual and asexual reproduction modes of A. wudanica perform at the transitional zones between active dune inter-dune lowlands and active dunes. In early spring, quadrats were randomly set up in the study area to monitor surviving seedling and/or ramet density and frequency coming from sexual/asexual reproduction of A. wudanica. Iron sticks were inserted near each quadrat to determine wind erosion intensity (WE). Additionally, soil samples were collected nearby each quadrat to test for soil moisture (SM), organic matter (OM) and pH. Surviving seedlings of A. wudanica showed an inverse response in comparison with ramets to SM, OM and WE. Soil moisture showed the most positive effect, and WE the negative effect, on surviving, sexual reproduction seedlings. Contrarily, WE had the most positive effect, and SM the negative effect, on asexual reproduction ramets. This suggests that increases in SM and decreases in WE should benefit recruitment of A. wudanica seedlings. On the contrary, ramets coming from asexual reproduction showed a different response to environmental factors in transition zone habitats. While SM was not a key constraint for the survival of seedlings, they showed a better, positive response to wind erosion environments. Overall, various study environmental parameters could be improved to foster A. wudanica invasion and settlement in the plant community through different reproductive modes, thereby promoting vegetation restoration and rehabilitation.																	1869-9510	1869-9529					2016	7	2					621	629		10.5194/se-7-621-2016							WOS:000374543400021						
J	Moszkowicz, L				Moszkowicz, Lukasz			Distribution of vascular plant species in woodland patches of Ojcow National Park (southern Poland) in relation to seed dispersal	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Plant diaspore dispersal is a fundamental process affecting the development of forest vegetation and its natural regeneration, especially with regard to typical woodland species, which spread slowly and form short-term soil seed banks. Most of these species have poor seed dispersal mechanisms, which is the major cause of their very slow expansion. The following questions were asked: (i) is there a relationship between the age of a woodland and the presence of forest vascular plant species representing different seed dispersal types; (ii) how do the proportions change between species representing different seed dispersal types in relation to the age of woodland; (iii) what factors determine the presence of species representing a given seed dispersal type; (iv) which factors affect the presence and which ones influence the abundance of selected woodland species? A multiple regression models were developed based on data obtained from 144 woodland patches designated for the study. A probit regression analysis was performed for selected species exhibiting various seed dispersal models. Woodland plants of all seed dispersal types show a significant relationship with the age of woodland, starting from the strongest linkage: anemochores, myrmecochores, endozoochores, epizoochores, barochores, autochores. As the woodland ages, the proportion of forest myrmecochores and anemochores grows, whilst the proportion of autochores, epizoochores and endozoochores shrinks. Results obtained indicate that the direct proximity of ancient woodland has a major effect on the occurrence of more poorly dispersing plants in recent woodlands, such as myrmecochores and heavy anemochores.																	0001-6977	2083-9480					2016	85	1							3484	10.5586/asbp.3484							WOS:000374192800003

(cheatgrass or downy brome) presents a rich resource for soil microorganisms because of its abundant production of biomass, seeds, and surface litter. Many of these organisms are opportunistic saprophytes, but several fungal species regularly found in B. tectorum stands function as facultative or obligate pathogens. These organisms interact dynamically with abiotic factors such as interannual variation in weather, with other soil microorganisms, with their hosts, and with each other to create spatially and temporally varying patterns of endemic or epidemic disease. Five principal soilborne pathogens, Ustilago bullata Berk. (head smut pathogen), Tilletia bromi (Brockm.) Nannf. (chestnut bunt pathogen), Pyrenophora semeniperda (Brittlebank & Adams) Shoemaker (black fingers of death pathogen), Fusarium Link sp. n. (Fusarium seed rot pathogen), and a new species in the Rutstroemiaceae (bleach blonde syndrome pathogen), are known to have sometimes major impacts on B. tectorum seed bank dynamics, seedling emergence, and seed production. These pathogens exhibit niche specialization, so that they are rarely in direct competition. They sometimes interact to increase the total impact on B. tectorum stand structure, which can result in stand failure or "die-off." Die-offs represent areas where B. tectorum has been controlled by natural processes, suggesting that these areas might be suitable targets for restoration. Naturally occurring fungal pathogens that can have a strong negative impact on B. tectorum success have also been considered as candidate organisms for B. tectorum biocontrol using an augmentative mycoherbicidal strategy.																	0172-6161		978-3-319-24930-8; 978-3-319-24928-5				2016							193	223		10.1007/978-3-319-24930-8_7	10.1007/978-3-319-24930-8						WOS:000373556000007

Seed bank density, weed population dynamics and crop productivity were studied in wheat crop under different tillage treatments in a field experiment carried out during summer and winter seasons of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. Different combinations of tillage, integrated with glyphosate herbicide were used in the fallow period (summer season). Results showed that tillage systems along with glyphosate in summer season controlled the establishment of seed bank density as observed in conventional tillage treatment. There was a positive and very week correlation between tillage intensity and seed bank density of C. arvensis L. Similarly the weed population dynamics with reference to importance value index of weed was minimum in 1 Disc harrowing + 4 cultivations that was not significantly different from no-till + glyphosate. Tillage intensity integrated with glyphosate showed negligible but negative correlation with the weed population dynamics. In crux, no tillage integrated with glyphosate is recommended for economical reduction of seed bank density and weed population of field bindweed in rainfed wheat areas.

RANGELAND JOURNAL												Chinee apple (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) is a thorny tree that is invading tropical woodlands of northern Australia. The present study reports three experiments related to the seed dynamics of chinee apple. Experiment 1 and 2 investigated persistence of seed lots under different soil types (clay and river loam), levels of pasture cover (present or absent) and burial depths (0, 2.5, 10 and 20 cm). Experiment 3 determined the germination response of chinee apple seeds to a range of alternating day/night temperatures (11/6 degrees C up to 52/40 degrees C). In the longevity experiments (Expts 1 and 2), burial depth, soil type and burial duration significantly affected viability. Burial depth had the greatest influence, with surface located seeds generally persisting for longer than those buried below ground. Even so, no viable seeds remained after 18 and 24 months in the first and second experiment, respectively. In Expt 3 seeds of chinee apple germinated under a wide range of alternating day/night temperatures ranging from 16/12 degrees C to 47/36 degrees C. Optimal germination (77%) occurred at 33/27 degrees C and no seeds germinated at either of the lowest (11/6 degrees C) or highest (52/40 degrees C) temperature regimes tested. These findings indicated that chinee apple has the potential to expand its current distribution to cooler areas of Australia. Control practices need to be undertaken for at least two years to exhaust the seed bank.

Allelopathy, seed germination, weed control and bioassay methods	ALLELOPATHY JOURNAL												Even before its formal establishment as a scientific discipline, allelopathy has been intertwined with agriculture and the potential of allelopathy for weed control has been a permanent matter of interest. Therefore we investigate the importance of seeds and of permanent soil seed banks as a means for propagation of weed species as well as strategies for long-term weed control. Depleting seed banks is critical and encouraging weed seed germination prior to sowing crops is one of the most promising targets for weed control by allelopathins.

Finally we present and discuss methodologic aspects to be taken into account in allelopathic studies for efficient weed control by either permanently inhibiting weed seed germination or by stimulating weed seed germination.																	0971-4693	0974-1240				JAN	2016	37	1					31	40									WOS:000370065800003						
J	Blazek, P; Leps, J; Fajmon, K; Tesitel, J				Blazek, Petr; Leps, Jan; Fajmon, Karel; Tesitel, Jakub			Response of two hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae species to mowing dates: implications for grassland conservation and restoration practice	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Rhinanthus major (= R. angustifolius) and Melampyrum nemorosum are very sensitive to mowing date. As they are annuals without a long-term persistent seed bank and with a poor long-distance dispersal ability, seed loss caused by an unsuitable mowing date could lead to rapid population decline. Since their populations have disappeared from productive grasslands, they have become a focus of conservational management. Rhinanthus is also used in restoration projects as a treatment for reducing biomass, where its permanent populations are desired. We aimed to deteimine the earliest suitable mowing date for these species in White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area to support its administration to plan the management. Methods - We conducted a mowing experiment with plots mown on 7 and 18 June and 5 July 2012. The number of parasites was counted in central plots before mowing and in the following growing season. The phenology of hemiparasites and co-occurring species was recorded to better understand the effects of mowing date. Key results - Melampyrum showed a significant population decrease after mowing on 7 and 18 June, while the 5 July mowing did not inflict any significant change. The effect on Rhinanthus was not significant, as it was probably obscured by seed dispersal from the close surroundings. Conclusions - Mowing in July is suitable for both species, while June mowing leads to population declines. Mosaic mowing (which includes early mowing in some parts of a site), could therefore gradually eradicate Melampyrum. Rhinanthus metapopulation could compensate for the seed loss by seed dispersal from neighbouring parts, but careful monitoring is necessary. When using Rhinanthus in restoration experiments, postponed mowing is essential to keep its population permanent. Our conclusions are widely applicable, but the particular mowing date must be determined separately for each region, species and ecotype.

Giant Ragweed (Ambrosia trifida) Seed Production and Retention in Soybean and Field Margins	WEED TECHNOLOGY												As herbicide-resistant weed populations become increasingly problematic in crop production, alternative strategies of weed control are necessary. Giant ragweed, one of the most competitive agricultural weeds in row crops, has evolved resistance to multiple herbicide biochemical sites of action within the plant, necessitating the development of new and integrated methods of weed control. This study assessed the quantity and duration of seed retention of giant ragweed grown in soybean fields and adjacent field margins. Seed retention of giant ragweed was monitored weekly during the 2012 to 2014 harvest seasons using seed collection traps. Giant ragweed plants produced an average of 1,818 seeds per plant, with 66% being potentially viable. Giant ragweed on average began shattering hard ( potentially viable) and soft ( nonviable) seeds September 12 and continued through October at an average rate of 0.75 and 0.44% of total seeds per day during September and October, respectively. Giant ragweed seeds remained on the plants well into the Minnesota soybean harvest season, with an average of 80% of the total seeds being retained on October 11, when Minnesota soybean harvest was approximately 75% completed in the years of the study. These results suggest that there is a sufficient amount of time to remove escaped giant ragweed from production fields and field margins before the seeds shatter by managing weed seed dispersal before or at crop harvest. Controlling weed seed dispersal has potential to manage herbicide-resistant giant ragweed by limiting replenishment of the weed seed bank.

J	Carrnona, CP; Navarro, E; Peco, B				Carrnona, Carlos P.; Navarro, Elena; Peco, Begona			Fungal-mediated mortality explains the different effects of dung leachates on the germination response of grazing increaser and decreaser species	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Depending on their response to grazing, grassland species can be categorized as grazing increasers or decreasers. Grazing by livestock includes several different activities that can impact species differently. Recent evidence suggest that one of these actions, dung deposition, can reduce the germinative performance of decreaser species, thus favouring increasers. The present study tested the hypothesis that decreased germinative success of decreaser species is caused by a greater activity of fungal pathogens under the influence of dung leachates. We performed a phytotron experiment analysing the germination and fungal infections of fourteen species from Mediterranean grasslands. Species were grouped into phylogenetically-related pairs, composed of an increaser and a decreaser species. Seeds of each species were germinated under four different treatments (control, dung leachate addition, fungicide addition and dung leachate and fungicide addition), and the differences in germination percentage, germination speed and infection rate between each increaser species and its decreaser counterpart were analysed. Decreaser species were more affected by mortality than increaser ones, and these differences were higher under the presence of dung leachates. The differences in germinative performance after excluding the effect of seed mortality did not differ between treatments, showing that the main mechanism by which dung leachates favour increaser species is through increased mortality of the seeds of decreaser species. Drastic reductions in the number of dead seeds in the treatments including fungicide addition further revealed that fungal pathogens are responsible for these differences between species with different grazing response. The different vulnerabilities of increaser and decreaser species to the increased activity of fungal pathogens under the presence of dung leachates seems the main reason behind the differential effect of these leachates on species with different grazing response.

Despite the potentially major influence of this functional trait on the regeneration and distribution of species under climate change, little is currently known about the ecological determinants of the persistence of desiccation-sensitive seeds in transient soil seed banks. Knowing which key climatic and microsite factors favour seed survival will help define the regeneration niche for species whose seeds display extreme sensitivity to environmental stress Methods Using the Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) forest as a model system, an in situ time-course monitoring of seed water status and viability was performed during the unfavourable winter season in two years with contrasting rainfall, at an instrumented site with detailed climate records. In parallel, the characteristics of the microhabitat and their influence on the post-winter water status and viability of seeds were investigated in a regional survey of 33 woodlands representative of the French distribution of the species. Key Results Time-course monitoring of seed water status in natural conditions confirmed that in situ desiccation is the main abiotic cause of mortality in winter. Critical water contents could be reached in a few days during drought spells. Seed dehydration rates were satisfactorily estimated using integrative climate proxies including vapour pressure deficit and potential evapotranspiration. Seed water status was therefore determined by the balance between water uptake after a rainfall event and water loss during dry periods. Structural equation modelling of microhabitat factors highlighted the major influence of canopy openness and resulting incident radiation on the ground. Conclusions This study provides part of the knowledge required to implement species distribution models which incorporate their regeneration niche. It is an important step forward in evaluating the ecological consequences of increasing winter drought and environmental filtering due to climate change on the regeneration of the most dominant Mediterranean tree species.

J	Ellison, AM; Plotkin, AAB; Khalid, S				Ellison, Aaron M.; Plotkin, Audrey A. Barker; Khalid, Shah			Foundation Species Loss and Biodiversity of the Herbaceous Layer in New England Forests	FORESTS												Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is a foundation species in eastern North American forests. Because eastern hemlock is a foundation species, it often is assumed that the diversity of associated species is high. However, the herbaceous layer of eastern hemlock stands generally is sparse, species-poor, and lacks unique species or floristic assemblages. The rapidly spreading, nonnative hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tusgae) is causing widespread death of eastern hemlock. Loss of individual hemlock trees or whole stands rapidly leads to increases in species richness and cover of shrubs, herbs, graminoids, ferns, and fern-allies. Naively, one could conclude that the loss of eastern hemlock has a net positive effect on biodiversity. What is lost besides hemlock, however, is landscape-scale variability in the structure and composition of the herbaceous layer. In the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment, removal of hemlock by either girdling (simulating adelgid infestation) or logging led to a proliferation of early-successional and disturbance-dependent understory species. In other declining hemlock stands, nonnative plant species expand and homogenize the flora. While local richness increases in former eastern hemlock stands, between-site and regional species diversity will be further diminished as this iconic foundation species of eastern North America succumbs to hemlock woolly adelgid.

J	Casanova, MT				Casanova, Michelle T.			Historical water-plant occurrence and environmental change in two contrasting catchments	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Historical conditions in riparian systems can be derived from the recorded distribution of water plants and their ecological requirements. Herbarium and literature records were used to assess historical species occurrence, and a field survey and a seed-bank study were used to assess present-day occurrence in two adjacent, southern Australian catchments: the Angas River and the Tookayerta Creek. There was an increase in the proportion of salinity-and drought-tolerant species detected in the Angas River catchment since European settlement. Field-survey data and the seed-bank study data were similar for that catchment, indicating that the submerged flora of the Angas River catchment is resilient to drought. In contrast, the dissimilarity of the seed-bank study data and the survey data from the Tookayerta Creek catchment indicated that the submerged flora in that catchment is not tolerant of drought. Although submerged species in the Tookayerta Creek catchment are dependent on the presence of permanent fresh water, there were more salinity-tolerant species in the lower Tookayerta catchment in the present study than were detected in the past. Comparison of the historical plant distribution and present-day distribution in catchments can provide interpretation of environmental conditions and ecological filters now, and since European settlement.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2016	67	2					210	223		10.1071/MF14189							WOS:000369301100005						
J	Jaganathan, GK				Jaganathan, Ganesh K.			Influence of maternal environment in developing different levels of physical dormancy and its ecological significance	PLANT ECOLOGY												There is considerable literature on the ecology of seeds with impermeable coats, i.e., physical dormancy (PY), but the factors controlling the development of PY and their ecological importance have received little study. The differences in relative humidity, temperature, and rainfall of the maternal environment during seed development, which vary within year at different sites or between years within the same site, contribute to the number and level of PY are reviewed. These factors all influence the development of PY by lowering the level of moisture content in the seeds. Based on moisture content reached during maturation drying, two levels of PY can be recognized: (1) shallow and (2) absolute. Seeds with shallow PY are shed at higher water content, while seeds with absolute PY have lower moisture content at the time of shedding. However, if the moisture content maintained is higher than the 'shallow dormant' level, the seed coat remains permeable to water. It is suggested that this variation in the level of PY subsequently affects the dormancy loss mechanisms and determines the ability of seeds to establish a long-term persistent seed bank or germinate within few years of shedding.

Late-Season Weed Management to Stop Viable Weed Seed Production	WEED SCIENCE												Integrated weed management (IWM) for agronomic and vegetable production systems utilizes all available options to effectively manage weeds. Late-season weed control measures are often needed to improve crop harvest and stop additions to the weed seed bank. Eliminating the production of viable weed seeds is one of the key IWM practices. The objective of this research was to determine how termination method and timing influence viable weed seed production of late-season weed infestations. Research was conducted in Delaware, Michigan, and New York over a 2-yr period. The weeds studied included: common lambsquarters, common ragweed, giant foxtail, jimsonweed, and velvetleaf. Three termination methods were imposed: cutting at the plant base (simulating hand hoeing), chopping (simulating mowing), and applying glyphosate. The three termination timings were flowering, immature seeds present, and mature seeds present. Following termination, plants were stored in the field in mesh bags until mid-Fall when seeds were counted and tested for viability. Termination timing influenced viable seed development; however, termination method did not. Common ragweed and giant foxtail produced viable seeds when terminated at the time of flowering. All species produced some viable seed when immature seeds were present at the time of termination. The time of viable seed formation varied based on species and site-year, ranging from plants terminated the day of flowering to 1,337 growing degree d after flowering (base 10, 0 to 57 calendar d). Viable seed production was reduced by 64 to 100% when common lambsquarters, giant foxtail, jimsonweed, and velvetleaf were terminated with immature seeds present, compared to when plants were terminated with some mature seeds present. Our results suggest that terminating common lambsquarters, common ragweed, and giant foxtail prior to flowering, and velvetleaf and jimsonweed less than 2 and 3 wk after flowering, respectively, greatly reduces weed seed bank inputs.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				JAN-MAR	2016	64	1					112	118		10.1614/WS-D-15-00096.1							WOS:000368263100013

Ecological significance of hydrological connectivity for wetland plant communities on a dryland floodplain river, MacIntyre River, Australia	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Hydrological connections between river channels and their adjacent floodplains facilitate the flux of organisms and nutrients and access to increased habitat and new resources. Hydrological connections also deliver water subsidy and potentially disturb (through hydraulic forces) floodplain ecosystems. This study investigates the role of hydrological connectivity as a driver of patterns in wetland plant assemblages in billabongs on the floodplain of an Australian dryland river, exploring indirectly the relative importance of the mechanisms of flux, subsidy and disturbance. Wetland plants were surveyed in billabongs across gradients of hydrological connectivity and depth. Surveys were accompanied by experiments examining germination from the soil seed banks of each site under submerged and waterlogged conditions. The patterns in extant and germinant plant communities in relation to connectivity and depth gradients were used to infer the relative importance of the connectivity-related mechanisms of flux, subsidy and hydraulic disturbance in structuring wetland plant communities. Depth influenced both extant and germinating plant communities. Shallow billabongs supported a greater diversity and abundance of plants, and greater numbers and diversity of germinable seeds in the seed bank. Germination of seeds was greater in waterlogged soils than submerged soils. Thus, the main controls of plant abundance in wetlands appear to be availability of waterlogged soil habitat for germination and absence of light limitation for growth. Hydrological connectivity did not influence the abundance of plants or germinable seeds, but did influence species presence-absence in growing vegetation; this effect did not extend to the germinating community. Thus, hydrological connection does not appear to influence wetland vegetation by facilitating the movement of propagules between habitats. Instead, the patterns observed are consistent with hydrological connection providing a cue for germination through the delivery of water, and by modifying hydraulic habitat.

Spatial and temporal patterns of modern (similar to 100 yr) sedimentation in a tidal freshwater marsh: Implications for future sustainability	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To maintain their position within the tidal frame, tidal marshes must accrete upward at approximately the same rate as relative sea-level rise (RSLR), typically accomplished through accumulation of mineral (from fluvial, estuarine, and/or coastal waters) and/or organic (plant-derived) sediments. However, accelerating RSLR and declining fluvial suspended-sediment supplies, along with other direct anthropogenic disturbances, may limit the ability of many marshes to keep pace. This study tests hypotheses addressing the relationship of marsh surface elevation and channel influence to marsh accretion and evaluating marsh response to historic mining disturbance and long-term environmental change, using Dyke Marsh Preserve, a tidal freshwater marsh located along the Potomac River estuary (Chesapeake Bay watershed) as a model system. Variability in sediment characteristics (grain size, organic content, bulk density) and decadal-scale accretion rates (using Pb-210) across the marsh platform is related to ecogeomorphic setting, anthropogenic activities (mining), and long-term changes in river sediment supply and RSLR. In general, sediment on river/tidal-channel banks accumulates faster and is more influenced by fluvially derived sediment than in the marsh interior. Accumulation rates on the banks can be predicted using proxies for sediment supply and availability most of the time; however, these relationships do not hold for the marsh interior, highlighting the role of sediment redistribution and/or complex sediment-vegetation interactions. Development of temporally variable sediment rating curves reveals that suspended-sediment loads of the Potomac River have decreased since the late 1970s, although current loads appear adequate to support accretion on the marsh platform, if net onshore sediment-transport mechanisms exist.

This understanding will be important for predicting the biogeographical consequences of changing fire regimes under global climate change. Here, we asked whether changing historical fire regimes, together with climatic and geological history, have influenced phylogeographical patterns in a fire-ephemeral vine. We also asked whether demographic stochasticity associated with a fire-ephemeral life history results in nuclear genetic drift as expected from spatio-temporal patchiness, or if this effect is buffered by the connectivity and diversity afforded by a persistent soil seed bank. Location The fire-prone, mediterranean-type climate region of south-western Australia. Methods We used Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction and statistical tests of demographic expansion based on variation at three non-coding chloroplast sequence regions (atpF, ndhF-rpl32, psbD-trnT) to reconstruct phylogeographical history. Nuclear diversity and population structure at 11 microsatellite loci were investigated for evidence of genetic drift. Results Evidence for prolonged persistence and a lack of vicariance within the species range was found, together with strong evidence of historical demographic expansion. Contrary to expectations, there was little evidence of nuclear genetic drift despite strong, above-ground spatio-temporal population patchiness. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that a late Pleistocene increase in fire frequency may have led to demographic expansion in this fire-ephemeral species; alternatively, the expansion signal may be an inherent feature of fire ephemerals with a persistent soil seed bank. Prolonged climatic stability has likely fostered persistence within the species range in contrast to contraction and vicariance. The notable lack of genetic drift implies a role for ample pollen dispersal and a long-lived soil seed bank in the maintenance of diversity and connectivity in an otherwise stochastic, fire-driven system.

Weed seed bank diversity and community shift in a four-decade-old fertilization experiment in rice-rice system	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The development of management practices that allow the prediction of timing and extent of weed emergence is essential for planning more effective weed control strategies as well as maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural systems. A better understanding of the seed bank could provide useful insights into the long-term effects of organic and chemical fertilization for maintaining diversity. The effects of organic and inorganic fertilization on weed seed bank composition, density and diversity were studied in the soil of a long-term fertilizer experiment established four decades ago in CRRI, Cuttack, India. Weed seed density was lowest for Paspalidium flavidum (22 individuals per m(2)) and highest for Amniania baccifera (11,616 individuals per m(2)) irrespective of the treatments. Highest weed seed density was observed in farm yard manure (FYM) treatment whereas, lowest was in NK treatment, which was 232% higher in FYM over NK treatment. Weed seedling emergence was higher in kharif flushes and lowest in rabi. Principal component analysis ordination indicated little similarity in the weed community composition particularly among NP, NPK and NPK + FYM, while application of N alone was quite distant. Weed species diversity was reduced significantly with application of inorganic N either applied with K or alone; therefore, lowest diversity and species richness was observed in NK treatment followed by N alone. The results of the study may contribute to the development of effective weed management strategies as well as maintenance of weed diversity which leads to transition from an herbicide-dependent cropping system to a more environmentally friendly cropping system.

Project Baseline: An unprecedented resource to study plant evolution across space and time	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Project Baseline is a seed bank that offers an unprecedented opportunity to examine spatial and temporal dimensions of micro-evolution during an era of rapid environmental change. Over the upcoming 50 years, biologists will withdraw genetically representative samples of past populations from this time capsule of seeds and grow them contemporaneously with modern samples to detect any phenotypic and molecular evolution that has occurred during the intervening time. METHODS: We carefully developed this living genome bank using protocols to enhance its experimental value by collecting from multiple populations and species across a broad geographical range in sites that are likely to be preserved into the future. Seeds are accessioned with site and population data and are stored by maternal line under conditions that maximize seed longevity. This open-access resource will be available to researchers at regular intervals to evaluate contemporary evolution. KEY RESULTS: To date, the Project Baseline collection includes 100-200 maternal lines of each of 61 species collected from over 831 populations on sites that are likely to be preserved into the future across the United States (similar to 78,000 maternal lines). Our strategically designed collection circumvents some problems that can cloud the results of "resurrection" studies involving naturally preserved or existing seed collections that are available fortuitously. CONCLUSIONS: The resurrection approach can be coupled with long-established and newer techniques over the next five decades to elucidate genetic change and thereby vastly improve our understanding of temporal and spatial changes in phenotype and the evolutionary processes underlying it.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				JAN	2016	103	1					164	173		10.3732/ajb.1500313							WOS:000368561500016	26772308					
J	Downey, PO; Richardson, DM				Downey, Paul O.; Richardson, David M.			Alien plant invasions and native plant extinctions: a six-threshold framework	AOB PLANTS												Biological invasions are widely acknowledged as amajor threat to global biodiversity. Species from all major taxonomic groups have become invasive. The range of impacts of invasive taxa and the overall magnitude of the threat is increasing. Plants comprise the biggest and best-studied group of invasive species. There is a growing debate; however, regarding the nature of the alien plant threat-in particular whether the outcome is likely to be the widespread extinction of native plant species. The debate has raised questions on whether the threat posed by invasive plants to native plants has been overstated. We provide a conceptual framework to guide discussion on this topic, in which the threat posed by invasive plants is considered in the context of a progression from no impact through to extinction. We define six thresholds along the 'extinction trajectory', global extinction being the final threshold. Although there are no documented examples of either 'in the wild' (Threshold 5) or global extinctions (Threshold 6) of native plants that are attributable solely to plant invasions, there is evidence that native plants have crossed or breached other thresholds along the extinction trajectory due to the impacts associated with plant invasions. Several factors may be masking where native species are on the trajectory; these include a lack of appropriate data to accurately map the position of species on the trajectory, the timeframe required to definitively state that extinctions have occurred and management interventions. Such interventions, focussing mainly on Thresholds 1-3 (a declining population through to the local extinction of a population), are likely to alter the extinction trajectory of some species. The critical issue for conservation managers is the trend, because interventions must be implemented before extinctions occur. Thus the lack of evidence for extinctions attributable to plant invasions does not mean we should disregard the broader threat.

Because seed banks represent a memory of past and present vegetation and largely regulate the regenerative potential of species reproducing by seed, knowledge of the impact of plant invasions on the seed bank is essential to predict future population and community dynamics. Here, we review this knowledge and how it may contribute to understanding the relationship between the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation. We discuss how changes in the seed bank may be a symptom of habitat degradation, reducing the resistance of resident communities to primary invasions, and/or a driver promoting secondary invasions.

J	Nafea, E				Nafea, Elsayed			Relationship between Vegetation and Soil Seed Bank at Protected Versus Unprotected Sites at Coastal Habitats in Libya	CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The present study conducted to assess the relationship between vegetation and soil seed bank at protected versus unprotected sites at coastal habitats in Libya, where two sites (protected and non-protected) were selected and soil seeds estimated manually by sieving and flotation method. The results revealed that 190 species recorded in the protected site for both vegetation and soil seed bank, among them 87 perennials, 2 biennials and 101 annual and included 126 genera belonging to 34 families. While the non-protected site vegetation attained 104 species, among them 51 perennials, 2 biennials and 51 annuals and 82 species in soil seed bank, from which 12 species were found only as seeds and 77 species were found as seeds and as vegetation, but 22 species were found only as vegetative forms. The life form spectrum was dominated by therophytes which represented by 106 species, (55.78%) of the total number of recorded species, hemicryptophytes 32 species, (16.84%), cryptophytes 23 species, (12.1%), Chamaephytes 16 species, (8.4%) and phanerophytes 12 species, (6.3%). Soil seed bank increased with the increases of soil salinity, soil organic matter content, calcium carbonates and sandy textured soil. The higher similarity index between the vegetation and soil seed bank recorded in the protected site (100 %), while the lower one detected in non-protected site (75.26%). Vegetation protection may lead to formation of a huge storage of seeds in soil more than in the non-protected vegetation. Accordingly, soil seed banks can provide a clear picture about the present, as well as the past vegetation and could be play a vital role in conservation and restoration of rare and endangered species after the disturbance processes in the coastal habitats																	1687-5052	2090-2786					2016	15						77	87									WOS:000424612200006

Plant Community Resistance to Invasion by Bromus Species: The Roles of Community Attributes, Bromus Interactions with Plant Communities, and Bromus Traits	EXOTIC BROME-GRASSES IN ARID AND SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS OF THE WESTERN US: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES, AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS	Springer Series on Environmental Management											The factors that determine plant community resistance to exotic annual Bromus species (Bromus hereafter) are diverse and context specific. They are influenced by the environmental characteristics and attributes of the community, the traits of Bromus species, and the direct and indirect interactions of Bromus with the plant community. Environmental factors, in particular ambient and soil temperatures, have significant effects on the ability of Bromus to establish and spread. Seasonality of precipitation relative to temperature influences plant community resistance to Bromus through effects on soil water storage, timing of water and nutrient availability, and dominant plant life forms. Differences among plant communities in how well soil resource use by the plant community matches resource supply rates can influence the magnitude of resource fluctuations due to either climate or disturbance and thus the opportunities for invasion. The spatial and temporal patterns of resource availability and acquisition of growth resources by Bromus versus native species strongly influence resistance to invasion. Traits of Bromus that confer a "priority advantage" for resource use in many communities include early-season germination and high growth and reproductive rates. Resistance to Bromus can be overwhelmed by high propagule supply, low innate seed dormancy, and large, if short-lived, seed banks. Biological crusts can inhibit germination and establishment of invasive annual plants, including several annual Bromus species, but are effective only in the absence of disturbance. Herbivores can have negative direct effects on Bromus, but positive indirect effects through decreases in competitors. Management strategies can be improved through increased understanding of community resistance to exotic annual Bromus species.																	0172-6161		978-3-319-24930-8; 978-3-319-24928-5				2016							275	304		10.1007/978-3-319-24930-8_10	10.1007/978-3-319-24930-8						WOS:000373556000010

Assessing Restoration and Management Needs for Ecosystems Invaded by Exotic Annual Bromus Species	EXOTIC BROME-GRASSES IN ARID AND SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS OF THE WESTERN US: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES, AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS	Springer Series on Environmental Management											Invasive annual grass research and management in arid and semiarid ecosystems of the Western United States (USA) have historically focused on reducing weed abundance as opposed to ecosystem restoration, which addresses the underlying processes responsible for their persistence. Given the current impact of invasive annual grasses and their continued spread in this region, we identified common characteristics responsible for persistence of the most problematic exotic annual Bromus. For heavily invaded areas, these include transient, yet typically large seed banks, altered soil resource availability and litter production, displacement of native species, and frequent disturbance from fire. To better address these common characteristics for future management, we illustrate how an adaptive management framework can reduce existing uncertainty associated with the restoration of arid and semiarid ecosystems. We also assess how research and management influence these characteristics with a case study of treatment outcomes for Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass or downy brome) control and a case study of current approaches used by the US Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management to restore landscapes impacted by B. tectorum and improve greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in the Great Basin region of the Western USA. We conclude that adapting for the future will require continued integration between research and management, greater inclusion of ecological processes, and long-term experiments to inform adaptive management decisions.																	0172-6161		978-3-319-24930-8; 978-3-319-24928-5				2016							339	370		10.1007/978-3-319-24930-8_12	10.1007/978-3-319-24930-8						WOS:000373556000012

Our objective was to generate information about the dynamics of post-fire regeneration via the soil seed bank (SSB), for fire management in subtropical forests. Samples taken at soil depths of 0-3cm, 3-6 cm and 6-10 cm before and 5 h after a prescribed burn showed that the fire immediately increased the number of germinable seeds and species in a Mexican pine-oak forest. Most of the germinable seeds were from species in genera with small seeds exhibiting physical or physiological dormancy, and that are tolerant or require fire for germination. Fire increased the number of germinable seeds during the wet season and the number of species was greater in the area control at 0-6-cm soil depth after 1 year; so that the fire modified the SSB seasonal pattern. Species diversity was not altered and was dominated by perennial herbaceous and shrub species both before and 2 years after the fire. Although fire completely eliminated the aboveground biomass of the understorey vegetation, the SSB can promote regeneration and persistence of understorey vegetation following a prescribed surface fire of low severity for the ecosystem studied.

The case of Bossiaea ornata (Fabaceae) in a fire-prone, mediterranean-climate ecosystem	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Fire regimes are a significant driver of plant adaptation and evolution, and projected changes under a changing climate will have significant implications for demographic and evolutionary responses of plant populations in fireprone regions globally. We tested predictions regarding level and pattern of genetic variation within a model post-fire facultative seeder, Bossiaea ornata (Fabaceae), that exhibits a combination of both post-fire resprouting and seeding strategies. Location Fire-prone forests in the mediterranean-climate region of southwestern Australia. Methods We genotyped individuals with eight microsatellite markers and four non-coding chloroplast sequence regions to assess population genetic variation and reconstruct phylogeographical history. Results Extremely high levels of chloroplast (H-D = 0.95) and nuclear (H-E = 0.81) diversity were detected. Nuclear population differentiation was weak (F-ST = 0.06) and chloroplast phylogeographical structure was absent. A significant excess of rare chloroplast haplotypes was detected (D, F-S, R-2; all P < 0.01), consistent with demographic expansion. Main conclusions Results suggest that a facultative seeding life-history affords the benefits of both obligate resprouting and obligate seeding strategies in terms of resistance and resilience to fire. High diversity and low differentiation are likely driven by long generational overlap (resprouter feature), regular post-fire population supplementation from a persistent soil seed bank (seeder feature) and longterm stability. Expansion signals may be a feature of species with regular, synchronous post-fire recruitment from a soil seed bank, rather than evidence of a single range or demographic expansion event, as typically interpreted. The facultative seeding strategy may therefore offer resilience to potential increases in fire frequency under a changing climate in fire-prone regions.

Interactive effects between physical forces and ecosystem engineers on seed burial: a case study using Spartina anglica	OIKOS												Seed burial (i.e. vertical seed dispersal) has become increasingly valued for its relevance for seed fate and plant recruitment. While ecosystem engineers have been generally considered as the most important drivers of seed burial, the role of physical forces, such as wind or water flow, has been largely overlooked. Using tidal habitats as a model system, and a combination of flume and mesocosm experiments, we investigated the effects of 1) currents, 2) benthic animals with different engineering activities and 3) their interplay on seed burial of a common salt marsh pioneer plant, Spartina anglica. Our results reveal that in such systems, water flow can be of equal or higher importance than ecosystem engineers for seed burial. For passive seed-burying engineers (PSE), coupling their actions with currents produced synergistic seed burial effects, whereas the interactive effects were only additive for active seed-burying engineers (ASE). This paper extends current understanding of seed burial and seed bank formation by revealing the need to incorporate physical forces into seed burial mechanisms. We provide the first empirical evidence that physical forces influence seed burial by synergistically interacting with ecosystem engineers, thus highlighting the role of biophysical interactions as important drivers for vertical seed movement.

J	Jaganathan, GK; Liu, BL				Jaganathan, Ganesh K.; Liu, Bao-lin			Moving beyond seed storage in tackling plant loss: linking seed collection and re-introduction	PLANT SCIENCE TODAY												Globally, plants are becoming extinct at an unprecedented rate. Seed banking is considered as the most cost-effective technique to preserve many conservation concern species. From a practical standpoint, however, banking seeds is essentially just the first step in tackling plant loss, as the real-life challenge lies in how well these seeds when re-introduced become whole plants and maintain species count. In the current model, merely very few seed banks extend their efforts in re-introduction problems. Compelling evidence suggests that many re-introduction efforts are less than successful. Such axiom convicts seed banks must also participate in the 'post-storage' process and engage working with other ecologists, physiologists and re-introduction practitioners to devise a robust re-introduction practice and exchange information about the seed lot including collection site, maternal environment etc. Bridging these gaps would facilitate enhanced restoration practice and pave way for efficient reconstruction of the ecosystem.																	2348-1900						2016	3	2					68	71		10.14719/pst.2016.3.2.202							WOS:000452650500001

We hypothesized that seed longevity is the lowest for forest species (living in stable habitat), the highest for weeds, while species of xerothermic grasslands take an intermediate value. Ten species were selected from each of the three habitats with balanced representation of plant families among habitats. Seeds of the 30 species were deep buried at 65 cm depth, then replicates recovered after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 years, and germinated in an unheated greenhouse. Weeds expressed the highest germination rate (36.1% in average) exceeding forest (14.4%) and grassland species (10.2%) which did not differ significantly. The number of species with transient, short-term persistent and long-term persistent seed bank, respectively, was 1, 7 and 2 for grasslands; 1, 3 and 6 for forests; and 0, 1 and 9 for weeds. As expected, weeds possessed the highest seed longevity. Contrary to our assumption, low seed longevity was not the norm among forest understorey species, and seed longevity of xerothermic grassland species was not intermediate but the shortest one. Ecological background of differences between hypotheses and experimental results are discussed. First record on seed bank type is reported here for 12 species: Dianthus pontederae, Digitalis grandiflora, Ferula sadleriana, Hieracium sylvaticum, Inula ensifolia, Jurinea mollis, Lychnis coronaria, Saponaria officinalis, Scorzonera austriaca, Secale sylvestre, Stipa borysthenica, Verbascum lychnitis.

Diverse Rotations and Optimal Cultural Practices Control Wild Oat (Avena fatua)	WEED SCIENCE												In western Canada, more money is spent on wild oat herbicides than on any other weed species, and wild oat resistance to herbicides is the most widespread resistance issue. A direct-seeded field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2014 at eight Canadian sites to determine crop life cycle, crop species, crop seeding rate, crop usage, and herbicide rate combination effects on wild oat management and canola yield. Combining 26 seeding rates of early-cut barley silage with 26 seeding rates of winter cereals and excluding wild oat herbicides for 3 of 5 yr (2011 to 2013) often led to similar wild oat density, aboveground wild oat biomass, wild oat seed density in the soil, and canola yield as a repeated canola-wheat rotation under a full wild oat herbicide rate regime. Wild oat was similarly well managed after 3 yr of perennial alfalfa without wild oat herbicides. Forgoing wild oat herbicides in only 2 of 5 yr from exclusively summer annual crop rotations resulted in higher wild oat density, biomass, and seed banks. Management systems that effectively combine diverse and optimal cultural practices against weeds, and limit herbicide use, reduce selection pressure for weed resistance to herbicides and prolong the utility of threatened herbicide tools.

Seed Production and Control of Sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia) and Pitted Morningglory (Ipomoea lacunosa) with 2,4-D, Dicamba, and Glyphosate Combinations	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Sicklepod and pitted morningglory are two of the most important weed species in row-crop production in the southeastern United States. The upcoming introduction of soybean and cotton varieties resistant to 2,4-D and dicamba will increase the reliance on these auxinic herbicides. However, it is not clear how these herbicides will affect sicklepod and pitted morningglory control. Field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 in Jay, FL to determine whether 2,4-D (560 and 1,120 g ae ha(-1)), dicamba (420 and 840 g ae ha(-1)), and glyphosate (1,060 g ae ha(-1)) alone or in combination applied when weed shoots were 11 (early POST [EPOST]) and 22 (late POST [LPOST]) cm long effectively control and prevent seed production of sicklepod and pitted morningglory. LPOST provided more effective control of sicklepod than EPOST. This was attributed to emergence of sicklepod seedlings after the EPOST application. When glyphosate was tank mixed with 2,4-D or dicamba, sicklepod control was higher (78 to 89% and 87 to 98% in 2013 and 2014, respectively) than for single-herbicide treatments (45 to 77% and 38 to 80% in 2013 and 2014, respectively) 6 wk after treatment (WAT). Pitted morningglory control was not affected by application timing, and 2,4-D provided 91 to 100% 6 WAT, which was equivalent to treatments with tank mixtures containing glyphosate. Dicamba applied at 420 g ha(-1) had the lowest pitted morningglory control (44 to 70% and 82 to 86% in 2013 and 2014, respectively). Sicklepod and pitted morningglory plants that survived and recovered from herbicide treatments produced the same number of viable seeds as nontreated plants in most treatments. The results of the present study indicated that the use of 2,4-D and dicamba alone will not provide adequate extended control of sicklepod, and the use of tank mixtures that combine auxinic herbicides with glyphosate or other POST herbicides will be necessary to manage sicklepod adequately in 2,4-D- or dicamba-resistant soybean and cotton. Because sicklepod plants that survived a single herbicide application are capable of producing abundant viable seeds, integrated approaches that include PRE herbicides and sequential POST control options may be necessary to ensure weed seed bank reductions.

J	Huang, SB; Gruber, S; Claupein, W				Huang, Shoubing; Gruber, Sabine; Claupein, Wilhelm			Field history of imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape (Brassica napus) volunteers in following crops under six long-term tillage systems	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Volunteer oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L) exhibits weedy behavior in crops, and can contribute to gene flow or unwanted seed admixture, particularly if its variety is tolerant to specific herbicides and if the proportion of OSR in a crop rotation is high. The aim of this study was to monitor the fate of seeds of imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape (Clearfield (R); CL OSR) lost at harvest over the two years following its intentional sowing. A 5-yr experiment (2011-2015) with non-CL OSR and CL OSR in the same rotation was conducted on an existing long-term tillage experiment in south-west Germany to investigate OSR volunteer dynamics. The experiment included different modes of primary tillage (inversion tillage, non-inversion tillage, no-till, with or without additional stubble tillage prior to primary tillage). The crop sequence was non-CL OSR, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L), CL OSR (a medium and a high dormancy variety), winter wheat, and maize (Zea mays L.). High dormancy CL OSR resulted in a larger soil seed bank (147 vs. 58 seeds m(-2)), but in fewer volunteers (0.9 vs. 1.9 volunteers m(-2)) than the medium dormancy variety in the first year after CL OSR. Dormancy release likely resulted in different volunteer emergence rates of the two varieties. Immediate stubble tillage after CL OSR increased seed bank and volunteers by 0.93 and 12.7 times, respectively. Inversion tillage resulted in 30 times fewer volunteers in the first year after CL OSR, but in an equal volunteer number in the second year compared to non-inversion tillage. Slight segregation of imidazolinone-tolerant genes occurred in the offspring of CL OSR, likely leading to different CL herbicide-tolerance levels in volunteers though the number of these individuals was small. Sound strategies to control OSR volunteers should include (1) use of low dormancy varieties with low potential to establish a seed bank, (2) varieties with fast dormancy release to trigger more dormant seeds to germinate in a very short period, and (3) a period of time between harvest of OSR and first tillage operation to reduce the possibility of seeds entering soil seed bank.

Using the possibilities of some trap, catch and Brassicaceaen crops for controlling crenate broomrape a problem in lentil fields	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												Broomrapes are obligate root parasitic weeds and major constraint to many dicotyledon crops especially in Mediterranean agricultural lands. Due to the fact that no single control measure is able to control broomrapes in the field satisfactorily, integrated management is recommended in general. The use of of trap crops or catch crops is an important strategy for controlling the weeds; and allelopathic plants are also utilized for the control. Trap crops, also called false hosts, are plants which stimulate the germination of the parasite seed but cannot be infested and thus reduce the seed population in the soil. On the other hand, catch crops stimulate the germination of the parasite seeds at a high frequency and allow the development of the parasite. Seed bank of the broomrapes are decreased by destroying the catch crops before the seed creating period of broomrape begins (Sauerborn, 1991). Field trials were conducted using flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) as a trap plant; lentil (Lens culinaris L.) as a catch plant; members of the Brassicaceae species, such as cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.), Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera (DC.) Thell.), broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.), canola (Brassica napus L.) and turnip (Brassica rapa var. rapa L.) as allelopathic plant in the Adana province (Turkey) in 2007-2009. Flax was the most effective treatment by decreasing 52% and 71% in shoot number and 55% and 26% in dry weight of O. crenata in the first and second year, respectively. Broccoli of the Brassicaceae family, was found to reduce the number of O. crenata shoots by 48% and 39% in two years. Regarding the effect of Brassicaceae family on O. crenata, broccoli was found to reduce the number of O. crenata shoots by 39%. It is concluded that growing flax as a trap plant or lentil as a catch crop two months before the sowing of lentil as a crop is can be a main element of integrated broomrape managament, which cause to reduce the soil seed bank of crenata broomrape.																	1735-6814	1735-8043				JAN	2016	10	1					53	62									WOS:000365644600005

Land degradation assessment through an ecosystem services lens: Integrating knowledge and methods in pastoral semi-arid systems	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												This paper develops and applies an integrated and participatory methodological framework to assess land degradation in pastoral systems through an ecosystem services (ES) lens in a semi-arid region of northern Nicaragua. We initially integrated local and scientific knowledge to assess ecological changes and understand the links with ecosystem services supplied by the local grazing system. Hence, we discuss land degradation features and test a state-and-transition ecological model, that is, we developed jointly with local farmers the hypotheses to understand transitions between ecological states and these hypotheses were then evaluated through an inventory of vegetation and an assessment of soil properties and seed bank composition. The assessment reveals that shifts in ecological state do not cause permanent soil properties changes, but that at a landscape scale they can limit production, affecting local livelihoods. The framework proposed provided local farmers with relevant information and facilitated communication with researchers, enabling them to use the co-constructed knowledge to implement adaptive management strategies to improve local productive systems.

Strategy for assessing impacts in ephemeral tropical seagrasses	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We investigated the phenology and spatial patterns in Halophila decipiens by assessing biomass, reproduction and seed density in similar to 400 grab samples collected across nine sites (8 to 14 m water depth) between June 2011 and December 2012. Phenology correlated with light climate which is governed by the summer monsoon (wet period). During the wet period, sedimentary seed banks prevailed, varying spatially at both broad and fine scales, presenting a source of propagules for re-colonisation following the unfavourable growing conditions of the monsoon. Spatial patterns in H. decipiens biomass following monsoon conditions were highly variable within a landscape that largely comprised potential seagrass habitat. Management strategies for H. decipiens and similar transient species must recognise the high temporal and spatial variability of these populations and be underpinned by a framework that emphasises vulnerability assessments of different life stages instead of relying solely on thresholds for standing stock at fixed reference sites.

In degenerated grasslands of northwest China endophyte (Epichlo. gansuensis) infected Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass) is becoming widely distributed because of its toxicity to livestock. In this study, we investigated the ecological consequences of endophyte toxicity in this native grass, at three sites in northwest China, by comparing seed production of plant species and arthropod abundance in overgrazed grasslands with and without the presence of A. inebrians. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of endophyte infected A. inebrians reduces the loss of plant and arthropod biodiversity by providing a protected nursery free of animal grazing. Therefore, A. inebrians, typically regarded as an unwanted toxic invader by pastoralists, should be viewed as beneficial for grasslands as its presence maintains plant and arthropod biodiversity, and provides a foundation stone in the reconstruction and restoration of these grassland ecosystems.

J	Alignier, A; Baudry, J				Alignier, Audrey; Baudry, Jacques			Changes in management practices over time explain most variation in vegetation of field margins in Brittany, France	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Studies of the effects of modern agriculture on biodiversity have generally lacked a historical perspective. Field margins have considerable ecological significance in agriculture-dominated landscapes, but are affected by interaction with management practices in the margin and on adjoining land. This study investigated the time period over which changes in management practices best explains the occurrence of 40 plant species now commonly found in 311 field margins of Zone Atelier Armorique, Brittany, France. Five management practices were surveyed every year since 1995. Species occurrence was recorded in 2007, 2011 and 2013 and related by means of GLMMs to management practices over time, up to a maximum of 12 years, i.e., scores of field margins on the two first axes of correspondence analysis (CA) performed on management practices. Model selection using AIC criteria allowed us to identify the time period over which to consider management practices that best explain plant patterns. For one third of the common 40 plant species recorded, the time period over which to consider management practices was greater than one year. The rest of the species showed inconsistent patterns with high level of variability between 2007, 2011 and 2013. The time period tended to be longer for species with vegetative reproduction and for zoochorous species. Our results show that the long-term simultaneous monitoring of both vegetation and management practices is important to understand some ecological patterns that would be missed either in short-term studies or for studies that exclude management information. Our findings contribute to long-term strategies for management and conservation of field margins diversity by highlighting that different plant groups require management on particular timescales.

Wild boar rooting intensity determines shifts in understorey composition and functional traits	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												In recent decades, the European populations of wild boar have grown substantially, as has the impact of this species, owing above all to its rooting activity. Our aim was to investigate the relationships between vascular plant understorey and wild boar rooting intensity. The questions we addressed are: does rooting intensity influence understorey species composition and diversity? Which functional traits are associated with different levels of rooting? We performed a comparative analysis of plant communities in areas with contrasting levels of rooting intensity within a Mediterranean deciduous lowland forest in central Italy. Besides comparing species composition and diversity, we tested the association between species traits and rooting levels through fourth-corner analysis. We found that contrasting levels of rooting were associated to different understorey species composition and evenness, while we observed no significant difference in species richness. In contrast with our expectations, sites with lower rooting returned i) lower evenness values and ii) a higher proportion of species characterized by traits related to resistance or response to herbivory, i.e., spinescence, clonality, endozoochory, underground storage organs, and low height values. Our findings suggest that current vegetation patterns partly depend on the legacy effect of past rooting disturbance, since the areas currently subjected to low rooting intensity were likely to be intensely rooted in the past. These areas may have developed a marked dominance of clonal thorny species that, in turn, inhibited further feeding activities by wild boar.

The aim was to compare quantitatively the Chignahuapan seed bank using two methods and infer whether plant communities could be rehabilitated from it. In the seasonally flooded areas of the marsh we collected samples of the top 10 cm of sediment to evaluate the seed bank by the methods of separation and of germination. The tested methods differ in species composition and in its abundance. Separation method predicted higher richness, diversity and density. Germination method showed a higher similarity to the established vegetation and predicted which species emerge more easily from the bank. The low similarity and the lack of relationship between species of both methods show that each technique has a different predictive power, thus its isolated application should be avoided. Chignahuapan seed bank includes 60 species and is characterized by the presence of plants with high ecological tolerance, low similarity with established vegetation and the absence of strict aquatic plants previously registered as typical elements in the region. This seed bank can be used in future restoration programs of the marsh, with the limitation to restore plant species of early succession stages.

A bioclimate model predicting the presence or absence of P. leiophylla (lumped with its putative variety P. leiophylla var. chihuahuana) was developed by using the Random Forests classification tree on Mexican and Unites States of America forest inventory data. The bioclimatic model had an average error of prediction of 4.6 %. The model used six predictor variables, dominated by precipitation variables. Projecting the 1961-1990 climate niche into future climates provided by three general circulation models and two greenhouse-effect gas emission scenarios, suggested that the area occupied by the niche should diminish rapidly over the course of the century: a decrease of 35 % by the decade surrounding 2030, 50 % for 2060, and 76 % for 2090. The most serious habitat reduction occurs at both latitudinal extremes of the species distribution: Chiricagua Mountains, Arizona, Unites States of America in the northern extreme, and at Oaxaca State, Mexico, in the southernmost extreme. There is no indication at all of expansion of suitable climatic habitat northwards. We urge establishing seed banks encompassing seed from provenances sampled from the largest part possible of the natural distribution, and start assisted migration tests, to realign the natural populations with the climate for which they are adapted and that will occur at higher altitudes.																	2007-4298	2007-4476				DEC	2015	93	4					709	718									WOS:000369046900003						
J	Yoshihara, Y; Koyama, A; Undarmaa, J; Okuro, T				Yoshihara, Yu; Koyama, Asuka; Undarmaa, Jamsran; Okuro, Toshiya			Prescribed burning experiments for restoration of degraded semiarid Mongolian steppe	PLANT ECOLOGY												Prescribed burning has been a successful ecosystem restoration tool worldwide. In this study, we burned two different degraded Mongolian grasslands in spring: sparsely vegetated Argalant (ARG) and Hustai National Park (HNP), dominated by the unpalatable forb Artemisia adamsii. We investigated soil properties, seed bank, seedling density, vegetation, biomass, and forage quality before and/or after burning in the grasslands. Burning weakly affected soil properties and significantly reduced seed bank density. Seedling density of Chenopodium aristatum was greater and that of Cleistogenes squarrosa was lower in burned than in unburned plots of HNP, although C. squarrosa showed greater vegetative growth in burned plots. The floristic composition showed small changes after burning, depending on the pre-burning vegetation, but cover of A. adamsii decreased after burning in both ARG and HNP. Thus, the reduced seed bank density by burning led to weak responses of vegetation composition to burning due to strong vegetative growth. However, burning suppressed the unpalatable forb (A. adamsii) and hastened palatable grass (C. squarrosa) productivity, which would be attractive for livestock production, especially for overgrazed areas with low forage palatability. Our findings illustrate the possibility of using spring prescribed burning as a restoration tool in degraded Mongolian steppe, as well as the importance of site-specific conditions for understanding postfire recovery.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				DEC	2015	216	12					1649	1658		10.1007/s11258-015-0548-7							WOS:000368419800006

Mycelial growth rate and toxin production in the seed pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda: resource trade-offs and temporally varying selection	PLANT PATHOLOGY												Pyrenophora semeniperda, an important pathogen in Bromus tectorum seed banks in semi-arid western North America, exhibits >4-fold variation in mycelial growth rate. Host seeds exhibit seasonal changes in dormancy that affect the risk of pathogen-caused mortality. The hypothesis tested is that contrasting seed dormancy phenotypes select for contrasting strategies for increasing pathogen fitness, and that increased fitness on nondormant seeds involves a resource trade-off between toxin production and growth. The strategy for successfully attacking rapidly germinating nondormant seeds at high inoculum loads in autumn involves increased post-infection aggressiveness to prevent seed escape through germination. An earlier study demonstrated that slow-growing strains caused higher mortality than faster-growing strains on nondormant host seeds at high inoculum loads. In this study, production of the toxin cytochalasin B was significantly higher in slower-growing strains, and was induced only in seeds or in seed-constituent-containing media. Its production was reduced in vivo by Bromus tectorum seeds, suggesting direct involvement in pathogenesis on seeds. Fast-growing strains caused significantly higher mortality than slow-growing strains at low inoculum loads on dormant seeds, which apparently have resistance that is overcome at high loads or through rapid mycelial proliferation. In a co-inoculation study, the fast-growing isolate produced 3 9 more stromata than the slow-growing isolate on dormant seeds, whereas the slow-growing isolate was twice as successful on nondormant seeds. These results provide evidence that mycelial growth rate variation and associated variation in cytochalasin B production represent a trade-off maintained through temporally varying selection resulting from seasonal variation in host seed dormancy status.

Patterns of loss of biodiversity associated with invasion by Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp monilifera (boneseed) across a large geographic region	WEED RESEARCH												To investigate the impact of invasion by Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera (boneseed) on plant communities, sites that were invaded and uninvaded were surveyed across Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria, Australia. Above-ground cover abundance was estimated and samples of the seed bank from invaded and uninvaded sites in each state were collected and germinated in the glasshouse. We compared species richness and composition between invaded and uninvaded sites for both above-ground and below-ground samples. Across this broad geographic area, C. monilifera invaded sites had 25% fewer species than uninvaded sites and twice as many exotic species. Most growth forms showed reduced richness in invaded sites. There were no differences in the composition of native species communities between invaded and uninvaded sites in most regions, except South Australia. The composition of the seed bank differed from the above-ground vegetation, but was similar within each state. Herbs and grasses were most abundant. The species composition of the seed bank was different in invaded sites only in Victoria, suggesting that invasion may negatively influence the capacity of the seed bank to restore vegetation in some areas. However, the underlying mechanisms for the observed patterns were not tested in this study. The capacity of all sites to regenerate effectively from the seed bank was limited and, in order to ensure the conservation of biodiversity into the future, monitoring of species richness at smaller scales, particularly those where management of C. monilifera has occurred, will be needed to ensure management can facilitate the establishment of missing species. This study suggests that C. monilifera impacts a range of functional groups and different species across its distribution and is therefore non-selective in how it influences changes in communities.

J	Elsey-Quirk, T; Leck, MA				Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Leck, Mary Allessio			Patterns of seed bank and vegetation diversity along a tidal freshwater river	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Species richness and diversity may increase with spatial scale related to increased area and heterogeneity of habitat. Yet, in bidirectional hydrologically connected tidal ecosystems, secondary dispersal via hydrochory has the potential to homogenize seed banks, and both life history characteristics and tolerances to environmental conditions influence the composition of plant communities. How species richness, diversity, and composition of seed banks and vegetation change along environmental gradients and at different spatial scales is not well understood. METHODS: We explored the relationships of seed bank and vegetation diversity across 135 plots along a tidal freshwater river in the Delaware Estuary, USA. Species richness and diversity were partitioned across three hierarchical spatial scales: individual plots, transects perpendicular to the tidal channel, and river kilometers. Community structure was also examined as it related to distance from the tidal channel and location along the tidal river. KEY RESULTS: Species richness was 89 in the seed bank and 54 in the vegetation. Species-area relationships revealed that species richness reached a near maximum asymptote inland (20 m from channel) for the seed bank and at the edge (0 m) for the vegetation. Rare occurrences of species in the seed bank and vegetation were greatest 5 m from the channel edge. As spatial scale increased, seed bank richness increased, associated with the progressive accumulation of species. Seed bank diversity, however, was maximized within small plot areas and along the river. Diversity of the vegetation was maximized locally due to the abundance of a few common species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that suites of common species contributed to high localized vegetation diversity, yet large spatial scales maximized the number and diversity of species in the seed bank and vegetation through rare encounters, as well as the complexity of the landscape.

Longevity of seeds and soil seed bank of the Cerrado tree Miconia chartacea (Melastomataceae)	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Miconia chartacea is a widely distributed tree in Brazil, occurring at altitudes ranging from 300m to 1900m in the Caatinga, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. In this work we attempted to classify M. chartacea seeds regarding their behaviour during storage and their germination syndrome and to determine, from a storage test in Cerrado soil and laboratory conditions in situ and ex situ, the longevity of seeds, as well as the capacity of the species to form a soil seed bank. The results suggested that M. chartacea seeds form a transient soil seed bank in the Cerrado and can be classified as orthodox in terms of storage behaviour, although the seeds are dispersed with a relatively high water content. The life span of seeds was favoured in soil-stored seeds in comparison with dry storage at 25 degrees C, whereas storage at low temperatures prevented a decrease of the seed's germinability with storage time (330d). M. chartacea seeds are dispersed during the dry season and germinate during the next rainy season, which can be classified as an intermediate-dry germination syndrome. Seeds of this species are dispersed in the Cerrado when temperatures and soil moisture are relatively low, which favours the formation of a soil seed bank, considering that the seeds tolerate desiccation and their longevity is favoured by low temperatures. A transient seed bank type is favoured by the loss of viability in storage at warm temperatures linked to the rainy season, and the predictable seasonal variations in climate in the region, with germination being restricted to the beginning of the rainy season.

AMBIO												Winter-flooding of ricefields provides foraging habitat to waterfowl, which in return may bring agronomic benefits to farmers. Our study experimentally tested the effect of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) on the standing stalks and weed seed bank in the Camargue (France), both of which present major challenges for farmers. Three duck densities were tested: (D1) 5 ducks ha(-1) (historical nocturnal density), (D2) 23 ducks ha(-1) (present nocturnal density), and (D3) 300 ducks ha(-1) (Asian rice-duck farming density). The ducks reduced the stalks significantly: -27 % (D1), -52 % (D2), and -91 % (D3). Conversely, they decreased the number of seeds by only 3 % (D3) and the seed mass by about 21 % (D1 and D3), which was not significant. Besides they had no effect on seed species richness. This study clearly demonstrates that the winter-flooding effect on straw decomposition can be enhanced by waterfowl foraging, hence showing an agronomic benefit from ducks to farmers. However, there was no clear effect in terms of seed bank reduction.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2015	44	8					793	802		10.1007/s13280-015-0678-0							WOS:000365268600008	26121948

It is in the Indo-Burma hotspot and contains 16% of China's vascular flora in <0.2% of the country's total area (19,690 km(2)). Rapid expansion of monoculture crops in the last 20 years, particularly rubber, threatens this region's exceptional biodiversity. To understand the effects of land-use change and collection on orchid species diversity and determine protection priorities, we conducted systematic field surveys, observed markets, interviewed orchid collectors, and then determined the conservation status of all orchids. We identified 426 orchid species in 115 genera in Xishuangbanna: 31% of all orchid species that occur in China. Species richness was highest at 1000-1200 m elevation. Three orchid species were assessed as possibly extinct in the wild, 15 as critically endangered, 82 as endangered, 124 as vulnerable, 186 as least concern, and 16 as data deficient. Declines over 20 years in harvested species suggested over-collection was the major threat, and utility value (i.e., medicinal or ornamental value) was significantly related to endangerment. Expansion of rubber tree plantations was less of a threat to orchids than to other taxa because only 75 orchid species (17.6%) occurred below the 1000-m-elevation ceiling for rubber cultivation, and most of these (46) occurred in nature reserves. However, climate change is projected to lift this ceiling to around 1300 m by 2050, and the limited area at higher elevations reduces the potential for upslope range expansion. The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden is committed to achieving zero plant extinctions in Xishuangbanna, and orchids are a high priority. Appropriate in and ex situ conservation strategies, including new protected areas and seed banking, have been developed for every threatened orchid species and are being implemented.

FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												The highly specialized flora of localities affected by former metal ore mining and metallurgy is endangered by succession or intentional afforestation all over Europe. Its last remnants therefore deserve our attention. We examined whether Scots pine encroaching on a heavy-metal grassland (Olkusz Zn-Pb mining area, S Poland) is outcompeting specialized herbaceous species, as has been observed elsewhere. Plant species composition and richness sampled at 124 plots were analysed in relation to pine stand parameters (canopy cover, stand age, stand basal area), abiotic environmental factors (e.g. soil properties) and spatial variables (e.g. plot coordinates). Plots were divided into three shading categories and compared in terms of vegetation and habitat parameters. Scots pine outcompeted several light-demanding species, leading to a decrease of total species richness and cover. Characteristic species of this grassland (Biscutella laevigata, Silene vulgaris) and some metal-tolerant plants were clearly insensitive to shading. For these early successional species, more important was the availability of microsites with shallow skeletal soil or bare subsoil. Tree stand parameters differently affected grassland vegetation: canopy cover caused primarily a compositional shift in the community, while stand age was the principal agent of decline in species richness. Scots pine increased the soil concentrations of available Ca and Mg, and negatively affected soil development (organic matter and mineral particle accumulation), which might be beneficial to some shade-tolerant grassland species. Maintaining the studied grassland's present species richness and composition would require cutting woody plants less frequently than recommended for dry grasslands of non-metalliferous sites, and disturbing the soil surface.				; Szarek-Lukaszewska, Grazyna/U-9840-2018	Kapusta, Pawel/0000-0002-9126-5068; Szarek-Lukaszewska, Grazyna/0000-0003-3170-8522; Jedrzejczyk-Korycinska, Monika/0000-0001-8189-6707												1211-9520	1874-9348				DEC	2015	50	4					317	329		10.1007/s12224-015-9232-x							WOS:000367517300003

Fire effects on capsules and encapsulated seeds from Eucalyptus globulus in Portugal	PLANT ECOLOGY												Eucalyptus globulus is native to Australia and currently one of the most cultivated hardwood species worldwide. The adaptation of E. globulus to fire-prone habitats has been linked to fire as a driver for regeneration and subsequent naturalization in Mediterranean-type regions. We studied the effect of fire on capsules and encapsulated seeds of E. globulus Labill. in the canopy and on the ground, aiming to assess the role of fire in plant recruitment in Portugal. Seed shed and capsule abscission through time were compared between scorched and non-scorched branches of living trees. Additionally, we assessed the number of capsules on the ground and the viability of encapsulated seeds in burned and unburned areas of E. globulus plantations. A complementary experiment comparing the viability of seeds from different positions in the capsule (surface vs. inner) was also carried out. Our study suggests that fire promotes the dehiscence of viable seeds from capsules in the canopy, whereas it has a destructive effect on ground capsules and seeds. We obtained an average germination of 43 % in encapsulated seeds from unburned areas, suggesting that these seeds may represent a potential propagule source for plant recruitment. This study provides experimental confirmation of the reported role of fire on seedling recruitment in E. globulus and provides new insights into the potential role of ground capsules in this process.

Impact of Ligustrum lucidum on the soil seed bank in invaded subtropical seasonally dry woodlands (Cordoba, Argentina)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The impact of invasive species on below ground flora may differ from that on the above ground vegetation. Recent reviews of invaded and native communities emphasize the need for more comprehensive information on the impacts of plant invasion on soil seed banks. Ligustrum lucidum is one of the most important invasive woody species in several ecosystems of Argentina; however, its impact on soil seed bank communities has not been studied. Here we analyzed differences in species richness, total seed density and species composition (total, native and exotic species) in the soil seed bank of native and invaded woodlands, in two different seasons. We also analyzed differences in similarity between standing vegetation and soil seed banks of both woodland types. The study was carried out in the Chaco Serrano woodlands of Crdoba, central Argentina. Our main results indicate differences in L. lucidum woodland composition and a reduction in both richness and total density of species in the soil seed bank compared to the native woodlands, independently of the sampling season. Moreover, a higher abundance of certain exotic species in the soil seed bank was observed in L. lucidum woodlands, particularly in spring. Finally, low similarity between soil seed bank and the established vegetation was observed in both woodland types. From a management perspective, it seems that passive restoration from soil seed banks of L. lucidum might be coupled with active addition of some native woody species and control of other exotic species.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				DEC	2015	17	12					3547	3561		10.1007/s10530-015-0977-1							WOS:000363482600016

In riparian systems, propagule dispersal and disturbance are constrained by longitudinal and lateral water flows, but riparian forests in temperate human-dominated landscapes have received little attention so far. We investigated how the longitudinal position along the river course and the lateral position to the riverbed structure forest plant communities subjected to flooding. We studied vegetation, soil seed bank, hydrochorous seed rain and environmental conditions along 23 transects perpendicular to the river in two forest floodplains in the North of France. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess the relative importance of longitudinal distance, relative elevation, and their interaction on both species richness in a given compartment and species turnover between compartments. Relative elevation to the riverbed was the main factor explaining species richness of vegetation and water seed deposit, but not of the seed bank. Vegetation was the most species-rich at low elevations, where the number of water-dispersed seeds and related species richness were maximal. The longitudinal position within the riparian forest had no effect on vegetation and seed bank richness. Dissimilarity between the seed bank and the seed rain increased with relative elevation. Lateral much more than longitudinal movements of water create a strong gradient in seed rain intensity that structures plant communities. Flooding is important to species dispersal, hence to the conservation of species-rich plant communities within human-pressured landscapes.

J	Crawford, M; Davies, S; Griffith, A				Crawford, Michael; Davies, Stephen; Griffith, Alan			Predicting metapopulation responses of a tidal wetland annual to environmental stochasticity and water dispersal through an individual-based model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Freshwater tidal wetlands are a complex environment for annual plants. Seedling establishment and survival may be limited by a variety of factors, including competition with perennials and the twice-daily inundation of seeds and seedlings. Hence such species are often endemic and rare. Their observed population dynamics can be extraordinary, with individuals reappearing in certain patches where they had been absent for several seasons, and with total populations varying by orders of magnitude between years. Many interacting influences are thought to be at play here, including seed banks and water-based seed dispersal (hydrochory). So far it is not known (1) to what degree environmental stochasticity is likely to affect the population's survival in its natural habitat, (2) what role hydrochory plays in propagating and maintaining the species, and (3) how these two factors interact with one another. We therefore took the annual Aeschynomene virginica (Sensitive joint-vetch, SJV) as an example and developed an individual-based model in a geographically precise replica of its Halts Creek, Virginia, habitat. The model represents SJV's life cycle and is calibrated to data from a variety of empirical studies on the plant. Vital rates are partly calibrated from aerial imagery providing estimates of the biomass of specific patches. Simulated seeds enter the river network based on their proximity to the water's edge, and then travel upstream and downstream according to estimated flow rates, float times, and implantation probabilities. Additionally, random seasonal environmental conditions are imposed, depressing or inflating vital rates within prescribed ranges. We found that as environmental stochasticity increased to more than relatively modest levels, the long-term survival probability of the species precipitously declined. Hydrochory, though it may have played an important role in the past in allowing SJV to reach the regions in which it now thrives, had little impact on the plant's long-term likelihood of survival for our study population. Nevertheless, the model's performance indicates the existence of additional key factors at play in SJV's metapopulation dynamics that were not considered or quantified so far. These may include the varying elevation of habitat patches and the corresponding variability in submersion time, which should be taken into account in future modeling of annuals in freshwater tidal wetlands. We conclude that population models which include detailed representations of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of environmental drivers can deliver important general insights even if they must be tied to specific study sites.

A synthesis of postfire recovery traits of woody plants in Australian ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Postfire resprouting and recruitment from seed are key plant life-history traits that influence population dynamics, community composition and ecosystem function. Species can have one or both of these mechanisms. They confer resilience, which may determine community composition through differential species persistence after fire. To predict ecosystem level responses to changes in climate and fire conditions, we examined the proportions of these plant fire-adaptive traits among woody growth forms of 2880 taxa, in eight fire-prone ecosystems comprising similar to 87% of Australia's land area. Shrubs comprised 64% of the taxa. More tree (>84%) than shrub (similar to 50%) taxa resprouted. Basal, epicormic and apical resprouting occurred in 71%, 22% and 3% of the taxa, respectively. Most rainforest taxa (91%) were basal resprouters. Many trees (59%) in frequently-burnt eucalypt forest and savanna resprouted epicormically. Although crown fire killed many mallee (62%) and heathland (48%) taxa, fire-cued seeding was common in these systems. Postfire seeding was uncommon in rainforest and in arid Acacia communities that burnt infrequently at low intensity. Resprouting was positively associated with ecosystem productivity, but resprouting type (e.g. basal or epicormic) was associated with local scale fire activity, especially fire frequency. Although rainforest trees can resprout they cannot recruit after intense fires and may decline under future fires. Semi-arid Acacia communities would be susceptible to increasing fire frequencies because they contain few postfire seeders. Ecosystems dominated by obligate seeders (mallee, heath) are also susceptible because predicted shorter inter-fire intervals will prevent seed bank accumulation. Savanna may be resilient to future fires because of the adaptive advantage of epicormic resprouting among the eucalypts. The substantial non-resprouting shrub component of shrublands may decline, but resilient Eucalyptus spp. will continue to dominate under future fire regimes. These patterns of resprouting and postfire seeding provide new insights to ecosystem assembly, resilience and vulnerability to changing fire regimes on this fire-prone continent.

(Egyptian broom-rape) causes serious damage to agricultural production and threatens economic development, which has raised widespread concern. The present study was conducted to determine whether lilies have the potential to be used as 'trap crops' for controlling O. aegyptiaca Persoon. In the experiments, the ability of three popular lily cultivars (Lilium Oriental hybrids 'Sorbonne', Lilium LA (Longiflorum hybrids x Asiatic hybrids) hybrids 'Ceb Dazzle', and Lilium Longiflorum hybrids (L. formosanum x L. longiflorum) 'L. formolongo') to induce O. aegyptiaca Persoon. seed germination was assessed. Parts of the three lily cultivars, including the rhizosphere soil and underground and above-ground organs, all induced "suicidal germination" of parasitic O. aegyptiaca Persoon. seed at four growth stages. Specifically, Sorbonne and Ceb Dazzle behaved with similar allelopathy, and the bulb, scale leaf and aerial stem exhibited stronger allelopathic effects on O. aegyptiaca Pers. germination compared to other organs. Aqueous L. formolongo leaf extracts may contain more stable, effective stimulants given that they induced the highest germination rate at 76.7% even though the extracts were serially diluted. We speculate that these organs may be advantageous in further isolating and purifying economical active substances that can be substitutes for GR24. These results indicate that lilies have the potential to be used as a trap crops or can be processed into green herbicide formulations that can be applied in agriculture production to rapidly deplete the seed bank of O. aegyptiaca Persoon. parasitic weeds in soil.																	1932-6203					NOV 13	2015	10	11							e0142811	10.1371/journal.pone.0142811							WOS:000367628500056	26565398

Traits of Heracleum sosnowskyi Plants in Monostand on Invaded Area	PLOS ONE												The ability of giant hogweeds to form monodominant communities and even pure monostands in invaded areas has been well documented. Understanding of the mechanisms leading to monostand formation can aid in determining the limitations of existing community ecology models and establishing an effective management plan for invasive species elimination. The aim of this observational study was to investigate traits of Heracleum sosnowskyi plants (demography, canopy structure, morphology and physiology) of the plants in a pure stand in an invaded area useful for understanding potential monostand formation mechanisms. All measurements were performed in one typical Heracleum sosnowskyi monostand located in an abandoned agriculture field located in Syktyvkar city suburb (North-east Russia). This monostand consisted of five main plant growth stages: seed, seedling, juvenile, vegetative adult, and generative adult. Plants of all stages began to grow simultaneously shortly after the snowmelt, at the same time as spring ephemeral plant species grew. The density of generative plants did not change during the vegetation period, but the density of the other plant stages rapidly decreased after the formation of a tall (up to 2-2.5 m) and dense (Leaf area index up to 6.5) canopy. The canopy captured approximately 97% of the light. H. sosnowskyi showed high (several orders of magnitude higher than average taiga zone grasses) photosynthetic water use efficiency (6-7 mu M CO2/mu M H2O). Formation of H. sosnowskyi monostands occurs primarily in disturbed areas with relatively rich and well-moistened soils. Early commencement of growth, rapid formation of a dense canopy, high efficiency of light and water use during photosynthesis, ability of young plants to survive in low light conditions, rapid recovery of above-ground plant parts after damage, and the high density of the soil seed bank are the most important traits of H. sosnowskyi plants for monostand formation in invaded areas.

However, accumulating evidence has revealed the presence of live microbes in crude oil. Therefore, it's of value to conduct an in-depth investigation on microbial communities in crude oil. To this end, microorganisms in oil and water phases were collected from four oil-well production mixtures in Qinghai Oilfield, China, and analyzed for their taxonomic and functional compositions via pyrosequencing and GeoChip, respectively. Hierarchical clustering of 16S rRNA gene sequences and functional genes clearly separated crude oil and water phases, suggestive of distinct taxonomic and functional gene compositions between crude oil and water phases. Unexpectedly, Pseudomonas dominated oil phase where diverse functional gene groups were identified, which significantly differed from those in the corresponding water phases. Meanwhile, most functional genes were significantly more abundant in oil phase, which was consistent with their important roles in facilitating survival of their host organisms in crude oil. These findings provide strong evidence that crude oil could be a "seed bank" of functional microorganisms with rich functional potentials. This offers novel insights for industrial applications of microbial-enhanced oil recovery and bioremediation of petroleum-polluted environments.

Community and species-specific responses to simulated global change in two subarctic-alpine plant communities	ECOSPHERE												Long-term observational studies have detected greening and shrub encroachment in the subarctic attributed to current climate change, while global change simulations have showed that community composition and productivity may shift drastically in arctic, subarctic, and alpine tundra plant communities in the future. However, responses to global change can be highly species-and context-dependent. We examined community-level and species-specific responses to a six-year factorial temperature and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) amendment experiment in two alpine plant communities in northern Sweden: a species-poor dwarf shrub heath, and a more species-rich meadow. We hypothesized that abundance responses to global change would be variable within commonly defined vascular plant functional groups (e.g., forbs, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs) and that new species would appear in experimental plots over time due to the ameliorated growing conditions. We found that within most functional groups, species were highly individualistic with respect to the global change simulation, particularly within the forbs, whereas within the shrubs, responses were neutral to negative and widely variable in magnitude. In the heath community the response of the graminoid functional group was driven almost entirely by the grass Calamagrostis lapponica, which increased in abundance by an order of magnitude in the combined temperature and nutrient treatment. Furthermore, community context was important for species' responses to the simulations. Abundance of the pan-arctic species Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis-idaea responded primarily to the temperature treatment in the meadow community whereas the nutrient treatment had stronger effects in the heath community. Over six growing seasons, more new species appeared in the experimental plots than in control plots in the meadow community, whereas in the heath community only one new species appeared. Our results from two closely situated but different plant communities show that functional groups do not predict individual species responses to simulated global change, and that these responses depend to a large extent on pre-existing physical conditions as well as biotic interactions such as competition and facilitation. It may be difficult to apply general trends of global change responses to specific local communities.

Disentangling legacy effects from environmental filters of postfire assembly of boreal tree assemblages	ECOLOGY												Disturbance plays a key role in driving ecological responses by creating opportunities for new ecological communities to assemble and by directly influencing the outcomes of assembly. Legacy effects (such as seed banks) and environmental filters can both influence community assembly, but their effects are impossible to separate with observational data. Here, we used seeding experiments in sites covering a broad range of postdisturbance conditions to tease apart the effects of seed availability, environmental factors, and disturbance characteristics on early community assembly after fire. We added seed of four common boreal trees to experimental plots in 55 replicate sites in recently burned areas of black spruce forest in northwestern North America. Seed addition treatments increased the probability of occurrence for all species, indicating a widespread potential for seed limitation to affect patterns of recruitment after fire. Small-seeded species (aspen and birch) were most sensitive to environmental factors such as soil moisture and organic layer depth, suggesting a role for niche-based environmental filtering in community assembly. Fire characteristics related to severity and frequency were also important drivers of seedling regeneration, indicating the potential for disturbance to mediate environmental filters and legacy effects on seed availability. Because effects of seed availability are typically impossible to disentangle from environmental constraints on recruitment in observational studies, legacy effects contingent on vegetation history may be misinterpreted as being driven by strong environmental filters. Results from the seeding experiments suggest that vegetation legacies affecting seed availability play a pivotal role in shaping patterns of community assembly after fire in these low-diversity boreal forests.

J	Livermore, JA; Jones, SE				Livermore, Joshua A.; Jones, Stuart E.			Local-global overlap in diversity informs mechanisms of bacterial biogeography	ISME JOURNAL												Spatial variation in environmental conditions and barriers to organism movement are thought to be important factors for generating endemic species, thus enhancing global diversity. Recent microbial ecology research suggested that the entire diversity of bacteria in the global oceans could be recovered at a single site, thus inferring a lack of bacterial endemism. We argue this is not the case in the global ocean, but might be in other bacterial ecosystems with higher dispersal rates and lower global diversity, like the human gut. We quantified the degree to which local and global bacterial diversity overlap in a diverse set of ecosystems. Upon comparison of observed local-global diversity overlap with predictions from a neutral biogeography model, human-associated microbiomes (gut, skin, mouth) behaved much closer to neutral expectations whereas soil, lake and marine communities deviated strongly from the neutral expectations. This is likely a result of differences in dispersal rate among 'patches', global diversity of these systems, and local densities of bacterial cells. It appears that overlap of local and global bacterial diversity is surprisingly large (but likely not one-hundred percent), and most importantly this overlap appears to be predictable based upon traditional biogeographic parameters like community size, global diversity, inter-patch environmental heterogeneity and patch connectivity.																	1751-7362	1751-7370				NOV	2015	9	11					2413	2422		10.1038/ismej.2015.51							WOS:000365091700008	25848869					
J	Laube, J; Sparks, TH; Bassler, C; Menzel, A				Laube, Julia; Sparks, Tim H.; Baessler, Claus; Menzel, Annette			Small differences in seasonal and thermal niches influence elevational limits of native and invasive Balsams	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Recent studies suggest that invasive plant species have colonised mountains to previously unobserved elevations, possibly due to ongoing climate change. Thus, they might pose new threats to high-elevation ecosystems, which are often of high conservation value. Current range predictions are primarily based on climate niche models, however many other factors might also contribute to the species' distribution. We studied the species-specific elevational limits of one native (Impatiens noli-tangere) and two invasive balsams (Impatiens glandulifera and Impatiens parviflora) on a mid-mountain range in Germany. We used a combination of trait measurements and a field experiment to assess the relative importance of temperature, trait adaptations, and biotic interactions on elevational limits. Results indicate that concurrent seedling emergence, low frost resistance and, for I. glandulifera, late flowering, are important contributors to elevational limits. Because of a lack of seed bank persistence, erratic spring and autumn frost events coinciding with the plants' annual life-cycles will likely influence the upper limits of the invasive species. The abundance of the species seems to be further limited by herbivory, mainly by molluscs. Given that a highly nuanced interaction between phenological development and erratic frost events are important for range limits, predictions based solely on mean climatic values, such.as temperature, are unlikely to accurately predict future invasion limits. Our results indicate that occasional occurrences of the species do not necessarily calHor eradication actions, that management efforts might be most effective at intermediate elevations, and that any measure encouraging terrestrial molluscs will help to maintain biotic resistance.

J	Nurse, RE; Darbyshire, SJ; Simard, MJ				Nurse, Robert E.; Darbyshire, Stephen J.; Simard, Marie-Josee			Impact of post-anthesis glyphosate on woolly cupgrass seed production, seed weight and seed viability	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Herbicides are generally applied at early stages of crop and weed growth to protect crop yield. Few studies have evaluated the effect of late (post-anthesis) applications of glyphosate as a management option to limit the seed production of weed escapes, such as woolly cupgrass (Eriochloa villosa). We propagated woolly cupgrass under greenhouse conditions and then applied three glyphosate treatments post-anthesis including: (1) an untreated control; (2) 900 g a.e. ha(-1); and (3) 1800 g a.e. ha(-1). Terminal inflorescences were collected 21 d after glyphosate application, and seed production, seed weight and embryo viability were assessed. Post-anthesis glyphosate applications did not influence seed production, but reduced seed weight and viability by 50 and 96%, respectively. Therefore, glyphosate applied just before the woolly cupgrass inflorescence begins to emerge from the leaf sheath (as late as the R1 stage in soybeans) is an effective strategy to manage woolly cupgrass reproduction and stop viable seeds from entering the soil seed bank or other dispersal pathways.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				NOV	2015	95	6					1193	1197		10.4141/CJPS-2015-166							WOS:000364153900013						
J	He, MX; Li, HY; Mo, XQ				He, Meng-xuan; Li, Hong-yuan; Mo, Xun-qiang			Optimization of application parameters of soil seed bank in vegetation recovery via response surface methodology	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Studies using the Box-Behnken central composite design (BBC) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) were conducted for the purpose of maximizing community indexes of soil seed banks (SSBs). 3(3) factorial designs were based on three independent variables: thickness of surface soil, covering thickness and the number of added tree seeds. Two comprehensive indexes with the name Component 1 and Component 2 (Cl and C2) abstracted by principal component analysis (PCA) from seven community indexes were used as two response values. The quadratic model was selected when the response value was CI, while the 2F1 model was more suitable when the response value was C2. ANOVA results showed that both models were significant, expressing ideal relationships between all independent and dependent variables. The optimum conditions of Cl and C2 were determined with the thickness of the surface soil of 4.17 cm and 4.75 cm respectively with a covering thickness of 2.37 cm and 1 cm, and the number of added tree seeds of 275 seeds/m(2) and 151 seeds/m(2) respectively. For the quadratic model, there were interactive effects between A and B and A and C. Of the three dependent variables, thickness of surface soil was the most important, having the most important influence on SSBs. The effect of the number of added tree seeds was more significant for Cl compared to C2, while the effects of the covering thickness on both Cl and C2 were less marked. The optimal schemes of SSBs can provide guidance for vegetation recovery when using a SSB, but a more practical experiment should be carried out for more exact results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the phytosociological patterns of FRP in a biodiverse monsoon-tropical region, to establish the influence of hydro-geological drivers on vegetation patterns in rock pool plant communities. Location: Gardner Plateau, central North Kimberley, Western Australia (centre of the study area: 14 degrees 47'046 '' S, 126 degrees 31'027 '' E). Methods: A total of 1066 phytosociological releves (microplots), as well as measurements of physical habitat characteristics, were collected from 580 rock pools. Communities were classified using clustering and table sorting. The hydrological regime of each rock pool was dynamically modelled, and the most significant predicative hydro-geological factors were determined for each species and vegetation community using canonical correlation analysis, classification and regression trees and random forests. Results: Variation in maximum rock pool depth, hydroperiod and the number of annual innundation events were identified as the most significant environmental predictors of community composition. All resident taxa were either regional or narrow-range endemics, with four species representing strict FRP specialists. FRP-specialist taxa exhibited the highest levels of hydro-geological specialization, and these species occurred in distinct communities characterized by longer periods of inundation and fewer annual inundation events than assemblages of non-specialist rock pool species. Eight distinct plant communities were recognized. Conclusions: FRP in the monsoonal tropics are dynamic and hydrologically unpredictable aquatic ecosystems that harbour a number of unique plant communities. The duration and periodicity of seasonal inundation represent major ecological drivers of vegetation assemblages in these habitats, with inhabitant species exhibiting a progression of specialization to hydro-geological factors along a gradient of hydrological stability. Although the colonization of individual rock pools by wetland plants appears to be a random process governed by the serendipity of seed arrival events, the comparative stability of FRP over long geological time frames may have facilitated the persistence of a small number of highly specialized taxa in these ecosystems.				dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Mucina, Laco/H-5490-2014; Mucina, Ladislav/A-6275-2019; Mucina, Ladislav/M-8875-2019; Cross, Adam/S-2710-2019; Renton, Michael/A-9979-2011; Merritt, David/G-9376-2011	dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; Mucina, Laco/0000-0003-0317-8886; Mucina, Ladislav/0000-0003-0317-8886; Mucina, Ladislav/0000-0003-0317-8886; Van Niekerk, Adriaan/0000-0002-5631-0206; Renton, Michael/0000-0003-1316-0145; Merritt, David/0000-0002-3250-6861												1100-9233	1654-1103				NOV	2015	26	6					1184	1197		10.1111/jvs.12318							WOS:000364147300017

Topsoil translocation for Brazilian savanna restoration: propagation of herbs, shrubs, and trees	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Topsoil translocation has been used for vegetation restoration throughout the world, but it has been poorly tested within savannas. This study describes Brazilian savanna (cerrado) regeneration for the first 3 years following topsoil translocation. The topsoil was stripped from 2.5 ha of savanna and spread on 1 ha of an abandoned laterite quarry in the Federal District, Brazil. We assessed vegetation structure and species composition in 18 circular plots (3.14/m(2)) after 5 and 15 months and in 30 circular plots after 37 months. In the last floristic survey, the coverage of herbs was estimated using the step-point method. To verify the source of regeneration, a total of 181 shrubs and trees were excavated over the first 2 surveys. After 3 years, 24, 40, and 21 species of herbs, shrubs, and trees, respectively, had been recorded by the surveys. Of the 33 families found, Fabaceae, Poaceae, and Asteraceae were the most representative. At 5 and 15 months, 91 and 83% of the individuals (shrubs and trees combined) were derived from resprouting, respectively. Shrub and tree stem density reached 3.2/m(2) at 5 months, but declined to 0.5/m(2) at 37 months. By the final survey, native and exotic grasses completely covered the ground. Topsoil translocation was effective for the propagation of native herbs, shrubs, and trees, despite the need to control invasive grasses. The large number of shrub and tree resprouts from roots suggests that the bud bank is an important component of the topsoil for savanna restoration.				Vieira, Daniel/T-1315-2019; Vieira, Daniel L.

Exotic Mammals and Invasive Plants Alter Fire-Related Thresholds in Southern Temperate Forested Landscapes	ECOSYSTEMS												Human activity has resulted in the emergence of fire-induced forest-shrubland mosaics in many southern temperate forest landscapes. In New Zealand (NZ), this transformation was caused by the introduction of fire to previously very low fire-frequency ecosystems. High levels of seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals and the reduction of avian pollination and seed dispersal further influence vegetation change and can cause successions to become completely arrested. Analogous dynamics occur in many other Southern Hemisphere forest landscapes where changes in fire regimes and the introduction of mammalian herbivores and predators have resulted in forest-shrubland mosaics. We developed a spatially explicit state-and-transition model to disentangle the effects of altered fire regimes; invasive pyrophyllic shrub species; seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals; and lowered rates of long-distance seed movement on long-term landscape dynamics and state transitions. Our modelling highlights a threshold in fire frequency where forest systems move to a fire-induced early-successional shrubland state. Because early-successional vegetation in NZ and many other southern temperate forests is much more flammable than mature late-successional vegetation, this shrubland state will persist until fire is suppressed. Our modelling suggests also that in the absence of fire there are critical thresholds in seed predation beyond which succession may become completely arrested in a mid-successional state. Even moderate levels of predation slow regeneration and move the tipping point at which forests shift to early-successional shrublands in the direction of less frequent fire. The presence of invasive pyrophyllic shrubs in the landscape also influences the location of thresholds in fire frequency at which state shifts occur. Restoring these landscapes to their formerly forested condition will require the removal of fire as well as mammalian seed/ling predators and the reinstatement of pollination and dispersal services. Removal of seed predators may act as an effective component of fire control by allowing secondary successions to proceed more quickly, thereby reducing landscape-level flammability.

Terrestrial origin of bacterial communities in complex boreal freshwater networks	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Bacteria inhabiting boreal freshwaters are part of metacommunities where local assemblages are often linked by the flow of water in the landscape, yet the resulting spatial structure and the boundaries of the network metacommunity have never been explored. Here, we reconstruct the spatial structure of the bacterial metacommunity in a complex boreal aquatic network by determining the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities along the entire terrestrial/aquatic continuum, including soil and soilwaters, headwater streams, large rivers and lakes. We show that the network metacommunity has a directional spatial structure driven by a common terrestrial origin of aquatic communities, which are numerically dominated by taxa recruited from soils. Local community assembly is driven by variations along the hydrological continuum in the balance between mass effects and species sorting of terrestrial taxa, and seems further influenced by priority effects related to the spatial sequence of entry of soil bacteria into the network.				del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Ruiz-Gonzalez, Clara/K-7782-2017	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Ruiz Gonzalez, Clara/0000-0003-3568-4943; Nino-Garcia, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-1610-3998												1461-023X	1461-0248				NOV	2015	18	11					1198	1206		10.1111/ele.12499							WOS:000362915600007	26306742					
J	Fartmann, T; Borchard, F; Buchholz, S				Fartmann, Thomas; Borchard, Fabian; Buchholz, Sascha			Montane heathland rejuvenation by choppering-Effects on vascular plant and arthropod assemblages	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Land-use changes and atmospheric nitrogen deposition have negatively affected heathland biota. Active habitat management is one possible way of counteracting the biodiversity loss associated with these habitat alterations. However, management practices for lowland heathlands often have been transferred to montane heathlands, irrespective of the differences in environmental conditions or assemblage composition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of so-called choppering for the rejuvenation of montane heathland. Choppering involves chaffing and removing the largest part of the organic layer down to the mineral soil. In this study, we compared montane heathlands that were rejuvenated through the application of choppering (CHOPPER) to old-growth montane heathlands (CONTROL). Thirteen years after the rejuvenation measures had been conducted, the environmental conditions between CHOPPER and CONTROL still differed. CHOPPER was characterised by shorter vegetation (herbs/grasses and dwarf shrubs), more bare soil, less litter and higher temperatures. Although, the vascular plants and all studied arthropod groups were affected by the environmental changes, their responses were somewhat different. CHOPPER had a unique assemblage of each taxonomic group that included at least a few heathland species that mainly occurred in this treatment. However, choppering was most beneficial for vascular plants, grasshoppers and carabid beetles. As shown for lowland heathlands, choppering is also a suitable management measure for montane heathland to rejuvenate vegetation with its characteristic arthropod fauna. Due to the intact seed banks and Ericaceae root systems with their mycorrhizas, in combination with the availability of bare soil, heathland vegetation can rapidly regenerate after choppering. The keystone structures that explain the high relevance of CHOPPER, especially for vascular plants, grasshoppers and carabid beetles, are low-growing vegetation and bare soil, which result in light and warm microclimatic conditions. Based on the results of our study, we recommend choppering as a regular management measure to rejuvenate montane heathland. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Seed bank of desert annual plants along an aridity gradient in the southern Atacama coastal desert	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: What is the species composition and density of the seed bank in one of the most arid deserts of the world: the Atacama Desert? Do composition and density vary along the aridity gradient? Are they affected by the sampling season and soil nutrient content? Location: Southern Atacama coastal desert, Chile. Methods: Seed bank composition and density were estimated via direct counting of seeds extracted from soil samples collected in eight localities separated by 0.5 degrees, between 26-30 degrees S along the study geographic gradient. This sampling protocol was conducted at three different seasons: after seed set and before and after germination in the rainy season. We also estimated soil nutrient content and obtained local climatic data from the WorldClim database to perform an ordination of seed banks along the aridity gradient. Results: The entire seed bank was composed of 89 species (38 endemic), including 51 annuals (20 endemic). Annuals represented 82.4% of all seeds counted. Exotic plants were represented by 11 species, including nine annuals, with higher seed densities towards the more mesic localities. Aridity was by far the main factor driving seed bank composition and seed density along the study gradient. Seed banks were similar among seasons across all localities. Soil nutrient content played an important, but secondary, role in species-specific relationships. In comparison to other ecosystems, the seed bank densities found in this study correspond to the lowest figures reported to date. Conclusions: This study represents the first report on seed banks via direct counting for the southern part of the Atacama coastal desert. The level of aridity mainly determines annual plant communities in this desert, including exotic species. Their responses to the aridity level and soil nutrient content are species-specific, which allows for species co-existence under extreme abiotic conditions.

Differential responses of total and active soil microbial communities to long-term experimental N deposition	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The relationship between total and metabolically active soil microbial communities can provide insight into how these communities are impacted by environmental change, which may impact the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients in the future. For example, the anthropogenic release of biologically available N has dramatically increased over the last 150 years, which can alter the processes controlling C storage in terrestrial ecosystems. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem located in Michigan, USA, nearly 20 years of experimentally increased atmospheric N deposition has reduced forest floor decay and increased soil C storage. A microbial mechanism underlies this response, as compositional changes in the soil microbial community have been concomitantly documented with these biogeochemical changes. Here, we co-extracted DNA and RNA from decaying leaf litter to determine if experimental atmospheric N deposition has lowered the diversity and altered the composition of the whole communities of bacteria and fungi (i.e., DNA-based) and well as its active members (i.e., RNA-based). In our experiment, experimental N deposition did not affect the composition, diversity, or richness of the total forest floor fungal community, but did lower the diversity (-8%), as well as altered the composition of the active fungal community. In contrast, neither the total nor active forest floor bacterial community was significantly affected by experimental N deposition. Our results suggest that future rates of atmospheric N deposition can fundamentally alter the organization of the saprotrophic soil fungal community, key mediators of C cycling in terrestrial environments.

J	Schwentner, M; Richter, S				Schwentner, Martin; Richter, Stefan			Stochastic effects associated with resting egg banks lead to genetically differentiated active populations in large branchiopods from temporary water bodies	HYDROBIOLOGIA												For Branchiopoda (Crustacea) and other taxa with resting egg banks, genetic differentiation among populations has been commonly observed at small geographic scales. This has been explained by a combination of priority effects and local adaptation. However, stochastic effects associated with hatching from resting egg banks may distort estimates of genetic differentiation. Herein we assessed the genetic composition and differentiation of subsequent active populations of two spinicaudatan species within a temporary water body in eastern Australia by sequencing mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and compared it to the differentiation among populations. Furthermore, a simulation was performed in which the genetic differentiation between active populations derived from resting egg banks of identical genetic composition was assessed. Genetic differentiation between subsequent active populations of the same water body was significant and of similar magnitude as among neighboring populations, all simulated active populations were significantly differentiated from each other. Stochastic effects associated with hatching from resting egg banks combined with genetic drift can lead to significantly differentiated active populations, even if the genetic composition of their resting egg banks was identical. As a consequence, genetic differentiation among populations may often be overestimated due to stochastic effects, which in turn may result in underestimations of gene flow.

Effects of volcanic ash deposition on the early recovery of gap vegetation in Northwestern Patagonian steppes	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Volcanic eruptions can cause changes in plant communities through the effects of ash fall. We studied the effect of ash deposition on vegetation recovery in inter-plant patches (gaps) following the eruption-of the Puyehue-CordOn Caulle volcano (June 2011) in the Northwestern Patagonian steppe of Argentina. We estimated the aboveground vegetation cover and the seed bank abundance (April 2012) in gaps with and without ash (November 2011 and December 2012). We compared the sampled data with studies performed in the area before the eruption. Total plant cover was greater in gaps with ash compared to gaps without ash. Ash deposition suppressed cover of therophyte exotic species, but augmented total cover due to the increase of geophyte cover. Pre- and post-eruption soil seed bank was dominated by therophytes, mostly exotic species. However, ash deposition decreased the abundance of the total seed bank, including therophyte species. The position of buds and plant size in relation to ash layer thickness were important in determining plant recovery. Our results indicate that ash derived from volcanic activity can change species abundance and composition of steppe gaps that are important for the regeneration of matrix species.

Seed Germination Ecology of the Cold Desert Annual Isatis violascens (Brassicaceae): Two Levels of Physiological Dormancy and Role of the Pericarp	PLOS ONE												The occurrence of various species of Brassicaceae with indehiscent fruits in the cold deserts of NW China suggests that there are adaptive advantages of this trait. We hypothesized that the pericarp of the single-seeded silicles of Isatis violascens restricts embryo expansion and thus prevents germination for 1 or more years. Thus, our aim was to investigate the role of the pericarp in seed dormancy and germination of this species. The effects of afterripening, treatment with gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and cold stratification on seed dormancy-break were tested using intact silicles and isolated seeds, and germination phenology was monitored in an experimental garden. The pericarp has a role in mechanically inhibiting germination of fresh seeds and promotes germination of nondormant seeds, but it does not facilitate formation of a persistent seed bank. Seeds in silicles in watered soil began to germinate earlier in autumn and germinated to higher percentages than isolated seeds. Sixty-two percent of seeds in the buried silicles germinated by the end of the first spring, and only 3% remained nongerminated and viable. Twenty to twenty-five percent of the seeds have nondeep physiological dormancy (PD) and 75-80% intermediate PD. Seeds with nondeep PD afterripen in summer and germinate inside the silicles in autumn if the soil is moist. Afterripening during summer significantly decreased the amount of cold stratification required to break intermediate PD. The presence of both nondeep and intermediate PD in the seed cohort may be a bet-hedging strategy.																	1932-6203					OCT 29	2015	10	10							e0140983	10.1371/journal.pone.0140983							WOS:000363920300011	26513241

We compared undisturbed reference steppe vegetation with vegetation impacted by changes in land use such as earlier phases of cultivation (dating back 20 years) and/or current water infiltrations (revealed by the presence of Brachypodium phoenicoides), since the establishment of adjacent hay meadows. We considered plots with and without brambles (Rubus ulmifolius), an indigenous shrub species that had colonized the area after the land-use changes. We monitored the composition and measured the taxonomic richness and richness of functional groups, evenness and similarities of plant communities. The species richness of the undisturbed community was significantly higher than that of all disturbed plant communities. Although cultivation led to the dominance of ruderal species, the removal of water stress had a stronger negative impact, enabling the establishment of herbaceous competitor species such as B. phoenicoides. The dominance of this species resulted in a significant decline in species richness and evenness after water stress removal. The presence of brambles correlating with former cultivation and/or current water infiltration did not have a significant impact on plant species richness in the vicinity of bramble bushes, although it significantly modified the composition of the adjacent herbaceous vegetation. Our study highlights again the low resilience of Mediterranean dry grasslands after disturbance. While both the disturbance and the water stress removal resulted in changes within the plant community, our findings reveal a stronger impact of the water stress removal. Water infiltration led to decreased plant species richness and evenness because the greater availability of water favored competitor species over the stress-tolerant xeric species. Therefore, for restoring the original steppe species richness, the priority will be to control water infiltrations, even before any scrub-clearing is undertaken to control bramble colonization.

Germination and establishment of bioenergy grasses outside cultivation: a multi-region seed addition experiment	PLANT ECOLOGY												Many invasive plants originate as cultivated species. The growing demand for renewable energy has stimulated agricultural production of native and non-native perennial grasses, but little is known about their potential to become invasive outside cultivation, particularly at the early establishment phase. We evaluated effects of propagule pressure and establishment limitations for early establishment of four potential bioenergy grasses in agricultural field margins and forest understory across a 6.3 degrees latitudinal gradient (Ontario, Canada; Illinois and Virginia, USA). We used multiple seed introductions in different years and followed their fate for up to three growing seasons. High interannual variability in establishment indicates that the frequency of propagule introduction is important for invasion outside cultivation. Establishment limitations were stronger in forest than fieldmargins; of 328,800 seeds added, only 1 of 505 persisting seedlings occurred in forest. Removal of competing vegetation had small and variable effects on establishment among sites and species. Unlike previous short-term experiments, our results indicate the potential for the persistence of these bioenergy grasses in both vegetation and seed bank, and highlight the importance of long-term experiments in evaluating invasion risk.

The aim of this study was to assess the seed bank potential of grassland areas with or without history of cultivation in southern Brazil. Specifically, we aimed at evaluating if agricultural use allowed for the persistence of species typical of natural grasslands in soil seed banks. We analyzed seed banks in two areas with a history of cultivation and in two natural grasslands. Samples were collected in spring and autumn in order to assess transient and persistent components, and were characterized by density, richness, presence of exotic species and relationship between seed bank and established vegetation. Both richness and density were high; we found a total of 114 species and a mean density of 61,796 seedlings/m(2) for all four areas in the spring sampling. In the natural grasslands, the dominant species of established vegetation were mostly absent from the soil seed bank. Our study indicates that the seed bank is of little relevance for the recovery of typical grassland vegetation after disturbance.																	0102-3306	1677-941X				OCT-DEC	2015	29	4					543	552		10.1590/0102-33062015abb0026							WOS:000367359100011

Although, both the sites were dominated by P. paniculata, however differ in vegetation pattern. Site 'A' possessed populations of annuals fully exposed to sunlight. While, site 'B' possessed annuals along with perennials located in somewhat shady area. Input to the seed bank was mainly determined by the seed dispersal. Persistent seed bank was observed in annual plant species with increasing numbers in the third collection ( i.e. after seed dispersal). On the other hand, perennial plants mostly exhibited transient nature of seed bank, with no or low numbers in some collections. Significant difference in seed numbers was observed on temporal and spatial scale. Seed densities were higher in the samples collected before rainfall and after dispersal of seeds at both the sites in both the years. High degree of similarity was observed between above and below ground vegetation; however this similarity was more pronounced at site 'B' which was located in shady area, thus providing better soil moisture conditions for seed germination. Moreover, above and below ground vegetation was diverse and flourished in 2013, due to high germination rates, followed by heavy summer rains, providing ample amount of moisture along with high temperature. This study can be used to predict the above ground vegetation and vise versa.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				OCT	2015	47	5					1875	1878									WOS:000364339500035

The hidden seasonality of the rare biosphere in coastal marine bacterioplankton	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Rare microbial taxa are increasingly recognized to play key ecological roles, but knowledge of their spatio-temporal dynamics is lacking. In a time-series study in coastal waters, we detected 83 bacterial lineages with significant seasonality, including environmentally relevant taxa where little ecological information was available. For example, Verrucomicrobia had recurrent maxima in summer, while the Flavobacteria NS4, NS5 and NS2b clades had contrasting seasonal niches. Among the seasonal taxa, only 4 were abundant and persistent, 20 cycled between rare and abundant and, remarkably, most of them (59) were always rare (contributing <1% of total reads). We thus demonstrate that seasonal patterns in marine bacterioplankton are largely driven by lineages that never sustain abundant populations. A fewer number of rare taxa (20) also produced episodic blooms', and these events were highly synchronized, mostly occurring on a single month. The recurrent seasonal growth and loss of rare bacteria opens new perspectives on the temporal dynamics of the rare biosphere, hitherto mainly characterized by dormancy and episodes of boom and bust', as envisioned by the seed-bank hypothesis. The predictable patterns of seasonal reoccurrence are relevant for understanding the ecology of rare bacteria, which may include key players for the functioning of marine ecosystems.

Seedbank Potential of Chinese Tallow Tree (Triadica sebifera) in a Texas Bottomland Hardwood Forest	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) is arguably one of the most deleterious exotic invasive plants in the southern United States, where it alters ecosystem structure and function, especially near the Gulf Coast. Chinese tallow continues to expand into riparian floodplain forests, which likely facilitate regional invasion by dispersing seeds during seasonal flooding and providing corridors of favorable habitat. We attempted to estimate existing Chinese tallow soil seedbank presence and density in a bottomland hardwood forest located at Old Sabine Bottom Wildlife Management Area (OSBWMA) in northeastern Texas, where heavy infestation has not occurred to date, though mature seed-bearing trees are present regionally. No Chinese tallow seeds were detected across the study area, despite the occurrence of mature, seed-bearing plants on adjacent properties. Based on this lack of detected seeds, combined with the lack of observed Chinese tallow plants at OSBWMA, it appears the species continues to occur at low densities within apparently suitable habitats in northeastern Texas, perhaps reflecting a lack of en masse water-mediated dispersal into the region due to its upstream location in relation to heavily infested areas further south.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				OCT	2015	35	4					581	584									WOS:000362849000010

When is the Best Time to Emerge-II: Seed Mass, Maturation, and Afterripening of Common Waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) Natural Cohorts	WEED SCIENCE												Field studies were conducted to determine the effect of emergence timing on the fitness of the next generation as represented by seed mass, maturation, and afterripening of common waterhemp cohorts. Five natural cohorts were documented both in 2009 and 2010. Different maternal environments resulting from varied cohort emergence timings did not influence seed maturation time and seed mass, but had an inconsistent effect on seed afterripening. Here are our major findings. (1) Waterhemp cohorts needed similar amounts of time to generate viable seeds (20 to 27 d after flower initiation) and the seeds produced were of similar size (2.0 to 2.35 g), and (2) waterhemp has strong primary dormancy that may be released within 4 mo during the afterripening process, depending on the dormancy level. Seeds produced by later cohorts were more sensitive to the afterripening period, suggesting more flexibility in life strategy. Seeds from the 2009 cohorts had similar afterripening patterns; newly harvested seeds had s trong primary dormancy (<10% germination), which was gradually released during dry storage and reached the maximum germination (>80%) rate 4 mo after harvest (MAH). However, germination then dropped to 40% 6 and 8 MAH, suggesting the induction of secondary seed dormancy. Strong primary dormancy at harvest for 2010 seeds was sustained in dry afterripening, perhaps because of higher dormancy level, which was the result of less-favorable parental environments brought by 10 to 30 times higher population densities and 2.5 to 5 times higher accumulative precipitation than in 2009 (see Wu and Owen 2014). We also tested the soil seed-bank seed population densities for each waterhemp cohort and found that early cohorts greatly influenced the seed population densities at the soil surface level and the turnover rate of the soil seed bank. Results from this research will provide insights into better management of waterhemp, targeting a better understanding of the seed bank. Nomenclature: Common waterhemp, Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.)

J	Shen, XX; Chai, MW; Xiang, J; Li, RL; Qiu, GY				Shen, Xiaoxue; Chai, Minwei; Xiang, Jiao; Li, Ruili; Qiu, Guoyu			Survival strategies of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus and Zygophyllum xanthoxylon in saline and drought environments, northwest China	ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM												Ammopiptanthus mongolicus and Zygophyllum xanthoxylon are typical plants in the West Ordos National Natural Reserve of Inner Mongolia, China. The populations of A. mongolicus had few young individuals and senesced. However, Z. xanthoxylon was growing well in the habitat of A. mongolicus. In addition, there is little information to compare their seed germination and seedling growth under combined salt and drought environments. In order to exploring the reason for the actuality, a study was conducted to quantify the interactive effects of salinity and drought stresses on seed germination and seedling growth of A. mongolicus and Z. xanthoxylon and then to compare the survival strategies of both shrubs. The experiment consisted of seven gradient concentrations of salinity (0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8 % NaCl) in each of the six drought stress levels (0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.6 and -2.0 MPa polyethylene glycol). As expected, combined salinity and drought stresses had significant (P < 0.05) interactive effects on seed germination of the two tested shrubs. There was significant decrease in these indices, in response to increased salt and/or drought stresses. The higher germination rate and shorter germination duration were detected for A. mongolicus, which may lead to the loss of seed bank. In addition, the radicle length of A. mongolicus (0-2.3 cm) was shorter than that of Z. xanthoxylon (0-14.6 cm), indicating less resistance of seedlings to the volatile conditions in the surface of arid soil. The stepwise regression analysis showed that salinity was the dominant influencing factor and followed by drought in seed germination and seedling growth under salt-drought mixed stress.																	0137-5881	1861-1664				OCT	2015	37	10							213	10.1007/s11738-015-1962-0							WOS:000362291800019						
J	Jongen, M; Hellmann, C; Unger, S				Jongen, Marjan; Hellmann, Christine; Unger, Stephan			Species-specific adaptations explain resilience of herbaceous understorey to increased precipitation variability in a Mediterranean oak woodland	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												To date, the implications of the predicted greater intra-annual variability and extremes in precipitation on ecosystem functioning have received little attention. This study presents results on leaf-level physiological responses of five species covering the functional groups grasses, forbs, and legumes in the understorey of a Mediterranean oak woodland, with increasing precipitation variability, without altering total annual precipitation inputs. Although extending the dry period between precipitation events from 3 to 6weeks led to increased soil moisture deficit, overall treatment effects on photosynthetic performance were not observed in the studied species. This resilience to prolonged water stress was explained by different physiological and morphological strategies to withstand periods below the wilting point, that is, isohydric behavior in Agrostis, Rumex, and Tuberaria, leaf succulence in Rumex, and taproots in Tolpis. In addition, quick recovery upon irrigation events and species-specific adaptations of water-use efficiency with longer dry periods and larger precipitation events contributed to the observed resilience in productivity of the annual plant community. Although none of the species exhibited a change in cover with increasing precipitation variability, leaf physiology of the legume Ornithopus exhibited signs of sensitivity to moisture deficit, which may have implications for the agricultural practice of seeding legume-rich mixtures in Mediterranean grassland-type systems. This highlights the need for long-term precipitation manipulation experiments to capture possible directional changes in species composition and seed bank development, which can subsequently affect ecosystem state and functioning.

J	Sottile, GD; Meretta, PE; Tonello, MS; Bianchi, MM; Mancini, MV				David Sottile, Gonzalo; Ezequiel Meretta, Pablo; Sandra Tonello, Marcela; Martha Bianchi, Maria; Virginia Mancini, Maria			Disturbance induced changes in species and functional diversity in southern Patagonian forest-steppe ecotone	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Ecotone areas are the most dynamic areas of the world where small changes in some condition produce rapid and abrupt responses such as shifts in the distribution of dominant species and associated community's patches. Studying southwestern Santa Cruz forest-steppe ecotone is an ideal landscape to explore potential feedbacks of grazing and fire on vegetation diversity because of the juxtaposition of fire-resistant forests dominated by obligate seedlers with fire-sprouting shrublands and the prevalence of wild cattle since the early XX century. In this study, we analyzed how climate (precipitation, temperature and water balance), stand characteristics (basal area, quantity of cohorts and exotic species cover) and disturbances (fire and grazing) affect native species diversity, Plant Functional Types (PFTs) diversity and PFTs response in the forest-steppe ecotone of southern Patagonia. The study was conducted on 124 plots located on the eastern slope of the Andes (between 48 degrees 50' and 50 degrees 50'S) including forest-steppe ecotone sites between 1000 and 400 mm of annual precipitation. Native species and PFTs diversity indices modeling were carried out by generalized least squares and generalized lineal models. Stand characteristics, disturbance type and climate variables were used as factors over native species and PFTs diversity variables. An ordination and a Spearman rank correlation analysis were achieved between scores of the two first axes with total basal area, exotic species cover, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, and water balance in order to explore PFTs responses to biotic or abiotic ecological conditions. The relationship between native species and PFTs richness (number of PFTs per plot) was modeled in order to evaluate the redundancy degree of PFTs under different disturbance types by fitting nonlinear power models to both richness measurements for each disturbance type. Fire impact over forest-steppe ecotone communities is one of the most important top down factor driving major increases on PFTs redundancy and heliophilous plants species abundance. At stand level, multicohort fire-disturbed stands support the highest native species diversity. Thus, mimicking this natural pattern on silvicultural practices could safeguard higher understory native species diversity than managing policies creating homogeneous conditions. Even if closed forest communities present lower native species diversity values than open canopy communities, they sustain different PFTs that present high conservation values for forest fauna. Grazing pressure represents a threatening agent diminishing native forest-steppe biodiversity. The coexistence of different stands at different development stages in the same landscape ensures the seed bank pools of shade tolerant and heliophilous species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, such predictions are highly valuable for determining management strategies, specifically in agricultural landscapes. In agroecosystems, most weed seeds survive during unfavourable seasons and persist for several years in the seed bank. This causes difficulties in making accurate predictions of weed population dynamics and life history traits (LHT). Consequently, it is very difficult to identify management strategies that limit both weed populations and species diversity. In this article, we present a method of assessing weed population dynamics from both standing plant time series data and an unknown seed bank. We use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to obtain estimates of over 3,080 botanical records for three major LHT: seed survival in the soil, plant establishment (including post-emergence mortality), and seed production of 18 common weed species. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches were complementarily used to estimate LHT values. The results showed that the LHT provided by the HMM enabled fairly accurate estimates of weed populations in different crops. There was a positive correlation between estimated germination rates and an index of the specialisation to the crop type (IndVal). The relationships between estimated LHTs and that between the estimated LHTs and the ecological characteristics of weeds provided insights into weed strategies. For example, a common strategy to cope with agricultural practices in several weeds was to produce less seeds and increase germination rates. This knowledge, especially of LHT for each type of crop, should provide valuable information for developing sustainable weed management strategies.

J	Streitberger, M; Fartmann, T				Streitberger, Merle; Fartmann, Thomas			Vegetation and climate determine ant-mound occupancy by a declining herbivorous insect in grasslands	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												There is considerable research on the effects of soil-disturbing ecosystem engineers in semi-natural Central European grasslands in terms of plant species diversity, soil properties and soil microorganisms. However, knowledge on the importance of such ecosystem engineers for animal diversity is still relatively rare. In this study we analyse the role of Lasius flavus nest mounds as habitats for larvae of the declining burnet moth species zygaena purpuralis in calcareous grasslands. We assumed that anthills act as preferred larval habitats in dependence on climate or vegetation structure. The analysis considers a macroclimatic gradient by comparing sites with differing elevation and, hence, local climates. Additionally, we analysed the importance of anthills for Z. purpuralis along a microclimatic gradient by comparing sites with different vegetation structures. The study clearly shows that anthills are important larval habitats when general microclimatic conditions in the grasslands are unfavourable due to a cool climate at higher elevation or dense vegetation. The likelihood of detecting larvae of the burnet moth species on sites where anthills were occupied was higher on the mounds than within the surrounding vegetation. Anthills were preferred as larval habitats by Z. purpuralis as they combine two essential elements for successful larval development: (i) a favourable microclimate thanks to an open vegetation structure and (ii) a sufficient amount of food. The study underlines the importance of L. flavus as an ecosystem engineer for maintaining habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity within semi-natural grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this regard, the ability of seeds to remain viable for a long time is a crucial prerequisite for seed persistence in the soil and in germplasm banks. However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on seed longevity of alpine plants. Here, we analysed the effects of a moderately warmer parental growth environment generated by open top chambers on subsequent seed longevity of four alpine snowbed species. Seeds from plants exposed to natural and warmed climate during the growing season were subjected to laboratory-controlled accelerated ageing and then regularly sampled for germination tests. Initial viability (Ki), deterioration rate (sigma (-1) ) and time taken for viability to fall to 50 % (p (50)) were estimated using probit analysis. Across species and treatments, p (50) varied from 4.9 to 23.1 days. Seeds produced by plants exposed to warmer temperatures were significantly longer lived than those from plants at natural conditions. Under warming, the seed progeny showed either a higher Ki or a slower sigma (-1) . Under moderate climate warming (about + 2 K), alpine snowbed species produced seeds with an extended resistance to heat stress indicating an effective rapid response to the new environment. Such plastic response may play a key role for survival and persistence of alpine snowbed species facing climate change and may also have important implications for ex situ conservation.

Coville	AQUATIC BOTANY												Genetic variability is a key component of biodiversity. Therefore, the health of populations that colonise restored ecosystems depends on maintaining a level of genetic diversity similar to what is found in unrestored and healthy populations. Wetland restoration occurs frequently, but genetic monitoring rarely considers the genetic variability of species that grow spontaneously in restored ecosystems as a marker of overall ecological restoration success. In this study, the temporal dynamics of genetic variability in an aquatic pioneer plant species, Berula erecta (Hudson) Coville (Apiaceae), were assessed based on an analysis of 12 different microsatellite markers. We hypothesised that vegetative propagation was enhanced by restoration and consequently tended to decrease clonal richness and to stabilise genetic diversity. Several genetic and genotypic indices were surveyed over five years in three restored and two reference sites. An assessment of the breeding system in this population suggested that B. erecta was an ISR (initial seedling recruitment) species; for this type of species, disturbances caused by dewatering permitted an increase in the level of genetic diversity. The results suggested that there were no temporal changes in genetic diversity at any of the studied sites over the time scale of the study, despite strong changes in population sizes that were induced by restoration processes. Clonal richness tended to decrease over time, although not significantly. This study demonstrated that restored populations of clonal species maintained their genetic variability over time and that they might even display greater diversity than unrestored populations. This study also underscored the importance of monitoring the genetic diversity of species in restoration projects to maintain biodiversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Implications for selection of seeds and seedlings for conservation	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seed collection and storage of wild species in ex-situ seed banks should be continued as an integrated tool for the conservation of plants in their habitats. Although seed-bank facilities are widely used today, their seed samples often suffer low genetic diversity. Consequently, reintroduced seeds and plant material may not have the resilience to cope with future environmental stress so leading to complete wastage of seeds. Molecular techniques allow the benefit of quantification of the genetic diversity of a seed collection in comparison with that of the natural population. In this study we focus on ex-situ seed bank samples and living collections of Ranunculus peltatus subsp. baudotii. We compare their genetic diversity and structure with that of the natural population before and after undertaking a restoration project on a natural pond in the Tuscan Archipelago National Park. ISSR analyses, carried out on a total of five sampling groups, shows a relatively high level of genetic diversity for the ex-situ cultivated groups. The analysis of molecular variance, in agreement with clustering obtained in the neighbour-joining dendrogram and with the pattern from cluster analysis, suggests dividing the samples analysed into two groups: one formed by individuals sampled before the pond restoration and the other formed by the subsequent pond population. The results highlight the importance of planning mixed propagation lines which can be obtained through the use of a range of germination conditions to exploit a novel source of genetic variability which may otherwise remain hidden within the seed collection.

Responses to water depth and clipping of twenty-three plant species in an Indian monsoonal wetland	AQUATIC BOTANY												Responses of species to disturbances give insights into how species might respond to future wetland changes. In this study, species of monsoonal wetlands belonging to various functional types (graminoid and non-graminoid emergents, submersed aquatic, floating-leaved aquatic) varied in their growth responses to water depth and harvesting. We tested the effects of water depth (moist soil and flooded) and clipping (unclipped and clipped) on the biomass and longevity of twenty-three dominant plant species of monsoonal wetlands in the Keoladeo National Park, India in a controlled experiment. With respect to total biomass and survival, six species responded positively to flooding and twelve species responded negatively to clipping. Responses to flooding and clipping, however, sometimes interacted. Individualistic responses of species to water levels and clipping regimes were apparent; species within a functional group did not always respond similarly. Therefore, detailed information on the individualistic responses of species may be needed to predict the vegetation composition of post-disturbance wetlands. In particular, as demands for fresh water increase around the world, studies of life history constraints and responses to hydrological changes will aid wetland managers in developing strategies to conserve biodiversity.

Dale			Effects of temperature, salinity and seed age on induction of Zostera japonica germination in North America, USA	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seagrasses can colonize unstructured mudflats either through clonal growth or seed germination and survival. Zostera japonica is an introduced seagrass in North America that has rapidly colonized mudflats along the Pacific Coast, leading to active management of the species. Growth and physiology have been evaluated; however, there is little information about the factors influencing seed germination. We examined the effects of storage and induction temperature (10, 15, 20 degrees C) and salinity (0, 10, 20, 30), and storage period (1.5 and 26 months) on germination of seeds of the seagrass Z. japonica collected from Yaquina Bay, Oregon, USA. Seed germination at 15 and 20 degrees C was 1.24 times higher than at 10 degrees C. Cumulative seed germination at salinity 0 during the first 28 days was 6.5 times greater than at a salinity of 10; similarly, initial seed germination at a salinity of 10 was 7.3 times greater than that observed for salinity 20 and 30. The proportion of germinated seeds collected in 2011 and stored for 26 months was 1.24 times greater than seeds collected in 2013 that were stored for only 6 weeks. Overall average germination rates were 21.6% and 17.1% for 2011 and 2013, respectively. Our experimental results indicate that salinity had a much stronger control over Z. japonica germination than temperature, and the long storage period suggests that Z. japonica is capable of developing a persistent seed bank. We hypothesize that Z. japonica uses seasonal variations in temperature and salinity to avoid competition between generations favoring germination under conditions that are not optimal for the growth of mature plants.

Amplification of 306bp fragment of orange-pigmented strains using CffFOR2- and CffREV4-specific prime pair characterized them as C.flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens. Although the yellow-pigmented variant of the causal agent was previously reported on cowpea, this is the first report of orange variant of C.flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens causing bacterial wilt on common bean in Iran.

J	Kumar, V; Jha, P				Kumar, Vipan; Jha, Prashant			Influence of glyphosate timing on Kochia scoparia demographics in glyphosate-resistant sugar beet	CROP PROTECTION												The recent evolution of glyphosate-resistant (GR) Kochia scoparia (kochia) is a potential threat to the sustainability of GR cropping systems, including GR sugar beet in the northwestern United States. The lack of effective and economical, alternative herbicide programs for K. scoparia control in GR sugar beet further exacerbates the problem. Therefore, it is critical to understand the population dynamics and demographics of K. scoparia in response to the glyphosate application timing, and their overall impact on the replenishment of the weed seed bank in the soil, and on GR sugar beet yields. To fulfill this objective, field experiments were conducted at the Montana State University Southern Agricultural Research Center near Huntley, Montana, USA in 2012 and 2013. Glyphosate timing treatments included a single application at the 2-leaf (If), 6-lf, or 10-lf stage of sugar beet or sequential applications at 2-lf followed by (fb) 6-lf, 6-lf fb 10-lf, 2-lf fb 6-lf fb 10-lf, or 6-lf fb 10-lf fb canopy closure (CC) stage of sugar beet. K. scoparia survival, biomass, and seed production were monitored in three cohorts that emerged at different growth stages of sugar beet during the season. K. scoparia plants in cohort 1 and 2 were more competitive (greater biomass and seed production) than those in cohort 3. Compared with a single glyphosate timing, sequential applications of glyphosate at 6-lf fb 10-If stages of sugar beet prevented survival, biomass and seed production in cohort 1 and cohort 2. K. scoparia plants in cohort 3 that emerged after the glyphosate application at the 10-If stage of sugar beet, produced up to 1123 seeds m(-2). A follow-up application of glyphosate at the CC stage of sugar beet was needed to prevent biomass and seed production from cohort 3 survivors. Irrespective of timing, sequential applications of glyphosate provided higher root and sucrose yields than the single glyphosate applications in GR sugar beet. Growers should utilize three applications of glyphosate applied sequentially at 6-lf fb 10-lf fb CC stages of sugar beet to prevent season-long K. scoparia interference and seed additions in GR sugar beet.

Response of a mixed grass prairie to an extreme precipitation event	ECOSPHERE												Although much research has been conducted to measure vegetation response to directional shifts in climate change drivers, we know less about how plant communities will respond to extreme events. Here, we evaluate the response of a grassland community to an unprecedented 43 cm rainfall event that occurred in the Front Range of Colorado in September, 2013 using vegetation plots that had been monitored for response to simulated precipitation changes since 2011. This rain caused soils to stay at or above field capacity for multiple days, and much of the seed bank germinated following the early autumn event. Annual introduced grasses, especially cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and several introduced forbs demonstrated strong positive increases in cover the following growing season. Native cool season grasses and native forbs showed limited changes in absolute cover despite continued high soil water availability, while native warm season grasses increased in cover the following summer. Treatments that previously altered the amounts and seasonality of rainfall during the 2011-2013 interval showed legacy effects impacting cover responses of introduced species and warm-season native grasses. Resin bag estimates of inorganic nitrogen flux resulting from the event indicated twice as much nitrogen movement compared to any previous collections during the 2011-2013 interval. Nitrogen additions to a subset of plots made in spring of 2014 demonstrated that the relative cover of introduced species could be further increased with additional soil nitrogen. Collectively, these results support the contention that extreme precipitation events can favor species already benefiting from other environmental change drivers.

Though there are extensive studies on the germination requirements of seeds in soil banks of saline habitats, studies conducted for halophytes with aerial seed banks are rare. We assessed the impact of aerial and room-temperature storages on the light and temperature requirements during germination in two small-seeded halophytes: Halocnmum strobilaceum having a short-term aerial seed bank (less than one year) and Halopeplis perfoliata having a longer term aerial seed bank (up to two years). Seed storage in the aerial bank reduced the germination in H. strobilaceum, but either increased it (5-months storage) or had no effect (17-months storage) in H. perfoliata. Seeds of both species that were stored in aerial bank germinated to higher percentages in light than in darkness, indicating that considerable portions of the seed populations are light sensitive. Seeds of H. perfoliata attained less than 5.0% germination in darkness at higher temperatures, compared to more than 90.0% in light. The results support the hypothesis that the aerial seed bank is an adaptive strategy for survival in the saline habitats of the two species.

However, several palm trees principally accumulate tocotrienols, rather than tocopherols, in seeds, as it occurs in other monocots. To unravel the protective role of either tocopherols or tocotrienols against lipid peroxidation during seed germination in Chamaerops humilis var. humilis; seed viability, natural and induced germination capacity, seed water content, malondialdehyde levels (as an indicator of the extent of lipid peroxidation) and vitamin E levels (including both tocopherols and tocotrienols) were examined at various germination phases in a simulated, natural seed bank. At the very early stages of germination (operculum removal), malondialdehyde levels increased 2.8-fold, to decrease later up to 74%, thus indicating a transient lipid peroxidation at early stages of germination. Tocopherol levels were absent in quiescent seeds and did not increase during operculum removal, but increased later presumably dampening malondialdehyde accumulation. Thereafter, tocopherols continued increasing, while lipid peroxidation levels decreased. By contrast, tocotrienols levels remained constant or even decreased as germination progressed, showing no correlation with lipid peroxidation levels. We hypothesize that despite their high tocotrienol content, seeds synthesize tocopherols" during germination to protect lipids from peroxidation events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In contrast to the well-established Chinese hamster ovary platform, which has been used for the production of therapeutic antibodies for nearly 30 years, only draft regulations were initially available covering the production of recombinant proteins in transgenic tobacco plants. Whereas recombinant proteins produced in animal cells are secreted into the culture medium during fermentation in bioreactors, intact plants grown under nonsterile conditions in a glasshouse environment provide various 'plant-specific' regulatory and technical challenges for the development of a process suitable for the acquisition of a manufacturing licence for clinical phase I trials. During upstream process development, several generic steps were addressed (e.g. plant transformation and screening, seed bank generation, genetic stability, host plant uniformity) as well as product-specific aspects (e.g. product quantity). This report summarizes the efforts undertaken to analyse and define the procedures for the GMP/GACP-compliant upstream production of 2G12 in transgenic tobacco plants from gene to harvest, including the design of expression constructs, plant transformation, the generation of production lines, master and working seed banks and the detailed investigation of cultivation and harvesting parameters and their impact on biomass, product yield and intra/interbatch variability. The resulting procedures were successfully translated into a prototypic manufacturing process that has been approved by the German competent authority.

In the Pharma-Planta project, the HIV-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 2G12 was expressed in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The scientific, technical and regulatory demands of good manufacturing practice (GMP) were addressed by comprehensive molecular characterization of the transgene locus, confirmation of genetic and phenotypic stability over several generations of transgenic plants, and by establishing standard operating procedures for the creation of a master seed bank, plant cultivation, harvest, initial processing, downstream processing and purification. The project developed specifications for the plant-derived antibody (P2G12) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) based on (i) the guidelines for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies in cell culture systems; (ii) the draft European Medicines Agency Points to Consider document on quality requirements for APIs produced in transgenic plants; and (iii) de novo guidelines developed with European national regulators. From the resulting process, a GMP manufacturing authorization was issued by the competent authority in Germany for transgenic plant-derived monoclonal antibodies for use in a phase I clinical evaluation. Following preclinical evaluation and ethical approval, a clinical trial application was accepted by the UK national pharmaceutical regulator. A first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation phase I safety study of a single vaginal administration of P2G12 was carried out in healthy female subjects. The successful completion of the clinical trial marks a significant milestone in the commercial development of plant-derived pharmaceutical proteins.

Nonconventional Weed Management Strategies for Modern Agriculture	WEED SCIENCE												Weeds are a significant problem in crop production and their management in modern agriculture is crucial to avoid yield losses and ensure food security. Intensive agricultural practices, changing climate, and natural disasters affect weed dynamics and that requires a change in weed management protocols. The existing manual control options are no longer viable because of labor shortages; chemical control options are limited by ecodegradation, health hazards, and development of herbicide resistance in weeds. We are therefore reviewing some potential nonconventional weed management strategies for modern agriculture that are viable, feasible, and efficient. Improvement in tillage regimes has long been identified as an impressive weed-control measure. Harvest weed seed control and seed predation have been shown as potential tools for reducing weed emergence and seed bank reserves. Development in the field of allelopathy for weed management has led to new techniques for weed control. The remarkable role of biotechnological advancements in developing herbicide-resistant crops, bioherbicides, and harnessing the allelopathic potential of crops is also worth mentioning in a modern weed management program. Thermal weed management has also been observed as a useful technique, especially under conservation agriculture systems. Last, precision weed management has been elaborated with sufficient details. The role of remote sensing, modeling, and robotics as an integral part of precision weed management has been highlighted in a realistic manner. All these strategies are viable for today's agriculture; however, site-specific selection and the use of right combinations will be the key to success. No single strategy is perfect, and therefore an integrated approach may provide better results. Future research is needed to explore the potential of these strategies and to optimize them on technological and cultural bases. The adoption of such methods may improve the efficiency of cropping systems under sustainable and conservation practices.

Weed Seed Banks Are More Dynamic in a Sod-Based, Than in a Conventional, Peanut-Cotton Rotation	WEED SCIENCE												Crop rotation promotes productivity, nutrient cycling, and effective pest management. However, in row-crop systems, rotation is frequently limited to two crops. Adding a third crop, especially a perennial crop, might increase crop-rotation benefits, but concerns about disruption of agricultural and ecological processes preclude grower adoption of a three-crop rotation. The objective of the present research was to determine whether weed seed banks differ between a sod-based rotation (bahiagrass-bahiagrass-peanut-cotton) and a conventional peanut-cotton rotation (peanut-cotton-cotton) and the importance of crop phase in weed seed-bank dynamics in a long-term experiment initiated in 1999 in Florida. Extractable (ESB) and germinable (GSB) seed banks were evaluated at the end of each crop phase in 2012 and 2013, and total weed seed or seedling number, Shannon-Weiner's diversity (H'), richness, and evenness were determined. ESB increased in H' (36%), richness (29%), and total number of weed seeds (40%) for sod-based compared with conventional rotation, whereas GSB increased 32% in H', 27% in richness, and 177% in total number of weed seedlings. Crop phase was a determinant factor in the differences between crop rotations. The first year of bahiagrass (B1) exhibited increases in weed seed and seedling number, H', and richness and had the highest values observed in the sod-based rotation. These increases were transient, and in the second year of bahiagrass (B2), weed numbers and H' decreased and reached levels equivalent to those in the conventional peanut-cotton rotation. The B1 phase increased the germinable fraction of the seed bank, compared with the other crop phases, but not the total number of weed seeds as determined by ESB. The increases in H' and richness in bahiagrass phases were mainly due to grass weed species. However, these grass weed species were not associated with peanut and cotton phases of the sod-based rotation. The results of the present study demonstrated that including bahiagrass as a third crop in a peanut-cotton rotation could increase weed community diversity, mainly by favoring increases in richness and diversity, but the structure and characteristics of the rotation would prevent continuous increases in the weed seed bank that could affect the peanut and cotton phases.

The loss of native plant diversity is of increasing concern. We evaluated the effect of Urochloa humidicola on floristic similarity between native and cultivated grasslands and the differences in spatial distributions between species. To analyze the effect of seasonality, we collected samples at the end of flood and dry periods. In native grasslands and another area cultivated with U. humidicola, samples were collected at three elevations (bottom; intermediate; and top). We identified 90 species and observed a high similarity between the cultivated and native grassland during the flood period; both grasslands exhibited significant differences during the drought period. This difference was due to an increased presence of grasses, mainly U. humidicola, in the cultivated grassland. Increased similarity between bottom and intermediate elevations was due to an increased proportion of aquatic macrophytes. In contrast, the top elevation differed due to the contribution of terrestrial species. We conclude that the native and cultivated grasslands exhibit differences in vegetation composition and are primarily structured by seasonal flooding, and small variations in elevation promote zonation within the plant community.

Does the method of soil handling (turfing or loose-tipping) or the season of transfer determine the outcome? LocationA deciduous ancient coppice woodland in Kent, southeast England. MethodsTwo methods of soil translocation were compared: loose-tipping, involving stripping a layer of topsoil and re-spreading it at a receptor site; and soil placement, in which soil turves were cut and laid intact. The operation also provided an opportunity to observe the effects of seasonal translocation, respectively, in autumn and spring. Soil compaction, texture and chemistry were assessed after translocation, while vegetation cover changes were followed over a 10-yr period. ResultsImmediately after soil transfer, the vegetation community reverted to an earlier successional stage, with bare ground rapidly colonized by annuals and biennials, many germinating from the soil seed bank. By the third year after translocation, a perennial vegetation cover had developed comprising grasses and woodland-edge opportunists as well as most of the original woodland species. After 10yr, bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.) dominated the receptor sites, along with the woodland geophyte bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), while some woodland species became less abundant. Localized soil compaction radically altered species composition. Autumn translocation promoted better immediate recovery of forest species than spring translocation, while soil placement caused less initial damage than loose-tipping. Convergence in vegetation composition in all soil handling treatments was observed towards canopy closure. ConclusionsResults illustrate the importance of conducting translocation operations in the autumn when the vegetation is dormant and soil moisture is low, and point to the need for sensitive soil handling. After 10yr the field layer at the receptor site still resembled that of the donor, but with differences in abundance of some individual species.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				OCT	2015	18	4					579	590		10.1111/avsc.12170							WOS:000361181500005

Are there constraints in terms of animal nutrition? LocationPastures on ex-arable land in pleistocene lowlands of Northwestern Germany, 120-160m a.s.l. MethodsWe sampled vegetation, soil nutrient status and above-ground biomass properties in 42 quadrats in a restored sand grassland and wet heath site and ten quadrats in an old sand grassland nearby. Data were analyzed using ordination, ANOVA and a generalized linear model. ResultsSoil phosphorus and nitrogen were significantly reduced by topsoil removal to the level of target communities. A remarkably high number of typical and endangered sand grassland species established, presumably from the seed/spore bank. Compared to old, seasonally grazed sand grassland, higher species diversity could be observed after topsoil removal. Reasons may be the raised pH as a heritage of arable cultivation and the very open vegetation structures enhancing early successional species. Year-round grazing preserved open vegetation structures, but was not able to fully suppress birch encroachment in early stages of succession. ConclusionsOur study showed that combining topsoil removal, self-greening via recruitment from the seed/spore bank and subsequent year-round grazing might be particularly successful approaches for the restoration of endangered sand grasslands and wet heaths on ex-arable land. However, additional measures might be necessary to prevent undesired shrub encroachment in the first years after topsoil removal. Due to relatively low biomass quantity and quality of sand grasslands even in summer, we propose supplementary feeding in winter or a restriction to seasonal grazing to meet the requirements of animal welfare.

Native recolonization following control of invasive Ruellia simplex in a cypress floodplain forest	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWhat factors constrain establishment of native plant species after removal of a dominant invasive plant species? Specifically, we tested whether missing soil seed banks, elevated soil nutrients and invasion by other non-native species explained the lack of recovery of native species. LocationBald-cypress-dominated (Taxodium distichum) floodplain forest. Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, Alachua County, FL, US. MethodsWe assayed the plant composition of the soil seed bank to a depth of 5cm and analysed soil nutrient levels in a floodplain forest invaded by Ruellia simplex. We measured percentage cover of vegetation 1yr after herbicide application to control R.simplex. ResultsMany native species (largely perennials) and very few R.simplex emerged from the seed bank assay. Herbicide application reduced cover of R.simplex, but 1yr post-herbicide vegetation cover lacked native perennials, and instead was largely comprised of novel invaders and early successional (annual) natives. Across locations, levels of some soil nutrients (P, Mg) and pH were higher in R.simplex-invaded plots than in uninvaded plots. Similarly, R.simplex-invaded plots were significantly correlated with soil K and Ca levels at some locations but not others. ConclusionIt seems most probable that watershed-level factors, including soil nutrients and pH, as well as changes in hydrology are interacting with site-level factors, such as remnant invasive non- Ruellia simplex plant propagules and vegetative propagules of R.simplex to constrain long-term native plant community establishment. Propagule limitation from the soil seed bank is not likely a barrier to native plant recolonization in floodplain forests after removal of invasive R.simplex, as diversity and density of native species emerged from the soil seed bank was high and density of R.simplex in the soil seed bank was extremely low. It does seem likely that soil properties are influencing the plant community. A critical next step will be identification of native species tolerant of altered soil and water conditions if restoration efforts are to succeed. However, further research on all spatial levels is needed to effectively restore degraded floodplain forests, especially at the broader watershed level.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				OCT	2015	18	4					694	704		10.1111/avsc.12187							WOS:000361181500015

Gray var. grypoceras in urban fragmented forests	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Habitat fragmentation is likely to have deleterious genetic consequences for plant populations. Although the genetic effects of fragmentation in plants have been investigated in various landscapes, such studies are scarce in urban landscapes where forests tend to be fragmented and have a complex internal structure. This study aimed to determine the factors, including patch and sub-patch level spatial factors, affecting the genetic diversity of a herbaceous species in urban fragmented forests. We collected 30-39 leaf samples of Viola grypoceras A. Gray var. grypoceras, a perennial herbaceous species with short-distance seed dispersal, from 12 fragmented and 12 suburban forests each at Kyoto City, Japan, and analyzed the genetic diversity of this species by developing six simple sequence repeat markers. Field survey was conducted to collect demographic and spatial data. There was no significant difference in allelic richness between the urban fragmented and suburban forests. However, statistical analysis revealed that the area of vegetation, distribution pattern of populations in a forest, and average distance between nearest populations affected the genetic diversity of this species in urban fragmented forests. Although V. grypoceras has traits that allow it to tolerate fragmentation, such as self-pollination and seed bank-formation ability, pure loss of habitat and reduced fragment size might have deleterious effects on this species, and these effects might become more apparent if fragmentation continues to proceed in the future.

J	Kellmann-Sopya, W; Gielwanowska, I				Kellmann-Sopya, Wioleta; Gielwanowska, Irena			Germination capacity of five polar Caryophyllaceae and Poaceae species under different temperature conditions	POLAR BIOLOGY												A compilation of the literature relating to the germination of five species of polar vascular plants, Cerastium alpinum, Colobanthus quitensis, Silene involucrata, Deschampsia antarctica and Poa annua, indicates that optimal temperature conditions for seed germination have never been identified for some of them, and the results reported for the remaining species are largely inconclusive. Our results and published findings suggest that significant differences in the germinability of the analysed five species and their species-specific germination responses to temperature and cold stratification could result from variations in their physiological dormancy levels. It is important that seed physiological development at time of collection, seed storing time and conditions are as equal as possible when comparing results from different studies. Our study revealed differences in the maximum germination percentages of those species, which ranged from very low (C. alpinum, 10 %) to very high (S. involucrata, 99 %). Silene involucrata, C. quitensis and D. antarctica have fast-germinating seeds, whereas P. annua is a long germinating species. Within the range of four tested temperatures (12, 20, 20/7 and 30/20 A degrees C), the lowest germination percentage of S. involucrata seeds was observed at fluctuating temperature of 30/20 A degrees C and C. quitensis seeds at 12 A degrees C, the highest germination percentage of C. quitensis seeds was reported at fluctuating temperature of 20/7 A degrees C and P. annua seeds at 12 A degrees C, whereas the germination percentage of D. antarctica was not affected by temperature. A two-month cold stratification period stimulated germination in C. quitensis and D. antarctica, but it did not affect the germination of C. alpinum.

The interactive effects of water flow and reproductive strategies on seed and seedling dispersal along the substrate in two sub-tropical seagrass species	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												We quantified the effects of water flow on secondary seed and seedling dispersal for two seagrass species with different reproductive strategies: turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) whose large seeds (15.1 +/- 0.8 mm tall) have the potential for long distance dispersal by current-mediated transport of buoyant fruits, and shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), whose small seeds (2.1 +/- 0.1 mm tall) are released adjacent to the parent plant and create a persistent seed bank. Results from field dispersal experiments in Texas indicate that under normal flow conditions (mean water velocity <5 cm s(-1)), turtle grass seedling movement is greater over bare sand than within seagrass beds and seedlings have the potential to move up to 2.1 m d(-1). Fine hairs on the seedling base trap sand grains, which likely leads to final seedling establishment after a few days and a potential secondary dispersal distance along the substrate of <20 m from the point of release. Under normal flow conditions, shoal grass seeds have the potential to move up to 1.1 m d(-1), but seed entrapment in sediment ripples likely limits the total secondary dispersal distance to <10 m from the parent plant. Secondary dispersal dynamics are species-specific, related to seed morphology and tightly coupled to each species' reproductive strategy. This phase of seed dispersal has the potential to shape plant population structure and aid in colonization of unvegetated habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Seed rain alteration related to fire and grazing history in a semiarid shrubland	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In arid environments, vegetation is distributed in patches. Herbivory and fires promote changes and seed rain plays a key role in the soil seed bank and the colonization of new spaces. This study focuses on the effect of different land use histories on the spatial and temporal seed rain distribution in Patagonia. We placed traps to capture seed rain of perennial grasses, shrubs and annual forage dicots at five sites with different grazing and fire histories. With grazing and fire seed rain diversity is higher than in absence of disturbances. Functional groups seed rain in vegetation patches did not show differences between sites, but at the interpatch level, grazing increased shrub seed and decreased perennial grass seed in the seed rain. Fire decreased the effects of grazing on shrub seed rain, but did not change its effects on perennial grasses. Shrub species showed a minimum abundance in the seed rain in the undisturbed site. Our results suggest that changes described for vegetative attributes are reflected in the seed rain, and this could reinforce the patch-interpatch pattern; fire did not reduce the grazing effects because it decreased the seed rain of the preferred grasses and increased the less preferred ones.

Can the sedimentological and morphological structure of rivers be used to predict characteristics of riparian seed banks?	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Seeds are transported by flowing water along with sediment and organic matter and form seed banks within the fluvial landforms (or geomorphic units) of river systems. Fluvial processes commonly result in observable gradients in sediment characteristics with elevation above the channel bed. This study aims to investigate spatial variability in seed bank characteristics that may be attributed to fluvial processes. We compared the extent to which four riparian seed bank characteristics (abundance, species richness, seed mass, and seed shape) are correlated with (1) fluvially influenced gradients in sediment character (percentage of organic matter [organic %], median particle size [D-50], percentage of fine particles 1% fines], and the combined percentage of sand and gravel 1% sand/gravel]); and (2) three geomorphic unit types that form with increasing elevation above the channel bed: bars, benches, and the floodplain. Seed bank abundance and species richness were weakly yet significantly correlated with sediment gradients, significantly increasing with increasing % fines and decreasing % sand/gravel. Seed bank species richness also significantly increased with increasing organic % and decreasing D-50. Conversely, seed abundance was highly variable, and relationships between sediment qualities and seed mass and shape were nonexistent. We suggest that hydrological factors such as inundation frequency, operating most clearly at the geomorphic unit scale, ultimately drive spatial variability in riparian seed bank characteristics by (1) directly influencing seed inputs and losses from seed banks via erosion and deposition, which is complicated by species-specific differences in seed morphology; and (2) indirectly influencing seed inputs and losses by mediating seed germination and mortality and the establishment success of plants, through impacts on sediment moisture and organic matter content. Further complexity is added by nonfluvial seed inputs from established vegetation. The net result of these influences tends toward decreasing potential for seed losses and increasing potential for seed inputs associated with the reduction in inundation frequency observed from bars to the floodplain. For those assessing the potential of the seed bank as a seed source for revegetation, sediment sampling for seed bank assays targeted at organic flood debris, or fine, organic-rich sediments such as those typically associated with benches and the floodplain, should elicit useful estimations of seed bank composition.

Sexual Recruitment in Zostera marina: Progress toward a Predictive Model	PLOS ONE												Ecophysiological stress and physical disturbance are capable of structuring meadows through a combination of direct biomass removal and recruitment limitation; however, predicting these effects at landscape scales has rarely been successful. To model environmental influence on sexual recruitment in perennial Zostera marina, we selected a sub-tidal, light-replete study site with seasonal extremes in temperature and wave energy. During an 8-year observation period, areal coverage increased from 4.8 to 42.7%. Gains were stepwise in pattern, attributable to annual recruitment of patches followed by centrifugal growth and coalescence. Recruitment varied from 13 to 4,894 patches per year. Using a multiple linear regression approach, we examined the association between patch appearance and relative wave energy, atmospheric condition and water temperature. Two models were developed, one appropriate for the dispersal of naked seeds, and another for rafted flowers. Results indicated that both modes of sexual recruitment varied as functions of wind, temperature, rainfall and wave energy, with a regime shift in wind-wave energy corresponding to periods of rapid colonization within our site. Temporal correlations between sexual recruitment and time-lagged climatic summaries highlighted floral induction, seed bank and small patch development as periods of vulnerability. Given global losses in seagrass coverage, regions of recovery and re-colonization will become increasingly important. Lacking land-scape-scale process models for seagrass recruitment, temporally explicit statistical approaches presented here could be used to forecast colonization trajectories and to provide managers with real-time estimates of future meadow performance; i.e., when to expect a good year in terms of seagrass expansion. To facilitate use as forecasting tools, we did not use statistical composites or normalized variables as our predictors. This study, therefore, represents a first step toward linking remotely acquired environmental data to sexual recruitment, an important measure of seagrass performance that translates directly into landscape-scale coverage change.																	1932-6203					SEP 14	2015	10	9							e0138206	10.1371/journal.pone.0138206							WOS:000361601100242	26368792

Often, this fodder type may be supplied free of charge to graziers in distress due to circumstances that follow natural disasters such as bushfires, drought, and flood. However, because of the obvious urgency arising from these situations, it is suspected that much relief fodder may unintentionally pose an elevated risk for dispersal of weeds since it may be supplied from pasture not normally used for trade in fodder, and therefore is of unknown quality. Previous destructive method to detect weed propagules in bales of fodder are cumbersome, time consuming and of limited ecological and statistical value. Therefore, objective of this paper was to development of a convenient method to assess round pasture hay bales for the presence of weed propagules, to prevent unintentional spread of noxious species in hay bales. To examine this objective known quantity of seeds were added in a series of distributions to bales of seed free pasture hay, and a positive correlation for the amount of seed added per bale with that recovered in core samples was observed. Whilst the number of seeds detected per bale varied according to the distribution of seeds within the bales and the number of cores analysed, the absolute detection of seeds suggests that this sampling method is worthy of further examination. In addition, a pragmatic estimation of bale remnants after stock feeding has been investigated to more closely estimate the potential size of the remaining seed bank. The authors propose that development of this approach is timely, in the light of future climatic uncertainty driving extreme weather events that increase the need for relief fodder, which can be a potential vector for the spread of noxious weed seeds.

Native root-associated bacteria rescue a plant from a sudden-wilt disease that emerged during continuous cropping	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Plants maintain microbial associations whose functions remain largely unknown. For the past 15 y, we have planted the annual postfire tobacco Nicotiana attenuata into an experimental field plot in the plant's native habitat, and for the last 8 y the number of plants dying from a sudden wilt disease has increased, leading to crop failure. Inadvertently we had recapitulated the common agricultural dilemma of pathogen buildup associated with continuous cropping for this native plant. Plants suffered sudden tissue collapse and black roots, symptoms similar to a Fusarium-Alternaria disease complex, recently characterized in a nearby native population and developed into an in vitro pathosystem for N. attenuata. With this in vitro disease system, different protection strategies (fungicide and inoculations with native root-associated bacterial and fungal isolates), together with a biochar soil amendment, were tested further in the field. A field trial with more than 900 plants in two field plots revealed that inoculation with a mixture of native bacterial isolates significantly reduced disease incidence and mortality in the infected field plot without influencing growth, herbivore resistance, or 32 defense and signaling metabolites known to mediate resistance against native herbivores. Tests in a subsequent year revealed that a core consortium of five bacteria was essential for disease reduction. This consortium, but not individual members of the root-associated bacteria community which this plant normally recruits during germination from native seed banks, provides enduring resistance against fungal diseases, demonstrating that native plants develop opportunistic mutualisms with prokaryotes that solve context-dependent ecological problems.

S 33 degrees 02' and Long. 71 degrees 35' O) from April to December 2012. Three sites were selected that were located on slopes with the same exposure: 1) site burned by fire in 2012, 2) site burned by fire in 2003, and 3) control site corresponding to an area without previous fires. Both shrub and herbaceous species were studied. The cover of shrubs, geophytes and therophytes was determined as well as the aboveground and belowground biomass of geophytes, with special attention paid to Oziroe arida. When O. arida was present, the diameter of its bulbs were studied. All information was processed by SAS software with ANOVA - analysis of 2 WAYS classification., The extensive geophyte coverage that exists in the site that was burned by fire in 2012 is due to the increased post-fire regeneration of this life-form. The biomass of geophytes is greater in the burned areas, especially during the first year after the fire (2012 site). On the site that burned in 2003, there was a higher percentage of therophyte coverage; there was no relationship found between the coverage of therophytes and the coverage of woody plants. It was determined that for each additional millimeter of diameter, there is an increase in age of 2.99 years for Oziroe arida bulbs, the most abundant geophyte in the site 1 (R-2 = 0.78); that is, the bulb diameter will be an indicator of the age of the bulbs. This study represents the first in the country to perform a quantitative analysis of the behavior of geophytes after fires (aboveground and belowground biomass), and it concluded that the action of fire favors the regeneration of geophytes through the generation of further overhead and underground biomass, which created conditions for increased reproduction.

Temporarily flooded habitats are an unpredictable environment for plants, and for some species the only chance they have of surviving is the formation of persistent seed banks. Astragalus contortuplicatus is an annual species of periodically flooded habitats and is considered an endangered species in Hungary. Altogether 1993 seeds of this species were tested in a germination experiment: 1200 were freshly harvested and 793 were collected from herbarium specimens of various ages. Seed viability was tested using the germination method. The freshly harvested seeds were used for selecting the best out of seven frequently used dormancy-breaking methods for this species. The highest percentage of germination was recorded for the combined treatment of scarification and light. Thus, this method was used to test the viability of the seeds collected from herbarium specimens. The oldest seeds that germinated were 131 years old. Until now there are no records of seeds of herbaceous legumes germinating that are more than 100 years old. This record is the 9th oldest of all the literature records of viable seeds originating from biological collections. All the seeds that geminated developed into healthy, fertile plants, the seeds of which also readily germinated. Fitted linear regression showed a significant negative relationship between seed age and percentage germination. Based on this linear regression the calculated theoretical maximum viability is 309 years. Our results suggest that seeds of A. contortuplicatus stored in collections can be successfully used in this species' reintroduction for conservation purpose, to areas in which the plants were collected.

However, the benefits of their use in metal-polluted soils remain unclear and need to be assessed in terms of factors besides soil fertility. This study examines the use of thermal-dried sewage sludge (TDS) as an amendment for heavy metal-polluted soil in terms of its effects on soil chemical properties, leachate composition, and the growth of native plant communities. To assess the response of the soil and its plant community to an increase in metal mobilization, the effects of TDS amendment were compared with those of the addition of a chelating agent (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]). The experimental design was based on a real-case scenario in which soils from of an abandoned mine site were used in a greenhouse bioassay. Two doses of TDS and EDTA were applied to a soil containing high Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd levels (4925, 5675, 404, and 25 mg kg(-1), respectively). Soil pH was 6.4, and its organic matter content was 5.53%. The factors examined after soil amendment were soil fertility and heavy metal contents, leachate element losses, the plant community arising from the seed bank (plant cover, species richness and biodiversity, above/below ground biomass), and phytotoxic effects (chemical contents of abundant species). Thermal-dried sewage sludge emerged as a good phytostabilizer of Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd given its capacity to reduce the plant uptake of metals and achieve rapid plant cover. This amendment also enhanced the retention of other elements in the plant root system and overall showed a better capacity to remediate soils polluted with several heavy metals. The addition of EDTA led to plant productivity losses and nutritional imbalances because it increased the mobility of several elements in the soil and its leachates.

Impacts of Mastication: Soil Seed Bank Responses to a Forest Thinning Treatment in Three Colorado (USA) Conifer Forest Types	FORESTS												Mastication is a forest fuel thinning treatment that involves chipping or shredding small trees and shrubs and depositing the material across the forest floor. By decreasing forest density mastication has been shown to lessen crown fire hazard, yet other impacts have only recently started to be studied. Our study evaluates how mastication treatments alter the density and composition of soil seed banks in three Colorado conifer forest types. The three forest types were (1) lodgepole pine, (2) ponderosa pine and (3) pinyon pine-juniper. Results showed that masticated sites contained higher seed bank densities than untreated sites: a pattern primarily driven by treatment effects in ponderosa pine forests. The seed bank was dominated by forbs regardless of forest type or treatment. This pattern of forb dominance was not observed in the aboveground vegetation cover as it demonstrated more even proportions of the functional groups. Graminoids showed a higher seed density in treated sites than untreated and, similarly, the identified non-native species only occurred in the treated ponderosa pine sites suggesting a potential belowground invasion for this forest type. These results suggest that presence of masticated material might not be creating a physical barrier hindering the transfer of seeds as predicted.																	1999-4907					SEP	2015	6	9					3060	3074		10.3390/f6093060							WOS:000362558500009

This study aimed to detect functional patterns that emerge in a cloud forest community, simulating the spatio-temporal dynamics using a cellular automaton. Modeling was based on regeneration types that were defined combining regeneration traits of tree species in a previous research developed at La Cortadura, Veracruz. We structured a cellular automaton, the operation rules were based on key biological processes involved in species regeneration and the density of trees around each cell. We simulated three treatments: no-disturbance, light disturbance and severe disturbance. The communities evolved as follows: on no-disturbed treatment, types with competitive profile increased their abundance, while the abundance of types with pioneer profile decreased. In light-disturbed treatment, the community immediately recovered, while in severe disturbance treatment, the community, and seed and seedlings banks recovered slowly and a disturbance imprint remained throughout the simulation. Colonization patterns of disturbed areas suggest a complementary response to the disturbance of regeneration types.

FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												Patch size and isolation are thought to have a large influence on the extinction risk of specialist plant species in grassland fragments in the modern agricultural landscape. We combined a re-sampling study in semi-permanent floodplain grassland plots with a GIS-based analysis of historical (1950s/1960s) and recent landscape patterns. Based on historical and recent vegetation maps and relev,s from six study areas (plus a protected reference area) covering 50-60 years of vegetation change following agricultural intensification, we aimed at analysing the importance of fragmentation on the diversity of potentially sensitive specialist species of wet floodplain meadows in northern Germany. On the plot scale, we found 30-66 % reductions in species richness of these characteristic wet meadow plant species over time and an associated increase in the fragmentation of grassland habitats. Distance to the nearest suitable habitat had a modest negative effect on modern plot-scale richness, while the other tested landscape metrics (total meadow area, mean patch size and landscape proximity index distribution) had no significant influence. There was also no evidence for a legacy of historical landscape structure on current richness of specialist species. Instead, management intensity and its change over the past decades, as indicated by altered Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients and moisture, had a strong influence on plot-scale diversity. The results suggest that fragmentation is not the proximate cause of impoverishment and point to habitat deterioration as a main driver. We conclude that conservation measures in Central-European floodplain meadows should not only focus on large continuous grassland areas, but should also consider small meadow patches if they remained species-rich.

Layne			Livestock-Mediated Dispersal of Prosopis juliflora Imperils Grasslands and the Endangered Grevy's Zebra in Northeastern Ethiopia	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC is a woody plant from the Americas that has dispersed worldwide via human intervention. Typically introduced with good intentions, Prosopis often proliferates and degrades native ecosystems. Prosopis first appeared in the Allideghi Wildlife Reserve (AWR) of northeastern Ethiopia in 1997. In 2005-2006 we determined: (1) patterns of Prosopis dispersal and establishment using global-positioning system mapping and seed-bank assessments; (2) impacts of Prosopis on cover composition and species richness of grassland vegetation using transects at replicated Prosopis stands that varied by tree size; and (3) attitudes of local people toward Prosopis using focus groups and interviews. Prosopis seeds first arrived in the AWR after pastoral livestock consumed seedpods along the Awash River, some 50 km away. Seeds have been deposited in corrals at recently established pastoral settlements within the AWR, and saplings now sprout along livestock trails. Prosopis has also colonized the AWR core grassland area, a vital habitat for wild grazers. Compared with sites lacking Prosopis, the largest class of Prosopis significantly reduced understory basal cover for perennial grasses from 68% to 2%, increased soil surface exposure from 30% to 80%, and lowered the number of grass species from seven to two. Attitudes of pastoralists toward Prosopis have become more negative over time. Local communities use Prosopis via limited charcoal production with some grinding of the seedpods for livestock feed. Infested sites are cleared by hand, but control has been ineffective. Because pastoral livestock are the main vectors for Prosopis seed dispersal and facilitate establishment, they will help transform the core of the AWR ecosystem from open grassland to denuded Prosopis woodland. While this bodes ill for grazing animals in general, it has particularly negative implications for the survival of an isolated population of an endangered, grass-dependent species-Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi).

Soil seed bank dynamics and fertility on a seasonal wetland invaded by Lantana camara in a savanna ecosystem	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Knowledge of seed bank status and dynamics is crucial for effective management of desirable and undesirable plant species in natural ecosystems. We studied the soil seed bank dynamics and soil nutrient concentrations in Lantana camara invaded and uninvaded patches at New Gada wetland in Harare, Zimbabwe. Soils were tested for pH, ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na) and potassium (K). We also assessed the soil seed bank density to a depth of 15 cm over varied altitudinal zones. Soil nutrient concentrations increased by a factor of 2.5 for NH, 3.1 for NI4+, 4.8 for Mg up to 8.5 for Ca with L. camara invasion. In contrast L. camara invaded patches had a lower concentration of NO3- and P than uninvaded patches. Seed density significantly declined with both soil depth and slope with high seed density in the upper surface soil of the lower slopes of the wetland. The elevated soil nutrient concentrations along with a high soil seed bank density suggest that the wetland may still be susceptible to continued invasion by L. camara particularly on the lower slopes of the wetland. Thus, management and eradication efforts should focus on the areas that receive or trap the eroded soil seed bank. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, few studies have investigated seed bank and above-ground species composition in degraded semi-arid dune systems, particularly in relation to their potential to contribute to stabilisation and revegetation. We determined whether soil seed bank and above-ground species composition differed along a chronosequence in the inter-dune lowlands of an active dune field in Inner Mongolia, China. Soil cores were collected in early April 2011 and soil seed bank composition determined using a combination of the seedling emergence and seed extraction methods. Established vegetation, including species composition and abundance, was also surveyed. Relative importance values for all above-ground species and similarities in species composition of vegetation and soil seed bank along the chronosequence were analysed. A clear successional trend was shown for established vegetation along the first three stages identified, followed by a final stage reverting to more mobile substrate due to disturbance by dune movement., This trend was not reflected in the seed bank. Plant and seed bank density increased over time, however, species composition of the seed bank reflected earlier stages rather than the corresponding established vegetation. There was a relationship between established vegetation and the soil seed hank at the earliest stage, driven mainly by the persistence of seeds of the pioneer species Agriophyllum squarrosum and Corispermum candelabrum. A relatively close relationship was also found at the final stage, where frequent disturbance occurred as a result of increasing sand burial, caused by constant directional sand dune movement. While a clear relationship between the seed bank and associated vegetation was not found along the whole chronosequence, the seed bank displayed potential for restoration of pioneer psammophytes and annual herb species, suggesting that it would contribute to regeneration, as well as support latter-stage annuals and several rare and endemic species.

Can the Regeneration of Vegetation from Riparian Seed Banks Support Biogeomorphic Succession and the Geomorphic Recovery of Degraded River Channels?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												For rivers degraded by erosion and channel widening, the re-establishment of riparian vegetation is essential. We assess the potential for riparian seed banks to facilitate natural channel contraction through the regeneration of plants involved in the biogeomorphic succession of three discrete geomorphic units of increasing age and height above the channel bed: bars, benches and floodplain. Standing vegetation upon each unit type was surveyed for four river reaches in the Hunter catchment of eastern Australia. Seed bank composition was determined using seedling emergence techniques on sediment sampled from the units. We compared species richness and composition, and longevity, growth form and seed dispersal mechanisms between the standing vegetation and seed bank species. The seed bank was similar across bars, benches and floodplain, containing mostly perennial pioneer herbs, sedges and rushes, dispersed by wind and hydrochory (water transport). While bar vegetation was similar to the seed bank, bench and floodplain vegetation included later successional species such as shrubs and trees, significantly more grasses and vines (benches: (2)(5, N=402)=102.033, p<0.001; floodplain: (2)(5, N=792)=30.324, p<0.001) and higher proportions of unassisted and animal-dispersed seeds (benches: (2)(5, N=352)=89.409, p<0.001; floodplain: (2)(5, N=338)=56.026, p<0.001). The results suggest that seed banks may support early stages of biogeomorphic succession, via regeneration of pioneer plants. However, plants, such as shrubs and trees that are observed upon units of increasing age and height above the channel bed (i.e. benches and floodplain), are likely sourced from transient seeds produced by local vegetation, rather than seed banks.

Their impact depends on community structure, which varies along time. However, very few studies take into account temporal variation. This is especially true for small, shallow freshwater systems, which remain largely understudied despite their wide variety, global surface and intense microbial activity. We have monthly followed changes in the community structure of small microbial eukaryotes (0.2-5 mu m cell diameter) for 2 years in four ponds and one brook located in North-Western France based on massive 18S rDNA amplicon 454 pyrosequencing. We detected a total of 3742 stringently defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs) encompassing all recognized eukaryotic supergroups and lineages of uncertain affiliation. Although geographically close, protist communities in the five ecosystems were contrasting, with very few shared OTUs, suggesting that environmental selection mainly drives community structure. The temporal dynamics of different high-rank taxa appeared complex and rapid at monthly scales. Despite this, a clear and reproducible seasonality was observed. As expected, low-abundance OTUs dominated the community. Although some of them appeared sporadically or remained at low frequencies during the survey, others occasionally reached relatively high abundances, sometimes recurrently. This shows that at least a fraction of low-abundance eukaryotes constitutes a seed bank. The annual proportion of primary producers, free-living heterotrophs and parasites appeared remarkably constant among the different ecosystems, suggesting underlying trends of ecosystem carrying capacity for these functional groups.

Our main hypothesis is that soil filtering is the main determinant of species assembly, subsequently modulated by climate and lastly by biotic interactions, such as Stipa tenacissima and the biological soil crust (BSC) at fine spatial scales. Our study system is highly suitable to test the importance of edaphic heterogeneity to the assembly of annual plant communities, since calcareous and gypsum soils are in close contact and freely receive propagules. LocationAnnual plant communities of semi-arid steppes in central Spain. MethodsWe built a soil affinity index (SAI) for each species to measure mean soil affinity (MSA; analogous to the community-weighted mean - CWM) in each local assemblage. ResultsMost species were able to establish in both substrates, but gypsum soils clearly exerted a stronger filtering effect. Stipa favoured an expansion of the niche space in calcareous soils but not in gypsum, and BSCs not only reduced annual species richness, diversity and cover, but also the range of SAI values of local assemblages. ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of the probabilistic filtering (sensu From plant traits to vegetation structure, 2010, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK) of soil characteristics to the assembly of annual plant communities, as opposed to an all-or-nothing' filter.

Nurse plant effects of a dominant shrub (Duma florulenta) on understorey vegetation in a large, semi-arid wetland in relation to flood frequency and drying	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsDo nurse plant interactions significantly influence understorey vegetation diversity in a large, semi-arid, shrub-dominated wetland? How do the modes and net effects of nurse plant interactions vary spatially along a flood frequency gradient, and temporally in response to drying? LocationNarran Lakes Ramsar site, New South Wales, Australia. MethodsMicrohabitat characteristics, understorey vegetation and germinable soil seed banks were investigated in shrub and open habitats across a flood frequency gradient in a large, semi-arid wetland dominated by open shrubland under productive conditions following floodwater recession and again following 6mo of drought. Split-plot ANOVA and multivariate analyses were used to determine the effects of shrubs on microhabitat character, understorey vegetation cover, species diversity, richness and composition and germinable soil seed banks. ResultsMicrohabitat characteristics, including canopy cover, litter cover and soil character, all differed between shrub and open habitats, especially in the most frequently flooded sites. Under productive conditions following flooding, lignum shrubs suppressed understorey vegetation cover but increased species richness at the site scale across the flood frequency gradient and, in the most frequently flooded sites, supported higher species density at a microhabitat scale. Under dry conditions, lignum shrubs had a positive effect on understorey vegetation cover, species richness and species density across the flood frequency gradient, but particularly in frequently flooded sites. A significant difference in soil seed bank composition between shrub and open habitats was only observed in frequently flooded sites. ConclusionsNurse plant interactions appear to play an important role in determining understorey vegetation diversity in the lignum shrubland of the Narran Lakes wetland system. The modes and net effects of these nurse plant interactions vary in space and time in relation to flood history and drying. Positive interactions, probably involving microhabitat amelioration, appear to be particularly important to plant diversity and abundance under dry conditions. Under more favourable wetter conditions, lignum shrubs also contribute to understorey vegetation diversity by facilitating the establishment of different species than those dominating open habitats. Our findings have implications for the management of perennial shrubs and hydrological regimes in such wetlands.

Tanner			An age-structured bio-economic model of invasive species management: insights and strategies for optimal control	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Controlling invasive species is a highly complex problem defined by the biological characteristics of the organisms, the landscape context, and a management objective of minimizing invasion damages given limited financial resources. While bio-economic optimization models provide a promising approach for invasive species control, current spatio-temporal optimization models omit key ecological details such as age structures-which could be essential to predict how populations grow and spread spatially over time and determine the most effective control strategies. We develop a novel age-structured optimization model as a spatial-dynamic decision framework for controlling invasive species. In particular, we propose a new carrying capacity sub-model, which allows us to take into account the biological competition among different age classes within the population. The potential use of the model is demonstrated on controlling the invasion of sericea (Lespedeza cuneata), a perennial legume threatening native grasslands in the Great Plains. The results show that incorporating age-structure into the model captures important biological characteristics of the species and leads to unexpected results such as multi-logistic population growth with multiple, sequential, and overlapping phases of logistic form. These new findings can contribute to understanding time-lags and invasion growth dynamics. Additionally, given budget constraints, utilizing control measures every 2-3 years is found to be more effective than yearly control because of the time to reproductive maturity. Results of the bio-economic optimization approach provide both ecological and economic insights into the control of invasive species. Furthermore, while the proposed model is specific enough to capture biological realism, it also has the potential to be generalized to a wide range of invasive plant and animal species under various management scenarios in order to identify the most efficient control strategies for managing invasive species.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2015	17	9					2545	2563		10.1007/s10530-015-0893-4							WOS:000359427400005

Population ecology of the endangered aquatic carnivorous macrophyte Aldrovanda vesiculosa at a naturalised site in North America	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Aldrovanda vesiculosa is an aquatic carnivorous plant native to nutrient impoverished wetland systems in Australia, Africa, Asia, and continental Europe that has declined dramatically throughout its native range in the last century. A strong reliance upon carnivory generally limits its occurrence to specific, nutrient-poor, island-like microhabitats. Remaining native populations are generally small and fragmented, and empirical population ecology data for the species arelacking. Developing an understanding of the constraints to growth, establishment and reproduction in A.vesiculosa is crucial to conservation of the species. In contrast with the decline of the species throughout its native range, a number of large A.vesiculosa populations have become naturalised in North America. This study examines the population ecology of A.vesiculosa at one of these naturalised sites and assesses the species' potential invasiveness in terms of its ecological characteristics. Transect and quadrat surveys were used to determine the response of morphology, fecundity and spatial distribution to putative biotic and environmental variables, with glasshouse trials and a bird feeding experiment employed to test the persistence of seeds in the seed bank and after transport in bird guts. Although A.vesiculosa is capable of becoming locally abundant (up to 1260 individuals m(-2)) in wetland areas where biotic and abiotic conditions are optimal, it appears to compete poorly with floating and emergent macrophytes and is limited predominantly to specific microhabitats. The ecological characteristics of A.vesiculosa suggest that it poses a low invasion risk. The species' growth and reproductive potential are highest in shallow areas harbouring loose vegetation assemblages, with over two thirds of all individuals recorded from water 10-50cm in depth and in areas with <50% native macrophyte cover. Seeds are unlikely to play a significant role in seasonal persistence or dispersal, with poor floral success (c. 10%), few seeds produced, low seed viability (<50%) throughout the study area and no seeds recovered from the sediment seed bank or recovered from bird faeces following gut transport. The stenotopic ecology of A.vesiculosa, and the continuing decline of dystrophic freshwater wetlands globally, indicate that remaining natural populations are highly sensitive and are likely to decline rapidly without adequate management. In addition to wetland management at the catchment scale to mitigate processes such as eutrophication, future conservation and reintroduction initiatives for A.vesiculosa must focus particularly on the identification, maintenance and restoration of optimal shallow humic microsites harbouring loose, open assemblages of emergent and floating macrophytes.

J	Durak, T; Holeksa, J				Durak, Tomasz; Holeksa, Jan			Biotic homogenisation and differentiation along a habitat gradient resulting from the ageing of managed beech stands	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding the processes driving biodiversity changes in forest communities helps to better evaluate sustainable forest management methods and their effects on forest ecosystems. This, in turn, is crucial for the appropriate management of protected areas, in particular those covered under the European protection program Natura 2000. Two datasets from the Polish Eastern Carpathians collected in the 1970s and 2000s were compared to analyse the temporal and spatial changes in the species composition of beech forests in a habitat gradient of soil moisture, acidity and fertility. We found that species favouring fertile and alkaline soils, with low ability for vegetative propagation and without a persistent seed bank became less frequent, whilst frequency of good competitors tolerant to lower soil pH and fertility with a persistent seed bank and a capacity for dispersing seeds over long distances increased. Herb layer vegetation on poor and rich soils became less similar in the past 30 years, though two opposite processes occurred. In poor habitats, the biotic differentiation of herb layer vegetation prevailed, whilst biotic homogenisation was more important in fertile habitats. It is suggested that the ageing of the managed beech stands might have contributed to these changes through the accumulation of litter, top soil acidification and the lowering of the concentration of nutrients as well as due to altered disturbance regimes in older stands. The observed relationships between biotic homogenisation/differentiation and the habitat gradient indicate that differences in soil conditions not only shape the spatial pattern of the forest vegetation, but also the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in vegetation composition resulting from the ageing of tree stands. Our results also suggest that in spite of continuous management the studied beech forests have only slightly changed in their specific species composition. Moreover, the ageing of tree stands did not necessarily generate better conditions for the conservation of the species richness of herbaceous plants, at least those species that are considered a measure of naturalness in beech forests.

The core question is whether N. peltata seeds have contributed to the expansion. To address this, we randomly selected three N. peltata stands to investigate the seed bank characteristics of N. peltata in Lake Taihu. Results showed that N. peltata had high seed production, with a maximum seed yield of 1763 seeds per m(2). Density of intact and fragmented seeds decreased rapidly with sediment depth. Few intact or fragmented seeds were distributed at depths greater than 4 cm in the sediment. Spatial distribution of the seed bank indicated that most seeds sank to the sediment within the N. peltata stands, and few seeds took advantage of their floating ability. Seeds recovered from the sediment during April to June had a low germination rate, and no seeds germinated during October to April. Cold exposure treatment increased the germination rate remarkably. No seedlings were found in the field from January 2012 to December 2012, indicating that few seeds were successfully established in the surveyed area. The results suggested that sexual reproduction had little direct contribution to the N. peltata expansion in this large shallow lake.																	2045-2322					AUG 18	2015	5								13261	10.1038/srep13261							WOS:000359661000001	26281712					
J	Esteban, DJ; Hysa, B; Bartow-McKenney, C				Esteban, David J.; Hysa, Bledi; Bartow-McKenney, Casey			Temporal and Spatial Distribution of the Microbial Community of Winogradsky Columns	PLOS ONE												Winogradsky columns are model microbial ecosystems prepared by adding pond sediment to a clear cylinder with additional supplements and incubated with light. Environmental gradients develop within the column creating diverse niches that allow enrichment of specific bacteria. The enrichment culture can be used to study soil and sediment microbial community structure and function. In this study we used a 16S rRNA gene survey to characterize the microbial community dynamics during Winogradsky column development to determine the rate and extent of change from the source sediment community. Over a period of 60 days, the microbial community changed from the founding pond sediment population: Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes increased in relative abundance over time, while most Proteobacteria decreased in relative abundance. A unique, lightdependent surface biofilm community formed by 60 days that was less diverse and dominated by a few highly abundant bacteria. 67-72% of the surface community was comprised of highly enriched taxa that were rare in the source pond sediment, including the Cyanobacteria Anabaena, a member of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, and a member of the Chloroflexi class Anaerolinea. This indicates that rare taxa can become abundant under appropriate environmental conditions and supports the hypothesis that rare taxa serve as a microbial seed bank. We also present preliminary findings that suggest that bacteriophages may be active in the Winogradsky community. The dynamics of certain taxa, most notably the Cyanobacteria, showed a bloom-and-decline pattern, consistent with bacteriophage predation as predicted in the kill-the-winner hypothesis. Time-lapse photography also supported the possibility of bacteriophage activity, revealing a pattern of colony clearance similar to formation of viral plaques. The Winogradsky column, a technique developed early in the history of microbial ecology to enrich soil microbes, may therefore be a useful model system to investigate both microbial and viral ecology.

Managing natural resources for their human values	ECOSPHERE												Species composition and structure are important properties that can influence the extent to which people value a natural element. Hence these two properties can provide a means to directly manage natural elements to meet values-based goals. With this principle in mind, we studied soil seed bank assembly in two wetland vegetation elements recognized for their science/education, opportunity and system benefit values. Because seed banks drive the composition and structure associated with a vegetation element, which in turn influence human value satisfaction, variance partitioning modeling was used to determine which combination of filters best described patterns in the seed bank beta diversity. A combination of abiotic (soil permeability and soil salinity) and spatial filters with several interactions were the best descriptors of beta diversity, particularly for one vegetation element (wetland 1). Within the remaining vegetation element (wetland 2), a much greater diversity of weed species was observed. Based on the different patterns in diversity, including the links between these patterns, particular filters, and associated processes, we propose that the two vegetation elements, despite their close proximity to each other, are on diverging reassembly pathways. To manage the vegetation elements such that they maintain their values, we suggest hydrological processes are controlled to ensure that soil salinity does not increase dramatically. Dramatic increases in salinity will decrease element value by reducing vegetation diversity and plant community structure. We also stress the importance of understanding and managing processes that effect within-element dispersal and invasion by weeds. Here we demonstrate a general approach to inform the management of natural resources. It is important to identify, understand, and manage the filters (and associated processes) that restrict observable patterns in the properties that influence element value, sensu rules to manage the human valuation of natural elements.

J	Moore, CM; Vander Wall, SB				Moore, Christopher M.; Vander Wall, Stephen B.			Scatter-hoarding rodents disperse seeds to safe sites in a fire-prone ecosystem	PLANT ECOLOGY												Fire can potentially decimate soil seed banks, even for species that are abundant in fire-prone areas. Many plants, like the widespread and dominant members of the genus Arctostaphylos in the fire-prone California Floristic Province, have seeds that (i) have no clear adaptions for dispersal and (ii) experience lethal fire temperatures if present on or near the soil surface. In this study, we aim to resolve these juxtaposed observations by mechanistically determining how one species, Arctostaphylos patula, is dispersed. To distinguish among dispersal modalities and determine the seed shadow, deposition patterns, and the conditions under which seeds germinate, we employed full-shrub exclosure treatments to monitor fruit removal, used a mark-relocation technique by radioactively labeling seeds, identified dispersers using motion-sensor cameras, and surveyed seedlings following fire to relate natural germination patterns to measured patterns from our experiment. Seed removal from exclosure treatments that allowed rodents access to shrubs was higher than those that prevented rodent access to shrubs, and cameras at radioactively labeled-seed stations failed to detect the presence of any other disperser; thus implicating rodents as the primary disperser of A. patula seeds. This evidence is corroborated by our finding from tracking radioactively labeled seeds that the depth at which rodents bury seeds completely overlaps with the depth from which we observed seedlings germinate following two fire events. Our study extends the boundary of what is understood as a scatter-hoarding seed dispersal syndrome and identifies a mechanism that allows populations of Arctostaphylos to exist in spite of recurrent fires that can be lethal to seeds and hazardous to plant populations.

J	Basto, S; Thompson, K; Rees, M				Basto, Sofia; Thompson, Ken; Rees, Mark			The effect of soil pH on persistence of seeds of grassland species in soil	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil pH is one of the main factors determining grassland plant community composition. However, its effects on seed persistence are not well understood, and it is not clear whether soil pH influences seed persistence, either directly or indirectly through microbial pathogens. This study examined the soil seed bank along a natural pH gradient from acidic to calcareous grassland in the Peak District National Park, UK. In addition, a seed burial experiment was performed using three species and including a fungicide treatment. Seeds of a calcicole species (Scabiosa columbaria), a calcifuge (Hypericum pulchrum) and a third species growing over a wide range of soil pH (Campanula rotundifolia) were buried, and seed germination, viability and damage (both physical and fungal) were recorded. Increasing soil pH was correlated with decreased total and grass seed abundance in the seed bank, and with a decline in the probability that H. pulchrum seeds persisted, mainly due to physical damage. In soils with pH higher than 5.6, fungicide increased seed persistence of all three species. Viability of intact, undamaged seeds and germination were not affected by soil pH. Decreasing soil pH was correlated with an increased proportion of persistent seeds. Results suggest that acid soils are associated with increased seed persistence, the size and longevity of grassland seed banks decrease as soil pH increases, and that pH influences seed persistence by an indirect effect mediated by microbial pathogens, while germination is not influenced by pH.

The non-native plant Rosa multiflora expresses shade avoidance traits under low light availability	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Shade tolerance is a key trait promoting invasive plant performance in forest interiors. Rosa multiflora is a problematic invasive shrub in the northeastern United States, occurring in edge habitats and encroaching into forests. Our objective was to evaluate the shade tolerance of R. multiflora to assess how ecophysiological traits may facilitate its spread into forest interiors. METHODS: In the field, we documented shrub and seed bank density, fecundity, phenology, and seasonal photosynthetic rates of R. multiflora in contrasting light environments. In the greenhouse, we exposed seedlings to simulated canopy treatments by altering spectral quantity and quality, mimicking habitats ranging from open fields to forest interiors. KEY RESULTS: In the field, shrub density and fecundity of R. multiflora sharply increased with light availability. However, no differences were observed between forest edge and interior seed banks. Rosa multiflora initiated leaf growth earlier and retained leaves longer than canopy vegetation and tended to have higher photosynthetic rates in spring and fall. In the greenhouse, plants displayed shade-avoidance traits, decreasing relative growth rate and reducing branching, while increasing elongation and showing no change in light response curve parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In deciduous forest understories, R. multiflora appears to make use of a lengthened growing season in spring and fall, and therefore, substantial growth and spread through intact forests appears dependent on canopy gaps. Management should focus on reducing edge populations to reduce spread into the interior and on monitoring newly created canopy gaps.																	0002-9122	1537-2197				AUG	2015	102	8					1323	1331		10.3732/ajb.1500115							WOS:000360208700011	26290555

Vegetative growth is a colonization strategy especially important in regularly disturbed grasslands. In a salt marsh on the Baltic coast of Germany, we studied (i) the role of seedling recruitment and vegetative growth in recolonization of gaps, (ii) if gaps are necessary for seedling recruitment and (iii) whether gaps contribute to species diversity and composition of the salt marsh. We carried out a two-factorial field experiment during two years. We created 48 gaps of 0.04 m(2) in size in autumn 2006. We eliminated the seed bank by sterilization and prevented vegetative growth into these gaps with dense meshes. We used a full-factorial design with four treatments: (1) seed bank and vegetative growth eliminated, (2) seed bank eliminated and vegetative growth intact, (3) seed bank intact and vegetative growth eliminated, (4) both intact. Seedlings and ramets were counted in these gaps in summers 2007 and 2008. In the established vegetation we counted the dicot seedlings in 12 control plots without manipulation. Both seed bank and vegetative growth contributed to the recolonization of the gaps. Nevertheless, seedling establishment was limited due to flooding of the site for six weeks in summer 2007. Vegetative growth was more successful in recolonizing the gaps. No increase in species richness occurred due to gaps in this salt marsh. Interestingly, more dicot seedlings emerged in the undisturbed control plots than in the gaps with intact seed bank. Vegetation gaps, thus, do not appear to be necessary for establishment of dicots in Baltic salt marshes. Nevertheless, some dicot species profit from gaps. We assume that the erect structure of the vegetation dominated by the evergreen plants Juncus gerardii, Triglochin maritimum and Plantago maritima facilitates germination in the undisturbed vegetation.

Effects of heat on the germination of sclerophyllous forest species in the highlands of Madagascar	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The effects of fire on germination have been extensively studied in many ecosystems. Several studies have shown that plant species in ecosystems frequently exposed to fire can survive through two main mechanisms: vegetative regeneration (re-sprouts) and recruitment of new individuals from a fire-resistant seed bank. In Africa, an increase in temperature can break seed dormancy and stimulate germination of some herbaceous and woody species. In Madagascar, the once widespread highland ecosystems dominated by woody species are now highly fragmented and dominated by anthropic grasslands and fields, with a significantly reduced area occupied by sclerophyllous forests referred to as tapia woodlands'. Six species of this endemic vegetation type were studied: Abrahamia ibityensis (Anacardiaceae), Aphloia theiformis (Aphloiaceae), Carissa edulis (Apocynaceae), Pentachlaena latifolia (Sarcolaenaceae), Uapaca bojeri (Phyllanthaceae) and Vaccinium secundiflorum (Ericaceae). Germination tests were conducted (i) by soaking seeds in water for 24h (imbibition) or (ii) by exposing the seeds to dry heat. Four different temperatures (40, 60, 80 and 120 degrees C) were applied, and seeds were exposed for 10, 30, 60 and 90min. To simulate hotter faster-burning fires, two higher temperatures (100 and 120 degrees C) were also used by exposing seeds to dry heat for 5min. The results did not reveal any significant effect of 24-h water imbibition on germination. For most species, germination decreased with increasing temperature of treatment using dry heat. Uapaca bojeri did not germinate under any treatment. Further studies on the biological and ecological characteristics of tapia woodland species in response to fire are needed to help guide conservation, management and restoration activities focusing on this endemic vegetation type.

J	Leprince, O; Buitink, J				Leprince, Olivier; Buitink, Julia			Introduction to desiccation biology: from old borders to new frontiers	PLANTA												Main conclusion A special issue reviews the recent progress made in our understanding of desiccation tolerance across various plant and animal kingdoms. It has been known for a long time that seeds can survive near absolute protoplasmic dehydration through air drying and complete germination upon rehydration because of their desiccation tolerance. This property is present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes across all life kingdoms. These dry organisms suspend their metabolism when dry, are extremely tolerant to acute environmental stresses and are relatively stable during long periods of desiccation. Studies aiming at understanding the mechanisms of survival in the dry state have emerged during the past 40 years, moving from in vitro to genomic models and comparative genomics, and from a view that tolerance is an all-or-nothing phenomenon to a quantitative trait. With the prospect of global climate change, understanding the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance appears to be a promising avenue as a prelude to engineering crops for improved drought tolerance. Understanding desiccation is also useful for seed banks that rely on dehydration tolerance to preserve plant genetic resources in the form of these propagules. Articles in this special issue explore the recent progress in our understanding of desiccation tolerance, including the evolutionary mechanisms that have been adopted across various plant (algae, lichens, seeds, resurrection plants) and animal model systems (Caenorhabditis elegans, brine shrimp). We propose that the term desiccation biology defines the discipline dedicated to understand the desiccation tolerance in living organisms as well as the limits and time constraints thereof.

Priming can be also valuable to seed bank operators who need improved protocols of ex situ conservation of germplasm collections (crop and native species). Depending on plant species, seed morphology and physiology, different priming treatments can be applied, all of them triggering the so-called 'pre-germinative metabolism'. This physiological process takes place during early seed imbibition and includes the seed repair response (activation of DNA repair pathways and antioxidant mechanisms), essential to preserve genome integrity, ensuring proper germination and seedling development. The review provides an overview of priming technology, describing the range of physical-chemical and biological treatments currently available. Optimised priming protocols can be designed using the 'hydrotime concept' analysis which provides the theoretical bases for assessing the relationship between water potential and germination rate. Despite the efforts so far reported to further improve seed priming, novel ideas and cutting-edge investigations need to be brought into this technological sector of agri-seed industry. Multidisciplinary translational research combining digital, bioinformatic and molecular tools will significantly contribute to expand the range of priming applications to other relevant commercial sectors, e.g. the native seed market.

J	Parker, VT				Parker, V. Thomas			Dispersal Mutualism Incorporated into Large-Scale, Infrequent Disturbances	PLOS ONE												Because of their influence on succession and other community interactions, large-scale, infrequent natural disturbances also should play a major role in mutualistic interactions. Using field data and experiments, I test whether mutualisms have been incorporated into large-scale wildfire by whether the outcomes of a mutualism depend on disturbance. In this study a seed dispersal mutualism is shown to depend on infrequent, large-scale disturbances. A dominant shrubland plant (Arctostaphylos species) produces seeds that make up a persistent soil seed bank and requires fire to germinate. In post-fire stands, I show that seedlings emerging from rodent caches dominate sites experiencing higher fire intensity. Field experiments show that rodents (Perimyscus califomicus, P. boylii) do cache Arctostaphylos fruit and bury most seed caches to a sufficient depth to survive a killing heat pulse that a fire might drive into the soil. While the rodent dispersal and caching behavior itself has not changed compared to other habitats, the environmental transformation caused by wildfire converts the caching burial of seed from a dispersal process to a plant fire adaptive trait, and provides the context for stimulating subsequent life history evolution in the plant host.																	1932-6203					JUL 7	2015	10	7							e0132625	10.1371/journal.pone.0132625							WOS:000358158900051	26151560

The proportion of young plants arising from seedlings was low, with the majority of species reproducing clonally. The establishment of seedlings of forbs in SD meadows led to species-rich, forb-dominant vegetation in these areas.Conclusions: LD and MD meadows appear to be able to be managed by reduced grazing for the restoration of grass- and sedge-dominated pastures. In contrast, restoration of SD meadows will require additional intervention, such as of seeding and weed eradication.

J	Espeland, EK; Kilian, R				Espeland, Erin K.; Kilian, Robert			Low-Dose Glyphosate Does Not Control Annual Bromes in the Northern Great Plains	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Annual bromes (downy brome and Japanese brome) have been shown to decrease perennial grass forage production and alter ecosystem functions in northern Great Plains rangelands. Large-scale chemical control might be a method for increasing rangeland forage production. Although fall application has been shown to be the most effective and least likely to impact co-occurring native species, spring germination of downy brome may reduce the efficacy of fall-only herbicide application. We assessed the impact of a low glyphosate dose rate (210 g ha (-1)) applied to rangelands in fall or in fall and spring on nontarget species and on annual brome abundance at two sites in eastern Montana over 2 yr. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) nontarget effects are greater with spring herbicide application, (2) fall and spring herbicide application are necessary for effective downy brome control, and (3) fall herbicide application is sufficient to control Japanese brome. Few nontarget effects occurred; two dicotyledonous species exhibited small increases in response to herbicide. We found that that a single fall application reduced downy brome cover and seed bank density, but after the second fall application in the following year, downy brome did not continue to show a response to herbicide. After 2 yr of fall herbicide application, Japanese brome had denser seed banks in plots where herbicide had been applied. Blanket glyphosate application on rangelands is an unreliable method for controlling annual brome invasions in the northern Great Plains.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JUL-SEP	2015	8	3					334	340		10.1614/IPSM-D-15-00004.1							WOS:000362129200010

The role of resource limitation in restoration of sagebrush ecosystems dominated by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)	ECOSPHERE												Success of invasive annual grasses is often linked to increases in resources, and restoration ecologists have suggested that decreasing nitrogen (N) availability and restoring more conservative N cycles with lower N turnover should decrease the competitive advantage of these invaders and facilitate establishment of native perennials. We developed a multivariate conceptual model of the likely effects of environmental factors (precipitation and temperature) and potential management treatments (repeated burning, litter manipulation, and seeding an annual competitor) on soil N availability and success of cheatgrass, the most widespread invader in the western United States. We examined effects of the treatments in a five year field study in a cold desert shrubland. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to examine differences among treatments over time, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate component hypotheses of the conceptual model. We hypothesized that burning would result in a pulse in soil available N due to heat-induced soil organic matter denaturation, but that subsequent fires would volatilize soil and biomass N resulting in progressive N deficiency. However, soil available N in burned plots was never lower than pre-burn levels, likely because burn temperatures were too cool to volatilize N from soils or aboveground biomass. Repeated burning decreased litter biomass, but there were generally no differences in soil available N between litter intact and litter removed plots. Litter removal had a negative effect on cheatgrass success likely due to effects on seed entrapment and plant establishment rather than N mineralization. Plots seeded with wheat generally had the lowest cheatgrass success, but available N was similar to other treatments, and decreased cheatgrass success was likely due to competition for other soil nutrients or water and reduced litter. In this semi-arid shrubland, long-term trends in available soil N and cheatgrass success were most strongly associated with precipitation and winter minimum temperatures. Treatments did not result in longer-term decreases in soil N, but indicated that integrated restoration approaches that reduce litter and seed banks and increase competitive interactions may be effective at reducing cheatgrass success and facilitating establishment of natives.																	2150-8925					JUL	2015	6	7							107	10.1890/ES14-00285.1							WOS:000358991500001

Seed Banks in Savanna, Forest Fragments, and Continuous Forest Edges Differ in a Tropical Dry Forest in Madagascar	BIOTROPICA												Rapid deforestation has fragmented habitat across the landscape of Madagascar. To determine the effect of fragmentation on seed banks and the potential for forest regeneration, we sampled seed viability, density and diversity in 40 plots of 1m(2) in three habitat types: forest fragments, the near edge of continuous forest, and deforested savanna in a highly fragmented dry deciduous forest landscape in northwestern Madagascar. While seed species diversity was not different between forest fragments and continuous forest edge, the number of animal-dispersed seeds was significantly higher in forest fragments than in continuous forest edge, and this pattern was driven by a single, small-seeded species. In the savanna, seeds were absent from all but three of the 40 plots, indicating that regeneration potential is low in these areas. Several pre- and post-dispersal biotic and abiotic factors, including variation in the seed predator communities and edge effects could explain these findings. Understanding the extent to which seed dispersal and seed banks influence the regeneration potential of fragmented landscapes is critical as these fragments are the potential sources of forest expansion and re-connectivity.

Notre objectif etait d'etablir l'effet de cette fragmentation sur les banques de semences, et la possibilite de regeneration forestier. Nos resultats demontrent, bien que la diversite des especes de semences ne varie pas entre les fragments de foret et les bords rapproches de foret ininterrompue, que la quantite de graines dispersees par les animaux est considerablement plus elevee dans le premier type d'habitat que dans la deuxieme, et que cet effet est grace a une seule espece [a petites graines]. Dans la savane deboisee, une absence complete de graines a ete notee dans tous les 40 parcelles, a part trois.

Le potentiel de regeneration en paysages fragmentes repose sur une meilleure comprehension de la nature et l'etendue des changements dans la dispersion des graines, ainsi que les resultantes banques de semences.

J	Hoban, S; Strand, A				Hoban, Sean; Strand, Allan			Ex situ seed collections will benefit from considering spatial sampling design and species' reproductive biology	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Collecting seed from natural plant populations is a key tool for conservation, ecological restoration, assisted migration, studying plant mating systems, and crop breeding. Many collections rely on simple, broadly-applied rules-of-thumb for minimum sample sizes, regardless of species' natural history, and are likely inadequate for obtaining sufficient genetic representation. There is a current paucity of information about how various logistical and biological factors influence seed sampling outcomes. Here we use simulated and empirical data to, for the first time, quantitatively evaluate the degree to which collection effectiveness is influenced by spatial arrangement, sampling intensity, and species' reproductive biology. We clearly and quantitatively demonstrate that collections with spatially limited or biased sampling arrangements, or collections from species with high selfing or low dispersal, will need substantially more samples than are commonly recommended, or else will fail to reach the targeted genetic diversity. We also show that the marginal gain from sampling additional maternal plants will nearly always exceed that of additional seeds. Lastly we show that random sampling outperforms "easy access" and "transect" sampling by 70% and 30%, respectively. Overall, we conclude that collection guidelines tailored to particular taxa will help facilitate optimal sampling design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

George			Litter Reduction by Prescribed Burning Can Extend Downy Brome Control	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) is a highly successful invasive species primarily because it fills an open niche in native plant communities. It also produces large amounts of litter over time. We hypothesized that removing accumulated litter with a prescribed burn before applying herbicides would improve herbicide efficacy, extending the duration of control. In January 2012, two downy brome-infested sites were burned. In March 2012, postemergent applications of glyphosate, imazapic, and tebuthiuron were made in a split-plot design. Above-ground biomass was collected at 6, 18, and 27 months after treatment (MAT) to evaluate treatment effects. In nonburned areas, all herbicide treatments were similar to the control 27 MAT; however, burning combined with imazapic or tebuthiuron reduced downy brome biomass 27 MAT by 81% +/- 4.6 SE and 84% +/- 19.3 SE, respectively. Remnant species responded positively to burning and herbicide treatments. Native cool-season grass biomass increased after burning whereas native warm-season grass biomass increased following tebuthiuron treatments. The impact of litter on imazapic and tebuthiuron availability was also evaluated. Herbicide interception increased in a linear relationship with increasing litter. For every 50 g . m(-2) increase in litter there was a 7% increase in the amount of herbicide intercepted, meaning that 75% of the applied herbicide was intercepted by 360 g . m(-2) of litter. A simulated rainfall event of 5 mm, 7 days after application, removed a significant amount of herbicide. This indicates that in sites with surface litter, timely precipitation could be critical for herbicide efficacy; however, when burning was used to remove litter and was followed by herbicides with residual soil activity, downy brome control was extended. Due to downy brome's relatively short seed viability in the soil, extending herbicide efficacy to several years could help to reduce the soil seed bank. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

Intra-population level variation in thresholds for physical dormancy-breaking temperature	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Intra-population variation in seed dormancy is an advantage for population persistence in unpredictable environments. The important role played by physically dormant species in these habitats makes understanding the level of variation in their dormancy a key ecological question. Heat produced in the soil is the major dormancy-breaking stimulus and, in fire prone ecosystems, soil temperatures generated by fire may vary spatially and over time. While many studies have investigated variation in initial dormancy, a measure that is of little value in fire-prone ecosystems, where initial dormancy levels are uniformly high, intra-population variation in dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds has never been quantified. This study predicted that species would display variation in dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds within populations, and investigated whether this variation occurred between individual plants from the same maternal environment. Methods The intra-population variation in dormancy-breaking thresholds of five common physically dormant shrub species (family Fabaceae) from fire-prone vegetation in south-eastern Australia was assessed using heat treatments and germination trials. Replicate batches of seeds from each of four maternal plants of Dillwynia floribunda, Viminaria juncea, Bossiaea heterophylla, Aotus ericoides andAcacia linifolia were treated at 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 A degrees C. Key Results Dormancy-breaking response to heat treatments varied significantly among individual plants for all species, with some individuals able to germinate after heating at low temperatures and others restricting germination to temperatures that only occur as a result of high-severity fires. Germination rate varied among individuals of three species. Conclusions Variation detected among individuals that were in close proximity to each other indicates that strong differences in dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds occur throughout the broader population. Differences found at the individual plant level could contribute to subsequent variation within the seed bank, providing a bet-hedging strategy, and represent a mechanism for increasing the probability of population persistence in the face of fire regime variability.

Annual dormancy cycles in buried seeds of shrub species: germination ecology of Sideritis serrata (Labiatae)	PLANT BIOLOGY												The germination ecology of Sideritis serrata was investigated in order to improve ex-situ propagation techniques and management of their habitat. Specifically, we analysed: (i) influence of temperature, light conditions and seed age on germination patterns; (ii) phenology of germination; (iii) germinative response of buried seeds to seasonal temperature changes; (iv) temperature requirements for induction and breaking of secondary dormancy; (v) ability to form persistent soil seed banks; and (vi) seed bank dynamics. Freshly matured seeds showed conditional physiological dormancy, germinating at low and cool temperatures but not at high ones (28/14 and 32/18 degrees C). Germination ability increased with time of dry storage, suggesting the existence of non-deep physiological dormancy. Under unheated shade-house conditions, germination was concentrated in the first autumn. S.serrata seeds buried and exposed to natural seasonal temperature variations in the shade-house, exhibited an annual conditional dormancy/non-dormancy cycle, coming out of conditional dormancy in summer and re-entering it in winter. Non-dormant seeds were clearly induced into dormancy when stratified at 5 or 15/4 degrees C for 8weeks. Dormant seeds, stratified at 28/14 or 32/18 degrees C for 16weeks, became non-dormant if they were subsequently incubated over a temperature range from 15/4 to 32/18 degrees C. S.serrata is able to form small persistent soil seed banks. The maximum seed life span in the soil was 4years, decreasing with burial depth. This is the second report of an annual conditional dormancy/non-dormancy cycle in seeds of shrub species.

J	Casanova, MT				Casanova, Michelle T.			The seed bank as a mechanism for resilience and connectivity in a seasonal unregulated river	AQUATIC BOTANY												The seed bank of a seasonally flowing river was sampled to assess ecosystem resilience and evidence of connectivity. Seed banks were sampled from 'Floodplain', 'Top of Bank' and 'In Channel' hydrogeomorphic areas in seven reaches of the Wannon River, and the distribution of species and water plant functional groups (WPFGs) among these sites was assessed. The seed bank material was exposed to two treatments (damp and flooded) to stimulate germination of terrestrial (Tdr Tda), flooding-tolerant (ATe, ATI, ARp, ATw) and flooding-dependent (ARf, Se, Sr, Sk) species. There was a high degree of similarity among seed banks from all parts of the river, and all hydrogeomorphic areas. Few species were restricted to any one area (i.e., 'In Channel', 'Top of Bank', 'Floodplain') or any one reach of the river. This indicates that the wetland areas of the Wannon River have a high degree of longitudinal and lateral connectivity, and the riparian zone retains the capacity to provide resources to wetland fauna, even with large variation in the natural flow regime and long-term agricultural land-use. Provided the seed bank remains intact, the perennial vegetation is allowed to regenerate, and a natural flow regime is maintained, seasonal rivers like the Wannon are likely to be resilient to the consequences of climate change, despite the surrounding agricultural land-use and the influx of saline ground-water.

Nevertheless, in recent years, several alien plant species has been found in Antarctica with negative effects on the native flora. In this study, we show a recolonization record of the most widespread plant invader in Antarctica (Poa annua) and the risk of a potential spreading in a highly visited site on the Antarctic Peninsula. Overall, two new P. annua individuals were recorded, where four specimens were previously reported and removed in 2010, suggesting that either a propagule load is continuous, or that a seed bank prevailed in the site. On the other hand, the spreading modeling suggests that the probability to colonize and spreading of P. annua increases notoriously with the possibility of dispersion of propagules, with consequent risk of displacement for the native flora. Biological invasions are a major threat to the integrity of native biodiversity in all biomes, and they have the potential to change irreversibly Antarctica's fragile ecosystems.

Evaluating restoration potential of transferred topsoil	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsTranslocation of topsoil and its seed bank for ecological restoration is increasingly popular. How representative is the soil seed bank of the extant vegetation at the source site? What influence does the transfer process have on germinant density, species and plant functional type composition? Does smoke and heat treatment of transferred topsoil enhance germination and potential for restoration success? LocationBanksia woodland of the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia. MethodsTo assess the efficacy of topsoil transfer for return of native plant species, we measured topsoil seed bank characterisitcs in situ proir to vegetation clearing, and immediately after transfer of the topsoil to an adjacent, degraded mediterranean-type woodland in southwest Australia. Glasshouse germination of topsoil samples from 24 pre- and 24 post-transfer plots was used to quantify the effects of transfer and soil depth on germinant density, species richness, plant functional types and seed bank similarity to in situ vegetation. Application of germination cues (heat+smoke) was used to explore the impact of topsoil transfer on seed germination and emergence. ResultsTopsoil transfer significantly reduced germinant densities (pre-transfer 1692-4239germinantsm(-2), post-transfer 795-1016germinantsm(-2); t=6.7, P<0.001) and shifted community structure (MRPP: A=0.13, P<0.001), including a reduction of woody species density by 81%. For the majority of functional types, heat and smoke failed to stimulate additional germination post-transfer, suggesting soil transfer simulated the effect of fire-related germination cues. ConclusionAlthough topsoil transfer translocated many viable native seeds, potential restoration success was hindered by reduced germinant densities. This was mostly attributable to a dilution effect associated with mixing of transferred topsoil, so that many seeds were buried too deep to emerge. However, total reductions were greater than expected based on dilution alone, suggesting some seed mortality during the transfer process. Transfer shifted composition towards dominance by annual species, suggesting the need for topsoil transfer to be supplemented by other restoration techniques.

These uses impose ecological disturbances affecting forest regeneration potential after field abandonment. Finding ways to identify those agricultural land uses limiting forest regeneration is a critical issue for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. Here, we developed a fast and inexpensive index, useful for quantifying ecological disturbance regimes associated with agricultural land uses, and tested its power to predict forest regeneration potential. LocationMunicipality of Marques de Comillas, southeast Mexico. MethodsInterviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned fields representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m(2) plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10-100m in height were counted, identified and measured in four 1-m(2) subplots, at the time of field abandonment and 2yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantified at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones. ResultsTwo years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deficit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass). ConclusionsEDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modified landscapes.

Is species richness higher in restored pastures adjacent to an intact semi-natural pasture than in restored pastures adjacent to arable land? Does community similarity between a restored and an adjacent intact pasture decrease with distance from the border between the two pastures? Do differences in species richness and community similarity decrease over time? LocationAgricultural landscapes in south-central Sweden. MethodsThe plant community in previously abandoned but now restored semi-natural pastures was surveyed along a distance gradient from the border between the restored pastures and adjacent fields towards the centre of the pastures. The restored pastures were located adjacent to either a crop field (N=8) or a continuously grazed pasture (N=6), and differed in time since restoration (1-13yr). ResultsThe total species richness was higher in pastures adjoining continuously grazed pastures compared to crop fields. Richness of both total and specialist species increased with time since restoration. Irrespective of adjacent land use, richness of specialist species decreased with increasing distance from the edge, an effect that became weaker with increasing time since restoration. The similarity in species composition compared to that in adjacent continuously grazed pasture also decreased towards the centre of the restored pasture. ConclusionsOur results suggest that restoration of biodiversity in semi-natural pastures benefits from adjacent pastures that can act as source habitats. The most likely mechanism is step-wise short-distance dispersal, but also other processes, such as more long-distance dispersal, seed bank dynamics and historical legacies are probably involved. To best succeed in habitat restoration in fragmented landscapes, the spatial location of source populations must be considered.

Species ranges are partially limited by their tolerances to extrinsic environmental conditions such as climate and habitat. However, they are also determined by the capacity of species to disperse, establish new populations and proliferate, which are in turn dependent on species intrinsic life-history traits. So far, the contribution of intrinsic factors driving species distributions has been inconclusive, largely because intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been examined simultaneously in a satisfactory way. We investigate how geographical ranges of plants are determined by both extrinsic environmental factors and species intrinsic life-history traits. LocationEurope. MethodsWe compiled a database on plant geographical ranges, environmental tolerances and life-history traits that constitutes the largest dataset analysed to date (1276 species). We used generalized linear modelling to test if range size and range filling (the proportion of climatically suitable area a species occupies) are affected by dispersal distance, habitat breadth and 10 life-history traits related to establishment and proliferation. ResultsThe species characteristics that were most linked to range limitations of European plant species were dispersal potential, seed bank persistence and habitat breadth (which together explained 30% of deviance in range filling and range size). Specific leaf area, which has been linked to establishment ability, made a smaller contribution to native range limitations. Main conclusionsOur results can be used to improve estimates of extinction vulnerability under climate change. Species with high dispersal capacity, that can maintain viable seed banks for several years and that can live in an intermediate number of habitats have the fewest non-climatic limitations on their ranges, and are most likely to shift their geographical ranges under climate change. We suggest that climate-change risk assessments should not focus exclusively on dispersal capacity.

We investigated the role of these parental materials for the development of functional microbial guilds using the example of alkane-degrading bacteria harbouring the alkane monooxygenase gene (alkB) in artificial mixtures composed of different minerals and charcoal, sterile manure and a microbial inoculum extracted froman agricultural soil. We followed changes in abundance and community structure of alkane-degrading microbial communities after 3 and 12 months of soil maturation and in response to a subsequent 2-week plant litter addition. During maturation we observed an overall increasing divergence in community composition. The impact of metal oxides on alkane-degrading community structure increased during soil maturation, whereas the charcoal impact decreased from 3 to 12 months. Among the clay minerals illite influenced the community structure of alkB-harbouring bacteria significantly, but not montmorillonite. The litter application induced strong community shifts in soils, maturated for 12 months, towards functional guilds typical for younger maturation stages pointing to a resilience of the alkane-degradation function potentially fostered by an extant 'seed bank'.

Testing reticulate versus coalescent origins of Erica lusitanica using a species phylogeny of the northern heathers (Ericeae, Ericaceae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Whilst most of the immense species richness of heathers (Calluna, Daboecia and Erica: Ericeae; Ericaceae) is endemic to Africa, particularly the Cape Floristic Region, the oldest lineages are found in the Northern Hemisphere. We present phylogenetic hypotheses for the major clades of Ericeae represented by multiple accessions of all northern Erica species and placeholder taxa for the large nested African/Madagascan clade. We identified consistent, strongly supported conflict between gene trees inferred from ITS and chloroplast DNA sequences with regard to the position of Erica lusitanica. We used coalescent simulations to test whether this conflict could be explained by coalescent stochasticity, as opposed to reticulation (e.g. hybridisation), given estimates of clade ages, generation time and effective population sizes (Ne). A standard approach, comparing overall differences between real and simulated trees, could not clearly reject coalescence. However, additional simulations showed that at the (higher) Ne necessary to explain conflict in E. lusitanica, further topological conflict would also be expected. Ancient hybridisation between ancestors of northern species is therefore a plausible scenario to explain the origin of E. lusitanica, and its morphological similarities to E. arborea. Assuming either process influences the results of species tree and further evolutionary inference. The coalescence scenario is equivocal with regard the standing hypothesis of stepping stone dispersal of Erica from Europe into Africa; whereas reticulate evolution in E. lusitanica would imply that the colonisation of Tropical East Africa by E. arborea instead occurred independently of dispersals within the rest of the African/Madagascan clade.

Because of phytosanitary restrictions to exports, pineapple producers must use a zero tolerance level for this species. An understanding of itchgrass seedling emergence would help producers to better time POST control. The objective of the present study was to characterize itchgrass seedling emergence patterns and develop a predictive model. Multiple field experiments were conducted in four agricultural fields in Costa Rica between 2010 and 2011 for a total of 9 site-years. Itchgrass consistently showed a biphasic emergence pattern, with a first emergence phase that was faster and more consistent across site-years than the second one. Weibull + logistic models based on chronological time (R-adj(2) = 0.92) and thermal time with T-base = 20 C (R-adj(2) = 0.92) provided the best fit for the combined emergence data for two experimental locations in 2010. Both models predicted itchgrass seedling emergence adequately for most site-years, but the thermal-time model was more accurate (R-adj(2) = 0.64 to 0.86) than the chronological model (R-adj(2) = 0.31 to 0.74), especially when temperatures were high. Both models showed high accuracy in the first emergence phase but tended to underestimate emergence rate during the second phase. The models predicted 50% emergence at 14 d or 80 growing degree days and the stabilization of the first emergence phase at approximately 25 d or 200 growing degree days. Thus, these models can be used to properly time itchgrass POST control. More research is needed to understand the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the variability of the second emergence phase.

We apply a spatially structured community model to predict how species diversity and intraspecific aggregation shape gap patterns emerging after climatic events, based on species-specific mortality responses. In multispecies communities, average gap size and gap-size diversity increased rapidly with increasing mean mortality once a mortality threshold was exceeded, greatly promoting gap recolonization opportunity. This result was observed at all levels of species richness. Increasing interspecific difference likewise enhanced these metrics, which may promote not only diversity maintenance but also community invasibility, since more diverse niches for both local and exotic species are provided. The richness effects on gap size and gap-size diversity were positive, but only expressed when species were sufficiently different. Surprisingly, while intraspecific clumping strongly promoted gapsize diversity, it hardly influenced average gap size. Species evenness generally reduced gap metrics induced by climatic events, so the typical assumption of maximum evenness in many experiments and models may underestimate community diversity and invasibility. Overall, understanding the factors driving gap formation in spatially structured assemblages can help predict community secondary succession after climatic events.

Although previous studies have highlighted the effect of frugivore gut passage on fresh seed germinability, no study has investigated the effect on seed storage after frugivore gut passage. We used the endangered plant, Euryodendron excelsum, to determine the combined effects of frugivore gut passage and storage conditions on the germination percentage and rate of seeds. In particular, three treatments that included storage periods, storage methods, and seed types were designed in the experiment. We hypothesized that seeds that passed through the gut will exhibit enhanced germination capacity and rate during storage. Results showed that the final germination percentage decreased in seeds that passed through the gut, whereas the germination rate increased during seed storage. Germination decreased in most types of seeds under both dry and wet storage after 6 months compared with storage after 1 and 3 months. The results suggest that after frugivore gut passage, E. excelsum seeds cannot form persistent soil seed bank in the field, and were not suitable for species germplasm storage. These finding underscore that seeds that passed through frugivore gut have long-term impact on their viability and germination performance.																	2045-2322					JUN 25	2015	5								11615	10.1038/srep11615							WOS:000356856200001	26109456

Self-reseeding annual legumes for cover cropping in rainfed managed olive orchards	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Given the environmental impact of nitrogen (N)-fertilizer manufacture and use, the sustainable management of agro-systems should be sought by growing N-fixing legumes. In this work, eleven self-reseeding annual legumes were grown in pure stands as mulching cover crops in a rainfed olive orchard managed without grazing animals. Dry matter yield. N content in above-ground biomass, groundcover percentage and persistence of the sown species were assessed during four growing seasons. All covers provided enough soil protection over the year, with living plants during the autumn/winter period and a mulch of dead residues during the summer. The legumes overcame a false break observed in the third year recovering the dominance of the covers in the fourth growing season. This means that the seed bank established in previous seasons ensured the persistence of the sown legume even when a gap in seed production occurred. The early-maturing cultivars produced less biomass and fixed less N (approx. 50 kg N/ha/yr present in the above-around biomass) than the late-maturing ones, but would compete less for water since the growing cycle finished earlier in the spring. They seem best suited to being grown in dry farmed olive orchards with low N demand in drought prone regions.

Regenerative potential and functional composition of soil seed banks in remnant evergreen broad-leaved forests under urbanization in South China	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks can act as an important source in forest regeneration, and the information on the seed bank composition is vital for determining the resilience of plant communities under severe environments such as urban settings. In this study, we examined the seed bank density and functional composition, and their relationships with aboveground vegetation in three remnant evergreen broad-leaved forests, i.e., PuGang (PG), LuoGang (LG), and DaLingShan (DLS) under urbanization in Guangzhou, South China. In both years of our study (2010-2011), seed density and species richness for overall soil seed banks and each classified life forms (tree, shrub, herb and grass) significantly differed among the forests and were much higher in the PG forest. The prevailing life forms in the seed banks were herbs and grasses, and the proportion of tree species Importance Value index (IV) of the seed banks was low. We did not detect significant difference in the percentage of exotic species seeds in the seed banks among the forests. The proportion of species with animal dispersal mode was much higher in the DLS forest than in the PG and LG forests. The similarity in species composition between standing vegetation and seed banks was low with the lower value in the DLS forest than in PG and LG forest. Our findings suggest that the regeneration potential of the soil seed banks is limited for the remnant forests in urban areas. Therefore, greater proactive and enhanced conservation efforts are thus needed.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				JUN	2015	16	1					86	94		10.1556/168.2015.16.1.10							WOS:000365978200010

REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Seed banks play an important role in the resilience of potential anthropogenic areas and are influenced by seasonal variation. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the forests influences the richness and density of the soil seed bank, but there is a hypothesis that such influence can be changed in anthropogenic areas, where we expect to find lower richness and seed density in relation to the seed bank of mature forests. The richness and seasonal density of seeds in the soil depth of a young caatinga forest, 17 years after an agricultural activity was abandoned, were evaluated and compared with those of a mature forest. The study was conducted at the Instituo Agronomic de Pernambuco - IPA (Estacao Experimental Jose Nilson de Melo), located in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, in an area of tropical dry forest, known locally as "caatinga". The local climate is seasonal, the dry season occurring from September to February and the rainy season concentrated in the remaining months. The average annual rainfall over time (time series of 30 years) is 692mm. In each climatic season (rainy and dry), the seed bank was sampled in 210 20x20cm plots (105 in the leaf litter and 105 at 5cm soil depth). The richness and seed density of the soil samples were evaluated by the method of seedling emergence. The seed bank had 47 species, with a predominance of herbaceous plants. Seasonal variation in richness and seed density in the soil (leaf litter + soil) was not significant, but 42 species of the mature forest were absent from the seed bank of the young forest, despite 17 years of natural regeneration and its proximity to the mature forest. On its own, the soil has greater richness and density of seeds than the leaf litter. The depth of seed deposition in the soil bank of the young forest significantly explained 36% of the species richness and 16% of the seed density, with a significant interaction effect with the climatic season only on species richness, explaining 4% of the variation recorded. The seed density of the young forest (1 277seeds/m(2)) was greater than that the mature forest indicating that the time abandoned had not yet been sufficient for complete recovery of plant diversity and there is no longer any seed limitation of pioneer species for regeneration of the young forest.				de L.

The present study investigated the longevity and germination of the buried seeds of this species in an experimental seed bank. Laboratory germination and viability tests were performed for comparison with field results. Pyrenes (seeds enclosed by the endocarp) were buried in a forest fragment edge in July 2012 (dry season) and exhumed monthly during one year, for the assessment of water content and percentage of germinated and viable seeds. Germination tests were conducted in a Mangelsdorf-type germinator at 30 degrees C under constant light and the viability was assessed by the tetrazolium test. An additional sample of pyrenes was buried to evaluate the percentage of seedling emergence and survival. Climatic and soil moisture data were recorded. In the laboratory, the pyrenes were stored for one year in a temperature-controlled room at 20 degrees C and 75% (+/- 10%) relative air humidity to assess changes in the percentage of germination and viability overtime. In the field, a reduction in seed viability was observed over the study period, with a total loss of viability of non-germinated seeds at seven months after burial. The maximum germination (close to 26%) was observed in the samples that were exhumed between five and seven months after burial. In the field, seedling emergence did not exceed 10% and seedling mortality was not observed. The percentages of germination and of viable seeds decreased both in burial and stored seeds. The stored seeds maintained viability at up to six months, with marked reduction thereafter. After the germination tests (four months) in the laboratory, all of the remaining seeds were nonviable. The ecological, physiological and reproductive characteristics of the species are discussed, and we concluded that S. romanzoffiana seeds have short longevity after imbibition, and low potential for soil seed bank formation.

J	Stevens-Rumann, C; Morgan, P; Hoffman, C				Stevens-Rumann, Camille; Morgan, Penelope; Hoffman, Chad			Bark beetles and wildfires: How does forest recovery change with repeated disturbances in mixed conifer forests?	ECOSPHERE												Increased wildfire activity and recent bark beetle outbreaks in the western United States have increased the potential for interactions between disturbance types to influence forest characteristics. However, the effects of interactions between bark beetle outbreaks and subsequent wildfires on forest succession remain poorly understood. We collected data in dry mixed conifer forests across Idaho and western Montana to test whether vegetation responses differ between sites experiencing single and repeated disturbances. We compared tree seedling density and age, surface fuel loading, and stand structure characteristics in stands that experienced either high severity wildfire, large-scale tree mortality from bark beetles, or stands that experienced high bark beetle mortality followed by severe wildfire within 3-8 years of attack. Tree seedling density was 300-400% higher in gray bark beetle-affected stands than burned sites, but there was no evidence that a beetle and wildfire interaction affected seedling densities. The age distribution of Douglas-fir and grand fir seedlings in stands with repeated disturbances differed from those that only experienced wildfire, suggesting that seed availability varies between these stands. Though both bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires resulted in the death of numerous large trees and surface woody fuel loads 100-200% greater than control sites, the creation of large snags and higher fuel loads across the landscape may have ecological benefits. Compounding effects of bark beetle activity and wildfires were not observed in surface fuel loadings or stand densities. Overall, the effects of high severity wildfire drove post-disturbance fuel complexes and succession whereas the effects of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae and Dendroctonus brevicomis outbreaks before wildfires resulted in minimal post-wildfire differences. We conclude that although seedling age structure is responsive to bark beetle and fire interactions, in terms of fuel complexes and tree densities these disturbances are non-additive and compounding effects on forest trajectory of dry mixed conifer forests of the northern Rockies were not supported.

No previous study has compared the seed biology of closely related disjunct taxa of legumes or of a diaspore-heteromorphic species. Our objective was to compare seed dormancy in two such sister species in the genus Amphicarpaea (Fabaceae). Methods: We investigated the ecology and ecophysiology of aerial and subterranean seeds of the amphicarpic species Amphicarpaea edgeworthii from China and compared the results to those published for its sister species A. bracteata from eastern North America. Key results: The seed coat of aerial seeds of A. edgeworthii is well developed, whereas the seed coat of subterranean seeds is not. Aerial seeds have combinational dormancy (physical dormancy [PY] + physiological dormancy [PD]) broken by scarification followed by cold stratification or by after-ripening and scarification; whereas subterranean seeds have PD broken by cold stratification. Aerial seeds formed a persistent soil seed bank, and subterranean seeds a transient soil seed bank. Aerial seeds of A. bracteata also have PY+PD and subterranean seeds PD. Subterranean seeds of both species are desiccation intolerant. Conclusion: Dormancy in neither aerial nor subterranean seeds of both species has diverged over geological time. Compared to subterranean seeds, aerial seeds of both species dispersed over longer distances. Seed dispersal ability and degree of dormancy of neither species fits the high-risk/low-risk (H-H/L-L) strategy found in many diaspore-dimorphic species. Rather, both species have an H-L/L-H strategy for these two life history traits.

Adaptation in a variable environment: Phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging during egg diapause and hatching in an annual killifish	EVOLUTION												Two ways in which organisms adapt to variable environments are phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging. Theory suggests that bet-hedging is expected to evolve in unpredictable environments for which reliable cues indicative of future conditions (or season length) are lacking. Alternatively, if reliable cues exist indicating future conditions, organisms will be under selection to produce the most appropriate phenotype that is, adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Here, we experimentally test which of these modes of adaptation are at play in killifish that have evolved an annual life cycle. These fish persist in ephemeral pools that completely dry each season through the production of eggs that can remain in developmental arrest, or diapause, buried in the soil, until the following rainy season. Consistent with diversified bet-hedging (a risk spreading strategy), we demonstrate that the eggs of the annual killifish Nothobranchius furzeri exhibit variation at multiple levelswhether or not different stages of diapause are entered, for how long diapause is entered, and the timing of hatchingand this variation persists after controlling for both genetic and environmental sources of variation. However, we show that phenotypic plasticity is also present in that the proportion of eggs that enter diapause is influenced by environmental factors (temperature and light level) that vary seasonally. In nature there is typically a large parameter zone where environmental cues are somewhat correlated with seasonality, but not perfectly so, such that it may be advantageous to have a combination of both bet-hedging and plasticity.					reznick, david/0000-0002-1144-0568												0014-3820	1558-5646				JUN	2015	69	6					1461	1475		10.1111/evo.12669							WOS:000356675400008	25908306					
J	Bart, D; Davenport, T				Bart, David; Davenport, Tara			The influence of legacy impacted seed banks on vegetation recovery in a post-agricultural fen complex	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Agricultural legacies shape soil seed banks, which in turn alter subsequent vegetation recovery. However, the role of legacy-impacted seed banks in shaping wetland-vegetation recovery is not well studied, and hydrologic context may alter impacts of seed bank legacies on extant vegetation. Here we compare seed banks and extant vegetation of four plowed fens to an on-site reference fen to determine (i) if plowing legacies have altered seed banks, (ii) if 13-year post-abandonment vegetation differs from the reference fen, and (iii) whether extant vegetation composition is different than that of seed banks in both reference and plowed fens. The relative abundance of key native graminoid and fen specialist species was greatly reduced in plowed-fen seed banks compared to the reference fen, while weedy/invasive species present in the post-agricultural fens' seed banks were absent from the reference fen. The depletion of normally dominant native graminoids from seed banks was reflected in extant vegetation. However, shallow water tables predicted shifts in extant vegetation from weedy-mesic annuals to areas dominated by either native clonal forbs or Phalaris arundinacea. In general, plowed plant communities had decreases relative abundance of weedy-mesic species and increased relative abundance clonal forbs or clonal-invasive graminoids compared to seed banks. Our results suggest that while depletion of native graminoids from seed banks plays a part in vegetation recovery, the abundance of weedy-mesic species was not reflected in the recovering vegetation in wetter areas.

J	Hudson, AR; Ayre, DJ; Ooi, MKJ				Hudson, Alice R.; Ayre, David J.; Ooi, Mark K. J.			Physical dormancy in a changing climate	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Species with physically dormant (PY) seeds make up over 25% of plant species in a number of ecologically important ecosystems around the globe, such as savannah and Mediterranean shrublands. Many of these ecosystems are subject to temporally stochastic events, such as fire and drought; but are in areas projected to experience some of the most extreme climatic changes in the future. Given the importance of PY in controlling germination timing for successful recruitment, we ask how plastic the PY trait is, and if changes to the maternal environment from climate change could alter recruitment. This review focuses on: (1) the evidence for inter- and intraspecific variation in PY; (2) the genetic, maternal and environmental controls involved; and(3) the ecologicalconsequences of (1) and (2) above. Evidence for (within-community) interspecific variation in conditions required to break PY is strong, but for intraspecific variation evidence is contradictory and limited by a paucity of studies. Identifying controllers of variation in PY is complex, there is some suggestion that conditions of the maternal environment may be important, but no consensus on the nature of effects. The implications of PY plasticity for the persistence of seed banks, species and communities under climate change are discussed. We highlight a number of key knowledge gaps, such as a lack of research estimating the components of variation in non-agricultural species, and identify a suite of seed attributes relevant to understanding the potential impacts of climate change on the population dynamics of PY species in the future.

Interactions between substrate temperature and humidity in signalling cyclical dormancy in seeds of two perennial tropical species	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The involvement of environmental factors in dormancy cycling is well known in temperate annual species, but it is not known how interaction between soil temperatures and humidity can modulate dormancy in perennial tropical species. In this study the effects were evaluated of substrate temperature and humidity on the modulation of the acquisition and overcoming of secondary dormancy in the buried seeds of two endemic Eriocaulaceae species from the rocky fields (campos rupestres) vegetation in south-eastern Brazil. Fresh seeds of Comanthera bisulcata and Syngonanthus verticillatus were buried and subsequently maintained at temperatures of 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, under three substrate humidity levels (boggy, humid and humid/dry). The seeds were exhumed every 3 months and tested for germination (20 degrees C, 12 h photoperiod) and viability (tetrazolium test). The seeds of both species acquired dormancy after burial in all of the treatments. During the experimental period they demonstrated cycles of acquisition and overcoming of dormancy that were most evident in the treatments involving alterations of the substrate humidity (humid/dry regime) that coincided with the environmental conditions found naturally in the region of origin of the species. The seeds gradually lost dormancy during the dry period and re-acquired it when exposed again to humidity; dormancy would once again be overcome during the subsequent dry period. Burial promoted the acquisition of dormancy in Comanthera bisulcata and Syngonanthus verticillatus seeds; the lowest temperature tested favoured overcoming dormancy; and varying the humidity regime signalled the acquisition and the overcoming of secondary dormancy.

Testing the Shifting Persistence Niche Concept: Plant Resprouting along Gradients of Disturbance	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Plant resprouting after disturbance confers community resilience because individuals persist through trade-offs in resources for buds versus those required to produce seeds. However, repeated disturbance may deplete bud banks, and population persistence may become increasingly reliant on regeneration from seed. Theory predicts a shift in community assemblage from species with a strategy of persistence by resprouting (persistence niche) to one of regeneration from seed (regeneration niche) as the disturbance frequency increases. We tested, for the first time, the shifting persistence niche concept in a model system at local and regional community scales using a phylogenetically diverse floristic assemblage. Persistence traits of vascular plants were modeled as a function of dry-down frequency in wetlands. Resprouting species occupying the persistence niche were more common in stable wetlands than in those more frequently disturbed by dry downs. The patterns of resprouting species in standing vegetation and in seed banks provide strong support for the shifting persistence niche model involving trade-offs between resprouting (clonality) and sexual reproduction.																	0003-0147	1537-5323				JUN	2015	185	6					747	755		10.1086/681160							WOS:000354942900007	25996860

Few data existed and so we used literature and government biotic and abiotic data and anthropogenic impacts to assess the conservation risk of the ecosystem as Least Concern (IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems, version 2.0). This was based on limited distributional change and low levels of degradation or anthropogenic threatening processes. The approach could be applied to ecosystem assessments of other large river basins around the world, given the Lake Eyre Basin occupies one extreme (unmodified) while the Aral Sea (collapsed), previously assessed, occupies the other extreme (highly modified). River flow analysis with available biotic data is critical for risk assessment as well as identification and tracking of long-term threats. Assessment was possible at this large basin scale and appropriate, given the critical importance of connectivity but could also occur at finer spatial scale. Increased diversions for irrigation, mining impacts on floodplains and projected increased temperatures threaten the current status (Least Concern) of the connected wetlands of the Lake Eyre Basin ecosystem.

Germination of Phelipanche aegyptiaca and Cuscuta campestris seeds in composted farm manure	CROP PROTECTION												The seed vitality of the parasitic weeds Phelipanche aegyptiaca (Egyptian broomrape) and Cuscuta campestris (field dodder) is a highly important factor in their dissemination to nearby and distant habitats. Fresh manure composting is an essential process as a 'good agricultural practice' of using manure safely as a fertilizer without dissemination of plant diseases, propagules or weed seeds. The aims of this research were a) to determine whether composting is effective in eliminating P. aegyptiaca and C. campestris seed vitality b) to evaluate the temperatures needed to eliminate seed viability of these species. Seeds of P. aegyptiaca and C. campestris were placed in various depths of compost piles and removed at different time intervals for germination rate determination. In a parallel experiment in the lab, P. aegyptiaca seeds were placed in incubators at fixed temperatures and removed periodically, to determine their germination rate. We found that ensuring compost temperatures above 55 degrees C for five to 6 h is sufficient to eradicate P. aegyptiaca seeds. This data was confirmed by the laboratory incubator experiments. Temperatures of 50-60 degrees C in the compost pile reduced C. campestris seed viability exponentially, but even 42 days of incubation did not completely eradicate their viability. Similar results were attained in a controlled temperature experiment in the laboratory, at which C. campestris seeds at 60 degrees C retained viability for 28 days. The results of this study stress the importance of maintaining high temperatures during manure composting procedures for eradication of P. aegyptiaca and C. campestris seeds and that. C campestris seeds require a longer period of composting for eradication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Escaped Miscanthus sacchariflorus reduces the richness and diversity of vegetation and the soil seed bank	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Prioritizing management efforts and funds for invasive species relies upon knowledge of their ecological impacts. Often, however, novel species have unknown effects and can exhibit long time lags before proliferating, making early management decisions difficult. The grasses Miscanthus sinensis, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, and their sterile hybrid M. x giganteus have been introduced to North America and elsewhere for horticultural and agricultural purposes, but little is known about their impacts on resident vegetation upon escape from cultivation. We compared the vegetation communities and soil seed bank of paired areas invaded and uninvaded by escaped Miscanthus sacchariflorus at ten sites in Ontario, Canada. Invaded plots had very few species other than Miscanthus sacchariflorus and had lower plant species abundance, richness, and diversity than did uninvaded plots, and effects were greater on the vegetation than on the seed bank. Invaded plots also had more live and dead standing biomass, taller vegetation, and greater litter biomass, along with decreased light penetration to the soil surface than in uninvaded plots. However, Miscanthus sacchariflorus did not produce a germinable seed bank. Our results suggest that the regional spread of Miscanthus sacchariflorus is currently limited by a lack of seed production/viability, but its occurrence along disturbance-prone roadways and drainages facilitates its local vegetative spread. The strong negative effects of Miscanthus sacchariflorus on the resident plant community should be considered in risk assessments and management planning for this and other Miscanthus species.

Invasiveness: Experimental Observations in Burkina Faso, West Africa	BIOENERGY RESEARCH												Biofuel plants such as Jatropha curcas L. have potential to support the livelihoods of rural communities and contribute to sustainable rural development in Africa, if risks and uncertainties are minimized. Yet, recent papers have warned of the risk of biological invasions in such tropical regions as a consequence of the introduction of exotic biofuel crops. We investigated the seed dispersal risk and invasiveness potential of both J. curcas monoculture plantations and live fences into adjacent cultivated and uncultivated land use systems in Sissili province, Burkina Faso. Invasiveness potential was assessed through (i) detecting evidence of natural regeneration in perimeters around J. curcas plantations and live fences, (ii) assessing seed dispersal mechanisms, and (iii) assessing seedling establishment potential through in situ direct seed sowing. Spontaneous regeneration around the plantation perimeters of the three sites was very low. Individual seedling density around J. curcas live fences was less than 0.01 m(-2) in all sites. Seventy percent of the seedlings were found close to the live fence and most of them derived from the same year (96 %), which indicates low seed-bank longevity and seedling survival. J. curcas can be dispersed by small mammals and arthropods, particularly rodents and ants. In some sites, such as in Onliassan, high secondary seed dispersal by animals (up to 98 %) was recorded. There were highly significant differences in germination rates between seeds at the soil surface (11 %) and those buried artificially at 1-2-cm depth (64 %). In conclusion, we failed to find convincing evidence of the spreading of J. curcas or any significant impact on the surrounding environment.

The plants observed most frequently where heating has occurred are Sisymbrium loeselii, Artemisia vulgaris, Sonchus arvensis, Chenopodium album, Achillea millefolium, Cirsium arvense, Amaranthus retrollexus, Atriplex niters and Solanum nigrum. Some new, rare species such as Portulaca oleracea, first noticed in 2011, may be added. Most of encroaching species are annual, alien archeophytes and neophytes. Native species are mainly perennials. The majority of these species show a tendency to form specimens of huge size (gigantism). The abundance of emitted CO2 and nitrogen compounds is the likely cause of this. Additionally, the plants growing there are not attacked by insects. The heating of the ground liquidates the natural seed bank. After cooling, these places are seeded by species providing seeds at that very moment (pioneer species). Heated places on the dumps allow plant growth even in the middle of winter. As the seasonal vegetation cycle is disturbed, plants may be found seeding, blooming and fruiting at the same time.

Reproductive responses of alpine plants to grassland degradation and artificial restoration in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												Artificial grassland establishment has been implemented in the alpine region of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China as a mitigation tool against grassland degradation, one of the major environmental problems in this region. We hypothesized that both grassland degradation and artificial restoration may alter the reproductive modes of the alpine vegetation at the levels of individual species as well as plant functional groups. By investigating a long-term field study of grassland degradation and artificial restoration experiments, we found that alpine plants can maintain a highly plastic relationship between sexual and asexual reproduction, that is, the alpine plants in degraded grasslands increased their efforts towards sexual reproduction while those in artificially restored grasslands promoted their efforts in vegetative reproduction with in the year after restoration. The high reproductive plasticity of the alpine plants can be regulated through a number of mechanisms, which include changing proportion of clonal species in the plant composition, altering number ratio of sexual and vegetative propagules, shifting biomass allocation for sexual and vegetative reproduction at both individual species and functional group levels. These conclusions demonstrate how crucial it is to consider manipulation of reproductive modes needed to restore the structure and stability of degraded alpine grasslands.

We hypothesized that the aerial seed bank in maternal tissues could protect halophyte seeds from lethal salinity effects of soils. Effects of aerial (in plant canopy) and room-temperature (lab) storage on subsequent germination behavior were assessed for two small-seeded halophytes: Halocnemum strobilaceum (known to be salt tolerant, with a short-term aerial seed bank -less than 9 months) and Halopeplis perfoliata (less salt tolerant, with a long-term aerial seed bank more than 17 months). Seeds were germinated in different salinities in both light/dark regime and darkness treatments. Ungerminated seeds from the different salinities were transferred to distilled water to assess their ability to recover germination capacity. Salinity tolerance during germination was much greater in H. strobilaceum, compared to H. perfoliata. Storage in the aerial seed bank resulted in significant germination-reduction in H. strobilaceum, but not in H. perfoliata. In H. strobilaceum aerial-stored seeds were less tolerant of the salinity than were the room-temperature-stored seeds. These results support the notion that an aerial seed bank protects salt-sensitive seeds from effects of high soil salinity, especially in species that have short-term aerial seed banks.

Seed dormancy is a dynamic state: variable responses to pre- and post-shedding environmental signals in seeds of contrasting Arabidopsis ecotypes	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seeds have evolved to be highly efficient environmental sensors that respond not only to their prevailing environment, but also their environmental history, to regulate dormancy and the initiation of germination. In the present work we investigate the combined impact of a number of environmental signals (temperature, nitrate, light) during seed development on the mother plant, during post-shedding imbibition and during prolonged post-shedding exposure in both dry and imbibed states, simulating time in the soil seed bank. The differing response to these environments was observed in contrasting winter (Cvi, Ler) and summer (Bur) annual Arabidopsis ecotypes. Results presented show that environmental signals both pre- and post-shedding determine the depth of physiological dormancy and therefore the germination response to the ambient environment. The ecotype differences in seed response to ambient germination conditions are greatly enhanced by seed maturation in different environments. Further variation in response develops following shedding when seeds do not receive the full complement of environmental signals required for germination and enter the soil seed bank in either dry or imbibed states. Species seed dormancy characteristics cannot therefore be easily defined, as seed dormancy is a dynamic state subject to within-species adaptation to local environments.

Thirty three populations (268 individuals) of Reichardia picroides, Scolymus hispanicus, Scandix pecten-veneris, Leontodon tuberosus, Cichorium spinosum, Sonchus asper ssp. glaucescens, Urospermum picroides, Prasium majus, Hypochoeris radicata, Centaurea raphanina ssp. raphanina and Anagallis arvensis were collected and identified from nine regions with distinct microclimate (Lassithi prefecture), and their genetic composition was studied by means of RAPD markers. Results: A total of ten primers per population were used to detect genetic diversity and bootstrap analysis was conducted for clustering the samples. High levels of heterogeneity were revealed while the Analysis of Molecular Variance documented that variance was allocated mainly within populations and at a lesser extent among populations. Fst values among regions were moderate to high, suggesting partial population fragmentation. Bayesian structure analysis revealed fine genetic composition and substantial admixture between species present in different regions, although clustering was mainly geographically related. Conclusions: High altitude regions, with little residential and agricultural development (Kefala, Agrilos, Ziros and Tziritis), were the areas where high biodiversity was detected. On the other hand, coastal regions had lower biodiversity, probably due to degradation of their habitat.

Tara Oceans Coordinators	Patterns and ecological drivers of ocean viral communities	SCIENCE												Viruses influence ecosystems by modulating microbial population size, diversity, metabolic outputs, and gene flow. Here, we use quantitative double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral-fraction metagenomes (viromes) and whole viral community morphological data sets from 43 Tara Oceans expedition samples to assess viral community patterns and structure in the upper ocean. Protein cluster cataloging defined pelagic upper-ocean viral community pan and core gene sets and suggested that this sequence space is well-sampled. Analyses of viral protein clusters, populations, and morphology revealed biogeographic patterns whereby viral communities were passively transported on oceanic currents and locally structured by environmental conditions that affect host community structure. Together, these investigations establish a global ocean dsDNA viromic data set with analyses supporting the seed-bank hypothesis to explain how oceanic viral communities maintain high local diversity.

Burning reveals cryptic plant diversity and promotes coexistence in a California prairie restoration experiment	ECOSPHERE												Grassland and prairie restoration projects in California often result in long-term establishment of only a few native plant species, even when they begin with a diverse seed palette. One explanation for the disappearance of certain native species over time is that they are excluded through competition. If so, management that reduces interspecific competition may favor "subordinate'' natives and promote greater native species diversity in restored communities. Potential management approaches to accomplish this goal include intraspecific spatial aggregation during seeding and prescribed fire. However, no studies have experimentally evaluated the effects of fire on a controlled (restoration) species pool or the interaction between fire and spatial aggregation. In a previous California prairie restoration experiment, we demonstrated that aggregated plantings protected competitively subordinate species from exclusion and increased community diversity for three years. However, native species richness declined throughout the study, and the benefits of aggregated seeding had begun to disappear by the third year. For the present study, we resurveyed the experimental plots five years after seeding and in the following year carried out controlled burns on half of the plots. The four subordinate species and one of the previously dominant species continued to decline and essentially disappeared aboveground during years four and five. However, burning in year five decreased the cover of dominant natives, triggered the reappearance of the three subordinate species that had disappeared or nearly disappeared in previous years, and increased diversity of the restored community. Seeding treatments (aggregated or interspersed) did not significantly affect community-level responses to the burning treatment. These results confirm that although initial intraspecific aggregation may promote species coexistence in the short term, re-establishing disturbance regimes can allow coexistence over a longer time scale by revealing and potentially renewing seed bank diversity.																	2150-8925					MAY	2015	6	5							81	10.1890/ES14-00303.1							WOS:000358433000002

Biomass harvest of invasive Typha promotes plant diversity in a Great Lakes coastal wetland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Ecological and financial constraints limit restoration efforts, preventing the achievement of desired ecological outcomes. Harvesting invasive plant biomass for bioenergy has the potential to reduce feedback mechanisms that sustain invasion, while alleviating financial limitations. Typhaxglauca is a highly productive invasive wetland plant that reduces plant diversity, alters ecological functioning, its impacts increase with time, and is a suitable feedstock for bioenergy. We sought to determine ecological effects of Typha utilization for bioenergy in a Great Lakes coastal wetland by testing plant community responses to harvest-restoration treatments in stands of 2 age classes and assessing community resilience through a seed bank study. Belowground harvesting increased light penetration, diversity, and richness and decreased Typha dominance and biomass in both years post-treatment. Aboveground harvesting increased light and reduced Typha biomass in post-year 1 and in post-year 2, increased diversity and richness and decreased Typha dominance. Seed bank analysis revealed that young stands (<20 years) had greater diversity, richness, seedling density, and floristic quality than old stands (>30 years). In the field, stand-age did not affect diversity or Typha dominance, but old stands had greater Typha biomass and slightly higher richness following harvest. Harvesting Typha achieved at least 2 desirable ecological outcomes: reducing Typha dominance and increasing native plant diversity. Younger stands had greater potential for native recovery, indicated by more diverse seed banks. In similar degraded wetlands, a single harvest of Typha biomass would likely result in significant biodiversity and habitat improvements, with the potential to double plant species richness.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				MAY	2015	23	3					228	237		10.1111/rec.12167							WOS:000358129000005

Seedling establishment in a masting desert shrub parallels the pattern for forest trees	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The masting phenomenon along with its accompanying suite of seedling adaptive traits has been well studied in forest trees but has rarely been examined in desert shrubs. Blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) is a regionally dominant North American desert shrub whose seeds are produced in mast events and scatter-hoarded by rodents. We followed the fate of seedlings in intact stands vs. small-scale disturbances at four contrasting sites for nine growing seasons following emergence after a mast year. The primary cause of first-year mortality was post-emergence cache excavation and seedling predation, with contrasting impacts at sites with different heteromyid rodent seed predators. Long-term establishment patterns were strongly affected by rodent activity in the weeks following emergence. Survivorship curves generally showed decreased mortality risk with age but differed among sites even after the first year. There were no detectable effects of inter-annual precipitation variability or site climatic differences on survival. Intraspecific competition from conspecific adults had strong impacts on survival and growth, both of which were higher on small-scale disturbances, but similar in openings and under shrub crowns in intact stands. This suggests that adult plants preempted soil resources in the interspaces. Aside from effects on seedling predation, there was little evidence for facilitation or interference beneath adult plant crowns. Plants in intact stands were still small and clearly juvenile after nine years, showing that blackbrush forms cohorts of suppressed plants similar to the seedling banks of closed forests. Seedling banks function in the absence of a persistent seed bank in replacement after adult plant death (gap formation), which is temporally uncoupled from masting and associated recruitment events. This study demonstrates that the seedling establishment syndrome associated with masting has evolved in desert shrublands as well as in forests.

J	Mojzes, A; Csontos, P; Kalapos, T				Mojzes, Andrea; Csontos, Peter; Kalapos, Tibor			Is the positive response of seed germination to plant-derived smoke associated with plant traits?	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Relationships between seed germination response to plant-derived smoke and various plant traits (habitat requirements, life form, seed morphology, seed bank type) were analysed for 97 species of the Hungarian flora using published data. It was hypothesized that smoke-responsive species those displaying enhanced germination in response to smoke differ from non-responsive species smoke having an indifferent or inhibitory effect on germination in habitat requirements and/or certain life history traits. To our knowledge, no such comparison has previously been reported for a European flora. We found that species indicating disturbance and those preferring soils rich or moderately rich in nitrogen were more frequent in the smoke-responsive group (80% and 41%, respectively) than in the non-responsive group, while the non-responsive group contained a high percentage of natural species (i.e. species dominant or characteristic in natural plant communities; 47%) and species indicative of nutrient poor (38%) or (sub)mesotrophic (38%) soils. Annuals or biennials (67%) dominated the smoke-responsive group, whereas in the non-responsive group these short-lived species and perennial herbs were equally abundant (43% each). There was a tendency for higher frequency of long-term persistent seed bank among smoke-responsive species (78%) than in the non-responsive group (54%). These findings suggest that smoke-stimulated germination is associated with only a few specific plant traits for species from a semiarid temperate region of Europe, but highlight the frequent occurrence of smoke-enhanced germination among short-lived, nitrophilous or disturbance tolerant species. These results can contribute to a better understanding of post-fire regeneration of plant communities, and could also be considered during vegetation restoration or weed management.

J	Milesi, FA; Marone, L				Milesi, Fernando A.; Marone, Luis			Exploration and exploitation of foraging patches by desert sparrows: environmental indicators and local evaluation of spatially correlated costs and benefits	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Conventional evolutionary and behavioral reasoning expects foragers to show strong spatial preferences in environments with heterogeneous resource distribution. Moreover, consumers should benefit from exploiting the information embedded in environmental features that indicate resource abundance. In desert soils seed abundance associates strong and reliably with vegetation and litter cover at small spatial scales. However, other spatially correlated factors (substrate complexity, temperature, predation risk) may affect foraging costs, benefits and decisions by ground-feeding granivores. We used a sequence of three semi-controlled field experiments of binary spatial choice within a portable aviary to identify the main cause of foraging microhabitat selection by the most abundant postdispersal granivorous bird in the central Monte desert (Argentina). In the first experiment we placed the aviary at field to offer pairs of adjacent microhabitats of unmodified, naturally-contrasting substrates and environmental conditions to single, untrained rufous-collared sparrows Zonotrichia capensis. Birds selected covered microhabitats in winter and summer, ruling out substrate complexity or thermoregulation as main single causes of patch selection. The other two experiments dissociated seed abundance, tree cover and litter to reveal their effects on patch selection. The results indicate that 1) sparrows do not restrict microhabitat exploration relying on environmental indicators, 2) distance to tree cover influences the order of patch exploration, probably in association with apprehension or risk-assessment behavior, and 3) patch exploitation is determined by short-term local estimation of seed abundance. The integration of these with previous results obtained under variable degrees of realism and experimental control allows for a better explanation of the spatial component of postdispersal granivory and its consequences on plants. The unconstrained selective foraging strategy of these sparrows would allow them to detect sporadic or ephemeral rich patches with structural characteristics indicating low-quality', should promote the spatial homogenization of the palatable seed bank, and would favor indirect interactions between plants.																	0908-8857	1600-048X				MAY	2015	46	3					225	235		10.1111/jav.00388							WOS:000355622400001						
J	Rogalski, MA				Rogalski, Mary A.			Tainted resurrection: metal pollution is linked with reduced hatching and high juvenile mortality in Daphnia egg banks	ECOLOGY												Many taxa, from plants to zooplankton, produce long-lasting dormant propagules capable of temporal dispersal. In some cases, propagules can persist for decades or even centuries before emerging from seed and egg banks. Despite impressive longevity, relatively little is known about how the chemical environment experienced before or during dormancy affects the fate and performance of individuals. This study examines the hatching rate and developmental success of Daphnia hatched from diapausing eggs isolated from sediments from four lakes that experienced varying levels of metal contamination. Two hundred seventy-three animals were hatched from lake sediments deposited over the past century. Hatching rate was negatively influenced by metal contamination and sediment age. There was a robust positive relationship between sediment metal concentrations and juvenile mortality in Daphnia hatching from those sediments. The negative effect of metals on Daphnia hatching and juvenile survival may stem from metal bioaccumulation, genetic effects, or reduced maternal investment in diapausing embryos. Regardless of the specific mechanism driving this trend, exposure to metals may impose strong selection on Daphnia diapausing egg banks.

J	Bowman, AS; Facelli, JM; Sinclair, R				Bowman, Alexandra S.; Facelli, Jose M.; Sinclair, Russell			Long-term influence of fallen logs on patch formation and their effects under contrasting grazing regimes	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Patchiness is a critical functional feature of arid lands, increasing productivity and diversity, but there is little information on the long-term dynamics of patch formation. While plant-created heterogeneity is widespread, grazing reduces plant density, hence removing patchiness. Patchiness is also associated with fallen logs and it is particularly important to assess this association in grazed areas, as there are few patches which are not created by living plants. We studied differences in soil nutrient content and soil seed bank associated with the presence of logs in the long ungrazed Koonamore Vegetation Reserve and an adjacent heavily grazed paddock in chenopod shrublands of South Australia. We studied soil properties associated with fallen logs of unknown age, and others known to have persisted for up to 78 years. Logs acted as traps for soil nutrients and seeds. Organic carbon was higher in soils associated with logs, and also higher inside the reserve than in the grazed paddock. Propagule number and species richness were higher next to logs than in open spaces and viable seeds were in much higher abundance next to logs in the grazed paddock than any other site. Increased time in situ of a log had a relatively small effect on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Logs act as resource traps which may enhance the diversity of the system, and may be particularly important for maintaining patches of resources in areas of severe grazing damage. Hence, their preservation should be incorporated into management schemes. [Correction added on 3 March 2015, after online publication: The following parts in the abstract have been edited. Organic carbon and total nitrogen were higher in soils associated with logs' has been corrected to Organic carbon was higher in soils associated with logs', and had a relatively small effect on soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium' has been corrected to had a relatively small effect on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen'.]					Facelli, Jose/0000-0002-0408-0082												1442-9985	1442-9993				MAY	2015	40	3					238	244		10.1111/aec.12204							WOS:000353101600003

MethodsWe recorded earthworm density, earthworm biomass and vegetation composition in 12 deciduous forests and subsequently collected soil cores and recorded emergence of plant species from the seed bank. We used path analysis to assess direct and indirect contributions of earthworms and vegetation composition (species richness and cover of native and non-native plants) to the species richness and abundance of emergent seedlings. ResultsHigh earthworm populations were positively associated with increased species richness and seedling density of both native and non-native plant species emerging from the seed bank. This relationship held for all life-form groups, although the earthworm effect was indirect for non-native graminoid abundance. Non-native plants were positively correlated with earthworms and while they influenced both aboveground vegetation cover and species richness, they had no direct influence on emergent abundance or species richness. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that forest seed bank composition is strongly influenced by the presence and abundance of non-native earthworms, and only weakly influenced by non-native plants. Forest understorey recovery from seed banks is possible following earthworm invasion, but resulting communities bear little similarity to standing vegetation. Recovery of the full desirable and typical complement of aboveground vegetation will require input to seed banks by (1) fostering seed production of existing vegetation and/or (2) planting seed of desired species. We suggest managing understorey vegetation to allow herbaceous species to set seed.																	1366-9516	1472-4642				MAY	2015	21	5					560	570		10.1111/ddi.12322							WOS:000352586400007

Propagule abundance and richness are equivalent or higher in communities restored with local ecotypes relative to cultivars of dominant species	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionDoes population source of dominant species influence propagule abundance and richness for ecological restoration, and are effects consistent across different species pools? LocationIllinois, USA. MethodsAbundance and richness of ramets, emerged seedlings, seed rain and the soil seed bank were measured in a restoration experiment consisting of a split-plot design with population source of dominant grasses (cultivar vs local ecotype) as the whole-plot factor and sown subordinate species (three unique pools of non-dominant species) as the subplot factor, respectively. Different sown species pools were included to assess whether any observed differences in propagule abundance or richness between the dominant species sources was generalizable across varying interspecific interactions. ResultsAbundance of emerged ramets was similar between communities sown with cultivar and local ecotypes of the dominant grasses, but differed among sown species pools in prairie restored with cultivars but not with local ecotypes. Number of emerged seedlings also differed among species pools, but only in communities sown with local ecotypes of the dominant grasses. There was also higher seedling emergence in communities sown with local ecotypes relative to cultivars of the dominant grasses in one species pool. Richness of the seed rain was influenced by an interaction between dominant grass population source and sown species pool, resulting from (1) higher richness in prairie restored with local ecotypes than cultivars of the native grasses in one species pool, and (2) differences in richness among species pools that occurred only in prairie restored with the local ecotype grass source. Abundance and richness of the seed bank was not affected by dominant grass population source. ConclusionsThis study addressed a poorly understood potential effect of using cultivars in ecological restoration, specifically on the abundance and supply of propagules for community assembly. We found no consistent negative effect of dominant grass cultivars on propagule supply. These results suggest that if both local ecotype and cultivar sources are available for restoration, using local ecotypes could result in more seedling germination and richness in the seed rain.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				MAY	2015	26	3					421	430		10.1111/jvs.12257							WOS:000352793500003

Shrub cover regulates population dynamics of herbaceous plants at individual shrub scale on the Mongolian steppe	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsDo shrubs regulate herbaceous plant community by modifying seed and plant distributions at the individual shrub scale? Do the magnitude and extent of effects at this scale change with shrub cover? LocationA desert steppe, Mandalgobi, Mongolia. MethodsWe compared soil properties, seed accumulation and the establishment of plants of three functional types (annual forb, perennial forb and perennial graminoid) between shrub microsites (on mounds vs mound interspace) at sites differing in shrub coverage (high and low). ResultsShrub patches (a legume Caragana microphylla) promoted seed accumulation but inhibited plant establishment on mounds, relative to the mound interspace, for all functional types. However, the effects varied with shrub cover, particularly in the mound interspace, with responses specific to each functional type. The accumulation of soil and annual forb seeds increased with shrub cover at both microsites. Additionally, the density of annual forbs was positively related to shrub cover in the mound interspace. In contrast, the density of perennial forbs and graminoids decreased with increasing shrub cover at both microsites, possibly because of enhanced sand accumulation. ConclusionShrubs shape herbaceous plant community by causing differences at the individual shrub scale in seed and plant distributions. Additionally, we showed that individual shrub effects are shrub cover-dependent: dense shrub stands enhanced the dominance of annual forbs in spite of the negative effect found at the individual shrub scale, whereas perennial forbs and graminoids were less abundant in denser shrub stands. Shrubs can play an important role in structuring plant communities via shrub cover-dependent variation at microsites.																	1100-9233	1654-1103				MAY	2015	26	3					441	451		10.1111/jvs.12253							WOS:000352793500005

LocationFlood-meadows at the northern Upper Rhine, Germany. MethodsFrom 1998 to 2004 annually, and again in 2008, species composition and above-ground biomass were studied in 46 permanent plots located along a flooding gradient ranging from frequently flooded Magnocaricion to rarely flooded Arrhenaterion meadows. The plots were situated in the functional floodplain (natural) and in the fossil floodplain on the land side of high winter levees (anthropogenic altered). Temporal variation of the functional structure was analysed based on community-weighted mean traits. ResultsProductivity and functional structure varied markedly over the study period and between the functional and fossil floodplain. During the study period two contrasting extreme events occurred: a summer flood in 1999 and a drought period after 2003. After the flood in 1999, species composition and functional structure of the studied flood-meadows shifted towards the species composition of wetter sites. Flooding reduced species richness in the functional floodplain, but not in the fossil floodplain. ConclusionsFlood-meadows in the Upper Rhine fully recover from extreme disturbance events within a time frame of less than 10yr. Environmental fluctuations and disturbances, enabling the co-existence of species with contrasting ecological requirements are a key factor for the preservation of plant biodiversity in flood-meadows.

Desiccated diaspores from building materials: methodological aspects of processing mudbrick for archaeobotanical studies and first results of a study of earth buildings in southwest Hungary	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Earth buildings are among the richest sources of archaeobotanical materials from the recent past. Thus, mudbrick constructions are extremely rich in plant materials, especially chaff, straw, fruits and seeds. Recovery of these remains enables us to gain a comprehensive insight into the contemporary floras of past settlements and their surroundings. Mudbricks from southwest Hungary which were 100-150 years old and were used there as traditional natural building materials, were examined in this research from an archaeobotanical point of view. Techniques were used that mostly come from modern seed bank research, and the most efficient processing methods were tested and further developed. Different flotation procedures were compared and the minimum sample volume was also determined. A new sodium chloride (common salt) flotation method was developed, providing a useful separation procedure for the recovery of plant remains and diaspores (seeds) from mudbrick. The effectiveness of sodium chloride is similar to other chemicals used in seed bank research, but much more economical. The minimum and optimum sample volumes are 2,500-3,500 cm(3); these are necessary to recover most of the taxa preserved in the bricks. A trend in the recovery of different sized seeds was also observed, revealing that the recovery of smaller seeds was less successful. Using the sodium chloride method, more than 18,000 desiccated diaspores were recovered and identified from 212 kg of mudbrick samples, from the period between 1850 and 1930. A total of 249 taxa were identified, most of which are weedy taxa connected to cereal and ruderal weed plant communities.

J	Kumar, V; Jha, P				Kumar, Vipan; Jha, Prashant			Influence of herbicides applied postharvest in wheat stubble on control, fecundity, and progeny fitness of Kochia scoparia in the US Great Plains	CROP PROTECTION												Field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments were conducted at the Montana State University Southern Agricultural Research Center, Huntley, MT, USA, in 2012 and 2013, to evaluate the effectiveness of various postharvest-applied herbicides on late-season control, fecundity, seed viability, and progeny fitness of Kochia scoparia (kochia) in wheat stubble. Paraquat + atrazine, paraquat + linuron, and paraquat + metribuzin applied at the early bloom stage were the most effective postharvest treatments for late-season control (100%) at 28 d after treatment (DAT), biomass reduction (70-73%), and seed prevention of K. scoparia, and did not differ from glyphosate, glufosinate, saflufenacil + 2, 4-D, saflufenacil + atrazine, tembotrione + atrazine, or topramezone + atrazine treatments. Dicamba alone, dicamba + 2, 4-D, or diflufenzopyr + dicamba + 2, 4-D applied at the early bloom stage were ineffective, with <70% late-season control, <45% biomass reduction, and <55% seed reduction of K. scoparia. In the absence of a postharvest herbicide, uncontrolled kochia plants at a density of 8-10 plants m(-2) contributed >100,000 seeds m(-2). Addition of atrazine to dicamba improved late-season control (80%) and seed reduction (78%) compared to dicamba alone, and reduced seed viability and 100-seed weight. There was no significant effect of any of the dicamba-containing herbicides applied at the early bloom stage on K. scoparia progeny fitness, including height, width, primary branches, and shoot dry weight of seedlings at 42 d after planting (DAP). The effective postharvest-applied herbicides investigated in this research should be utilized to prevent late-season K. scoparia seed bank replenishment in wheat, and as a component of herbicide resistance management program for the containment of glyphosate- and/or acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibitor-resistant K. scoparia in wheat-based crop rotations in the US Great Plains.

Younger Daphnia clones are competitively superior over centuries-old ancestors	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A laboratory microcosm experiment was conducted to examine the roles of food quantity and food quality on the competitive abilities of clones of the keystone aquatic zooplankter, Daphnia pulicaria. Using methods of resurrection ecology, clones were established by hatching dormant eggs from sediment layers of a lake (South Center, MN, U.S.A) that were separated by centuries of environmental change (nutrient enrichment). Two sets of paired clones ("modern" vs. "ancient") were competed against each other in a 2 x 2 factorial design of high/low food quantity and high/low food quality. Experimental carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratios were designed to mimic food quantity and food quality parameters respective to each of the two time periods from which the clones were extracted to test whether clones are competitively superior under conditions representative of the time period in which they existed. Contrary to predictions, we found that "modern" clones were able to outcompete "ancient" clones under all food treatments. We discuss potential mechanisms (i.e., mutational input, viability of long-dormant eggs, differences in phenotypic plasticity) that may have differentially impacted the performance of experimental clones. Our results should aid in deciphering microevolutionary dynamics observed in resurrection ecology studies, a powerful tool that can illuminate adaptive dynamics of organisms to environmental changes on long-term (centuries-long) temporal scales.

Effects of 10-Year Management Regimes on the Soil Seed Bank in Saline-Alkaline Grassland	PLOS ONE												Background Management regimes for vegetation restoration of degraded grasslands can significantly affect the process of ecological succession. However, few studies have focused on variation in the soil seed bank during vegetation restoration under different management regimes, especially in saline-alkaline grassland habitats. Our aim was to provide insights into the ecological effects of grassland management regimes on soil seed bank composition and vegetation establishment in mown, fenced, transplanted and natural grassland sites, all dominated by the perennial rhizomatous grass Leymus chinensis. Methodology We studied species composition and diversity in both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation in differently managed grasslands in Northeast China. An NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) was used to evaluate the relationship between species composition, soil seed banks, aboveground vegetation and soil properties. Principal Findings Fenced and mown grassland sites had high density and species richness in both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation. The Transplanted treatment exhibited the highest vegetation growth and seed production of the target species L. chinensis. Seeds of L. chinensis in the soil occurred only in transplanted and natural grassland. Based on the NMDS analysis, the number of species in both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation were significantly related to soil Na+, Cl-, RSC (residual sodium carbonate), alkalinity, ESP (exchangeable sodium percentage) and AP (available phosphorus). Conclusions Soil seed bank composition and diversity in the saline-alkaline grassland were significantly affected by the management regimes implemented, and were also significantly related to the aboveground vegetation and several soil properties. Based on vegetative growth, reproductive output and maintenance of soil seed bank, the transplanting was identified as the most effective method for relatively rapid restoration of the target species L. chinensis. This approach could be beneficial for the restoration of dominant species in a wide range of degraded grassland ecosystems.

The role of large wood in retaining fine sediment, organic matter and plant propagules in a small, single-thread forest river	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper investigates associations among large wood accumulations, retained sediment, and organic matter and the establishment of a viable propagule bank within a forested reach of a lowland river, the Highland Water, UK. A wood survey within the 2-km study reach, illustrates that the quantity of wood retained within the channel is typical of relatively unmanaged river channels bordered by deciduous woodland and that the wood accumulations (jams) that are present are well developed, typically spanning the river channel and comprised of wood that is well decayed. Sediment samples were obtained in a stratified random design focusing on nine subreaches within which samples were aggregated from five different types of sampling location. Two of these locations were wood-associated (within and on bank faces immediately adjacent to wood jams), and the other three locations represented the broader river environment (gravel bars, bank faces, floodplain). The samples were analysed to establish their calibre, organic, and viable plant propagule content. The gravel bar sampling locations retained significantly coarser sediment containing a lower proportion of organic matter and viable propagules than the other four sampling locations. The two wood-related sampling locations retained sediment of intermediate calibre between the gravel bar and the bank-floodplain samples but they retained significantly more organic matter and viable propagules than were found in the other three sampling locations. In particular, the jam bank samples (areas of sediment accumulation against bank faces adjacent to wood jams) contained the highest number of propagules and the largest number of propagule species. These results suggest that retention of propagules, organic matter and relatively fine sediment in and around wood jams has the potential to support vegetation regeneration, further sediment retention, and as a consequence, landform development within woodland streams, although this process is arrested by grazing at the study site. These results also suggest that self-restoration using wood is a potentially cost-effective and farreaching river restoration strategy but that its full effects develop gradually and require the establishment of a functioning wood budget coupled with grazing levels that are in balance with vegetation growth.

Natural genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana defense metabolism genes modulates field fitness	ELIFE												Natural populations persist in complex environments, where biotic stressors, such as pathogen and insect communities, fluctuate temporally and spatially. These shifting biotic pressures generate heterogeneous selective forces that can maintain standing natural variation within a species. To directly test if genes containing causal variation for the Arabidopsis thaliana defensive compounds, glucosinolates (GSL) control field fitness and are therefore subject to natural selection, we conducted a multi-year field trial using lines that vary in only specific causal genes. Interestingly, we found that variation in these naturally polymorphic GSL genes affected fitness in each of our environments but the pattern fluctuated such that highly fit genotypes in one trial displayed lower fitness in another and that no GSL genotype or genotypes consistently out-performed the others. This was true both across locations and within the same location across years. These results indicate that environmental heterogeneity may contribute to the maintenance of GSL variation observed within Arabidopsis thaliana.

Short-Term Responses of Southern African Semi-Arid Rangelands to Fire: A Review of Impact on Soils	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Knowledge of the impact of fire in arid and semi-arid sweet rangeland areas and the role it can play in sustainable utilization of the rangeland ecosystem is limited. This review uses a South African case study (experimental plot data) to elevate the research (soil quality and seed bank dynamics) on short-term fire responses in a semi-arid climate. The impact of a decrease in basal cover and plant density due to fire, especially on the hydrological characteristics of the ecosystem was clearly shown. Fire increase soil temperatures and soil compaction, and decrease organic matter, which lowers soil-water content and infiltration ability. Much of the influence of these variables had not been completely reduced two growing seasons after the fire. Reduction of organic matter after only one fire is a cause of concern due to maintenance of soil fertility. Fire caused a flush of seedlings from the soil seed bank over the first season following the fire. Low seedling survival with burning can be ascribed to poor basal cover and resultant change in microclimate. Fire also negatively influenced species richness. The enormous impact of fire on soil characteristics and seed bank dynamics, over the short-term, underscores the importance of purposeful burning in semi-arid rangelands. It is clear that over the short term, fire could strongly influence the sustainability of the ecosystem in the drier areas.																	1532-4982	1532-4990				APR 3	2015	29	2					222	236		10.1080/15324982.2014.944244							WOS:000344470200006

EVOLUTION OF RYEGRASS SEED BANKS DEPENDING ON SOIL TILLAGE AND CROPS	PLANTA DANINHA												The seed bank is characterized by the amount of seeds and other viable reproductive structures in the soil and it is changed by the input and output of seeds, being classified by its permanence in the soil as transient or permanent. The tillage and crops used decisively influence this dynamic and more disturbed areas tend to have richer seed banks. The purpose of this study was to test different soil tillage and crop systems, aiming to reduce or eliminate the ryegrass in the area. The experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2012. In the first year, the effect of chemical tillage was assessed, compared to the area without tillage. From the second year on, in the area that received chemical tillage, the second experiment was installed, where it was assessed the effect of soil tillage and crop rotation in the ryegrass seed yield. The soil tillage treatment was chisel plow and non-chisel plow. The crop rotation was: fallow/soybean; wheat/soybean; black oat/maize. The samples of soil were taken three times a year and split in 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm. After sampling, the seeds were separated from the soil and sterilized. Afterwards, germination and tetrazolium test were conducted. In the same plots used for soil sampling, the emergence flow of ryegrass was assessed in the winter 2011 and 2012. In the first year it was observed that chemical tillage had considerably reduced the amount of ryegrass in the soil. The crop rotations used were more effective than soil tillage in reducing the seed banks in the soil. The rotation oat/maize and wheat/soybean, in only two years, practically zeroed the ryegrass seed banks in the area.																	0100-8358					APR-JUN	2015	33	2					183	191		10.1590/0100-83582015000200003							WOS:000358011500003

Fire and the dynamics of two unpalatable grass species (Cymbopogon pospischilii and Elionurus muticus) in a semi-arid climate	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Cymbopogon pospischilii and Elionurus muticus are unpalatable for most of the growing season and form a reasonably large component of the vegetation composition in semi-arid grassland areas. The influence of an accidental fire on the dynamics of these two grass species was quantified over a three-year period (2008/09 to 2010/11 growing seasons) in a semi-arid grassland. After burning, the production of C. pospischilii was 18% higher than that of the total production of the rest of the burned species for the third growing season. Production of E. muticus was lowered by fire by 82% for the first season. Three years after the fire, the density of C. pospischilii was 14.52 plants m(-2) versus an average for the unburned species of only 6.78 plants m(-2). Seedling emergence from the seed bank for C. pospischilii and E. muticus, at the end of the third growing season, was respectively 6.6 and 12.4 seedlings m(-2) more than that of unburned grassland - a reason for concern regarding plant composition stability of burnt semi-arid grasslands. This study provides a better understanding of the two unpalatable grass species Cymbopogon pospischilii and Elionurus muticus and the implications of this for the sustainable utilisation of semi-arid grassland.																	1022-0119	1727-9380				APR	2015	32	1					1	12		10.2989/10220119.2014.913076							WOS:000354322000001

Seed bank composition varies along invasion and inundation gradients in vernal pool wetlands	PLANT ECOLOGY												Environmental filters are well-known influences on aboveground vegetation community structure; however, less is known about their role on belowground seed banks. Understanding the influence of environmental filters on the composition of seed banks can reveal community dynamics across known environmental gradients and facilitate restoration efforts. We examined the influence of environmental filters on seed banks of vernal pools by characterizing seed density and diversity along seasonal inundation gradients. We also sampled seed banks from both naturally occurring and restored vernal pools that differed in their aboveground communities (invasive or native species dominated) in a long-term field study in Solano Co., California, USA. We found that the highest seed densities were associated with the longest inundation period and in the naturally occurring pools. Inundation gradients within a pool had little influence on seed bank diversity, yet among the pool types diversity and community metrics varied. The naturally occurring pools, regardless of invasion status, displayed a greater species richness and diversity than constructed pools. Our greenhouse germination trials did not show a strong relationship of inundation depths influencing species and total germination. Overall, we found that local position in the field along inundation gradients within a pool strongly affected soil seed bank density, while seed bank diversity varied more across pool types. Environmental filters may be limiting germination with the pool bottoms having the highest inundation and maintain the densest seed bank, but our lack of difference in the germination trials suggests alternative mechanisms other than inundation may be hindering germination.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				APR	2015	216	4					553	564		10.1007/s11258-015-0458-8							WOS:000353208500005

In this study, earthworms, seed banks, and the standing vegetation were sampled in a grassland of central California. Our objectives were i) to examine whether the abundances of non-native, invasive earthworm species and non-native grassland plant species are correlated, and ii) to test whether seed ingestion by these worms alters the soil seed bank by evaluating the composition of seeds in casts relative to uningested soil. Sampling locations were selected based on historical land-use practices, including presence or absence of tilling, and revegetation by seed using Phalaris aquatica. Only non-native earthworm species were found, dominated by the invasive European species Aporrectodea trapezoides. Earthworm abundance was significantly higher in the grassland blocks dominated by non-native plant species, and these sites had higher carbon and moisture contents. Earthworm abundance was also positively related to increased emergence of non-native seedlings, but had no effect on that of native seedlings. Plant species richness and total seedling emergence were higher in casts than in uningested soils. This study suggests that there is a potential effect of non-native earthworms in promoting non-native and likely invasive plant species within grasslands, due to seed-plant-earthworm interactions via soil modification or to seed ingestion by earthworms and subsequent cast effects on grassland dynamics. This study supports a growing body of literature for earthworms as ecosystem engineers but highlights the relative importance of considering non-native-native interactions with the associated plant community.

J	Hemrova, L; Munzbergova, Z				Hemrova, Lucie; Muenzbergova, Zuzana			The effects of plant traits on species' responses to present and historical patch configurations and patch age	OIKOS												Patch configuration is viewed as an important factor affecting the distributions of plant species. Although a number of studies have explored the relationship between plant life-history traits and species' distributions in fragmented landscapes, the effect of individual traits on the dependence of species on historical versus current landscape configurations remains unclear. We identified the extent to which present (2000s) and historical (1843, 1954, 1980s) patch configurations (area and connectivity) and patch age affected the distributions of 99 species inhabiting dry calcareous grasslands. We used traits related to dispersal, survival, growth and habitat preferences to explain the dependence of 60 of these species on present and historical configurations, and the age of grassland patches. We found that most of the species had an affinity to currently or historically large, older and more isolated patches. This suggests that many dry grassland species are not in equilibrium with the current landscape, as their distributions still reflect past landscape structures. Rapidly growing species with higher seed bank longevity and nutrient requirements primarily occur in young, large grassland patches whereas species with the opposite traits occur in older, historically large and currently more isolated smaller patches. We hypothesise that patch quality is the reason why different species occupy patches of different age. Species occupying young, large patches commonly disperse by endozoochory. By contrast, no dispersal trait is associated with species occupying old, usually isolated patches. Our results suggest that species occupying old patches are exposed to higher potential risk of extinction, as their distributions are probably limited by the low number and connectivity of available suitable patches and poor dispersal ability. We thus suggest that the dynamics of these species can effectively be supported by improving the quality of young grassland patches.
