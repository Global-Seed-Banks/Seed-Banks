A study on understory plant diversity in managed oak stands	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Roads are recognised as having different ecological roles such as barrier, corridor or habitat, but the spatial extent of road effects on plant communities in forests remains unclear. We studied the effect of forest road distance on plant understory diversity at 20 sites in young and adult oak stands in a French lowland forest with a long history of management and road construction. All vascular and bryophyte species were collected at five distances ranging from the road verge to 100 m into the adjacent forest stand. We analysed species composition, individual species response, a priori life-history traits response - life form, habitat preference and dispersal mode - and environmental indicator values in relation to road distance and stand age. Plant composition strongly differed between road verge and forest interior habitats. The main road effect extended less than 5 m into the forest stand. A third habitat was detected at the forest-road edge resulting from the road effect on light and soil conditions, and from edge-specific topography. Non-forest species were almost absent from the forest interior. In contrast, many bryophytes and several vascular plants kept away from the road. We identified a posteriori six species groups that better explained the variability of plant response profiles than a priori life-history traits. Plant response to road distance was also dependent on stand age: some species colonised from the road into the forest interior in young stands following regeneration cutting, while other species displayed the reverse pattern in adult stands once canopy closed above the forest road. Even if the depth of forest road effect measured in lowland managed stands was narrow, building of a new forest road has non-negligible effects on plant population dynamics. Forest managers should take into account the impacts of roads on biodiversity, since the expected intensification of silviculture in response to global changes is set to accentuate the effect of forest roads. We recommend further study on the role of dispersal by vehicles (i.e. agestochory) in road effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Dormancy contributes to the maintenance of microbial diversity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy used by a variety of organisms to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions. By entering a reversible state of low metabolic activity, dormant individuals become members of a seed bank, which can determine community dynamics in future generations. Although microbiologists have documented dormancy in both clinical and natural settings, the importance of seed banks for the diversity and functioning of microbial communities remains untested. Here, we develop a theoretical model demonstrating that microbial communities are structured by environmental cues that trigger dormancy. A molecular survey of lake ecosystems revealed that dormancy plays a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than eukaryotic microbial communities. The proportion of dormant bacteria was relatively low in productive ecosystems but accounted for up to 40% of taxon richness in nutrient-poor systems. Our simulations and empirical data suggest that regional environmental cues and dormancy synchronize the composition of active communities across the landscape while decoupling active microbes from the total community at local scales. Furthermore, we observed that rare bacterial taxa were disproportionately active relative to common bacterial taxa, suggesting that microbial rank-abundance curves are more dynamic than previously considered. We propose that repeated transitions to and from the seed bank may help maintain the high levels of microbial biodiversity that are observed in nearly all ecosystems.																	0027-8424					MAR 30	2010	107	13					5881	5886		10.1073/pnas.0912765107							WOS:000276159500035	20231463

This paper examines seed bank dynamics in a tropical savanna in northern Australia, an environment characterised by frequent fire and highly seasonal rainfall. In particular, we examine the contribution of seed bank processes to the high level of resilience shown by grass-layer vegetation in relation to fire. We assess the spatial congruence between seed bank composition and extant vegetation, document temporal variation in the germinable seed bank over the annual dry season, test the effects of laboratory-applied heat and smoke treatments on seed germinability, and determine the effect of experimental fires on seed bank composition. Although dominant species were shared, the composition of the germinable seed bank was significantly different to that of extant vegetation, with approximately half the extant species not being detected in the seed bank. The density and species richness of germinable seeds was significantly greater in the late dry season than the early dry season, with annual grasses showing particularly high levels of seed dormancy in the early dry season. The density and species richness of germinable seeds in the seed bank was significantly enhanced by laboratory-applied treatments of smoke and especially heat, driven by the response of legumes. However, fire had no significant effect on the density or species richness of germinable seeds in the field, indicating soil temperatures during fire were too low to overcome physical dormancy, or burial was too deep to experience adequate heating or smoke exposure. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the persistence of annual grasses and forbs in an environment subject to frequent fire and highly seasonal rainfall, and, together with the sprouting capacity of perennial grasses, explain the high resilience of savanna grass-layer plants in relation to fire.

J	Ferreras, AE; Galetto, L				Elisa Ferreras, Ana; Galetto, Leonardo			From seed production to seedling establishment: Important steps in an invasive process	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												It is widely accepted that exotic invasive species are one of the most important ecological and economic problems. Reproductive and establishment traits are considered key features of a population expansion process, but few works have studied many of these simultaneously. This work examines how large the differences are in reproductive and establishment traits between two Fabaceae, the exotic invasive, Gleditsia triacanthos and the native, Acacia aroma. Gleditsia is a serious leguminous woody invader in various parts of the world and Acacia is a common native tree of Argentina. Both species have similar dispersal mechanisms and their reproductive phenology overlaps. We chose 17 plants of each species in a continuous forest of the Chaco Serrano Forest of Cordoba, Argentina. In each plant we measured fruit production, fruit removal (exclusion experiments), seed predation (pre- and post-dispersal), seed germination, seed bank (on each focal tree, three sampling periods during the year), and density of seedlings (around focal individuals and randomly in the study site). Gleditsia presented some traits that could favour the invasion process, such as a higher number of seeds per plant, percentage of scarified seed germination and density of seedlings around the focal individuals, than Acacia. On the other hand, Gleditsia presented a higher percentage of seed predation. The seed bank was persistent in both species and no differences were observed in fruit removal. This work highlights the importance of simultaneously studying reproductive and establishment variables involved in the spreading of an exotic invasive species. It also gives important insight into the variables to be considered when planning management strategies. The results are discussed from the perspective of some remarkable hypotheses on invasive species and may contribute to rethinking some aspects of the theory on invasive species.

Despite extensive study, the mechanisms regulating savanna tree populations are not well understood. Recent empirical work suggests that both tree-tree competition and fire are key factors in semiarid to mesic savannas, but the potential for competition to structure savannas, particularly in interaction with fire, has received little theoretical attention. We develop a minimalistic and analytically tractable stochastic cellular automaton to study the individual and combined effects of these two factors on savannas. We find that while competition often substantially depresses tree density, fire generally has little effect but can drive tree extinction in extreme scenarios. When combined, competition and fire interact nonlinearly with strong negative consequences for tree density. This novel result may help explain observed variability among apparently similar savannas in their response to fire. Paradoxically, this interaction could also render the presence of competition more difficult to detect in empirical studies because fire can override the characteristic regular spacing driven by competition and lead instead to clustering.

Traditional land use like mowing is believed to favour orchids through increased survival and reproduction of established individuals, but the lack of data connecting their complex life cycle presently limits our ability to evaluate effects of management. Here we used data from 16 years of demographic monitoring to study how mowing affects population dynamics in two populations of the rare orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica. Both populations were characterized by long-lived individuals, low adult mortality and high seedling mortality. The traditional regime of mowing every second year strongly increased recruitment and reduced seed production in both populations, but had moderate effect on adult survival, growth rate and flowering probability. Population growth rate was positive for all population x treatment combinations. Traditional mowing significantly increased growth rate in both populations, and LTRE-analyses revealed that this primarily was a result of increased recruitment. The results indicate that demographic rates commonly associated with orchid persistence may be insensitive to traditional management, and underscores the importance of seed production and recruitment to maintain population growth in this long-lived species. The combination of low establishment success and no seed bank makes D. lapponica dependent on high seed input. Our results suggest that D. lapponica would benefit most from traditional mowing performed after seed dispersal in the study areas, but also suggest a high probability of future survival in the absence of mowing.

Seed Bank of a Bottomland Swamp in Western New York	CASTANEA												The spring seed bank in a red maple bottomland swamp along the Chadakoin River in western New York was examined. Soil samples were collected at 13 microtopographically defined microsites and placed in a greenhouse for a seed bank emergence study. Mean emergent seed density was 1,037/m(2) with a total of 2,179 seedlings emerging. A total of 81 species were identified, 18 of which were non-native. Seed bank composition was dominated by the forbs Boehmeria cylindrica, Lysimachia nummularia, and Scutellaria lateriflora. Of the seed bank species 23% were woody trees, shrubs and vines, 46% were perennial forbs, 16% were perennial graminoids, and 15% were annuals and biennials. Microsites varied in seed bank density with elevated moss, swale, mossy stump, mossy tree hummock and mossy root containing 58.3% of the emergent seedlings. Detrended Correspondence Analysis showed that berm and stump microsites differed in seed bank composition from the other microsites which were very similar to each other. The extant swamp vegetation, with 68 species in nineteen 100 m(2) plots had 39 species in common with the seed bank. Seeds of the dominant woody species (Acer x freemanii, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Ulmus americana) were present in the seed bank. The Sorenson-Dice index of similarity between the species composition of the standing vegetation and the soil seed bank based on presence/absence data was 0.347. This moderate level of similarity indicates that Bonita swamp is a mid-successional forested wetland.																	0008-7475	1938-4386				MAR	2010	75	1					19	38		10.2179/08-044.1							WOS:000277862100002						
J	Pirk, GI; de Casenave, JL				Ines Pirk, Gabriela; Lopez de Casenave, Javier			Influence of seed size on feeding preferences and diet composition of three sympatric harvester ants in the central Monte Desert, Argentina	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Selective seed consumption by harvester ants may affect seed abundance and composition and, ultimately, plant communities. We evaluated the influence of seed size on preferences and diet of Pogonomyrmex mendozanus, P. rastratus, and P. inermis in the central Monte Desert, Argentina. In choice experiments with Pappophorum spp. seeds of different sizes, P. mendozanus and P. rastratus preferred large seeds, maximizing energy reward. P. inermis showed a less-marked preference for large seeds, which was probably due to morphological constraints imposed by its small body size. Under natural conditions, none of the three species selected larger Pappophorum spp. seeds probably because of high travel and handling costs. Seeds of intermediate size predominated in the diet of the three species but a slight size match was detected as P. mendozanus carried larger seeds than P. rastratus and this than P. inermis, matching body-size differences. Thus, ants probably maximize energy reward but face morphological restrictions and higher costs when carrying and holding large seeds. While seeds of intermediate size are the most vulnerable ones to ant predation, small seeds are favored, as they are abundant in the soil seed bank and lowly predated.																	0912-3814					MAR	2010	25	2					439	445		10.1007/s11284-009-0673-7							WOS:000275705600021						
J	Fensham, RJ; Fairfax, RJ; Dwyer, JM				Fensham, R. J.; Fairfax, R. J.; Dwyer, J. M.			Vegetation responses to the first 20 years of cattle grazing in an Australian desert	ECOLOGY												Existing theoretical frameworks suggest three predictions relevant to grazing effects in Australian aridlands: grazing has a negative but moderate effect on plant species richness; a separate "state" resulting from degradation caused by extreme grazing will be evident; some plant species will have a strong association with grazing relief refuges that have only ever been subject to light grazing. These predictions were examined in the dune swales of an Australian desert, with data on herbaceous species collected along transects up to 14 km from artificial water points between four and 33 years old. A cumulative grazing index was constructed utilizing both the spatial occupation patterns of cattle and the length of exposure. Despite restricting sampling to a narrow habitat, silt/clay content and soil pH influence floristic patterns independent of grazing. The analysis of quadrat data in relation to grazing revealed almost no patterns in plant cover, species richness (at two different scales), or abundance across plant life-form groups. Five species had an increasing response, and seven a decreasing response, while the only species restricted to areas of extremely low grazing pressure was sufficiently rare that it could have occurred there by chance. The dominant annual grass, the most common shrub, and a perennial tussock-forming sedge all decrease with high levels of grazing. Most species exhibit an ephemeral life strategy in response to unreliable rainfall, and this boom and bust strategy effectively doubles as an adaptation to grazing. After 20 years of exposure to managed grazing with domestic stock in Australian dune swales, patterns in species richness have not emerged in response to grazing pressure, the ecosystem has not been transformed to another degradation "state," and there is no evidence that grazing relief refuges provide havens for species highly sensitive to grazing.

J	Morreale, SJ; Sullivan, KL				Morreale, Stephen J.; Sullivan, Kristi L.			Community-level enhancements of biodiversity and ecosystem services	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												A common management technique for preserving and maintaining biodiversity is the establishment of large refuges and preserves. Although extensive sanctuaries can provide crucial protection for many organisms and ecosystems, they cannot fulfill all the needs of regional conservation. An alternative to a few large refuges is to create many different habitats across the landscape that enhance and improve local and regional biodiversity and provide immediate benefits to nearby communities in the form of ecosystem services. Furthermore, these can all be initiated and achieved by individuals or communities. Some key landscape enhancements can be undertaken on a local level: the creation or expansion of small wooded areas, windbreaks, or hedgerows; the construction of small wetlands; and the release of some lands from heavy pressure for the reestablishment of natural ecological processes, namely, the natural accumulation of woody and other organic materials. Newly created ecosystems can be inoculated at the outset with soil biota such as seed banks, microbes, fungi, and organic material that can accelerate ecological functioning and balance. In addition to increasing much local and regional biodiversity, locally enhanced areas can provide fuel, plant and animal food and medicinal products, and agroforestry products directly to the nearby community. These small ecological oases can serve as nesting and overwintering sites for numerous pollinators that are hugely beneficial to agricultural production. Moreover, several ecosystem enhancements may contribute positively to local and regional hydrologic cycles and prevent prolonged droughts. Enhancements to local landscapes can take on many forms. We believe that any changes that increase structural complexity in natural systems almost certainly lead to increases in local biological complexity. In addition, wider landscape level considerations, such as corridors and connectivity of populations, can be integrated on a broader scale to improve regional biodiversity and ecosystem services. Small landscape enhancements undoubtedly cannot provide for all conservation needs, but they can greatly increase widespread biodiversity, restore local ecosystem services, and can be used to complement the relatively few larger parks.

J	Sampaio, MB; Scariot, A				Sampaio, Mauricio Bonesso; Scariot, Aldicir			Effects of stochastic herbivory events on population maintenance of an understorey palm species (Geonoma schottiana) in riparian tropical forest	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Plant populations can respond to temporal environmental heterogeneity caused by natural disturbances, such as herbivory. Palm individuals of several species are preyed upon by mammals but the effects of such herbivory events on population dynamics remain poorly known. To evaluate the effects of environmental stochasticity on a Geonoma schottiana (Arecaceae) population, we surveyed annuallly 40 permanent 20 x 10-m plots in a riparian tropical forest over 5 y (2000-2004) and results were analysed using matrix models. The population growth rate (lambda) was in equilibrium during the study period and only one bad year was identified (2002-2003), which had a higher mortality of juvenile individuals due to herbivory. Additionally, the bad year had a higher mortality of reproductive individuals than the other periods. The stasis matrix elements of the late life stages were the vital rates with highest elasticities. The mortality of juvenile and reproductive individuals had a negative contribution to lambda in the bad year. Conversely, the growth of infant and juvenile individuals and the clonal growth of juveniles were the vital rates with highest contribution to stability maintenance of lambda in the bad year in a life-table response experiment. the palm population had a high individual density, high proportion of the initial life stages, clonal growth, high fertility, abundant seed bank and high seedling recruitment. Despite these traits, if stochastic herbivory events occur frequently over a long period of time the population will have a negative growth rate and the probability of local extinction will be very high.

Previous work focusing mostly on global and regional scales has demonstrated the importance of historical events such as long-distance migration and colonization. Far less is known about the role of contemporary factors or environmental heterogeneity in generating diversity patterns at local scales. We sampled 1,005 individuals from 77 closely spaced stands in diverse settings around Tubingen, Germany. A set of 436 SNP markers was used to characterize genome-wide patterns of relatedness and recombination. Neighboring genotypes often shared mosaic blocks of alternating marker identity and divergence. We detected recent outcrossing as well as stretches of residual heterozygosity in largely homozygous recombinants. As has been observed for several other selfing species, there was considerable heterogeneity among sites in diversity and outcrossing, with rural stands exhibiting greater diversity and heterozygosity than urban stands. Fine-scale spatial structure was evident as well. Within stands, spatial structure correlated negatively with observed heterozygosity, suggesting that the high homozygosity of natural A. thaliana may be partially attributable to nearest-neighbor mating of related individuals. The large number of markers and extensive local sampling employed here afforded unusual power to characterize local genetic patterns. Contemporary processes such as ongoing outcrossing play an important role in determining distribution of genetic diversity at this scale. Local "outcrossing hotspots'' appear to reshuffle genetic information at surprising rates, while other stands contribute comparatively little. Our findings have important implications for sampling and interpreting diversity among A. thaliana accessions.

Comparison of Seed Bank Estimation Techniques Using Six Weed Species in Two Soil Types	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Evaluation of the viable seeds in a soil, otherwise known as the seed pool or seed bank, is a crucial component of many weed dynamic and plant ecology studies. Seed bank estimation is used to predict the possibility of future weed infestations in rangelands as well as the nascent native plant diversity within them. However, there is no standardized method of reporting seed bank evaluation techniques, limiting the ability to compare across studies. After sowing known quantities of cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum (L.); brome fescue, Vulpia bromoides (L., S.F. Gray); pigweed, Amaranthus retroflexus (L.); kochia, Kochia scoparia (L. Schrad.); lambsquarters, Chenopodium album (L.); and field pepperweed, Lepidium campestre (L. R. Br.) into sterile soil, we compared two different watering regimes in two soil types to Petri plate germination of these seeds. Seed bank estimations from the emergence method were lower compared to estimations from the Petri plate germination. Top-and-bottom watering increased absolute abundance, and the rank order of abundance among species changed with watering method. Emergence levels were the same between the two soil types. The higher water availability of the top-and-bottom watering method resulted in greater seedling emergence (26.3% +/- 10% SD vs. 9.1% +/- 7.5% SD). Lower emergence compared to germination (62.3% +/- 24.4%) may indicate that emergence is an important postgermination barrier to seedling establishment. While emergence techniques may not accurately portray the volume of seeds in the soil, they may more accurately predict which plants can become established in field conditions. Our different species abundances between watering methods show that multiple emergence methods may need to be employed to forecast a range of future rangeland conditions from the soil seed bank.

Exotic Grass Invasions: Applying a Conceptual Framework to the Dynamics of Degradation and Restoration in Australia's Tropical Savannas	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Plant invasions can cause severe degradation of natural areas. The ability of an ecosystem to recover autogenically from degradation following weed control is in part determined by the type and magnitude of changes to both biotic and abiotic processes caused by the invasion and how these interact with structural and functional components of the ecosystem. Recently, a number of conceptual frameworks have been proposed to describe the dynamics of degradation and regeneration in degraded ecosystems. We assessed the utility of one of these frameworks in describing the degradation and restoration potential of Australia's tropical savannas following exotic grass invasion. First, we identified easily measured structural characteristics of putative states. We found that a continuous cover of the exotic grasses Gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth.) and Perennial mission grass (Pennisetum polystachion (L.) Schult.) under an intact tree canopy was a common state with an understorey characterized by reduced species richness and abundance and a change in the relative contribution of functional groups. Further degradation led to a state where the canopy was severely reduced and the impacts on the understorey were more severe. In both states, the seed bank was substantially less degraded than the understorey vegetation. Guided by the framework, we combined our study with other studies to construct a conceptual model for degradation in exotic grass-invaded savannas.

To our knowledge, the fine-scale spatial structure, i.e. <2 m, has not been studied before. This study aims to make a thorough investigation of fine-scale spatial structure. Soil samples (128) were collected from each of five 2.1 m x 2.1 m plots, using a combined systematic (64) and random design (64). This allowed investigation of the fine-scale spatial structure of individual species-plot combinations using indicator-variograms. Our results indicated that over half of all species recorded in a particular plot were spatially structured. Remarkably, the presence of spatial structure seemed independent of species frequency. Visualization of the spatial structure showed an irregular spatial pattern, i.e. seed clusters that were randomly distributed in space. Spatial dependence occurred over small distances, possibly suggesting that a significant proportion of seeds was deposited near the mother plant. We conclude by presenting the relevance and implications of small-scale spatial seed-bank patterning for seed-bank sampling.

Seasonal dormancy cycles in seeds of the holoparasite Cuscuta epithymum	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed banks are often crucial for the survival of plant species, especially short-lived ones. Nevertheless, empirical studies about the fate of seeds under natural conditions are scarce, particularly for parasitic plants. Therefore, fresh seeds of the holoparasitic Cuscuta epithymum were buried in the field under natural conditions in Belgium or kept at room temperature for up to 31 months, and germination was tested periodically by incubating seeds in light at 23 degrees C. Buried C. epithymum seeds had cyclic changes in their germinability, while those stored dry at room temperature never germinated without scarification. Buried seeds exhibited a seasonal cycle of physiological dormancy, the first to be reported for a species with combinational (i.e. physical + physiological) dormancy. The physiological dormancy of the embryo was broken during winter (<= 5 degrees C) but induced during exposure to late spring temperatures (> 10 degrees C). Therefore, germination of C. epithymum seeds is fine tuned to seasonal temperature changes. Each year only a portion of the viable seeds could germinate. The portion of seeds buried in the soil that remained available for delayed germination, i.e. in the seed bank, decreased rather quickly, with only 8.5% of them being viable after 31 months of burial; all seeds stored in the laboratory remained viable. Nonetheless, we concluded that some C. epithymum seeds are capable of surviving for several years in the soil. These data indicate that the parasite is well adapted to survive in a dynamic heathland landscape where conditions for survival change constantly, but it is still sensitive to local extinction.																	0960-2585					MAR	2010	20	1					23	30		10.1017/S0960258509990225							WOS:000274691600003

Gorse is a pioneer species and forms large seed banks that can persist for a long time while buried deeply in the soil. Although many studies have been conducted on gorse seed banks in invasive contexts and in scrubland ecosystems, few data are available on forests in a native context. The aim of the present study was thus to report on the variability of seed-bank density in 'critical' stages in the forest management of pine stands (five stands) in south-western France. We examined variations in the number of gorse seeds as a function of soil depth but also of the presence and abundance of adult gorse in the understorey. Seed-bank density did not show a clear decrease in seed number with pine stand age, principally because gorse also appears to be able to establish itself in mature pine stands, probably thanks to local disturbances. In the pine stands in our study, the presence and abundance of seeds in the soil appeared to depend mostly on the presence of adult gorse as seeders in the understorey. Finally, we observed that, contrary to what has generally been found in scrubland ecosystems, most gorse seeds were located in the 5-10 cm soil layer rather than in the 0-5 cm soil layer. This depletion of the first 5 cm may be linked to seed germination that was not compensated for by the production of new seeds.

Resilience of soil seed banks to site degradation in intermittently flooded riverine woodlands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: (1) What is the recovery potential of soil seed banks of intact, average and degraded floodplain woodlands? (2) Will soil seed banks of different functional groups (native and exotic, dryland and wetland) display contrasting responses to site degradation? Location: Semi-arid, seasonally flooded woodland of eastern Australia. Methods: Diversity, abundance and composition of soil seed banks were assessed using a glasshouse study. Surface soil samples were taken from a total of nine sites with three levels of degradation (intact, average, degraded) from three microsites (sub-canopy, canopy edge, open). Results: A total of 26 662 individuals of 82 species germinated. Seed abundance increased tenfold from intact to degraded sites, but there was no effect on richness. Species composition of all functional groups varied significantly among degradation states. Seeds of native wetland and exotic dryland species were more abundant in degraded than in intact sites. However, the abundance of native dryland germinants did not differ among degradation classes and no seeds of exotic wetland species were observed. Richness of exotic dryland species was significantly higher in degraded sites. Conclusions: Increasing disturbance promoted seed banks of exotic but not native dryland species and native but not exotic wetland species. Unexpectedly, disturbance promoted the abundance of native seeds more than exotics, although this was driven by a single species. Our results suggest that the dryland phase of the floodplain community is more resilient to degradation than predicted.

J	Syphard, AD; Franklin, J				Syphard, Alexandra D.; Franklin, Janet			Species traits affect the performance of species distribution models for plants in southern California	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: To what extent do plant species traits, including life history, life form, and disturbance response characteristics, affect the degree to which species distributions are determined by physical environmental factors? Is the strength of the relationship between species distribution and environment stronger in some disturbance-response types than in others? Location: California southwest ecoregion, USA. Methods: We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 45 plant species using three primary modeling methods (GLMs, GAMs, and Random Forests). Using AUC as a performance measure of prediction accuracy, and measure of the strength of species-environment correlations, we used regression analyses to compare the effects of fire disturbance response type, longevity, dispersal mechanism, range size, cover, species prevalence, and model type. Results: Fire disturbance response type explained more variation in model performance than any other variable, but other species and range characteristics were also significant. Differences in prediction accuracy reflected variation in species life history, disturbance response, and rarity. AUC was significantly higher for longer-lived species, found at intermediate levels of abundance, and smaller range sizes. Models performed better for shrubs than sub-shrubs and perennial herbs. The disturbance response type with the highest SDM accuracy was obligate-seeding shrubs with ballistic dispersal that regenerate via fire-cued germination from a dormant seed bank. Conclusions: The effect of species characteristics on predictability of species distributions overrides any differences in modeling technique. Prediction accuracy may be related to how a suite of species characteristics co-varies along environmental gradients. Including disturbance response was important because SDMs predict the realized niche. Classification of plant species into disturbance response types may provide a strong framework for evaluating performance of SDMs.					Syphard, Alexandra/0000-0003-3070-0596												1100-9233					FEB 10	2010	21	1					177	189		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2009.01133.x							WOS:000273668300017

Integrated pest management in faba bean	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Successful production of faba bean crops in the presence of a wide range of disease-causing fungi, parasitic weeds, nematodes, insects, mites and other pests depends on the integration of genetic resistance, hygienic management, monitoring of the target organisms and timely application of appropriate chemical and biological treatments. This paper reviews the progress in this area. Arthropod management is still overly reliant on broad-spectrum insecticides for many pests, particularly aphids, but field assessment, tillage, sowing date, plant density and weed control can minimize pest incursions. Crop assessments, bait and pheromone traps and economic thresholds are used to predict and monitor arthropod pest populations, and biological measures (natural enemy conservation and bioinsecticides) and selective chemicals (less harmful to beneficial insects) are also used. Crop hygiene and seed bank demise is critical for management of broomrape, as much of its damage is done before the parasite is visible above ground. Mild herbicide treatments can prevent ripening of broomrape seeds with minimal damage to the faba bean crop. The main diseases caused by fungi, namely rust, ascochyta blight, chocolate spot and downy mildew, all spread rapidly when weather conditions are appropriate. Since these weather conditions are well characterized for each disease, it is possible to intervene strategically by treating with fungicide at times of high risk. Good sources of resistance are available to the key diseases, although few current cultivars are resistant to more than one disease. Root-lesion, stem and root-knot nematodes can cause severe yield losses but several cultivars and breeding lines of faba bean have good resistance to root-lesion nematodes and at least one has resistance to stem nematode and one to root-knot nematode. These groups of nematode species have broad host spectra so attention to rotations is particularly important. Chemical control of nematodes is difficult and biological control is still experimental. Control of the pathogenic fungi and nematodes requires that clean, non-infested seed be used and that the new crop does not get infected from debris and volunteer from the previous crop or adjacent fields. In the presence of continued selection pressure on the pathogens and pests, continued breeding for novel resistance genes, development of new selective chemicals, screening for new biocontrol agents and the design of new management strategies will all be necessary.

Vegetation restoration of secondary bare saline-alkali patches in the Songnen plain, China	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: What factors limit vegetation restoration of secondary bare saline-alkaline patches (BSAP) in the Songnen grassland of northeast China? Is there any adaptive approach to promote revegetation in the shortest time possible and at a low cost? Location: Northeast China. Methods: Considering the climate, soil saline-alkalization and available seed sources, a new approach was adopted to restore vegetation in BSAP, which were formed by the degradation of typical Leymus chinensis grasslands owing to long-term overgrazing. The experimental treatments included no treatment (CK), fencing (F), fencing+inserting cornstalks (FS), fencing+inserting cornstalks+sowing L. chinensis (FSL) and fencing+inserting cornstalks+sowing Puccinellia chinampoensis (FSP). The assumptions behind inserting cornstalks were not only that they would create safe sites for initial revegetation but also that they would enhance seed input by trapping and containing the seeds from seed movement on the BSAP surface. Results: Seed bank shortage was an important factor limiting initial revegetation in BSAP; seed movement on the BSAP surface could provide the necessary seed source if it were contained by effective measures. Vegetation at the sites FS, FSL and FSP was restored well in terms of the above-ground biomass and coverage. Inserted cornstalks acted as safe sites that enhanced the plant survival rate in BSAP; they also enhanced the ability to contain seed movement, thus providing a seed source for initial revegetation. Along with initial revegetation, tussocks around cornstalks can provide better safe sites, which in turn can accelerate subsequent vegetation restoration in BSAP. Conclusions: The approach entails the strategic use of diverse seed sources and the construction of safe sites with agricultural byproducts (cornstalks); therefore, it is a low-cost method and can be used on a widespread scale. The results provide vigorous support in favor of vegetation restoration in BSAP and severely degraded grasslands in the region. In practice, this approach can be used in degraded ecosystems with compacted soil surfaces (including arid and salt-affected soils) to promote revegetation in various regions.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				FEB	2010	13	1					47	55		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2009.01048.x							WOS:000273601700005

Restorative removal of plant litter and vegetation 40 years after abandonment enhances re-emergence of steppe grassland vegetation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The accumulation of biomass and of dead plant remains is a direct consequence of grassland abandonment. Litter can occupy potential microsites for seed germination and seedling establishment, and thus decrease species diversity in the long-term. This effect can be more accentuated in dry grassland of open structure where species are adapted to excessive light and bare surfaces during the recruitment phase. We conducted a field experiment with litter removal alone or in combination with vegetation cutting and studied germination and seedling survival during 2 years in two abandoned steppe sites. With our experimental treatments we intended to create microsites and to activate the seed bank, with the aim to enhance recruitment of dry-grassland species; potentially also those already absent from the established vegetation. Our results show, that while both treatments significantly increased recruitment by enhancing seed germination in the first year of the study, only litter removal combined with vegetation cutting significantly promoted seedling survival during both years. Our experiment demonstrated that even after 40 years of abandonment the applied measures favoured the re-emergence of target species that were very rare or absent from the above-ground vegetation of continental steppe-like grassland. Thus, management prescriptions which comprise removal of dead and even living biomass, such as mowing or grazing, are considered beneficial for this habitat type of high nature conservation priority.

Apart from the planktonic bloom period, the annual cycle of these cyanobacteria is poorly known. With a combination of pelagial monitoring, sedimentation traps and germination experiments, we studied the annual cycle of formation, sedimentation and germination of cyanobacterial akinetes (resting stages) in the northern Baltic Sea during 2005-2006. Akinetes were only rarely encountered in the fall plankton, but they were abundant in the near-bottom sedimentation trap from the middle of July to August. All three taxa formed akinetes, but the numbers of A. flos-aquae akinetes were generally low. Of the three taxa, only Anabaena spp. were regularly found to germinate from the sediment samples. Estimates of Anabaena viable seed bank size ranged from 205 to 1913 akinetes g(-1) (ww) of sediment. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae never germinated, and N. spumigena did so only occasionally. It is concluded that the three co-occurring taxa probably have different life cycle strategies, A. flos-aquae being holoplanktonic and Anabaena spp. planktonic during summer, but overwintering as akinetes in the bottom. Summer populations of N. spumigena may originate from both sedimented akinetes and trichomes that overwinter in the water Column. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial Patterns of Grass Seedling Recruitment Imply Predation and Facilitation by Harvester Ants	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Extended drought on the Edwards Plateau, TX, causes high mortality in grass species' populations and their replacement by recruitment from the seeds of survivors. Harvester ant nests may act as refugia for perennial plants during drought, as evidenced by a high survivorship of plants directly adjacent to nests. Because grasses tend to disperse seeds short distances and drought eliminated seed banks, we hypothesized that the spatial pattern of grass seedlings and adults would be clumped at small scales around these refugia. In contrast, nests would be regular at small to moderate scales. We studied the spatial patterns of seedlings, adults, and ant nest locations using a modified Ripley's K-function technique for transect data. Point data were collected along a 1-km transect. Spatially regular patterns were found for nests from 1.0- to 22.0-m scales. We found that two species' seedlings and adults were significantly clumped with ant nests, and two species had significantly regular spatial patterns with nests. Surprisingly, patterns of clumped seedlings occurred up to 30-m scales with nests. Nests appear to affect seedling establishment at multiple scales. These results suggest that nests may facilitate colonization for some grass populations, but regular spatial patterns in other species imply that forager seed harvest may inhibit establishment.

Long-term changes in the flora of the cereal ecosystem on the Sussex Downs, England, focusing on the years 1968-2005	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. There has been a surge of interest in the effects of modern agriculture on biodiversity but studies of farmland flora have lacked continuity and historical context. Here we present the results of 38 years of annual monitoring of the weed flora of cereal crops on the Sussex Downs. 2. This study investigates the long-term changes in abundance of 214 weed species, two subspecies and one forma found in the cereal fields of a 62-km2 area of the Sussex Downs. Species occurrence and weed abundance were recorded annually in June from 1970 to 2005 inclusive. Stubbles were surveyed in 1968, 1971, 2004 and 2005. 3. Annual archaeophytes and perennial natives predominated and the community belonged to the Papaver rhoeas-Silene noctiflora association (OV16) of the UK National Vegetation Classification. 4. Overall, 97% of fields were treated with herbicides prior to sampling, reducing dicotyledonous weed abundance by 64% and taxon occurrence by 52%. From 1970 to 2005 there was no trend in overall abundance of dicotyledons, although monocotyledons decreased by 13% relative to the early 1970s. 5. Of 66 taxa monitored from 1970 to 2005, 18 increased, 38 rose and fell (or vice versa) and 10 showed no trend. Annuals increased until the early 1980s, when many were not susceptible to herbicides, before levelling off or declining slightly as the efficacy of herbicides expanded. 6. Perennial dicotyledons increased steadily throughout the study. This latter change was due to the loss of traditional leys, not to changes in herbicide efficacy. 7. Ninety-two species of dicotyledons were found on stubbles, with no significant overall change in occurrence from 1968-1971 to 2004-2005. In both stubbles and crops, species uncommon at the start have tended to increase whereas common species have tended to decrease. 8. Combining this study with earlier records, we estimate that 16 weed species have been lost from the study area and 15 gained. Before 1970, the loss rate of archaeophytes and the gain rate of neophytes were both higher than for other species. Most species lost were historically uncommon whereas many of the species gained are now common. 9. Synthesis and applications. The soil seed bank remains sufficient to enable a rapid restoration of the pre-herbicide flora where needed for wildlife conservation purposes, without 'enhancement', i.e. seeding. The means to do this are available through the UK's agri-environment 'in-field measures', but these are very unpopular with farmers. Incentives need to be much improved to ensure the future conservation of the traditional arable flora.																	0021-8901					FEB	2010	47	1					215	226		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01742.x							WOS:000274191300025

Influences of interyear rainfall variability and microhabitat on the germinable seed bank of annual plants in a sandy Monte Desert	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We addressed the effects of growing-season rainfall of two consecutive years and of two microhabitats on seed density and floristic composition of the germinable seed bank of annual plants in a sandy desert. We hypothesised that seed composition and density is affected by the presence of vegetated patches, but that this effect varies according to rainfall. We predict an overall lower soil-seed density with higher values under shrubs after a dry growing season. We found significant effects of interyear variability and microhabitat on the germinable soil seed bank of annual plants. Twice as many germinable seeds were present in soil after the rainy summer than after the drier summer. Moreover, seed density under shrubs was 1.3 times greater than on bare ground. Although we found no statistic interaction between factors affecting the germinable soil seed density, the relative amount of germinable seeds under shrubs increased after a drier growing season. Species composition showed non-additive effects for the interaction of precedent growing-season rainfall and microhabitat, resulting in four species-assemblages. Altogether, our findings suggest that shrub patches and rainfall events of the precedent growing season may affect the abundance and identity of ephemeral and annual plant species in the germinable seed bank.

A plurality of causal mechanisms explains the persistence or transience of soil seed banks	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Annual forbs form short-term persistent soil seed banks whereas perennial grasses form mostly transient ones in the central Monte desert. A conceptual framework predicts that annual forb seeds will have primary dormancy, whereas perennial grasses will have low dormancy levels. We assessed whether the dormancy traits of four annual forb species and five perennial grass species can account for their soil seed bank dynamics. To overcome dormancy, we treated perennial grasses and autumn annual forbs with high temperatures, and spring annual forbs with low temperatures. To force seeds into secondary dormancy we exposed non-dormant perennial grasses to low temperatures. Most of the annual forbs and two perennial grasses (Setaria leucopila and Sporobolus cryptandrus) showed low germination rates. The remaining perennial grasses presented moderate (Pappophorum caespitosum and Digitaria californica) or high germination levels (Trichloris crinita). Low temperatures increased germination in spring forbs (Chenopodium papulosum and Parthenium hysterophorus), but high temperatures did not break dormancy in autumn forbs (Sphaeralcea miniata and Phacelia artemisioides). Germination of perennial grasses increased after they had been exposed to high temperatures, but only two species reentered into dormancy under low temperature. Given that in the central Monte desert winter-autumn granivores eat mainly grass seeds, we conclude that high seed dormancy and low consumption may contribute to the persistent soil seed bank of most forbs, and that seed dormancy itself does not explain the transience of grass seed banks.

The interaction of temperature, water availability and fire cues regulates seed germination in a fire-prone landscape	OECOLOGIA												Ambient temperature and water availability regulate seasonal timing of germination. In fire-prone landscapes, the role of fire-related cues in affecting the range of temperatures and water potentials (psi s) across which germination can occur is poorly known, especially in non-Mediterranean landscapes. We examined interactive effects of temperature (15 or 25A degrees C), psi (0 to -0.9 MPa), and fire-related cues (heat and smoke) on germination for seeds of three shrub species from fire-prone southeastern Australia. Incubation temperature affected germination of untreated seeds of Kunzea ambigua and Kunzea capitata (Myrtaceae) (reduction at 25A degrees C), but germination was uniformly low in Epacris obtusifolia (Ericaceae). Decreasing psi reduced germination across both incubation temperatures. Fire cues increased germination at both incubation temperatures and across psi s, although in Kunzea the increase was smaller and occurred over a narrower range of psi s at 25A degrees C. Hydrotime analysis suggested that fire cues reduced the amount of water necessary for germination of Kunzea seeds. Post-fire germination of the three study species may occur during the warm season, although it is reduced and confined to wet periods for the two Kunzea species. Warm season germination of the study species is consistent with a trade-off between the increased risk of failure of a cohort of seedlings, and benefits of early establishment of a cohort that may survive in an environment with aseasonal rainfall.

Two levels of fire severity estimated by the levels of tree crown damage-scorched and unaffected crown-were compared. Seed dispersal and first cohort pine (November 2001) seedling density, before salvage logging, were significantly and positively affected by fire severity. Between November and January, a fungal attack caused a noticeable decrease in seedling density in both levels of fire severity. The first cohort survival was significantly reduced by harvesting and slash treatments carried out in February 2002. However, slash chopping favoured a new pine cohort, particularly in the unaffected crown plots, in which seedling density was significantly higher than in the scorched crown plots between July 2002 and February 2003. First cohort seedling survival and height were positively related. Fire severity levels, combined with post fire management, did not appear to determine final pine seedling density and height. Finally, reduction in seedling density caused by post-fire management did not threaten pine establishment and may reduce the need for subsequent thinning operations.

Vegetation data were collected by permanent plots from the restoration site and adjacent, reference salt marshes during three consecutive periods. Seed length, width and mass were used as dispersal traits, and Ellenberg moisture, salinity and nutrient indices as indicators of site suitability. Seed production in the reference site and seed bank in the restoration site were also investigated. The establishment of salt-marsh species within the restoration site was rapid (less than 5 years). The cover of plant species was not correlated between the restored and the reference sites at the first year of restoration, but this correlation was significant during the following years. Seed availability was more important in explaining the sequence of species establishment than salt and nutrient-limitation tolerance. The first colonizers are known as massive seed producers, with shorter seed length and lower seed mass, which probably increased buoyancy. Among dispersal and site traits, seed length and mass, and in a less extent salinity and nutrients, indicated a relationship with new colonizers. Despite few species have not (yet) appeared in vegetation and seed bank in the restoration site, the existence of an existing salt marsh adjacent to the restoration site is shown to be vital for fast colonization of newly created intertidal areas.

Inter-population variation in seed longevity for two invasive weeds: Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp monilifera (boneseed) and ssp rotundata (bitou bush)	WEED RESEARCH												P>Seed longevity has a major influence on the success of weed management and eradication programmes. A correlation between responses to a controlled aging test performed at 45 degrees C, 60% relative humidity (RH) and seed persistence in the field has recently been suggested. Here we investigated whether collections of differing quality of two closely related invasive weeds, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera and ssp. rotundata (boneseed and bitou bush, respectively), had different seed longevity using the controlled aging test. Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera fruits were collected from across five Australian states, and C. monilifera ssp. rotundata from one state, covering their invasive ranges. Seed quality was assessed visually and using tetrazolium staining, and a series of germination tests established appropriate germination conditions. The controlled aging test was run for a subset of collections. Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata seeds died more quickly (time to lose 50% viability, P-50 = 16 days) than the C. monilifera ssp. monilifera collections (P-50 = 47 days) when aged at 45 degrees C and 60% RH. This difference was significant even considering the large differences in longevity between C. monilifera ssp. monilifera populations (P-50 = 35-61 days; probably due to differences in maturity at collection). Based on a published correlation, we predict that mature C. monilifera ssp. monilifera may have a long-lived (> 3 years) seed bank and C. monilifera ssp. rotundata may have a transient (< 1 year) seed bank. This suggests the two sub-species should be considered separately when designing effective control measures.

J	Colbach, N; Darmency, H; Tricault, Y				Colbach, Nathalie; Darmency, Henri; Tricault, Yann			Identifying key life-traits for the dynamics and gene flow in a weedy crop relative: Sensitivity analysis of the GENESYS simulation model for weed beet (Beta vulgaris ssp vulgaris)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The benefits of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) varieties stem from their presumed ability to improve weed control and reduce its cost, particularly targeting weed beet, a harmful annual weedy form of the genus Beta (i.e. B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) frequent in sugar beet fields. As weed beet is totally interfertile with sugar beet, it is thus likely to inherit the herbicide-tolerance transgene through pollen-mediated gene flow. Hence, the foreseeable advent of HT weed beet populations is a serious threat to the sustainability of GM sugar beet cropping systems. For studying and quantifying the long-term effects of cropping system components (crop succession and cultivation techniques) on weed beet population dynamics and gene flow, we developed a biophysical process-based model called GENESYS-BEET in a previous study. In the present paper, the model was employed to identify and rank the weed life-traits as function of their effect on weed beet densities and genotypes, using a global sensitivity analysis to model parameters. Monte Carlo simulations with simultaneous randomization of all life-trait parameters were carried out in three cropping systems contrasting for their risk for infestation by HT weed beets. Simulated weed plants and bolters (i.e. beet plants with flowering and seed-producing stems) were then analysed with regression models as a function of model parameters to rank processes and life-traits and quantify their effects. Key parameters were those determining the timing and success of growth, development, seed maturation and the physiological end of seed production. Timing parameters were usually more important than success parameters, showing for instance that optimal timing of weed management operations is more important than its exact efficacy. The ranking of life-traits though depended on the cropping system and, to a lesser extent, on the target variable (i.e. GM weeds vs. total weed population). For instance, post-emergence parameters were crucial in rotations with frequent sugar beet crops whereas pre-emergence parameters were most important when sugar beet was rare. In the rotations with frequent sugar beet and insufficient weed control, interactions between traits were small, indicating diverse populations with contrasted traits could prosper. Conversely, when sugar beet was rare and weed control optimal, traits had little impact individually, indicating that a small number of optimal combinations of traits would be successful. Based on the analysis of sugar beet parameters and genetic traits, advice for the future selection of sugar beet varieties was also given. In climatic conditions similar to those used here, the priority should be given to limiting the presence of hybrid seeds in seed lots rather than decreasing varietal sensitivity to vernalization.

Non-linear ecological processes, fires, environmental heterogeneity and shrub invasion in northwestern Patagonia	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The emergent behaviors of nature are not only the sum of interactions among ecosystem parts but also depend on the organization of these interactions. Fire, climate and vegetation patterns produce non-linear fire propagation across the landscape. Environmental heterogeneity, like outcrop presence and hare density, increases landscape patchiness and makes possible the occupation of fire refuges by plants, like Fabiana imbricata shrubs. We monitored shrub recruitment and cover during nine postfire years in northwestern Patagonia grasslands and we studied the long-term population dynamics under different environmental conditions through a matrix model, exploring different fire frequencies and spring precipitation regimes. Both, the field monitoring and the model seem to confirm the relationships between shrub invasion and fire. The climate change forecast predicts an increase in the frequency of El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena that could causes more coupled fires-rainy springs in northwestern Patagonia, and consequently, more recruitment windows for shrubs, like F. imbricata. The matrix model also indicates that this scenario would be the most favourable for shrub invasion. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the ecosystem properties and processes, providing useful information to improve the grasslands sustainable use. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

THE ROLE OF SEED BANK IN THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERSTOREY IN AN OAK FOREST IN HUNGARY	ACTA BIOLOGICA HUNGARICA												We studied the potential role of seed bank in the dynamics of the understorey in a turkey oak-sessile oak forest (Querceteum petraeae-cerris) in Hungary. We used long-term records of the herb layer (1973-2006) and the seed bank composition of 2006 to assess the role of seed bank in the regeneration of herb layer. The total cover of herb layer decreased from 22% (1973) to 6% (1988), and remained low (< 10%) till 2006; coinciding with the increasing cover of secondary canopy dominated by Acer campestre. We found a low density seed bank (ca. 1300 seeds/m(2)). Altogether 33 species were germinated from the soil samples. A few generalist weed species composed the majority of seed bank. It was possible to assign a seed bank type for 19 species; 14 species out of 19 was long-term persistent. We found that the characteristic perennial forest herbs and grasses had only sparse seed bank. The Jaccard similarity between vegetation and seed bank was low (< 30%). Our results suggest that the continuous establishment of forest herbs are not based on local persistent seed bank; it should be based on vegetative spreading and/or seed rain.

SEED LONGEVITY AND GERMINATION CHARACTERISTICS OF SIX FEN PLANT SPECIES	ACTA BIOLOGICA HUNGARICA												Fens are among the most threatened habitats in Europe as their area has decreased considerably in the last centuries. For successful management and restoration conservationists need detailed knowledge about seed bank formation and seed longevity of plants, as these features are closely related to successional and vegetation dynamical processes. I analysed seed longevity and the germination characteristics of six fen plant species by seed burial experiments. Based on seed weight, seed bank was expected for long-term persistent for the light-seeded Schoenus nigricans, Carex appropinquata, C. pseudocyperus, C. davalliana and Peucedanum palustre and also that for the medium-seeded Cicuta virosa. It was proved that, the latter two species have short-term persistent seed banks, while Carex pseudocyperus has a transient seed bank, therefore these species may only have a limited role in restoration from seed banks. It was found that Schoenus nigricans, Carex appropinquata and C. davalliana have persistent seed banks, because some of their four-year-old seeds have emerged. Fresh seeds had low germination rate in all studied species and majority of seeds emerged after winter, except for Carex pseudocyperus. After the germination peak in spring, the majority of the ungerminated seeds of Schoenus nigricans, Peucedanum palustre, Carex appropinquata, C. davalliana and Cicuta virosa entered a secondary dormancy phase that was broken in autumn. I found the seasonal emergence of the latter three species highly similar.																	0236-5383						2010	61			S			197	205		10.1556/ABiol.61.2010.Suppl.19							WOS:000290954500019	21565777					
J	Wodkiewicz, M; Kwiatkowska-Falinska, AJ				Wodkiewicz, Maciej; Kwiatkowska-Falinska, Anna Justyna			SIMILARITY BETWEEN SEED BANK AND HERB LAYER IN A NATURAL DECIDUOUS TEMPERATE LOWLAND FOREST	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Forest seed banks mostly studied in managed forests proved to be small, species poor and not reflecting above-ground species composition. Yet studies conducted in undisturbed communities indicate a different seed bank characteristic. Therefore we aimed at describing soil seed bank in an undisturbed forest in a remnant of European lowland temperate forests, the Bialowieza Forest. We compared similarity between the herb layer and seed bank, similarity of seed bank between different patches, and dominance structure of species in the herb layer and in the seed bank of two related oak-hornbeam communities. We report relatively high values of Sorensen species similarity index between herb layer and seed bank of both patches. This suggests higher species similarity of the herb layer and soil seed bank in natural, unmanaged forests represented by both plots than in fragmented communities influenced by man. Although there was a set of core seed bank species present at both plots, yielding high Sorensen species similarity index values, considerable differences between plots in seed bank size and dominance structure of species were found, indicating spatial variability of studied seed bank generated by edaphic conditions. Dominance structure of species in the herb layer was not reflected in the underlying seed bank. This stresses, that natural forest regeneration cannot rely only on the seed bank, although some forest species are capable of forming soil seed banks. While forest seed banks may not reflect vegetation composition of past successional stages, they may inform on history and land use of a specific plot.

THE ROLE OF SEED ECOLOGY IN IMPROVING WEED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN THE TROPICS	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 105	Advances in Agronomy											Weed seed banks reflect past weed populations and management practices and are the source of weed infestations to come. The factors affecting weed seed germination, however, are often poorly understood. Depleting the soil seed bank and influencing germination patterns are common goals of enduring cultural weed management practices. Greater understanding of the factors influencing the germination of weed seeds could facilitate the development of more effective cultural weed management practices through either suppressing germination or encouraging germination at times when seedlings can be readily controlled. Such cultural methods may contribute to overcoming problems such as feral crops (e.g., weedy rice), crop volunteers, and the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds that have, in some systems, increased to a point where the lack of sustainable practices is a threat to productivity. Weed seed germination is commonly influenced by light exposure, soil moisture, burial depth through tillage, the use of mulches, fire for land clearance, and flooding of the soil. Harnessing these factors to influence germination can serve as major entry points for improved weed management. Diverse crop production systems provide a wide range of examples to illustrate how recent advances in the understanding of the responses of weed seed germination can be used to develop new and sustainable cultural management of weeds. Crop management practices, such as adopting no-till crops or delaying tillage, that increase weed seed exposure to predators (ants, beetles, etc.) could be incorporated into integrated weed management programs. Retention of crop residue on the soil surface under no-till systems can suppress weed seedling emergence, delay the time of emergence, and allow the crop to gain an advantage over weeds, and reduce the need for control. Rotation of tillage or crop establishment system could also be adopted to deflect the "trajectories" of likely weed population shifts. In rice, flooding after herbicide application or hand weeding can largely prevent the growth of weeds and reduce the need for further interventions.

ROLE OF FIRE ON PATAGONIAN GRASSLANDS: CHANGES IN ABOVEGROUND VEGETATION AND SOIL SEED BANK	ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH, VOL 2	Advances in Environmental Research-Nova											Grasslands, dominated by herbaceous and woody vegetation, are ecosystems whose structure is determined by fire, grazing, and drought. Although these structuring factors determine the natural dynamics of grasslands, their plant biodiversity can be affected when these disturbances occur in an extreme or unbalanced way. The Argentinean northwestern Patagonian grasslands are fire-prone ecosystems, and fire events have relevant implications for the vegetation recovery. In this chapter, we will focus on the postfire dynamics of aboveground vegetation and seed bank. The results indicate that grasslands are resilient to fire, evidencing a fast vegetation recovery. Fire promotes recruitment opportunities to native shrubs and fugitive species. Some of these species come from the seed bank, increasing the aboveground vegetation biodiversity. Fires also contribute to the spread of exotic species that have already invaded Patagonian grasslands. Therefore, fire has multiple effects on grassland dynamics, but more long-term studies are necessary in order to propose management guidelines for the sustainable use of these ecosystems in ways compatible with biodiversity conservation. In addition, owing to global climate change, an increase of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) frequency and amplitude is expected. Considering that the wildfire regime is affected by ENSO, it is important to find the relationships between this phenomenon, fire and vegetation patterns. Several relevant questions arise in relation to the future of grasslands as important suppliers of goods and services, and as irreplaceable biodiversity source.																			978-1-60741-793-4				2010	2						243	264									WOS:000284342500007

Aspects of the seed ecology of Acacia karroo in the Eastern Cape, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Seed ecology may play a role in the widespread increase of Acacia karroo in savanna and grassland. Accordingly, fecundity, predation, mortality by fire, dispersal by livestock, and seed longevity were studied. Seed production per tree (P of pod production, pods per tree) was positively related to tree height, negatively related to tree density, and was greater for sites receiving run-on. Predispersal predation by bruchids, cerambycids, and wasps depleted seed production by 18%. The ant Messor capensis effectively eliminated surface seed except during the early dry season following seed shed. Rodent predation of seed was minimal. Fires 100 degrees C killed most exposed seed but a thin layer of soil increased survival and maintained germinability. A greater proportion of ingested seeds passed through cattle (57%) and sheep (50%) than through goats (15%). 50% of seeds were recovered within 48 h. During passage, soft seeds were digested, some hard seeds were softened, but most were egested as hard seeds; germinability was not increased. Cattle were confirmed as dispersal agents. Using experimental seed banks, it was shown that buried or surface-exposed seeds did not persist for longer than a year, but 24% of surface-shaded seeds persisted for two years. Most seeds germinated but most buried seeds died before emergence. Seed persistence in deep shade should facilitate invasion into grassland. Seed banks of. A. karroo did not exceed 18 seeds m-2 because of the above-described effects. Seed availability (fecundity, dispersal by cattle, seed longevity) is concluded to contribute to the invasiveness of A. karroo, but use of fire may offer partial control of seed availability.																	1022-0119						2010	27	2					77	87	PII 925482702	10.2989/10220119.2010.502647							WOS:000280771900002

AGROCIENCIA												Lolium rigidum is a major grass weed of winter cereals in the Mediterranean area, in spite of the continuous use of herbicides in these crops. New management approaches focus on the reduction of the seed banks by enhancing crop competitiveness and, consequently, minimizing weed seed rain. However, the spatial heterogeneity that exists within fields results in differences in the growth and the competitiveness of crops and weeds. In order to determine if the competitive interactions between barley and L. rigidum are site-specific biomass and seed production of this weed, growing in monoculture (plots with L. rigidum) and in mixed culture (plots with L. rigidum+barley), were studied at three sites (in upland, mid-slope and lowland positions) within barley fields. In each site were determined weed populations, and in soil separates, nutrient content, organic matter, slope and orientation were determined for each site. Crop presence significantly reduced weed biomass between 5 and 79 % and seeds per spike between 10 and 48 %, depending on the site. The competitive effect of the crop was greater in the more fertile sites (with higher N, P and organic matter content). In these sites, differences in plant biomass accumulation between the weed in monoculture and the weed in mixed culture started to be significant after stem elongation. Regardless the reduction in the number of seeds per spike observed in the most fertile sites, seed rain (measured as seeds m(-2)) could still be very important if weed density of the site is high. The differences in the competitive interactions between barley and L. rigidum observed within the fields suggest that adequate crop husbandry practices addressed site-specifically to enhance crop competitiveness can play an important role as a mechanism to reduce L. rigidum populations over the long term.

The predictability, the length of the flood pulse, the abrupt transition in the environmental conditions along topographic gradients on the banks of major rivers in Central Amazonia, and the powerful water and sediment dynamics impose a strong selective pressure on plant reproduction systems. Scope In this review, we examine how the hydrological cycle influences the strategies of sexual and asexual reproduction in herbaceous and woody plants. These are of fundamental importance for the completion of the life cycle. Possible constraints to seed germination, seedling establishment and formation of seed banks are also covered. Likewise, we also discuss the importance of river connectivity for species propagation and persistence in floodplains. Conclusions The propagation and establishment strategies employed by the highly diversified assortment of different plant life forms result in contrasting successional stages and a zonation of plant assemblages along the flood-level gradient, whose species composition and successional status are continuously changing not only temporally but also spatially along the river channel.

An area close to the lagoon will be restored now to improve water quality and to recover submerged vegetation. To have information on the background of the charophytes from this area, four 80-87 cm long sediment cores were extracted from the lagoon. The subfossil charophyte fructifications (oospores and gyrogonites) were isolated and identified in two of the four cores. Moreover, sediment core fractions from the third and fourth cores were allowed to germinate under several conditions. The study of the lagoon sediments has revealed that at least I I morphologies of charophyte fructifications existed in the past. Ten of these were determined at species level: Chara vulgaris, Chara hispida, Chara aspera, Chara baltica, Chara tomentosa, Chara globularis, Lamprothamnium papulosum, Nitella hyalina, Tolypella glomerata and Tolypella hispanica. However, one form of Chara gyrogonite did not fit in any known species. L papulosum oospores and gyrogonites were the most abundant and concentrated in the deepest sediment layers when the lagoon held brackish water. Large changes in salinity due to freshwater input drove charophyte species substitution (disappearance of L. papulosum). During the oligohaline period C vulgaris sexual propagules were the most abundant. The last charophyte community before its disappearance due to eutrophication was composed mainly of C. hispida, C. tomentosa and N. hyalina (the two latter with small numbers of oospores in the sediment). To characterize the morphology of the unidentified gyrogonite species, 100 specimens were studied. This type could be a local variety of a more common species, probably C vulgaris, grown under particular ecological conditions. Old collected oospores (more than 45 years old) germinated and could be identified as C vulgaris and C hispida. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There was no significant difference in final germination of M. spicatum among water level treatments, but A malaianus germinations at 1 cm and 12 cm water levels were better than at 0 cm water level at temperatures of 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Little to no germination was observed for either species at the temperature of 10 degrees C. At 15 degrees C, however, germination increased significantly to 66.3-70.6% for M. spicatum and to 29.4-48.1% for P. malaianus under all three water level treatments. Increased temperature from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C had no significant effect on the final germination of M. spicatum except at the 1 cm water level, but enhanced significantly the germination of P. malaianus. Analysis of the mean time to germination revealed that M. spicatum was a faster germinator relative to P. malaianus. The two species' germination differed markedly in response to burial depth. Germination percentage of M. spicatum was 71.3% at 0 cm burial depth, but decreased to 5.0% and to 2.5% at depths of I cm and 2 cm, respectively; whereas germination percentages of P. malaianus were 40.0%, 23.8%, 12.5%, 7.5% and 1.3% at depths of 0 cm, I cm, 2 cm, 3 cm and 5 cm, respectively. We concluded that the two species respond differently to germination strategies. The findings provided further insight into how germination strategy contributes to the seed bank formation and species invasion. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bai, WJ; Mitchley, J; Jiao, JY				Bai, Wen-Juan; Mitchley, Jonathan; Jiao, Ju-Ying			Soil Seed Bank and Standing Vegetation of Abandoned Croplands on Chinese Loess Plateau: Implications for Restoration	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Vegetation succession depends on the availability of suitable propagules in the soils, and an understanding of soil seed banks is important for effective vegetation restoration of abandoned croplands. Aims of this study were to identify characteristics of soil seed bank, relationship with standing vegetation, and potential significance of soil seed bank for vegetation restoration in abandoned croplands on the hilly-gullied Loess Plateau. Results of field survey, germination, and correspondence analysis showed that density of soil seed bank ranged from almost 900 through almost 6470 seeds m(-2) at 0-5 cm depth and almost 120 through almost 2470 seeds m(-2) at 5-10 cm depth, with species richness of 7-14. Early successional species dominated soil seed bank, while later successional species occurred only at low densities. Similarity between soil seed bank and standing vegetation was low (with an average of 0.261). Most important variables contributing to the variation of the standing vegetaion included soil water, extractable P, soil seed bank density, and aspect. Soil seed bank alone explained 32% of vegetation community variation. Potential for vegetation restoration from soil seed banks is limited, and it is recommended to transplant some later successional species into abandoned croplands to accelerate succession.																	1532-4982	1532-4990					2010	24	2					98	116		10.1080/15324981003635461							WOS:000276033100002

The results indicated that there were significant differences in the soil seed banks composition among the microhabitats in both areas, while the orientation effects were detected at the revegetated site, where the wind plays an important role in structuring the soil seed banks. There were more forb seeds in southeastern and southwestern directions of the C. korshinskii shrubs than in the northwest and northeast, and their abundance decreased from microhabitats under the shrub canopies, to the shrub edges, and to the intercanopy spaces. The grass seeds, by contrast, were most abundant at the intercanopy spaces, intermediate at the edges of the shrub canopies, and lowest at the centre of the patch under the shrub canopies. There was high seed density heterogeneity within the four microhabitat classes of the orientation from the revegetated shrub patches. Differences between microhabitats were greatest in the revegetated site and tended to disappear in the natural site. Seed densities in the natural site were around 3.6 times greater than in the revegetated site, this difference was mainly accounted for by the annual forbs and grasses in the natural site and suggests that for the desert ecosystems restoration will be a long-term process in terms of the spatial soil seed banks variation.																	1532-4982						2010	24	3					238	252		10.1080/15324981003745005							WOS:000278418500005

J	Castillejo, JM; Castello, R				Castillejo, Jose M.; Castello, Ricardo			Influence of the Application Rate of an Organic Amendment (Municipal Solid Waste [MSW] Compost) on Gypsum Quarry Rehabilitation in Semiarid Environments	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Rehabilitation of open-cast gypsum mines is made difficult by the permanent loss of the original soil resource. Soil development can be accelerated by using organic amendments (e.g., MSW compost), which provide both physical (structural) enhancement and chemical (nutrient) reinforcement. Excess of salts as a result of the effect of refuse application can lead to overfertilizing for some species and the species Atriplex halimus L. (Chenopodiaceae) can be considered an effective indicator of the optimum organic amendment rate. Four treatments of composted urban municipal solid waste (MSW compost) were applied to the top flat area of a gypsum spoil [soil-forming material (SFM)], being then the surface covered with natural topsoil layer coming from the head of the quarry. Soil and vegetation sampling was made over a four-year period. As a result of the physical and chemical effects of the organic amendment on soil properties, a close relationship existed between application rate and Atriplex halimus presence. Based on the results of this study, gypsum quarry rehabilitation in semiarid environments may be facilitated by the use of medium organic amendment rates. High rates caused halophyte species such as Atriplex halimus to grow in such a way that development of native gypsiferous species was hindered by the competitive processes. On the other hand, low rates seemed to have no beneficial effect on soil.																	1532-4982						2010	24	4					344	364	PII 926378839	10.1080/15324982.2010.502920							WOS:000281360000005

Comparative longevity and low-temperature storage of seeds of Hydatellaceae and temporary pool species of south-west Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The comparative longevity of seeds of species from the early-angiosperm group, Hydatellaceae, along with other temporary wetland aquatics from the South-west Australian Floristic Region were tested under standard experimental storage conditions. In contrast to recent hypotheses proposing that seeds from basal angiosperm species may be short-lived in storage, seeds of the Hydatellaceae species (Trithuria submersa Hook. f. and T. austinensis D. D. Sokoloff, Remizowa, T. Macfarlane and Rudall) were longer-lived than the other temporary wetland aquatic species tested. Seeds of Glossostigma drummondii Benth. (Scrophulariaceae), Myriophyllum petreaum Orchard and M. balladoniense Orchard (Haloragaceae), lost viability quickly and are thus predicted to be short-lived in seed bank storage. To assist seed bank conservation programs, the effect of seed moisture content on the viability of seeds stored for 1, 6 and 12 months at -18 degrees C or in vapour phase cryopreservation (-150 degrees C) was determined. Seeds of all species survived storage at both temperatures for up to 12 months, provided seed equilibrium relative humidity was below similar to 50%. Given the high conservation value of Hydatellaceae species and the potential short-lived nature of seeds of some of the species, we recommend that ex situ conservation programs for these aquatic species should consider cryopreservation as a means to maximise the longevity of their seeds.

J	Venn, SE; Morgan, JW				Venn, Susanna E.; Morgan, John W.			Soil seedbank composition and dynamics across alpine summits in south-eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Alpine soil seedbanks are generally regarded as small and unimportant to regeneration. Here, we investigate for the first time the composition of the readily germinable soil seedbank across alpine summits in south-eastern Australia. We aimed to compare the species in the seedbank with the standing vegetation, show seasonal variations in seedbank composition and identify regeneration strategies of alpine seedbank species. By using standard glasshouse and cold-stratification germination techniques, the germinable soil seedbank across the study region was found to comprise 39 species from 25 families, with species from the Asteraceae the most common. Persistent seedbanks were found across all eight alpine summits (1668-1970 m), comparable in seed density (150 +/- 27 to 1330 +/- 294 per m(2)) with those of other alpine areas in the northern and southern hemispheres. The density of germinable seeds varied widely among sites and between collection times (autumn, spring) and there were no trends in seed density with altitude. The qualitative and quantitative similarity between the seedbank species and the standing vegetation was low. Correlations between the proportions of species in regeneration categories (from obligate seeders, through to vegetative regenerators) in the standing vegetation and the seedbank were also poor. Our results indicate a divergence between the species in the current standing vegetation and those present in the readily germinable soil seed bank. The current patterns and predominance of seed-regenerating species in the seedbank indicate that these species may have an important role to play in regulating and contributing to future changes in the vegetation assemblage.

In Europe, commercial seed mixtures, which are widely used for restoration measures, mostly consist of species and varieties of non-local provenance. The regional biodiversity of a given landscape, however, can be preserved only when seeds or plants of local provenance are used in restoration projects. Furthermore, the transfer of suitable target species of local provenance can strongly enhance restoration success. We review and evaluate the success of currently used near-natural methods for the introduction of target plant species (e.g. seeding of site-specific seed mixtures, transfer of fresh seed-containing hay, vacuum harvesting, transfer of turves or seed-containing soil) on restoration sites, ranging from dry and mesic meadows to floodplain grasslands and fens. Own data combined with literature findings show species establishment rates during the initial phase as well as the persistence of target species during long-term vegetation development on restoration sites. In conclusion, our review indicates that seed limitation can be overcome successfully by most of the reviewed measures for species introduction. The establishment of species-rich grasslands is most successful when seeds, seed-containing plant material or soil are spread on bare soil of ex-arable fields after tilling or topsoil removal, or on raw soils, e.g. in mined areas. In species-poor grasslands without soil disturbance and on older ex-arable fields with dense weed vegetation, final transfer rates were the lowest. For future restoration projects, suitable measures have to be chosen carefully from case to case as they differ considerably in costs and logistic effort. Long-term prospects for restored grassland are especially good when management can be incorporated in agricultural systems.

We investigated the influence of plant cover and diversity on interrill erosion on a disturbed alpine site. Rainfall simulations were conducted on micro-scale plots (25 x 25 cm) with different degrees of vegetation cover and plant functional group diversity. We selected plots with 10%, 30% and 60% of vegetation cover containing different plant functional groups: (i) grasses, (ii) forbs, (iii) cryptogams (moss and/or lichens), and all possible combinations of these three groups. On each plot a rain intensity of 375 ml min(-1) (30 mm) was applied for 5 min. The degree of vegetation cover had the largest effect on interrill erosion. At 60% vegetation cover, the sediment yield was reduced by 83% in comparison to the un-vegetated ground. In the plots with 60% vegetation cover, an increase in functional group diversity decreased the sediment yield significantly. Sediment yield was three times lower in the presence of three plant functional groups than in systems with one plant functional group. Combinations of plant functional groups including grasses reduced the sediment yield more than other combinations. The findings of this study support the view that beside the re-establishment of a closed vegetation cover, a high plant functional diversity can be a relevant factor to further reduce interrill erosion at disturbed sites in alpine ecosystems.

Plant species will respond variously via phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary adaptation, migration, or extinction. When fragmentation limits migration potential of many species or when natural migration rates are outstripped by the pace of climate change, some propose purposeful, human-mediated migration (assisted migration) as a solution. Here, we join the debate on assisted migration, and while recognizing the potential negative impacts, present a strategy to collect and bank seeds of plant species at risk of extinction in the face of rapid climate change to ensure that emerging habitats are as species-diverse as possible. We outline the framework currently being used by the Dixon National Tall-grass Prairie Seed Bank to prioritize species for seed banking, both for restoration purposes and for potential assisted migration in the future. We propose a strategy for collecting across the entirety of a species range, while targeting populations likely to go extinct under climate change, determined by application of species distribution models. Finally, we discuss current international efforts to collect and bank the global flora, as well as the research needs necessary to fully undertake the strategy presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	van Katwijk, MM; Bos, AR; Kennis, P; de Vries, R				van Katwijk, Marieke M.; Bos, Arthur R.; Kennis, Peer; de Vries, Rob			Vulnerability to eutrophication of a semi-annual life history: A lesson learnt from an extinct eelgrass (Zostera marina) population	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A semi-annual eelgrass (Zostera marina L) population became extinct in 2004. it had flourished for many decades at Terschelling in the western Wadden Sea, one of the most eutrophied locations where seagrass growth has been recorded. Semi-annual populations survive the winter season by seed (annual), and by incidental plant survival (semi-annual). We compared seed bank dynamics and fate of plants between this impacted site and a reference site in the winter of 1990-1991. Seed bank density at Terschelling was extremely low (5-35 seeds m(-2)) in comparison to the reference site (>60 seeds m(-2)) and also in comparison to seed bank densities of (semi-)annual eelgrass populations in other parts of the world. Plant survival during winter was nil. Nevertheless, the population more than doubled its area in 1991, implying maximum germination and seedling survival rates. However, from 1992 onwards the decline set in and continued - while the nutrient levels decreased. To establish the cause of the low seed bank density, we conducted a transplantation experiment in 2004 to study the relationship between seed production and macro-algal cover. The transplantation experiment showed a negative relationship between the survival of seed producing shoots and suffocation by macro-algae, which is associated with light limitation and unfavourable biogeochemical conditions. The plants died before they had started to produce seeds. Thus, it is likely that macro-algal cover was responsible for the low seed bank density found in Terschelling in 1990-1991. Both the recorded low seed bank density and absence of incidental plant survival during winter were related to eutrophication. These parameters must have been a severe bottleneck in the life history of the extinct population at the impacted site, particularly as Z. marina seed banks are transient. Therefore we deduce that this population had survived at the edge of collapse, and became extinct after a small, haphazard environmental change. We argue that its resilience during these years must have been due to (i) maximum germination and seedling survival rates and (ii) spatial spreading of risks: parts of the population may have survived at locally macro-algae-free spots from where the area could be recolonised. As a consequence, the timing of the collapse was unpredictable and did not synchronise with the eutrophication process. The lesson learnt for conservation is to recognise that eutrophication may be a cause for seagrass population collapse and its eventual extinction, even years after nutrient levels stabilised, or even decreased.

The germplasm bank of the Instituto de Invesitgaciones Agropecuarias INIA, contains 1200 acessions distributed mainly into two Active Working Germplasm Banks at INIA La Platina (Santiago) and at INIA Quilamapus (Chillan) and also the Germplasm Base Bank at INIA Intihausi (La Serena). The Chilean collection possesses accessions collection throughout the country. One way to study and use the germplasm stored at the Seed Banks is the formation of a core collection. The objectives of this work were: a) To establish a common bean core collection with the germplasm collected throughout the country, and b) to evaluate its representatives based on phenotypic data and to compare with data from the whole collection. The results indicated that the Chilean base collection contained accessions belonging to the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools and to genotypes belong to race Chile, Peru, Nueva Granada, Mesoamerica and Durango. The Chilean bean core collection consisted of 246 accessions. Comparison for several phenotypic traits data from 246 accessions from the whole and core collection indicated the genetic variation expressed for each trait in the whole collection was quite well represented in the core collection. This core collection will be very useful for further phenotypic and genetic characterization and to select accessions for the beam breeding program.																	0718-5820					JAN-MAR	2010	70	1					3	15									WOS:000277262000001

Impacts of grazing management options on pasture and animal productivity in a Heteropogon contortus (black speargrass) pasture in central Queensland. 2. Population dynamics of Heteropogon contortus and Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												The dynamics of Heteropogon contortus and Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca populations were studied in a subset of treatments in an extensive grazing study conducted in central Queensland between 1988 and 2001. These treatments were 4 stocking rates in native pasture and 2 of these stocking rates in legume oversown and supplement/spring burning treatments. For the 1999-2000 summer, population data for H. contortus in 5 of these native pasture and supplement/burning treatments were compared with those for an additional burnt treatment. Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was below the long-term mean and mean annual pasture utilisation ranged from 24 to 61%. Increasing stocking rate from 5 to 2 ha/steer in native pasture reduced H. contortus plant density. Increasing stocking rate reduced seedling recruitment as a result of its effect on soil seedbanks. Seedling recruitment was the major determinant of change in plant density, although some individual H. contortus plants did survive throughout the study. Burning in spring 1999, particularly at light stocking rate, promoted seedling recruitment above that in both unburnt native and legume oversown pasture and resulted in increased H. contortus plant density. In the legume oversown treatments, S. scabra cv. Seca density increased rapidly from 15 plants/m(2) in 1988 to 140 plants/m(2) in 2001 following a lag phase between 1988 and 1993. This increased S. scabra density was associated with an eventual decline in H. contortus plant density through reduced seedling recruitment. It was concluded that H. contortus population density is sustainable at stocking rates of 4 and 5 ha/steer (30% pasture utilisation) and that spring burning at light stocking rate can promote H. contortus populations. Increasing densities of S. scabra need to be managed to prevent its dominance.																	1836-5795						2010	61	3					255	267		10.1071/CP09194							WOS:000275272400007

Effect of gypsum on establishment, persistence and productivity of lucerne and annual pasture legumes on two grey Vertosols in southern New South Wales	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Changes in pasture yield and botanical composition due to gypsum application were examined on Vertosols at two locations of differing soil sodicity, Grogan and Morangarell, in southern New South Wales. Two pasture treatments were examined. One was an annual pasture comprised of 3 annual legumes (2 subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneum L. cultivars, Clare and Riverina, and balansa clover T. michelianum Savi cv. Paradana), while the second treatment consisted of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) cv. Aquarius sown in a mixture with the same annual legumes. Gypsum had no effect on the establishment or persistence of lucerne at either site. Gypsum increased the number of subterranean clover seedlings present in autumn in annual swards at the more sodic Grogan site in each of the 4 years, but provided no difference when the clover was in a mixture with lucerne. Annual legume seed yields in annual-only swards increased with gypsum by up to 58% at Grogan and 38% at Morangarell. Seed yields of both cultivars of subterranean clover declined as a proportion of the total annual legume seed bank when lucerne was included in the mixture, in contrast to balansa clover (at Grogan) and the naturalised annual legumes, burr medic (M. polymorpha L.) and woolly clover (T. tomentosum L.), which all increased in relative seed yield in the presence of lucerne. Total pasture production at the Grogan site increased with gypsum by up to 15% per annum in annual swards and 36% in lucerne swards depending on the season. Yield responses to gypsum by the lucerne component were observed in 10 of the 13 seasonal yield measurements taken at Grogan. However, total pasture yield and seasonal yields were unaffected by both gypsum and pasture type at the less sodic Morangarell site. It was concluded that sowing a diverse mixture of annual legumes or polycultures was conducive to maintaining productive pastures on these spatially variable soils. Lucerne dried the soil pro. le (0.15-1.15 m) more than annual pastures at both sites. The combination of gypsum and lucerne enhanced water extraction at depth (0.6-1.15 m) at the Grogan site increasing the size of the dry soil buffer whereas gypsum increased soil water at depth (>0.6 m) under annual swards.

Influence of stocking rate and phosphate fertiliser application on the composition of annual legume seedbanks within a Mediterranean grassland	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												This paper tested the general hypothesis that differences in grazing intensity and phosphate application lead to adjustments in the structure of an annual legume community in natural and diverse grassland at Tel Hadya, Syria, due to changes in competitive relationships between species. The management treatments imposed were a factorial design of 0 or 60 kg/ha of superphosphate fertiliser (applied annually) and relatively low or high continuous sheep stocking intensities. These management treatments were applied for 13 years across three replicate paddocks for each treatment before the annual legume seed banks were sampled. The seed was sorted and representative plants were grown in a common garden in Perth, Australia, to assess reproductive and morphological traits. We found that phosphate application had more influence on species composition than stocking rate and favoured species with relatively competitive reproductive strategies (plants with relatively large seeds, low fecundity and early maturity). Contrary to our expectations, a higher stocking rate did not result in an increase in the proportion of small seeds in the legume seed bank or favour species with other strongly ruderal-type reproductive strategies (high fecundity and high seed dormancy). In paddocks without phosphate application, the high and low stocking rate paddocks were dominated by different species (Trifolium tomentosum and T. campestre), each with a similar reproductive strategy. Plant architecture and/or differences in animal selectivity may account for these differences. The study highlights the importance of phosphate fertiliser for maintaining seedbanks of competitive-type (large seed size, highly productive with good early vigour) annual legume species.

B	Li, XH		Ramawat, KG		Li, Xuehua			Biology of Annual Plants in Arid and Semi-Arid Desert Regions of China	DESERT PLANTS: BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												Annual species are a major component of desert vegetation, with their unique traits playing a key role in vegetation restoration in and and semi-arid deserts. This chapter presents a systematic discussion of current research status and expectations of future studies with respect to annual species in the deserts of China. To date, studies on annual species have been concerned mainly with vegetation distribution pattern, seed germination, soil seed banks, competitive mechanisms in annual species population, and so on. Due to the important ecological functions of annual species in desert floral systems, further studies on annual species, especially on seed adaptability and plant coexistence mechanisms, would benefit ecosystem conservation and restoration efforts, rational utilisation of resources, and sustainable development of and and semi-arid deserts.																			978-3-642-02549-5				2010							73	89		10.1007/978-3-642-02550-1_4	10.1007/978-3-642-02550-1						WOS:000274796600004						
J	Dugan, JE; Hubbard, DM				Dugan, Jenifer E.; Hubbard, David M.			Loss of Coastal Strand Habitat in Southern California: The Role of Beach Grooming	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												We investigated the role of beach grooming in the loss of coastal strand ecosystems. On groomed beaches, unvegetated dry sand zones were four times wider, macrophyte wrack cover was >9 times lower, and native plant abundance and richness were 15 and >3 times lower, respectively, compared to ungroomed beaches. Experimental comparisons of native plant performance were consistent with our survey results: although initial germination was similar, seed bank, survival, and reproduction were significantly lower in groomed compared to ungroomed plots. Rates of aeolian sand transport were significantly higher in groomed plots, while native plants or wrack placed in that zone reduced sand transport. Our results suggest beach grooming has contributed to widespread conversion of coastal strand ecosystems to unvegetated sand. Increased conservation of these threatened coastal ecosystems could help retain sediment, promote the formation of dunes, and maintain biodiversity, wildlife, and human use in the face of rising sea levels.																	1559-2723					JAN	2010	33	1					67	77		10.1007/s12237-009-9239-8							WOS:000275420700006

Germination response of all tree and shrub seeds after wildfires in the Leiria National Forest, Portugal, was simulated by treating sample trays of soil seed banks with distinct combinations of: burning time (0 min, 5 min, and 15 min), seed depth (5 cm and 8.5 cm), and presence or absence of ash cover. The design included control samples for null hypothesis testing. During a time span of 20 months after treatments, the maximum number of seedlings observed every 30 day period, their taxonomical identity, the number of destroyed seeds, and the number of non-germinated seeds were analyzed. Six functional species groups, defined by germination response (i.e,. germinated, destroyed, non-germinated), were identified using minimum-variance hierarchical clustering and correspondence analysis. In addition, the influence of the three environmental design factors and three functional species groups based on their general germination response were then analyzed by means of general regression models. Clustering and ordination results suggest two obvious main groups in terms of post-fire germination response: 1) seeders-fast-growing pioneer shrubs that respond positively to post-fire germination, and 2) resprouters-slow-growing understory tall-shrubs in which germination is largely depressed. Each of the two main functional species groups were further subdivided into six sub-groups, which are distinct in mean germinated, destroyed, and non-germinated seed values. Burning time and seed depth were highly significant in explaining post-fire germination response, while the presence of ash cover was less significant. Results suggest that pioneer seeder behavior is largely promoted by wildfires that are, in turn, detrimental to slow-growing, late-sucessional tall shrubs. Forest fire hazard risk management can thus be put into perspective-seeder fuel beds are promoted by wildfire and are themselves highly fire prone, and resprouters are not (due to discontinuous horizontal and vertical structure and less flammable leaf composition).

FIRST-ORDER FIRE EFFECTS ON HERBS AND SHRUBS: PRESENT KNOWLEDGE AND PROCESS MODELING NEEDS	FIRE ECOLOGY												Herbaceous plants and shrubs have received little attention in terms of fire effects modeling despite their critical role in ecosystem integrity and resilience after wildfires and prescribed burns. In this paper, we summarize current knowledge of direct effects of fire on herb and shrub (including cacti) vegetative tissues and seed banks, propose key components for process-based modeling, and outline research needs. Most herbs and shrubs are likely to be killed or top-killed even in low intensity surface fires. Therefore, modeling efforts should focus on mortality of protected above and below ground meristematic tissue and seeds as well as the effects on seed germination. Further development of an organic and mineral soil heating model capable of describing heating patterns under a range of flaming and smoldering fire behaviors, validated heat transfer models for protected plant structures, standardized descriptions of tissue heat tolerance for a wider range of species, and a better understanding of the effects of soil heating on seed banks are required. The combination of these components would result in a comprehensive, process-based model predicting immediate herb, shrub, and seed mortality and post-fire responses. It would permit quantitative description of fire severity and a more accurate prediction of post-fire ecosystem recovery.

J	Schwienbacher, E; Marcante, S; Erschbamer, B				Schwienbacher, Erich; Marcante, Silvia; Erschbamer, Brigitta			Alpine species seed longevity in the soil in relation to seed size and shape - A 5-year burial experiment in the Central Alps	FLORA												Long-term persistent seeds are generally expected to be small and spherically shaped. In contrast, transient seeds are often large, flattened and elongated. We hypothesized that alpine species follow these trends, and that most species of unstable alpine habitats have the potential to form long-term persistent seed banks. The latter would enable them to delay germination until favourable conditions are present in their environment thereby increasing the likelihood for establishment of seedlings. We selected nine alpine species of more or less unstable habitats (i.e. Achillea moschata, Artemisia genipi, Anthyllis vulneraria ssp. alpicola, Geum reptans, Linaria alpina, Oxyria digyna, Saxifraga aizoides, Saxifraga oppositifolia, and Trifolium pallescens) for this study. Seed longevity was estimated by a 5-year burial experiment in the field with seed excavations after I winter, 2 years and 5 years. Germination experiments in the growth chamber and viability tests were performed after each excavation. We detected longevity patterns ranging from transient to long-term persistent. Two species were classified as transient. All other species have the potential to form persistent seed banks, with almost half of the investigated species showing a trend for long-term persistence. Despite contradictory reports, long-term persistent seed banks are an important life history trait of species of unstable alpine habitats. We found that seed shape and hard-seededness are good predictors of seed persistence of alpine species. Seed size seems to be less important. The data from this study support the general hypotheses describing the relationship among seed size, seed shape and seed persistence in the soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Langhans, TM; Storm, C; Schwabe, A				Langhans, Tanja Margrit; Storm, Christian; Schwabe, Angelika			Regeneration processes of biological soil crusts, macro-cryptogams and vascular plant species after fine-scale disturbance in a temperate region: Recolonization or successional replacement?	FLORA												Open base-rich sandy habitats are often characterised by an extensive cover of biological soil crusts (BSCs). We studied the impact of mechanical disturbances on cyanobacteria/algae-dominated BSCs, macro-cryptogams (bryophytes, lichens), phanerogams and their regeneration processes in a 3-year field experiment in a temperate region. We compared controls with two fine-scale disturbance regimes, each based on 50 plots (20 cm x 20 cm): 1. BSCs were raked (weak disturbance), 2. BSCs were completely removed (strong disturbance). We used a Sileno conicae-Cerastion semidecandri habitat as a model area for the field study and ask if the crusts are able to regenerate or will be replaced by macrocryptogams and/or phanerogams. To clarify whether there is an autochthonous recolonization by vascular plant species out of the seed bank, we analysed the upper soil layer with the seedling-emergence method. Furthermore, we considered the possibility of seed limitation in the harsh environment and added seeds of four habitat-typical species. To assess the impact of disturbance on the soil nutrient content we analysed ammonium, nitrate, total N and phosphate contents. There was a recolonization by macro-cryptogams 2 years after strong disturbance. The cyanobacteria/algae crusts resettled only to 5% in comparison to the previous 40% cover. Therefore, the strong disturbance impact results in a replacement of the crust. Two years after disturbance the ruderalisation indices are higher on strongly disturbed plots than on weakly disturbed and intact plots. Total species numbers of phanerogams were lower on strongly disturbed plots, even in the last year of the experiment. A few habitat-typical phanerogams showed significantly lower numbers of individuals on strongly disturbed plots (Koeleria glauca, Myosotis stricta: seedlings: Erodium cicutarium, Saxifraga tridactylites). The intermediate-disturbance hypothesis implies that weak disturbance should lead to higher species numbers. This was not the case in our system. Similarity in species composition between seed bank and above-ground vegetation was 70%. The seed-addition experiment revealed that emergence, survival and establishment were species specific; two added species emerged in intact and weakly disturbed crusts, demonstrating seed limitation of the system. Nutrient contents showed variability in time; ammonium and total N revealed treatment effects (strong disturbance resulted in lower contents). There was no recolonization of BSCs to the pre-disturbance stage in a 3-year period, but a successional replacement occurred: especially acrocarpic bryophytes and phanerogams replaced the cyanobacteria/algae stages in the case of our fine-scale disturbance regime.

J	Ma, MJ; Zhou, XH; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Zhou, Xianhui; Du, Guozhen			Role of soil seed bank along a disturbance gradient in an alpine meadow on the Tibet plateau	FLORA												We examined the role of the soil seed bank along a grazing disturbance gradient and its relationship with the vegetation of alpine meadows on the Tibet plateau, and discussed the implications for restoration. The seed bank had a high potential for restoration of species-rich vegetation; 62 species were identified in the vegetation and 87 in the seed bank, 39 species being common to both. Mean seed density was 3069-6105 viable seeds m(-2). The density of buried seeds increased significantly with increasing disturbance, indicating that restoration of disturbed areas is not seed limited. Seed density and species richness decreased with depth. The proportion of perennial species decreased with decrease in disturbance both in seed bank and in vegetation. A large portion of species with persistent seeds in the disturbed areas indicate that this seed type can be regarded a strategy of adaptation to current disturbances. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) showed significant differences of species composition between seed bank and vegetation, except for the seriously disturbed site. Our results suggest that the establishment of new species in severely disturbed areas is more dependent on the seed bank. By contrast, the restoration in less-disturbed and mature meadows does not rely on seed banks, and the establishment of the vegetation in these communities is more likely to rely on seed dispersal from the standing vegetation and on species with vegetative reproduction.

J	Tesfaye, G; Teketay, D; Fetene, M; Beck, E				Tesfaye, Getachew; Teketay, Demel; Fetene, Masresha; Beck, Erwin			Regeneration of seven indigenous tree species in a dry Afromontane forest, southern Ethiopia	FLORA												Regeneration of seven indigenous tree species having significant ecological and economic importance was investigated in the Munessa-Shashemene dry Afromontane forest (MSF), southern Ethiopia. Densities and distributions of seedlings, saplings and trees were assessed along gradients of altitude, light and disturbance using quadrat sizes of 10 x 5 m (for seedlings) and 20 x 20 m (saplings and trees) following line transects. The number of individuals, frequency and height of the study species were recorded in the quadrats at every 100 m drop in altitude. Seedling densities varied markedly among the species and altitudes. Mean densities (number of individuals ha(-1)) of seedlings ranged from zero (Polyscias fulva) to 5334 (Prunus africana), and from three (Polyscias fulva) to 102 (Podocarpus falcatus) for trees and saplings. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that seedlings of Celtis africana and Croton macrostachyus were highly favored by disturbance and, hence, were concentrated in canopy gaps within the forest. Based on their population structures, the study species could be categorized into three groups: (1) Species that showed the highest proportion of individuals in the lowest height class and with a gradual decrease towards the upper height classes, which suggests good regeneration; Podocarpus falcatus, C. africana, C. macrostachys and P. africana belonged to this group. (2) Species that showed higher proportions of individuals in the lowest height class and with missing individuals in the Subsequent middle height classes, indicative of hampered regeneration; Syzygium guineense and Pouteria adolfi-friederici belonged to this group. (3) Species with no individuals in the lowest and middle height classes but represented by individuals in upper height classes; P. fulva belonged to this group. The species categorized in the last two groups exhibited hampered regeneration, and P. fulva is in the verge of local extermination. High seedling densities (e.g. C africana and P africana) and/or adaptive defense mechanisms to herbivory (e.g. P. falcatus and C. macrostachyus) were common attributes of species, which exhibited good regeneration. Regeneration problems were largely attributed to human disturbance, lack of suitable habitat for seed germination or problems associated to seed set (seed predation or abortion). Our study indicated that P fulva, P. adolfi-friederici and S. guineense require the highest immediate attention for conservation in the MSF. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

In addition, the effect of salinity on the variation in seed bank density and similarity between above-ground vegetation and seed bank with depth was compared between euhaline against mesohaline conditions in three salt marshes. Ten plots of 2 m x 2 m were situated in a new salt marsh (existing since 2002) and 80 plots in three old salt marshes. Soil samples were collected at three different depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-15 cm) in spring 2006. Soil seed bank was investigated in germination experiments under greenhouse conditions. Germination experiments lasted 6 months and all seedlings were identified and removed after identification. Above-ground vegetation composition was determined during the growing season in all plots. Viable seed density was calculated for each plot and for the three different depths; the similarity between seed bank and floristic composition of the above-ground vegetation was calculated. A general linear model was used to investigate the effect of soil depth, salinity and age of the salt marsh on density and similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation. The results showed that seed density decreased with depth in all salt marshes, irrespective of their age and soil salinity. Seed density and similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation were higher in the new salt marsh than in the old one in the same study area. This is because in young as well as in old successional stages, the seed bank was mostly composed of new colonizers, while most perennial species were absent from the soil seed bank, although they were dominant in the standing vegetation of the old salt marsh. The characteristics of the seed bank of a mesohaline salt marsh were found not to be fundamentally different from that of both euhaline salt marshes. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this work comparative studies on two populations of P. sardoa and in the only one of P. sinisica were carried out. In particular, seed output calculations and morphometric measurements on seed and elaiosome sizes were carried out. The effect of chipping, constant (15 degrees C) and alternating (25/10 degrees C) temperature regimes and light (8 h irradiance/day and dark) on germination were investigated. Seedling vigor assessments and a study on seed persistence in the soil were also carried out. P. sinisica had a higher seed output than P. sardoa and P. sinisica seeds were smaller than those of P. sardoa, with lower elaiosome area and elaiosome ratio values. Neither species had alternating temperature or light requirements for germination. P. sardoa achieved high germination percentages (> 80%) at all the tested conditions. P. sinisica had a lower maximum germination (<60%), suggesting the presence of physiological dormancy, and took more than twice as long to reach the maximum germination percentage. Seedlings of P. sardoa were larger than those of P. sinisica, and neither species formed a persistent soil seed bank. These new data may help implement effective conservation measures for these two species and, more generally, for threatened endemic species of this genus. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Alien species in the western slope of the Coastal Range, Valparaiso Province, Central Chile	GAYANA BOTANICA												Central Chile supports a rich native flora and a high proportion of alien, naturalized plants. To increase our knowledge about behavior of naturalized plants in central Chile, the flora of the western slope of the Coastal Range (Province Valparaiso, 33 degrees S lat.), was recorded and analyzed. Study sites were placed at natural and anthropic, perturbed areas. Taxonomic richness, species composition, geographic origin, Raunkiaer's life forms, and absolute coverage were recorded. Of the 325 vascular plant species were identified, 110 (34%) were considered alien; 74% of them with European origin, and 10%, European-North African. According to abundance, 27% of the plant coverage was of native species and 73% of non-natives. The natives were distributed in 68 families and the naturalized and cultivated in 28 families. Asteraceae, Poaceae y Fabaceae were the richest in both native and naturalized species. The native species were distributed in 146 genera and non natives in 89. Alstroemeria, Baccharis and Calceolaria were the richest in native species; Erodium, Trifolium, Rumex and Vicia, were rich in alien species. Hemicryptophytes and therophytes were most abundant in natives and naturalized species. We conclude that due to increasing urban and agricultural pressures on soils in Province Valparaiso, it is expected that short-lived alien species with opportunistic, high-reproductive capacity, will increase in diversity and abundance.

B	Javaid, A		Lichtfouse, E		Javaid, Arshad			Beneficial Microorganisms for Sustainable Agriculture	GENETIC ENGINEERING, BIOFERTILISATION, SOIL QUALITY AND ORGANIC FARMING	Sustainable Agriculture Reviews											There was a desperate need for food to recover the economy of the 1950s and 1960s. Farmers all over the world were advised to rely on intensive production methods and synthetic pesticide inputs to increase the productivity. No doubt, these chemical-based agricultural practices substantially increased crop yield. However, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals have contributed significantly to the environmental pollution and adversely affected human and animal health. In addition, the increasing cost of these agrochemicals has continued to lower the farmer's net cash return. The global use of synthetic pesticides at the start of this millennium exceeded 2.5 million tons per year. A growing worldwide concern for these problems has motivated researchers, administrators, and farmers to seek alternatives to chemical-based, conventional agriculture. One such product is effective microorganisms (EM) developed by Japanese scientists. Effective microorganisms are a mixed culture of beneficial and naturally occurring microorganisms, such as species of photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Rhodobacter sphaeroides), lactobacilli (Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, and Streptococcus lactic), yeasts (Saccharomyces spp.), and Actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp.). These beneficial microorganisms improve crop growth and yield by increasing photosynthesis, producing bioactive substances such as hormones and enzymes, controlling soil diseases, and accelerating decomposition of lignin materials in the soil. Experiments conducted on various agricultural crops in different parts of the world have shown good prospects for the practical application of these beneficial microorganisms in improving crop yield and soil fertility. Application of beneficial microorganisms generally improves soil physical and chemical properties and favors the growth and efficiency of symbiotic microorganisms such as nitrogen fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Nonetheless experiences of some researchers revealed that the effect of these microorganisms on crop growth and yield was usually not evident or even negative in the first test crop. However, this adverse effect can be overcome through repeated applications of these microorganisms. Research on these microorganisms has shown that crop yields tend to increase gradually as subsequent crops are grown. Foliar application of beneficial microorganisms avoids many of the biotic and abiotic factors and constraints of the soil environment, and thus increases the crop growth and yield significantly. Application of beneficial microorganisms also reduces seed bank of weeds in agricultural soils by enhancing the rate of weed seeds germination. There are reports of management of various fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as insect pests due to application of beneficial microorganisms. These microorganisms have shown a great promise in dairy wastewater treatment. They can reduce NH3 concentration in poultry manure up to 70% possibly by transforming NH4+ to NO3-. Research conducted so far concludes that benefits of beneficial microorganisms can be best exploited through their repeated applications for few years in combination with organic amendments and applying them as foliar spray. Integrated use of organic matter plus beneficial microorganisms with half mineral NPK can yield equivalent to that of full recommended NPK fertilizers dose. Beneficial microorganisms can also be used for wastewater treatment, pest and disease management, and to reduce the aiotic stresses on crop growth and yield.																			978-90-481-8740-9				2010	4						347	369		10.1007/978-90-481-8741-6_12	10.1007/978-90-481-8741-6						WOS:000278926800012

Of these, 178 are considered to be extinct, 40 are critically endangered, one is endangered (Bulbophyllum vaginatum), two are vulnerable (Vanilla griffithii, Bulbophyllum trifolium), and only five are considered to be common (Arundina gramminifolia, Bromheadia finlaysonianum, Dendrobium crumenatum, Eulophia graminea, Spathoglottis plicata). The orchid conservation program at the Singapore Botanic Gardens aims to monitor existing species, explore ways to conserve their germplasm, and increase their number for subsequent re-introduction into appropriate habitats, including managed parks and roadsides. Thus far, we have successfully re-introduced Grammatophyllum speciosum, Bulbophyllum vaginatum, Bulbophyllum membranaceum, Cymbidium finlaysonianum and Cymbidium bicolor. A special designated area at the National Orchid Garden has been set up to showcase the rich diversity of native species. The Orchid Cryo-Seed Bank began several years ago and is showing some promising results. We have successfully stored seeds of several native species including Cymbidium finlaysonianum, Cymbidium bicolor, Grammatophyllum speciosum, Dendrobium crumenatum, Spathoglottis plicata, Bulbophyllum vaginatum, and Dendrobium anosmun.																	0567-7572		978-90-6605-573-5				2010	878						21	28									WOS:000323617100001

Repeated disturbance through chaining and burning differentially affects recruitment among plant functional types in fire-prone heathlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Managing fire regimes is increasingly recognised as important for biodiversity conservation in fragmented agricultural landscapes in fire-prone regions. In the global biodiversity hotspot of south-west Western Australia, chaining and burning is a novel technique for facilitating fire management. Vegetation is first dislodged using a chain, then after a period of curing, burnt. The effects on plant communities are largely unstudied, despite the potential consequences of combining two disturbance events. We hypothesised that outcomes would vary depending on plant functional types defined by disturbance response. We compared plant community composition and recruitment and resprouting of plant functional types in mallee-heath subject to chaining and burning, burning only and neither of these. The effects of chaining and burning did not differ from only burning at the community level. Importantly, however, we recorded 90% fewer recruits of serotinous, obligate seeders in chained and burnt compared with only burnt plots, and a 44% decrease in their species richness. By contrast, recruits of obligate seeding shrubs and fire-ephemeral herbs with persistent soil-stored seed banks increased by 166% in chained and burnt plots. Sprouters showed little difference. We conclude that chaining and burning is likely to significantly alter vegetation composition, and potentially poses a significant threat to serotinous, obligate seeders. These impacts require consideration in fire management planning.

Growth Regulator Herbicides Prevent Invasive Annual Grass Seed Production	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Auxinic herbicides, such as 2,4-D and dicamba, that act as plant growth regulators are commonly used for broadleaf weed control in cereal crops (e.g., wheat, barley), grasslands, and noncroplands. If applied at late growth stages, while cereals are developing reproductive parts, the herbicides can reduce seed production. We tested whether growth regulators have this same effect on the invasive annual grass Japanese brome. The herbicides 2,4-D, dicamba, and picloram were applied at typical field use rates to Japanese brome at various growth stages in a greenhouse. Picloram reduced seed production nearly 100% when applied at the internode elongation, boot, or heading stages of growth, whereas dicamba appeared to be slightly less effective and 2,4-D was much less effective. Our results indicate it may be possible to control Japanese brome by using growth regulator herbicides to reduce its seed production, thereby depleting its short-lived seed bank.

Comparative Seed and Dispersal Ecology of Three Exotic Subtropical Asparagus Species	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The genus Asparagus includes at least six invasive species in Australia. Asparagus aethiopicus and A. africanus are invasive in subtropical Australia, and a third species, A. virgatus is naturalized and demonstrates localized spread in south east Queensland. To better understand how the attributes of these species contribute to their invasiveness, we compared fruit and seed traits, germination, seedling emergence, seed survival, and time-to-maturity. We further investigated dispersal ecology of A. africanus, examining the diet of a local frugivore, the figbird (Sphecotheres viridis) and the effect of gut passage on seedling emergence. Overall, A. aethiopicus was superior in germination and emergence, with the highest mean germination (98.8%) and emergence (94.5%) under optimal conditions and higher emergence (mean of 73.3%) across all treatments. In contrast, A. africanus had the lowest germination under optimal conditions (71.7%) and low mean seedling emergence (49.5%), but had fruits with the highest relative yield (ratio of dry pulp to fruit fresh weight) that were favored by a local frugivore. Figbirds consumed large numbers of A. africanus fruits (similar to 30% of all non-Ficus fruits), and seedling germination was not significantly affected by gut passage compared to unprocessed fruits. Asparagus virgatus germinated poorly under cool, light conditions (1.4%) despite a high optimum mean (95.0%) and had low mean performance across emergence treatments (36.3%). The species also had fruits with a low pulp return for frugivores. For all species, seed survival declined rapidly in the first 12 mo and fell to < 3.2% viability at 36 mo. On the basis of the traits considered, A. virgatus is unlikely to have the invasive potential of its congeners. Uniformly short seed survival times suggest that weed managers do not have to contend with a substantial persistent soil-stored seed bank, but frugivore-mediated dispersal beyond existing infestations will present a considerable management challenge.

J	Beyene, F				Beyene, Fekadu			The role of NGO in informal seed production and dissemination: The case of eastern Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS												Seed is the basic input to crop production. Farmer-based seed production as an alternative agricultural technology transfer is increasingly given especial attention in developing countries where food insecurity is critical. This paper aims to assess the seed production and dissemination strategy among smallholder farmers in eastern Ethiopia that has been introduced by Hararghe Catholic Secretariat (a Non-Governmental Organization). A survey of 160 households in four administrative districts and focus group discussions were used to collect data. While narratives helped understand the process, logistic regression was used to identify determinants of land allocation to seed production. Results indicate the crucial role of informal networks and social capital as facilitators of access to production inputs, information and knowledge. The informal seed supply system initiated by the NGO has a huge potential to benefit smallholder farmers by improving their access to higher-yielding varieties of various crops, thereby contributing to an increase in their wellbeing. However, the traditional practice of seed exchange, influenced by social relations, will remain uneconomical to seed producers. Thus, the paper suggests that this potential can be further exploited if some preconditions such as establishment of seed banks, investment in human capital, removal of the underlying constraints and creation of reliable seed markets are given emphasis.																	1612-9830						2010	111	2					79	88									WOS:000297185600002

Interspecific variation in susceptibility to fungal pathogens in seeds of 10 tree species in the neotropical genus Cecropia	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P>1. Species differences in susceptibility to pathogens acting at early life history stages may strongly influence the abundance and distribution of tropical trees. Here, we test the susceptibility of 10 congeners of the pioneer genus Cecropia to fungal seed and seedling pathogens and compare interspecific differences in intrinsic seed defences with survival. 2. Pathogens were experimentally removed through fungicide addition and/or autoclave sterilization of forest soil to determine the relative importance of fungal versus other microbial pathogens. Treatments were applied during a 4-month seed incubation (pre-emergence) phase or during an 8-week germination phase to distinguish between seed and seedling mortality. 3. Overall, seedling emergence after incubation in fungicide-treated, autoclaved soil was twice that in live soil, with significant positive effects of fungicide for six of 10 species. Pathogen infection occurred while seeds were quiescent in soil; fungicide addition during germination had no effect on emergence. Seedling emergence after burial ranged from 6 to 58%, indicating large interspecific variation in the capacity for Cecropia seeds to persist in the seed bank. Neither interspecific variation in survivorship, nor the relative strength of fungicide effects on survivorship was correlated with seed defence traits. 4. For four species, measurements of fungicide effects on emergence were coupled with direct measurements of the fungal and bacterial infection of seeds and seedlings. For two species, fungicide addition resulted in lower fungal infection rates and higher emergence success. However, Cecropia peltata, the species with the highest overall emergence success, also had the highest fungal infection rate. This suggests that either C. peltata was infected by a different suite of fungi than other congeners, or that fungi had low pathogenicity when colonizing this host species. 5. Synthesis. Our study shows strong interspecific variation in seed survival and susceptibility to fungal infection among congeneric tree species with similar life history. These differences are likely to influence recruitment success from the soil seed bank and may play a role in species coexistence.

Cheatgrass facilitates spillover of a seed bank pathogen onto native grass species	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P>1. Pathogen spillover occurs when disease levels for a given population are driven by transmission from a reservoir species that carries a high pathogen load. Pathogen spillover is widely documented in crop systems, but has been little studied in natural plant communities. 2. The abundant seed production of weedy species may create a scenario where spillover of a generalist seed pathogen onto less abundant seeds of native hosts is possible. The invasive annual weed cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a potential reservoir species for Pyrenophora semeniperda, a multiple-host fungal seed pathogen that naturally occurs in the semi-arid western United States. 3. To investigate potential community-level consequences of spillover by this pathogen in plant communities invaded by cheatgrass, we first used artificial inoculation studies to determine the relative susceptibility of seeds of cheatgrass and five co-occurring native grasses to P. semeniperda. Secondly, we quantified the pathogen reservoir (density of pathogen-killed seeds) in the spring seed bank for cheatgrass monoculture, cheatgrass-invaded native grass, and uninvaded native grass patches. Thirdly, potential pathogen spillover onto co-occurring native grasses was quantified by planting native grass seeds into field-collected seed-zone samples from each vegetation patch type and scoring subsequent seed mortality. 4. All species tested were susceptible to infection by P. semeniperda, but their vulnerability to seed death varied as a function of germination time and degree of susceptibility. 5. Seed bank samples from cheatgrass-dominated patches contained seed densities over four times higher than samples from uninvaded native grass patches, and P. semeniperda-killed seeds were also present at much higher densities, indicating that cheatgrass can function as a reservoir for P. semeniperda. Native seeds planted into seed-zone samples from cheatgrass-dominated patches were more likely to be killed by P. semeniperda than those planted into samples from uninvaded native patches. Seed mortality also varied across years, sites and host species. 6. Synthesis. Pathogen spillover onto native seeds is likely to operate within seed banks of semi-arid communities invaded by cheatgrass, and perhaps other weeds, and may have broad consequences for community structure. Our findings also demonstrate the ecological significance of multiple-host pathosystems that operate at the seed stage.

Microsite effects on forest regeneration in a bottomland swamp in western New York	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												BLOOD, L. E. AND J. H. TITUS (Department of Biology, SUNY-Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063). Microsite effects on forest regeneration in a bottomland swamp in western New York. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 137: 88-102. 2010.-The distribution of woody plant in wetlands may be influenced by topographic microsites that differ in flooding duration, substrate composition, moisture retention, canopy cover, nutrient availability, and seed trapping ability. In order to assess the effects of microsites on woody plant regeneration in Bonita Swamp, a wetland in Western New York, we conducted an assessment of 15 microsite types, a survey of 400 trees, and a woody seedling count using nineteen 100 m(2) quadrats in a 4.3 ha study area. Acer X freemanii E.Murr., Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall, and Ulmus americana L. dominated the overstory and the often inundated swales occupied 50.3% of the soil surface. Relative to area occupied by each microsite, seedlings were found more often than expected on elevated moss, near elevated moss/soil, near log/root, and swale microsites with 66% of woody seedlings occurring in swales. Acer x freemanii and Fraxinus pennsylvanica occurred more often than expected in the swales. Seedlings appear to prefer moss substrates over soil and wood substrates. Hydrochory may explain the preference of seedlings for "near" microsites onto which wind, water currents and receding spring flood waters deposit floating seeds. Mean percent canopy cover did not vary over the different microsite types, over different species, or between the first and second year (or older) seedlings. Woody seedlings that were two years old or older were found at significantly higher relative elevations and were much less frequent than first year seedlings indicating high mortality and the importance of elevation to survival and establishment. The elevations of microsites are important to woody plant regeneration in this system.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JAN-MAR	2010	137	1					88	102		10.3159/08-RA-062.1							WOS:000277756900008

Responses of Rare Plant Species to Fire in Florida's Pyrogenic Communities	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Lightning- and human-ignited fires have shaped many of Florida's natural communities. Plant persistence in these habitats requires adaptation to survive high temperatures, ability to respond to aboveground tissue loss, or avoidance of these conditions through survival in unburned patches or in the soil seed bank. Limited distribution of many rare species in increasingly fragmented habitats and uncertainty of whether rare species tolerate, require, or persist through avoidance of fire hampers fire management when it is possible and threatens long-term viability of plants. We review up to 14 years of monitoring data for 18 rare plant species from 14 families occurring on sandhill, scrub, pine rockland, and mixed deciduous hardwood communities across Florida. For a number of variables measured, including density, frequency, flowering, and recruitment. 50% of the species showed significant positive responses to burning and 50% of the species showed a neutral or no response. None of the species were unable to recover post-bum. These results suggest that prescribed fire in these pyrogenic habitats need not be delayed until species-specific responses to fire are understood.																	0885-8608					JAN	2010	30	1					4	19		10.3375/043.030.0102							WOS:000274223600002						
J	Meyer, SE; Stewart, TE; Clement, S				Meyer, Susan E.; Stewart, Thomas E.; Clement, Suzette			The quick and the deadly: growth vs virulence in a seed bank pathogen	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												We studied the relationship between virulence (ability to kill nondormant Bromus tectorum seeds) and mycelial growth index in the necrotrophic seed pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda. Seed pathosystems involving necrotrophs differ from those commonly treated in traditional evolution-of-virulence models in that host death increases pathogen fitness by preventing germination, thereby increasing available resources. Because fast-germinating, nondormant B. tectorum seeds commonly escape mortality, we expected virulence to be positively correlated with mycelial growth index. We performed seed inoculations using conidia from 78 pathogen isolates and scored subsequent mortality. For a subset of 40 of these isolates, representing a range of virulence phenotypes, we measured mycelial growth index. Virulence varied over a wide range (3-43% seed mortality) and was significantly negatively correlated with mycelial growth index (R2 = 0.632). More virulent isolates grew more slowly than less virulent isolates. We concluded that there is an apparent tradeoff between virulence and growth in this pathogen, probably because the production of toxins necessary for necrotrophic pathogenesis competes with metabolic processes associated with growth. Variation in both virulence and growth rate in this pathosystem may be maintained in part by seasonal variation in the relative abundance of rapidly germinating vs dormant host seeds available to the pathogen.																	0028-646X						2010	187	1					209	216		10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03255.x							WOS:000278395100020	20406404

Vegetation patterns and trajectories in disturbed landscapes, Great Barrier Island, northern New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Fire has been a major driver of forest loss in New Zealand. A conceptual model has been proposed in which positive feedbacks between vegetation, fire and soils can arrest regeneration of recurrently burned wet forest landscapes. We used vegetation data collected across three topographically similar landscapes-Awana, Glenfern and Windy Hill-on Great Barrier Island to ( 1) describe current vegetation composition and structure and predict future change in composition and (2) assess evidence for interactions between fire and soils slowing regeneration in these landscapes. Compositional data were analysed via classification and ordination, and we used transition matrix models to explore how vegetation composition may change in the future. The vegetation in the three landscapes spans repeatedly burned scrubland dominated by manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and exotic fire-dependent woody species such as Hakea sericea, to intact mature forest. Scrubland vegetation tends to be found on north-facing upper slopes and ridges - drier sites where fire has been more frequent and rendered soil conditions (e.g. organic matter and moisture) poor for plant growth. There is a slow reinvasion of forest species into the Leptospermum and Kunzea scrubland from gullies and other remnant patches, with wind-dispersed species preceding fleshy-fruited bird-dispersed ones. In the absence of fire in the next few decades the landscapes will continue to move back towards forest. More fires, however, will further degrade these landscapes by removing remaining fertile topsoils from ridges and slopes and by favouring exotic species adapted to recruit from seed and/or resprout vegetatively after fire.

A factorial experiment, combining different temperature regimes (10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 25 degrees or 30 degrees C), photoperiod (total darkness and 12 h light/12 h darkness) and different pre-treatments (freezing, dry-heat, hot-water), was designed to analyze seed germination patterns and dormancy processes. The. results obtained are in agreement with the ecology of the two species. Seeds are not dormant after collection and maintain high viability when preserved by standard seed bank conservation protocols. It was found out that optimal temperature for germination is 20 degrees C for both species. Light seems to play a key role in the germination of genus Sideritis, particularly for S. chamaedryfolia, significantly inhibited by light as other psammophilous plants. Temperature and light arc relevant environmental indicators, but it was found out that the germination response to these factors in the studied species is correlated with a different environmental factor, namely the availability of water resources in their habitats, which is generally a major constraint factor for seed germination in Mediterranean areas. The results indicate that germination limitations are not so much related to taxonomic position, but rather adaptations to water restrictions.

Seed-bank convergence under different tree species during forest development	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Seed banks are of vital importance for local plant persistence and recruitment, for maintaining both plant and genetic diversity and for habitat restoration. Yet, seed-bank dynamics, particularly on the long term and in deciduous forests, remain poorly understood. Additionally, information on compositional seed-bank differences under contrasting tree canopies remains scarce. This study aims at quantifying long-term seed-bank dynamics by sampling vegetation and seed banks along a four-stage successional chronosequence (40, 80, 120 and 250 years) using 12 10 m x 10 m plots per forest stand age-class under fully developed oak-hornbeam and beech canopies. Seed banks were remarkably abundant and diverse. Species richness and seed density declined steeply with forest stand age, regardless of canopy species. Seed-bank composition differed significantly with stand age, yet also with tree species. Most likely, tree species-dependent ecosystem engineer effects on light availability and possibly also litter quality affect the seed bank through the vegetation. Compositional differences between seed banks from stands with a different canopy diminished with increasing stand age, possibly due to a gradual loss of species with a less persistent seed bank. Long-term seed-bank dynamics in deciduous forests seem to consist predominantly of a unidirectional and predictable depletion of the seed bank as long as large disturbances, which would allow seed-bank replenishment of early-successional species, are lacking. Furthermore, forest seed-banks appear to converge upon a characteristic seed bank in the later stages of forest development, irrespective of canopy composition, driven by seed-bank depletion and limited input from the herb layer.

J	Klimkowska, A; Van Diggelen, R; Grootjans, AP; Kotowski, W				Klimkowska, Agata; Van Diggelen, Rudy; Grootjans, Ab P.; Kotowski, Wiktor			Prospects for fen meadow restoration on severely degraded fens	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												The majority of fens in Europe have been transformed for agricultural purposes and have disappeared or become degraded. Fen meadows that developed under low-intensity management of fens also have become degraded. In this paper, we consider the available restoration methods, biotic constraints for restoration and new prospects and approaches for the reStoration of severely degraded fens. Due to irreversible changes in landscape settings, hydrology, soil and trophic conditions, a full restoration to natural mires is unlikely. Yet, an improvement of the ecosystem functions and revival of biodiversity in degraded fens is possible. A restoration of semi-natural meadows is one of the alternative targets. Important for restoration efforts to succeed are a sufficient reduction of nutrient levels and preventing acidification. In general, a combination of topsoil removal and seed transfer is an effective measure for fen meadow restoration, provided that groundwater seepage can be re-established. There are also several biotic limitations to fen meadow restoration, due to limited propagule availability of target species and the legacy of the former vegetation in form of its soil seed bank and high seed production by unwanted species. Under the present environmental conditions, the re-development of fen meadows on degraded fens will result in species compositions different from those observed in the past and such restoration may require considerable time and effort.

Impact of long-term, saline flooding on condition and reproduction of the clonal wetland tree, Melaleuca ericifolia (Myrtaceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Although water regime modification and salinity are recognised as significant threats to wetland ecosystems worldwide, the effects of long-term saline flooding (decades) on woody tree persistence are poorly quantified. We compared the condition, growth, structure and reproduction (sexual and asexual) of mature individuals of the clonal tree, Melaleuca ericifolia (Myrtaceae), that experienced continual (> 30 years) flooding with trees that were only intermittently (approximately every 5 years) flooded. An index developed to assess the condition of multi-stemmed trees found that continually flooded trees were in significantly poorer condition than intermittently flooded trees, having lower crown cover, foliar cover and foliar density, and a higher incidence of dead stags and dieback. Annual stem growth correlated strongly with condition scores. Evidence for a trade-off between sexual and asexual reproductions was found; flooded trees were constrained in their vegetative lateral spread (< 12 m dia.) and flowered more than intermittently flooded trees, which were not restricted in lateral spread (similar to 30 m dia.). Flooded trees used intensively by the colonially roosting Australian Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis molucca) were in especially poor condition. These trees flowered infrequently and produced the lowest number of infructescences, but produced many new vegetative stems (ramets) within their centre. Although chronic flooding appeared to compromise the condition of M. ericifolia trees in Dowd Morass, their existence upon woody hummocks (similar to 40 cm high) upon which they are able to produce new stems is likely to be a key mechanism in their persistence. It is unknown, however, how long this process can maintain the existing population. Production and maintenance of a large aerial seed bank by living mature trees under flooded conditions may allow M. ericifolia to regenerate sexually upon drawdown and may be important for population persistence in the longer term.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				JAN	2010	206	1					41	57		10.1007/s11258-009-9623-2							WOS:000272969600004						
J	Klimkowska, A; Bekker, RM; Van Diggelen, R; Kotowski, W				Klimkowska, Agata; Bekker, Renee M.; Van Diggelen, Rudy; Kotowski, Wiktor			Species trait shifts in vegetation and soil seed bank during fen degradation	PLANT ECOLOGY												Fens in Central Europe are characterised by waterlogged organic substrate and low productivity. Human-induced changes due to drainage and mowing lead to changes in plant species composition from natural fen communities to fen meadows and later to over-drained, degraded meadows. Moderate drainage leads to increased vegetation productivity, and severe drainage results in frequent soil disturbances and less plant growth. In the present article, we analyse changes in plant trait combinations in the vegetation and the soil seed bank as well as changes in the seed bank types along gradient of drainage intensity. We hypothesize that an increase in productivity enhances traits related to persistence and that frequent disturbance selects for regeneration traits. We use multivariate statistics to analyse data from three disturbance levels: undisturbed fen, slightly drained fen meadow and severely drained degraded meadow. We found that the abundance of plants regenerating from seeds and accumulating persistent seed banks was increasing with degradation level, while plants reproducing vegetatively were gradually eliminated along the same trajectory. Plants with strong resprouting abilities increased during degradation. We also found that shifts in trait combinations were similar in the aboveground vegetation and in soil seed banks. We found that the density of short-term persistent seeds in the soil is highest in fen meadows and the density of long-term persistent seeds is highest in degraded meadows. The increase in abundance of species with strong regeneration traits at the cost of species with persistence-related traits has negative consequences for the restoration prospects of severely degraded sites.

Population density and soil seed bank of weed beet as influenced by crop sequence and soil tillage	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT												Dynamics of population density and soil seed bank of weed beet was studied in a 5 year crop rotation consisting of spring barley, and sugar beet. Beside the crop rotation experiment, the seeds of weed beet were studied for their dormancy and viability in soil seed bank over the period of four years. The obtained data indicates that weed beet was able to produce seeds only in sugar beet, but not in barley. In sugar beet, its reproductive potential allows weed beet to restore and increase the soil seed bank of glomerules rapidly. Common infestation of sugar beet is able to persist over more than the 2-year period between repeated introductions of sugar beet in crop rotation. The experiment has also proven the negative effect of weed beet presence on sugar beet yield. The sugar beet root yield decreased of 0.4 t/ha with every 1000 weed beet plants per hectare. The yearly loss of viable seeds was about 75%. The number of surviving seeds decreased exponentially in time. Less than 2% of seeds remained viable after three years in the soil. Seasonal fluctuations of seed dormancy were observed. Seeds were dormant in autumn, lost dormancy in winter and recovered it in late summer.

IN ALPINE GRASSLANDS (CHINA)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Ligularia virgaurea (Maxim.) is a typiwcal naturally-occurring native noxious weed, widely distributed in alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau, China. Three field sampling plots (30 m ' 50 m) dominated by L. virgaurea were selected to study its population colonization mode and the relationship between sexual- and clonal-recruitment in alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, NW China. Field investigations were conducted on its soil seed bank, seed rain and the individuals of new recruitment (seedlings and ramets) to study its sexual and asexual recruitment. And, 46 individuals which produced the seeds were selected randomly to study their relationship between seed production and ramet production. Results showed that there were more ramets (26.23 ramets m(-2)) and less seedlings (6.70 seedlings m(-2)) and a mean value of seed rain was close to 8.04 seeds m(-2), but the soil seed bank for this species was not found in study sites. Significantly negative correlations (r = -0.416, P <0.001) between seed number per individual and ramet number per adult individual were found for L. vrigaurea in studied alpine grasslands. Our results revealed that clonal reproduction was the main population colonization mode. In addition, there was a significantly negative relationship between seed production and ramets for this species.

Yet there are few studies about the seed bank difference between plant communities in lakeshore wetlands. Seed banks are also known to play important roles in the vegetation restoration process. Environmental factors such as water level, temperature, or nutrient levels can affect vegetation composition and seed bank composition. The relationships between environmental factors and seed banks of wetlands in the field are still unknown. The Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve is located at the eastern edge of Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. The lakeshore wetland vegetation is dominated by Phragmites australis (Cav.)Trin. ex Steud., Typha latifolia L., Carex pamirensis C. B. Clarke, Equisetum fluviatile L. The wetlands in Jiuzhaigou (118 lakes) are under strong pressure such as trampling and enhanced construction for travel. Plant restoration is necessary for protection of these areas. We investigated the soil seed bank in six lakeshore wetlands in this area using the seedling emergence method. Sediment samples (0-2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm intervals from surface to bottom) were taken with core (diameter 5 cm) in April and from each replicate samples were spread on two plastic trays. Trays were randomly arranged in the greenhouse and watered daily. Seedlings were counted weekly after emergence, and removed as soon as they could be identified. Our study showed that seed density in all soil layers samples was negatively correlated to water depth. Water depth can explain 45% variance of species richness in surface layer in sediment. Species richness in extant vegetation can explain 45, 48, 25% variance of species richness in total 10 cm and in 2-5 cm and 5-10 cm layer sediment respectively. Dominant species cover in extant vegetation, site altitude, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total organic carbon in soil showed no correlation with species richness in seed bank. Mean seed densities in wetlands ranged from 0 to 15945 m(-2). A total of 23 species germinated in seed bank, while 85 species were found in extant vegetation. The dominant species in seed bank and extant vegetation showed great difference. The total number of species and seedlings that germinated in different layers was not significantly different. But the second layer had the greatest seed density. The relationship between seed bank and extant vegetation differed from one species to another. We should use different restoration strategies for different plant communities.																	1505-2249						2010	58	3					449	457									WOS:000281936100004						
J	Wodkiewicz, M; Kwiatkowska-Falinska, A				Wodkiewicz, Maciej; Kwiatkowska-Falinska, Anna			SMALL SCALE SPATIAL PATTERN OF A SOIL SEED BANK IN AN OLD-GROWTH DECIDUOUS FOREST	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We studied an old growth deciduous forest seed bank to examine how its potential role in regeneration is shaped by natural forest environment. Our research questions were: is the spatial pattern of seed bank influenced by local variation in elevation, soil moisture and light intensity, and what is the impact of herb layer characteristics on seed bank pattern. We recorded species composition of the herb layer and seed bank on a 2 x 40 m study plot divided into 20 quadrates, situated in a natural oak-hornbeam forest, in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, (NE Poland). Soil cores were sampled from two soil layers (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) yielding altogether 40 samples of a total 15.9 dm(3) and 0.159 m(2). Seeds were extracted from soil samples under a microscope. Ellenberg indicator values were used to characterize light (L) and moisture (F) conditions. Relative quadrate elevation was averaged for nine points. There were 6.65 x 10(3) seeds m(-2) in upper soil layer and 3.00 x 10(3) seeds m(-2) in lower soil layer. Seed bank structure constituted of patches 6 m diameter in the upper soil layer and 4 m in the lower soil layer. Aggregated pattern of the seed bank was influenced by clumped distribution of plants in the herb layer. Seed bank species richness in the upper soil layer was correlated with moisture (r = 0.485, P =0.03) and light (r = 0.526, P = 0.0172) values. Seed densities were correlated with moisture (r = 0.848 P <0.0001 upper and r = 0.491 P = 0.0278 lower soil layer) and light (r = 0.803 P <0.0001 upper and r = 0.751 P = 0.0001 lower soil layer). Seed density in upper soil layer was negatively correlated with elevation (r =-0.485 P = 0.0422). Higher seed density and species richness of the seed bank associated with better light conditions and higher moisture is probably caused by higher seed production in favourable conditions, and factors promoting seed persistence in soil. Our results indicate, that even subtle changes in light, moisture and mean relative elevation can shape seed bank spatial pattern on a fine local scale, differentiating the response of this community to small scale disturbances present in natural forests.

Fallowing and mineral fertilisation applied prior to planting may accelerate this process causing considerable seed reduction in an arable soil layer. In order to identify the above-mentioned dependences, in pot experiments conducted in the years 2002-2004 arrangement structure, size and diversity of soil seed bank in soil samples from fields in Przylek were distinguished and compared. On examined samples potatoes and wheat were cultivated in a crop rotation system and wheat in monoculture using various management systems. As a result of the conducted experiments on soil from the field of an extensive farming system there germinated 1382 weed pieces/m(2), and on samples with an intensive farming germinated 3129 weed pieces/m(2). In an extensive farming system there registered 9 weed species. Dominant species were Chenopodium album, Apera spica venti, and Anthemide spp. and on samples from fields of an intensive farming system 12 weed species, of which in the greatest intensification appeared Chenopodium album, Galinsoga parviflora, Anthemide spp. and Apera spica venti. The fallowing process lasting for 72 days used in the experiment increased the number of plant germinations depending on examined samples by 15.5 to 24.4%. The attained results indicated that this method of plant farming substantially influences the number and diversity of seeds of weed species existing in an arable soil layer.																	1898-617X						2010	4	1					73	77									WOS:000283466300012

Evaluating the long-term project to eradicate the rangeland weed Martynia annua L.: linking community with conservation	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Eradication of an invasive species is a holy grail sought by land managers, scientists and policy makers alike. This prize is particularly attractive to funding bodies that foresee a one-off investment to solve a problem. We evaluate a 20-year eradication project on the annual weed Martynia annua L. from remote Gregory (Jutburra) National Park in northern Australia. M. annua was regionally introduced in the 1860s and has since become naturalised and locally abundant on some pastoral properties. When land use changed from grazing to national park in the mid 1980s, M. annua was thought to be a serious problem. An eradication project was started in the late 1980s. Eradication of all individuals from within the National Park has not been successful but there have been other benefits of the project. We analysed operational, biological, social and economic criteria to find that the principal barriers to eradication were: occasional inaccessibility during the crucial seed production window; many widely dispersed small infestations; a perennial seed bank; and long-distance dispersal mechanisms. The two successes of the project were control of the weed to a level where ecological impact was negligible; and extensive community engagement. A novel approach adopted by the National Park, a biannual event called the Devil's Claw Festival, has trained and educated hundreds of local, national and international people about biological invasions and conservation issues in remote northern Australia. Long-term institutional leadership and investment have been crucial for this project. We offer recommendations to policy makers embarking on eradication projects of widespread rangeland weeds.																	1036-9872						2010	32	4					407	417		10.1071/RJ10029							WOS:000284612400006						
J	Gardener, MR; Atkinson, R; Renteria, JL				Gardener, Mark R.; Atkinson, Rachel; Renteria, Jorge Luis			Eradications and People: Lessons from the Plant Eradication Program in Galapagos	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												It is often argued that the benefit of eradication of an invasive species-a one-off injection of funds and the problem is solved-far outweighs the cost of a perennial control program. Furthermore, these are very attractive projects for funding agencies as outcomes are clear and easy to assess. Galapagos is in the early stage of the invasion process, with most alien species not yet naturalized and still restricted to gardens and farms. These species should be easy targets for early and cost-effective eradication projects, which would prevent many future problems. We review 30 plant eradication projects covering 23 potentially invasive species with limited distributions on four of the Galapagos Islands. Of the 30 projects, only four were successful: these were all less than 1 ha in net area, on land with a single owner and did not have persistent seed banks. Of the other 26 projects, most failed due to a lack of support from institutions that did not offer continuity of resources, from land owners who denied permission to carry out the work or from being too ambitious. As a result of these problems, 64.3% of the funding secured for the program was spent on discontinued projects. We highlight lessons learned to inform plant eradication programs in the future.

This species has aggressive growth, competitively replacing native trees in the natural forest of the islands. The aim of this study was to examine seed and seedling factors which might confer an advantage to the establishment of Bischofia over native trees. During a 5-yr period we compared the demographic parameters of early life history of Bischofia and Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius, a native canopy dominant, in actively invaded forests. Predation of Elaeocarpus seeds by in troduced rodents was much higher before (27.9-32.9%) and after (41.3-100%) dispersal of seeds than that of B. javanica. Most Elaeocarpus seeds lost viability ca. 6 mo after burial in forest soil while some seeds of Bischofia remained viable for more than 2 yr. Seedling survival in the first 2 yr was much higher in Bischofia (16%) than in Elaeocarpus (1.3%). The high persistence of Bischofia in the shade, coupled to its rapid acclimation to high light levels, is an unusual combination because in forest tree species there is generally a trade-off between seedling survival in the shade and response to canopy opening. Compared with a native canopy dominant, greater seed longevity, lower seed predation by introduced rodents, longer fruiting periods and the ability to form seedling banks under closed canopy appear to have contributed to the invasive success of Bischofia on the Bonin Islands.																			978-4-431-53858-5				2010							93	102		10.1007/978-4-431-53859-2_15	10.1007/978-4-431-53859-2						WOS:000276528000015

The litter and soil samples of 1 x 1 m were collected at a depth of 5.0 cm in a secondary semideciduous forest in Vicosa, MG, Brazil. The litter and soil samples were deposited in seedbeds in which the superficial soil (10 cm) was previously removed. Three treatments were performed as well as a separate control with five repetitions, totaling 20 samples. The first treatment (T1) was the litter transposition only, the second treatment (T2) was the soil seed bank only, the third treatment (T3) was the transposition of the litter together with the soil seed bank and the control (T). During a period of six months, 327 individuals of trees and shrubs and 864 herbaceous individuals were identified. Among the tree and shrub species occurring in the samples, 74% were classified as pioneers, and 26% were classified as other ecological groups. The most abundant tree species were Cecropia hololeuca with 151 individuals. Among the herbs, Oxalis corniculata was the most abundant, with 329 individuals. The differences of density and species richness between the treatments were significant, with the greatest richness in treatment T3 and the greatest densities in treatments T2 and T3. Therefore, it is concluded that the transposition of the seed bank is a promising methodology to stimulate forest restoration in degraded areas, being more efficient when the superficial soil is used with the litter.																	0100-6762					JAN-FEB	2010	34	1					65	73		10.1590/S0100-67622010000100008							WOS:000277831400008

The main goal of this paper is to present restoration techniques based on the concept of nucleation, in which small nuclei of vegetation are established within a degraded land. The nucleation techniques (artificial shelters for animals, planting of herbaceous shrub life forms, soil and seed bank translocation, seed rain translocation, soil and seed rain translocation's seedling set, artificial perches, planting of native trees in groups, and ecological stepping-stones with functional groups) promote the landscape connectivity on two flows: inward: receiver connectivity and outward: donor connectivity. The nuclei development represents an alternative for restoration by prioritizing the natural processes of succession. This methodology appears to take long to generate vegetation corresponding to tropical climates, but is fundamental in the formation of communities capable of acting, in the future, as a new functional nuclei within the current fragmented landscape. This strategy also encourages greater integration between the theories and projects of ecological restoration for the development of human resources and to benefit the restoration practitioner.

Seed desiccation sensitivity of Quercus fabri and Castanopsis fissa (Fagaceae)	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The logistics of reforestation and restoration projects often require that seeds being used to produce seedlings must be stored after collection. However, desiccation tolerance and subsequent survival of stored seeds of many Chinese temperate and subtropical tree species, such as White oak (Quercus:fabric) and Chestnut oak (Castanopsis fissa), are poorly understood. Both Quercus fabri and Castanopsis fissa are multipurpose. deciduous trees growing in temperate and subtropical forests in southwest China. However, since the first stage in the ex-situ conserving seeds is drying, it is important to know whether or not seeds of Q. fabri and C. fissa tolerate drying. The present purpose was to determine the desiccation sensitivity and storability of these two species with the aim of effectively storing seeds in a seed bank. Subjected to rapid drying, the germination of Q. fabri seeds declined dramatically from 95% to zero when seed moisture content decreased from an initial 42.5% to 21.7%. In particular. viability of Q. fabri seeds decreased by more than 50% at 31.0% moisture content. Loss of viability of C. fissa seeds showed a similar pattern, decreasing to 48% at 27.6% moisture content. Based on these results, we concluded that seeds of both species were desiccation sensitive. Such information is valuable for maintaining seed viability during storage and subsequent reforestation. As well, both Q. fabri and C. fissa seeds were chilling-sensitive according to their storability. Data are also obtained, including seed size, 1000-seed weight and seed coat ratio (SCR) of both species.																	0251-0952	1819-5717					2010	38	1					225	230		10.15258/sst.2010.38.1.23							WOS:000276490900023

The influence of environmental factors on the germination of Acorus calamus seeds	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Acorus calamus is an emergent macrophyte with great potential for use in wetland restoration in North America. We studied the germination response of A. calamus seed to different environmental conditions by subjecting them to experimental manipulations of light, temperature, moisture, pH and storage. Seed germination occurred only in full light and it varied significantly (P < 0.0001) across temperatures. Maximum germination occurred in spring (15/25 degrees C) and summer (20/35 degrees C) temperatures when seeds were fully submerged. Germination velocity (Timson's Index) was significantly (P < 0.0001) greater in moist, acidic, late spring temperatures and had significant moisture x temperature (P < 0.0001), temperature x pH (P < 0.0001) and moisture x pH (P < 0.0001) interactions. Seeds germinated more rapidly in moist environments. Acorns calamus can create persistent seed banks germinating when soil turnover exposes them to light. There was no significant difference in seed germination after storage for 24 months. Results indicate that A. calamus seeds can indeed be used for a wide range of wetland restoration projects. Seeding of A. calamus is best conducted at the very onset of projects when there is more light available at the soil surface.																	0251-0952						2010	38	2					390	398		10.15258/sst.2010.38.2.12							WOS:000281714000012

The seeds of S. virgata were collected in the municipal district of Natuba-PB in March/2008. Eight treatments were used as follows: intact seeds in the presence and absence of light, at 25 degrees C; intact seeds in the presence and absence of light, at 30 degrees C; submerged seeds in sulfuric acid for five minutes in the presence and absence of light, at 25 degrees C; submerged seeds in sulfuric acid for five minutes in the presence and absence of light, at 30 degrees C. The germination tests were accomplished in germination cameras under light and continuous darkness at constant temperatures of 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, in a 12 hours photoperiod. The seeds were put to germinate in plastic boxes (gerbox) with filter paper. The seeds of S. virgata have tegument dormancy and show low germination tax when intact, which is a strategy for seed banks formation. The acid scarification increased germination percentage and speed germination index.																	1676-546X	1679-0359					2010	31	4					889	893		10.5433/1679-0359.2010v31n4p889							WOS:000285295400009						
S	Kalinova, J		Lichtfouse, E		Kalinova, Jana			Allelopathy and Organic Farming	SOCIOLOGY, ORGANIC FARMING, CLIMATE CHANGE AND SOIL SCIENCE	Sustainable Agriculture Reviews											Allelopathy is a biological process including interactions between two plants through the production of chemical compounds (allelochemicals) that are released by leaching, volatilization, decomposition, or root exudation. Hence, allelopathy together with competition is a promising environment-friendly tool for weed management. However, detailed knowledge of this phenomenon is necessary for its successful application due to still limited available knowledge. Suitable use of allelopathic crops in agriculture could reduce the pesticide application and thereby reduce the environmental and food pollution, decrease costs in agriculture, improve food security in poor regions and soil productivity, and increase biodiversity and sustainability in the agro-ecosystem. Weed management in organic agriculture is one of the most difficult aspects of organic farming and uses especially preventive methods that include ways such as cover crops, mulches, green manure, intercropping in which allelopathy could play an important role. Therefore, this review focuses on the possibilities of the allelopathy application in organic agriculture. Roots of allelopathic plants as cover crops, intercrops, green manure, or so-called smothering crops or decomposing residues release compounds in the soil that are toxic to weeds. The weed-suppressive effect is influenced by species, planting date, seeding rate and method, weather, and other factors. Decomposition time of plant residues and amounts of biomass are important factors of weed control by mulching. Annual, biennial, or perennial herbaceous plants in a pure or mixed stand can be grown for these purposes. Biofumigation is the name for one type of allelopathy that includes effects of the chemicals, i.e., highly toxic isothiocyanates, produced by Brassica green manure. The balance in the crop rotation is necessary due to possible autotoxicity. A allelopathic plants as catch crops or trap crops found utilization in plant protection of tropical regions against parasite weeds, because they can reduce the parasite seed bank by 72%. Other applications of allelopathy for weed control include the use of plant residues as an herbicide agent, e.g., water extracts, pellets, flours, by-products of crop processing, etc. Sorgaab, an extract of sorghum, is produced commercially as a natural herbicide. Allelopathic compounds act as repellents for herbivorous pests, so the same strategy used in weed control could be effective against pests and pathogens, e.g., push-pull strategy. All possible applications of allelopathy need to combine with other methods of plant protection. Newly investigated pollen allelopathy could reduce reproductive ability of wind pollination annual weeds. Pollen of allelopathic species would be artificially dusted on the stigmatic surface of other plants. This phenomenon is yet to be studied and field tested. The new crop varieties with elevated allelopathic activity could be a great chance not only for organic farming. Hybridization could be the promising method. However, allelopathic activity was identified as a quantitative trait and therefore this characteristic is affected by both genetic effects and environmental conditions.																	2210-4410	2210-4429	978-90-481-3332-1				2010	3						379	418		10.1007/978-90-481-3333-8_14	10.1007/978-90-481-3333-8						WOS:000273430200014

Production of reactive oxygen species in excised, desiccated and cryopreserved explants of Trichilia dregeana Sond	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The tropical tree Trichilia dregeana Sond. has recalcitrant seeds that cannot be stored by conventional seed banking methods that include drying and storage at low temperatures, or by using cryopreservation protocols that have been successfully applied to recalcitrant-seeded species such as Castanea sativa. We recently showed that in C saliva both excision of the embryonic axes and subsequent dehydration cause transitory (5 min) bursts of extracellular superoxide production. Here we show that both excision and partial dehydration of the embryonic axes from seeds of T dregeana cause large, prolonged extracellular bursts of O-2(center dot-). Furthermore, during rehydration after cryopreservation, another burst of O-2(center dot-) occurs with slightly different kinetics. Compared with C. sativa, rates Of O-2(center dot-) production in T. dregeana are approximately twice as great and decline much more slowly, suggesting that excessive radical formation may be responsible for poor survival of the axes following cryopreservation. Fractionating the cell wall proteins of embryonic axes and cotyledons in conjunction with electrophoretic analyses of the fractions showed that Most O-2(center dot-) was produced by two peroxidases with molecular masses of c. 50 and 80 kD that were loosely bound to the cell walls of the embryonic axes. Future successful cryopreservation of T. dregeana would appear to depend on manipulations of O-2(center dot-) production, and the discovery of peroxidases as the enzymes responsible described here may help in the development of more effective protocols.

Seed banks were sampled annually and kept in cold storage. Population changes on 26 morphological, agronomic and chemical characters were measured three and 16 years after sowing, in comparison with the ancestral bulk-hybrid population. Changes in population means were observed in 20 characters at one or both sites, with much of this occurring within 3 years. Natural selection at Nabawa favoured early flowering of long duration, thick peduncles, high harvest index and high hardseededness, while at Mt Barker it favoured late flowering of short duration, large leaves and long, thick petioles at flowering, thick stems with long internodes, long, thin peduncles with a high burial angle, large plants at maturity, low hardseededness and high biochanin A and total oestrogenic isoflavone contents. High seed production capacity, with high seed weight and seeds per burr, was important at both sites. The use of bulk-hybrid populations is suggested as a low-input means of breeding and selecting well-adapted subterranean clovers.																			978-90-481-8705-8				2010							557	+		10.1007/978-90-481-8706-5_83							WOS:000280198100083						
J	Orr, DM				Orr, D. M.			Managing the grass-legume balance in Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca pastures in central Queensland	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												The impacts of 4 grazing strategies (yearlong grazing, summer grazing, winter grazing and winter grazing plus spring burning) on the grass: legume balance were studied between 2000 and 2006 in a pasture oversown with Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca (Seca stylo) in central Queensland. Seasonal rainfall throughout the study was generally below average. Total pasture yields in autumn were higher in the 2 winter grazing than the 2 summer grazing treatments, largely reflecting the sampling time relative to when grazing occurred. There were few differences in Seca composition in autumn, although there was a clear trend for Seca composition to be reduced by winter grazing plus burning. Both the frequency of occurrence and plant density of Seca were higher under the 2 summer grazing treatments and there was also a trend for the density of juvenile plants (<5 cm height) to be higher in the 2 summer grazing treatments. Seca soil seed banks were generally low and were reduced in the winter grazing plus burning treatment in spring 2002. The frequency of the palatable perennial grass Pennisetum ciliaris (Biloela buffel grass) was reduced while that of the 'increaser' species Bothriochloa pertusa (Indian couch grass) and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis (snake weed) increased in the 2 summer grazing treatments compared with the 2 winter grazing treatments. Burning in spring increased soil loss in treatments grazed in winter. Differences in Seca frequency and density but not composition were explained by the 2 summer grazing treatments promoting 'gaps' in the pasture which were then colonised by Seca plants and other 'increaser' species. It was reasoned that, with time, mature Seca plants in the 2 winter grazing treatments would die so that Seca composition would eventually become higher under summer grazing regimes than under winter grazing. It was concluded that limiting grazing to particular seasons can alter legume: grass balance and that a time-frame of 5-8 years with average to good rainfall would be necessary to achieve large shifts in composition.																	0049-4763						2010	44						174	183									WOS:000292910800019

Successful creation of species-rich grassland on road verges depend on various methods for seed transfer	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												This study focused on a suite of vascular plant species (six herbs and two grasses) common to traditionally managed, species-rich grasslands in Western Norway. We assessed the suitability of two species transfer methods (seed sowing and soil seed bank) for restoration of species-rich grassland on a newly established road verge. We compared the species' frequencies one and three years after they were sown on a naked, newly created road verge with their frequencies in aboveground vegetation and soil seed banks of comparable, local grasslands. Species frequencies in the aboveground vegetation differed significantly from those in the seed banks. Moreover, the frequencies in the seed banks differed from those recorded one year after sowing, and the frequencies in the aboveground vegetation differed from those recorded three years after sowing. Avenula pubescens and Knautia arvensis, found in more than 25% of the aboveground grassland plots, did not germinate from any of the seed bank samples. Festuca rubra, Galium verum, Pimpinella saxifraga and Silene vulgaris were more frequent in the aboveground plots than in the seed bank samples. Pimpinella saxifraga, Galium verum and Lychnis viscaria emerged quite well both from sown seeds and from the seed bank. Avenula pubescens was frequent in the aboveground vegetation, but did not germinate from sown seeds. Six species established well from seeds, and most increased in frequency in the sown plots from the first to the third year. No species was found in the sown plots only, but three years after sowing, three species were more frequent in the sown plots than in the aboveground vegetation of donor grassland plots. Our fine-scale, point-to-point study demonstrates that different restoration methods produce widely differing species composition even when the donor material is identical. We propose that different substrates and a combination of establishment methods (sowing and hay transfer) are needed as supplements to seed banks to re-establish species-rich grassland.

Nonnative Plant Response to Silvicultural Treatments: A Model Based on Disturbance, Propagule Pressure, and Competitive Abilities	WESTERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY					Conference on Forest Biomass Utilization - Impact on Forest Resources	MAY 14-14, 2008	Spokane, WA					Invasion by normative plants can result in substantial adverse effects on the functions of native forest ecosystems, including nutrient cycling and fire regimes. Thus, forest managers need to be aware of the potential impacts of management activities, including silvicultural treatments, on normative vegetation. To aid in that effort, we created a conceptual model of potential responses of normative plants to silvicultural treatments, used the model to make a general set of predictions, and tested our predictions against observed responses published in the scientific literature. Of a total of 42 studies that addressed the effects of silvicultural treatments on normative plants, 90% found a posttreatment increase in at least one normative plant species. All of the studies that assessed the effect of disturbance intensity on normative plants found that invasion success increased with increasing disturbance intensity or number of management entries. As predicted by the model, there was substantial among-species and among-site variation in normative plant responses to silvicultural treatments; variation in responses were probably driven by local conditions including propagule pressure, condition of the forest community, or characteristics of the local flora (native and normative species). Because species- and location-specific changes in normative plants are dependent on local conditions, local knowledge is important for predicting invasion potential. In addition, monitoring is essential for early detection of postharvest invasions and/or expansions of normative plants.

The effects of fire recurrence (up to more than three recurrent fires with an interval since the last fire of more or less than 15 years) on the structure of fuel beds were studied at stand level in southeastern France. Three types of vegetation that are among the most common in the study area (pure pine stands, oak-pine mixed stands and shrublands) were studied to determine the role of fire recurrence on biodiversity. Fuel bed description was carried out on aboveground vegetation at understorey and overstorey levels, and on litter in 39 homogeneous study sites. The structure of the understorey was categorized following a gradient of fragmentation including: (i) isolated shrubs, (ii) vegetation patches made up of a single species and (iii) homogeneous vegetation layers including different species of the same height. The decrease of time interval since the last fire caused an opening of the canopy, except for the lowest vegetation stratum (grasses and low shrubs) that did not vary significantly. There was no significant change in horizontal connectivity between fuel beds (% of layer cover) as a function of the fire regime or the type of vegetation. Conversely, the vertical connectivity (% of tree cover, height of the trees and of the layer) was affected by the fire regime, especially in pure pine stands. Fire regime also influenced the litter layer and litter depth decreased with an increase in the opening of the stand that could be due to fire. These results show that fire risk is greater in the oldest stands (long interval since the last fire). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Influence of Perenniality and Seed Banks on Polymorphism in Plant-Parasite Interactions	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Antagonistic interactions, such as diseases, play an important role in natural populations. Understanding the mechanisms that promote long-term polymorphism at loci that are involved in host-parasite recognition is a fundamental problem in evolutionary ecology. Coevolution implies the existence of indirect frequency-dependent selection because the fitnesses of parasite genotypes depend on the frequencies of host genes and vice versa. Polymorphism can be maintained in both organisms if there is also negative, direct, frequency-dependent selection, when natural selection for host resistance or parasite virulence declines with increasing frequency of that trait itself. In this article, using the gene-for-gene relationship as a model, we show that two plant life-history traits, seed banks and perenniality with parasite density-dependent disease transmission, generate frequency-dependent selection on host resistance and are thus capable of stabilizing frequencies of coevolving host and parasite genes. The host population's response to selection by the parasite is modified by the contribution of past selective events stored in long-lived seed banks or in a growing population of perennial plants that have a long life span in the absence of disease. While fitness costs determine whether coevolutionary cycles occur in interacting host and parasite populations, the ecology of the two organisms determines whether stable polymorphism is maintained.

Seed moisture content affects afterripening and smoke responsiveness in three sympatric Australian native species from fire-prone environments	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Germination of freshly collected seeds of three sympatric herbaceous species native to fire-prone environments in south-western Australia was significantly improved through the application of novel combinations of dry heat, gibberellic acid, smoke water and dry afterripening. For fresh seeds, combinations of dry heat, gibberellic acid and/or smoke water resulted in > 80% germination in Austrostipa elegantissima (Poaceae) and Stylidium affine (Stylidaceae) seeds and > 60% germination in Conostylis candicans (Haemodoraceae) seeds, compared with < 10% germination of control seeds. For fresh seeds, two broad germination patterns were observed in response to smoke water: nil - low germination for both control and smoke water-treated seeds (A. elegantissima and S. affine); and a significant smoke response (35%) compared with control seeds (1%) (C. candicans). During afterripening, high germination for A. elegantissima seeds was achieved following 3 months storage of seeds at equilibrium relative humidities of 23-75%, but seeds stored at 5-13% equilibrium relative humidities took 6-36 months to achieve similar levels of germination. Germination of C. candicans seeds also increased after 3 months storage, to > 60% at each equilibrium relative humidity and further increases over time were slight. For S. affine seeds > 60% germination was achieved only after 36 months storage at 50% equilibrium relative humidity. Seeds from all three species were smoke-responsive at some point, but the interaction/effects of afterripening on the smoke response varied significantly between species. This study highlights an apparent effect of seed dormancy status on response to smoke and a surprisingly high level of ecological variation in pre-germination requirements (cues) for these co-occurring species that may relate to variation(s) in microsite selection forces operating on the soil seed bank of the different species.

Evaluating barriers to native seedling establishment in an invaded Hawaiian lowland wet forest	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Many tropical island forest ecosystems are dominated by non-native plant species and lack native species regeneration in the understorey. Comparison of replicated control and removal plots offers an opportunity to examine not only invasive species impacts but also the restoration potential of native species. In lowland Hawaiian wet forests little is known about native species seed dynamics, recruitment requirements, or the effects of management. In a heavily invaded lowland wet forest, we examined the relationship between seed presence and seedling establishment in control and removal plots. Non-native species were competitively superior because they had higher germination percentages and dominated the seed bank; only seven out of 33,375 seedlings were native. In contrast, the seed rain contained native seed, but native seedling recruitment was almost exclusively limited to removal plots, suggesting that optimum establishment conditions are not met in the presence of a dense mid-storey of non-native species. Non-native species dominance was altered and biomass significantly decreased over time resulting in a reduced weeding effort (12.38-0.77 g day(-1)). We suggest that with opening of the canopy through non-native species removal and subsequent weeding. it may be possible to reduce the seed bank enough to skew the regeneration potential towards native species. Our results suggest that germination success and lack of a seed bank are the main bottlenecks for native species. We conclude that without invasive species control, future regeneration of Hawaiian lowland wet forests is likely to be almost entirely non-native. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Meulebrouck, K; Verheyen, K; Brys, R; Hermy, M				Meulebrouck, Klaar; Verheyen, Kris; Brys, Rein; Hermy, Martin			Metapopulation viability of an endangered holoparasitic plant in a dynamic landscape	ECOGRAPHY												By creating transient patch mosaics, disturbance can influence the dynamics of interacting populations in many ecosystems. In European heathland, traditional land use created such dynamic systems favourable for both early and later successional species. Little empirical evidence is, however, available on the impact of current management on metapopulations occurring in such landscapes. This paper looks at the metapopulation viability of the endangered holoparasite Cuscuta epithymum, a species that typically occurs in early successional stages of recently managed heathlands. We used both observational and experimental data from a 4-yr study to parameterise a spatially explicit metapopulation model. This model explores the impact of demographic characteristics and spatiotemporal landscape patterns created by management events on metapopulation viability. Both occasional long-distance dispersal and dormant seeds are shown to be critical for the long-term survival of C. epithymum in a dynamic heathland landscape subjected to a fixed rotational mowing of 15 yr. A relatively high management frequency (< 15 yr between two consecutive mowing events) appeared to be necessary to sustain a viable C. epithymum metapopulation. When there is a longer interval between management events, grazing can counterbalance the negative effects of vegetation succession. Our results indicate that small-scale cyclical management events combined with extensive grazing are the most appropriate management strategy to maintain viable populations of C. epithymum instead of the current large-scale management events. Our results further emphasise the importance of incorporating both spatiotemporal patch availability and key demographic characteristics, especially seed banks, for a realistic view of metapopulation dynamics in disturbed landscapes. This study clearly demonstrates the usefulness of metapopulation models to understand the impact of management events and to provide new ecological insights into processes acting at a landscape scale.

Relative influence of landscape vs. local factors on plant community assembly in restored wetlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Ecological restoration often involves only the manipulation of abiotic factors at the local scale. However, processes external to a restoration site determine the range of local conditions within the site, constraining the level of restoration progress that can be achieved by on-site manipulations. We examined the relationship of landscape and local explanatory variables to plant species composition in 28 restored wetlands in Illinois, USA. Using constrained ordination combined with variation partitioning, we determined the independent and joint effects of three spatially hierarchical sets of variables: (1) macroscale landscape features reflecting site setting within regional landscapes, (2) mesoscale landscape features reflecting nearby propagule sources and buffers from disturbances, and (3) local environmental factors. Because the relative influence of landscape-vs. local-scale factors on restoration success may depend on particular restoration goals, we repeated the analyses using three multivariate plant community responses that represented three frequently stated goals: (1) replicating species composition, (2) restoring a particular wetland community type, and (3) constructing sites with high value for plant conservation. Explanatory variables at landscape and local scales had independent and nearly equally strong relationships to plant species composition. In contrast, when species were aggregated based on plant traits, the independent contribution of local predictors was greater than the independent contributions of macroscale or mesoscale landscape predictors, reflecting convergence of plant trait composition in sites with similar local conditions. Local predictors explained a significant amount of variation in plant conservation value among sites, but much of the variation could be explained by large-scale landscape setting, indicating that landscape constraints on local environmental conditions limited the level of floristic conservation value achievable. The appropriate scale at which to focus restoration efforts will vary depending upon restoration objectives. Restoration of particular wetland community types might be successfully achieved through manipulation of local abiotic factors. In contrast, restoration of a particular species assemblage or reconstruction of wetlands with high value for conservation requires consideration of landscape processes and available species pools.

O.; Eriksson, Ove			Dispersal and establishment limitation reduces the potential for successful restoration of semi-natural grassland communities on former arable fields	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. Ex-arable fields have been suggested as potential sites for re-creation of semi-natural grasslands, but information is still limited on the temporal scales needed for the natural assembly of these communities and whether colonization is related to dispersal or establishment limitation. 2. We investigated grazed ex-arable fields of different age and adjacent semi-natural grasslands in terms of species richness of plants, community similarity, colonization pattern and recruitment ability of 16 sown grassland species. The functional trait distribution of successful and unsuccessful colonizing species was compared using five traits related to dispersal and persistence: seed mass, seed bank persistence, specific leaf area, plant height and potential for lateral spread. 3. The youngest ex-arable fields had the lowest species richness and contained communities with the lowest similarity to semi-natural grassland. Species richness and similarity to semi-natural grassland both increased with time since grazing started on ex-arable fields, but were still significantly lower than in semi-natural grasslands even after more than 50 years of grazing. 4. Colonization was not related to any of the investigated functional traits. The rank order of the species in terms of abundance was correlated between young and old ex-arable fields suggesting that species performance remains the same with field age. 5. Recruitment after sowing was generally lower in ex-arable fields than in semi-natural grasslands, although the basic recruitment ability varied between species. Recruitment did not change with field age, suggesting that dispersal limitation rather than establishment limitation caused the temporal pattern of colonization. However, establishment limitation may act as a filter for colonization of all ex-arable fields, regardless of their age. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the temporal scale for natural assembly of semi-natural grassland communities in ex-arable fields extends over 50 years, even when source pools are nearby. Results suggest that a field age-independent establishment limitation, combined with dispersal limitation, cause the delayed assembly in ex-arable fields. Management that aims to re-create semi-natural grassland communities in ex-arable fields should consider introducing seeds or improving germination conditions at the sites.

Micropropagation and in vitro conservation of wild Arachis species	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE												Wild species of Arachis constitute potential sources of novel genes for groundnut improvement programs and some of them are also considered as new agricultural usage. The majority of these species occur in regions under intensive human activity and their areas of distribution are being drastically reduced, thus requiring effective conservation measures. Conservation of Arachis germplasm is usually carried out in seed banks or as live plants. However, seed renewal can be impaired by loss of germinative potential, and plant multiplication under field conditions can be limited by specific soil and environmental requirements or by low seed yield. Therefore, complementary in vitro methodologies represent an important tool for ex situ conservation of Arachis germplasm. In this work, we analyse the state of art of micropropagation and the use of in vitro conservation methodologies for wild relatives of the groundnut.

In this study seed and seedling traits of three congeneric alien species in Europe, differing in their region of origin, invasion status and history (Impatiens glandulifera, I. parviflora, L capensis), were compared with the native L noli-tangere in laboratory and common garden experiments. Seeds of I. glandulifera required the shortest period of stratification, germinated well both under laboratory and experimental garden conditions and the seedlings produced more biomass than those of the other species. Seeds of I. parviflora required a longer period of stratification, had the highest percentage germination but seedling emergence in the experimental garden was poorer than in L glandulifera. Neither of these two species invasive in the Czech Republic formed soil seed banks. The native I. noli-tangere had the lowest percentage germination and formed a short-term persistent seed bank. Impatiens capensis germinated well in the laboratory, had the highest seedling emergence in the garden and its seed remained viable in the soil for three years. This indicates that in terms of germination and emergence, this species is comparable with the two invasive alien congeners and there appear to be no constraints to its invasion in the Czech Republic where it does not occur yet. Its absence may be due to a low propagule pressure; in the national flora L capensis is listed as a potential future invader without mentioning it being cultivated in this country. Our results indicate that differences in the invasiveness of three alien species of balsams in the temperate zone of Central Europe can be attributed, at least in part, to their differing performances in the early stages of their life cycle. The short period of time required for seed stratification and the high seedling biomass of L glandulifera might have increased its invasion potential compared to other Impatiens species occurring in the Czech Republic.

J	Rodriguez, C; Garcia, MA				Rodriguez, Claudia; Garcia, Maria Alice			Seed-bank dynamics of the tropical weed Sida rhombifolia (Malvaceae): incidence of seedling emergence, predators and pathogens	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Arrowleaf sida (Sida rhombifolia) is a tropical weed that grows in disturbed areas. Its control by hand pulling and mowing are only partially effective because arrowleaf sida is difficult to pull and quickly sprouts after cutting. We studied the seed-bank dynamics of S. rhombifolia in the region of Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil for 2 years, following a known number of seeds placed artificially at five burial depths. Predators and pathogens were responsible for the loss of c. 40% of the seeds during the first year of the experiment. The importance of predation declined with depth. Mortality due to fungal attack did not differ among the burial depths, except for seeds placed at the surface (where it was negligible). Seedling emergence only occurred during the first year, after the beginning of the rainy period and when the study area was still free of a dense vegetation cover. Seedlings did not emerge from depths greater than 5 cm. We conclude that seedling emergence and death are significant causes of seed losses from the seed bank of S. rhombifolia but their relative importance is highly dependent on depth of burial.																	0960-2585					DEC	2009	19	4					241	248		10.1017/S0960258509990146							WOS:000271994700005

Sensitivity cycling to physical dormancy break and seed vigour of two Ipomoea species (Convolvulaceae)	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The physically dormant seeds of Ipomoea lacunosa and of I. hederacea undergo sensitivity cycling (insensitive <-> sensitive) to dormancy-breaking treatment. Sensitivity cycling is important to seeds with physical dormancy in sensing appropriate environmental conditions for germination. Seed vigour is also important to seedling establishment, but no study has compared changes in vigour (or not) with changes in sensitivity. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between sensitivity cycling and seed vigour in I. lacunosa and I. hederacea. The seed moisture contents of insensitive and sensitive seeds of I. lacunosa and of sensitive seeds of I. hederacea were measured, and several vigour tests were performed. Vigour of sensitive seeds of I. lacunosa decreased more rapidly than that of insensitive seeds. No significant change in vigour was observed in either permeable or impermeable seeds of I. hederacea We conclude that sensitivity cycling to physical dormancy break is important in maintaining vigour of I. lacunosa seeds in the soil seed-bank.

J	Kelly, CK; Bowler, MG				Kelly, Colleen K.; Bowler, Michael G.			Investigating the role of enemies in temporal dynamics: Differential sensitivity, competition and stable coexistence	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												The impact of herbivores and other pests on plants varies greatly from year to year. Here we develop an analytical model of a temporal niche dynamic as a tool to examine how natural fluctuations in pest (enemy) levels may determine coexistence in competing annual plant species when one but not the other is affected by the pest. We show that the probability and speed with which the resistant drives out the sensitive species, coexists with it, or is driven out by its sensitive competitor depends on the cost of pest-resistance to the unaffected species, the frequency of high pest levels in the habitat and the competitive advantage of the sensitive species when the pest is not actively present. The interaction is regulated primarily by pest impact on relative seedling survival of the two, with relative yield per capita of seeds viable into the following season (effective fecundity) the next most vulnerable life-cycle stage.

Identifying key components of weed beet management using sensitivity analyses of the GeneSys-Beet model in GM sugar beet	WEED RESEARCH												P>Genetically-modified (GM) sugar beet varieties tolerant to non-selective herbicides would be useful for managing weed beet, an annual form of Beta vulgaris impossible to eliminate with herbicides in sugar beet. However, it is highly probable that the herbicide-tolerance transgene would be transmitted to the weed through pollen flow. It is therefore essential to study how weed beet. particularly Herbicide-Tolerant (HT) populations, develop in cropping systems and how to optimise crop succession and management for controlling these weeds. As multiple interactions and long-term effects make field experiments impractical, we carried out a simulation study with a deterministic and mechanistic model, GeneSys-Beet, which quantifies weed beet dynamics and gene flow in cropping systems with interactions with climate, soil structure and hydro-thermal conditions. The sensitivity analysis consisted of 250 000 random combinations of input variables to rank cropping system components according to their effect on both total and GM weed beet infestations. Frequency of sugar beet crops, crop succession, manual and mechanical weeding and tillage were identified as the most important variables. Several cultivation techniques must be combined to efficiently control weed beet. Our recommendations are complex, but a delayed return of sugar beet in the rotation. Harvest should be followed as soon as possible by a shallow tilling; tillage should always be as shallow and as early as possible, except before sugar beet where mouldboard ploughing is advisable. If possible, sowing dates should be delayed. Sugar beet should be weeded mechanically and/or manually, aiming at late and efficient, rather than early or frequent operations. Herbicides should be applied whenever possible and target all weed beet stages and genotypes. Set-aside must be cut as frequently and as late as possible.

Plant community establishment following drawdown of a reservoir in southern Arkansas, USA	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wetland area, function and wildlife habitat value are extensively altered by the construction of freshwater reservoirs. We studied the effects of a temporary drawdown on shoreline vegetation communities of Felsenthal Navigation Pool ("the pool"), an impoundment at Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arkansas that is managed as a greentree reservoir. The pool was permanently flooded from 1985 until the summer of 1995 when the water level was dropped 0.3 m for about 16 weeks, exposing about 1,591 ha of soil. To document plant succession on the sediments exposed, we recorded plant species composition and cover at 14 transects along the pool margin prior to the drawdown, during the drawdown, and in the following summer. A soil disturbance treatment was applied near five transects following the drawdown, and soil was collected at each transect for seed bank and soil analyses. Plants colonized the drawdown zone quickly and high vegetation cover was present at some transects 4 weeks after the drawdown was initiated. Plants included species that are high quality food sources for waterfowl, including Cyperus erythrorhizos and Leptochloa fascicularis var. fascicularis. Vegetation response, measured by species richness, total cover, and cover of Cyperus species, was often greater at low compared to high elevations in the drawdown zone; this effect was probably intensified by low summer rainfall. Response on the disturbed transects was lower than that on the undisturbed transects. This effect was attributed to two factors: (1) removal of the existing seed bank by the disturbance applied and (2) reduced incorporation of seeds recruited during the drawdown because of unusually low rainfall. Seed bank studies demonstrated that several species persisted despite 10 years of continual flooding, and that seed bank species richness increased during the drawdown. Although conclusions are limited by the 1-year time frame of the study, it is unlikely that permanent change to plant community structure in the drawdown zone resulted from the lowered water level.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				DEC	2009	17	6					565	583		10.1007/s11273-009-9134-x							WOS:000271963900001

Management of Lantana, an invasive alien weed, in forest ecosystems of India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Lantana is one of the world's worst weeds of South American origin that threatens native biodiversity of forest ecosystems across India. It was introduced into India as a garden ornamental and or a biohedge plant in the early part of the 19th century and now it has virtually invaded all the tropical and subtropical regions of India. Although attempts have been made to control Lantana by physical, chemical and biological methods, there is no success either in its control or the prevention of its spread. No effective management strategy is yet available for the containment of this obnoxious alien weed. On the basis of critical assessment of the biological and ecological attributes of Lantana that enabled it to overcome all the existing management practices, we have developed a new management strategy. The new strategy involves (i) its removal by cut rootstock method, (ii) weeding of saplings from beneath the trees used for perching by generalist birds that disperse the seeds throughout their home range and from surface drainage channels originating from the area covered by such trees and (iii) ecological restoration of weed-free landscapes, preferably to the grassland, or forest communities according to the needs of stakeholders to prevent reinvasion of the same species or secondary invasion by another alien species. The new strategy developed has been implemented successfully in demonstration plots of 2-5 hectares at the Corbett Tiger Reserve (Uttarakhand), Kalesar National Park (Haryana) and Satpura Tiger Reserve (Madhya Pradesh). The advantages of the new management strategy over other control methods currently used are: (i) cost effectiveness, (ii) simple and easy to adopt and (iii) ensures successful control of Lantana without using chemicals and exotic biological control agents, and with minimum disturbance of soil.																	0011-3891					NOV 25	2009	97	10					1421	1429									WOS:000272231900012

Can brush-cutting of Pteronia paniculata improve the composition and productivity of veld in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa?	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Pteronia paniculata is an indigenous, unpalatable shrub that invades mismanaged Karooveld, resulting in degraded rangelands with low species diversity and grazing potential. We conducted a series of trials in the Succulent Karoo Randteveld near Barrydale to determine if the uniform defoliation of P. paniculata dominated vegetation at two heights (0.05 m and 0.20 m above ground level) using a brush-cutter and, in one trial, application of a second cut will improve the plant species composition, productivity and grazing capacity of the veld. Brush-cutting treatments and the uncut control all resulted in a change in species composition towards greater species diversity and more palatable species and an average increase of 540 kg ha(-1) (28%) in above-ground biomass over four years. It appears that there was a pervasive improvement in species composition associated with a general decline in the cover and abundance of P. paniculata over the time-scale of the present study that was not influenced by the defoliation treatments, except for the 1996-cut treatment where the cover of P. paniculata increased. The absence of propagules of palatable species in the soil seed bank and competition from P. paniculata (a long-lived, perennial shrub) are assumed to be among the main reasons for the lack of response of the vegetation community to the defoliation treatments. Brush-cutting (in the absence of reseeding), aimed at reducing the dominance of unpalatable karoo shrubs, was more costly but not significantly better than long-term resting in improving veld composition or forage production.																	1022-0119	1727-9380				NOV	2009	26	3					181	190		10.2989/AJRF.2009.26.3.9.954							WOS:000273771800009

No-Tillage Improves Broomrape Control with Glyphosate in Faba-Bean	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) causes considerable losses in faba-bean (Vicia faba L.) production in the Mediterranean region. The application of an ultra-low glyphosate rate at an early broomrape parasitic phase, i.e., tubercle development, is the most common control system. This study sought to determine the effect of tillage system and glyphosate application on broomrape infestation, faba-bean yield, and yield components. A field experiment was performed over a 3-yr period in Cordoba (Spain) in a rainfed Vertisol. Experimental factors and respective treatments were: tillage system (no-tillage vs. conventional tillage) and glyphosate application (none vs. 0.113 kg a.i. ha(-1)). Year x tillage system x glyphosate interactions were apparent in the results. Averaging over 3-yr, no-tillage with glyphosate application reduced weed infestation (42 plants m(-2)) and increased faba-bean seed yield (1.73 Mg ha(-1)) in comparison with conventional tillage with glyphosate application (10 broomrape plants m-2, and 1.14 Mg ha(-1) of seed yield). When glyphosate was not applied, broomrape density varied from 80 to 45 plants m(-2) and faba-bean seed yield from 0.50 to 1.24 Mg ha(-1) for tillage and no-tillage systems, respectively. Within each tillage system, glyphosate application always reduced broomrape infestation and increased seed yield. Even in the absence of glyphosate application, seed yields were higher under no-tillage than under conventional tillage with herbicide application over 2 yr. Pod m(-2) was the yield component most affected by broomrape infestation. No-tillage is an important tool for broomrape control, but the addition of glyphosate application substantially enhances the degree of control.

J	Sederias, J; Colman, B				Sederias, Joana; Colman, Brian			Inhibition of Chara vulgaris oospore germination by sulfidic sediments	AQUATIC BOTANY												The germinability of Chara vulgaris oospores collected from the sediments of four Ontario lakes varies considerably, ranging in germination percentage from 7% to 54%. Chemical analysis of the interstitial water of the sediments indicated that oospores with low germination occurred in lakes which have high acid volatile sulfides (H2S, FeS, HS-) and high soluble Fe2+. The inhibitory effects of sediment on oospore germination were demonstrated by transplant experiments, and suggested that sulfide was the toxic agent. Exposure of high-germinating sedimentary oospores to free sulfide concentrations greater than 2.0 mM caused a greater than 30% reduction in oospore germination. The presence of sulfide in sediments was shown to result from sulfate reduction by bacteria in sediment pore water of those lakes where oospore viability was lowest. Differences in oospore germination percentage appear, therefore to, be due to the toxicity of H2S produced in the sediment, either by a direct effect on the oospore or on the, parent plants.

J	Ma, MJ; Du, GZ; Zhou, XH				Ma, Miaojun; Du, Guozhen; Zhou, Xianhui			Role of the Soil Seed Bank during Succession in a Subalpine Meadow on the Tibetan Plateau	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We studied the seed bank of abandoned Fields in four Successional stages (habitat A: I year; habitat B: 10 years; habitat C: 20 years; and habitat D: mature meadow) in eastern Tibetan Plateau. The seed density in seed banks decreased with successional age, but species richness and diversity increased, and the highest species diversity and species richness appeared in habitat C. Similarity between the seed bank and vegetation decreased gradually with succession in the whole. The vegetation is more similar to the seed bank in the shallow layer than to the seed bank in the deeper soil, which shows that the vegetation contributes less to the seed batik as soil depth increases. The seed bank was mainly composed of First Successional species during the whole successional range. Species of the later successional stages contributed little to the seed batik. Most of species from early successional stage produced longer-lived seeds, which stayed viable in the soil for a long period (more than 20 years). Hypotheses about changes in seed bank during Succession, predicting decreasing species richness and seed diversity, were not confirmed. The hypothesis that density of buried seeds declined during Succession was confirmed. We conclude that seed bank plays an important role on vegetation in the early Succession stage. In the later Succession stages, seed bank's role becomes weaker and weaker, and which likely relies on vegetative reproduction and dispersal.

Soil seed bank in and between vegetation patches in arid Patagonia, Argentina	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												This study was conducted at two sites, 1.5 km from I to another in and Argentina (39 degrees S, 69 degrees W). Vegetation is distributed in patches. Four microenvironments can be identified in the soil surface of these patches, and the bare interspaces among them. Hypotheses were that (1) at any time during the sampling periods. buried (viable + damaged) seeds of the most common vegetation in the patches, Larrea divaricata Cav., Atriplex lampa Gill ex Moquin, Stipa neaei Nees ex Steudel and Leymus erianthus (Phil.) Dubcovsky, are present in the soil seed bank at all four microenvironments within any vegetation patch and its associated interspace, and (2) natural plant recruitment from the soil seed bank occurs for L divaricata, A. lampa, S. neaei, L erianthus, Bromus tectorum L. and Poa lanuginosa Poiret ap. Lamarck in all study microenvironments. In undisturbed field areas, 32 soil samples were periodically taken using an auger in 1999. Viable and damaged seeds contained in the soil organic matter were counted for L. divaricata, A. lampa, S. neaei, and L. erianthus. In a further study, emergence and subsequent growth of L. divaricata, A. lampa, S. neaei, L erianthus, B. tectorum and P. lanuginosa from the soil seed bank were evaluated in the various microenvironments: permanent plots (0.04 m(2)) were placed on each of the two study sites using four vegetation patches and their associated interspaces per site. Results supported the first hypotheses only for L. divaricata and A. lampa. However, natural recruitment from the soil only included S. neaei and P lanuginosa through asexual, and B. tectorum through sexual reproduction. Despite the presence of buried seeds of L. divaricata and A. lampa in microenvironment 4 during most of the sampling period, bare interspaces among vegetation patches can be naturally vegetated through sexual reproduction by B. tectorum. during years of abundant, higher than long-term, annual precipitation.

Applications for characterisation of phytogenetic resources preserved ex situ	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												Electrophoresis has become one of the most usual tools for plant studies. However, most analyses, using isoenzymes, have been carried out from a population geneticist's point of view for the study of allelic frequencies. In present work, isoenzyme electrophoresis of bulked seeds was used as a rapid strategy for obtaining the electrophoretic profiles of accessions of a seed bank. The relationships amongst 30 taxa of the complex Diplotaxis-Erucastrum-Brassica (Brassicaceae family, tribe Brassicinae) were analysed, with the electrophoretic profiles of six isoenzyme systems. Each sample presented a stable and characteristic isoenzymatic pattern representative of the whole population. The enzyme markers provided 147 reliable bands which were scored as multistate traits (not with allelic value). UPGMA clustering method showed a dendrogram with three main groups and subgroups of samples that are in agreement with the recognised taxonomy of the taxa. This approach can be a rapid and efficient method to establish the specific enzyme patterns of conserved species populations of a germplasm bank, and the information could be included in the a database as part of documentation system.																	0925-9864	1573-5109				NOV	2009	56	7					1023	1036		10.1007/s10722-009-9423-5							WOS:000272119900013

Disturbance liberates sites for the random recruitment of new individuals. The addition of seeds modifies the structure of the communities. In order to verify these hypotheses concerning the vegetation of temporary pools, an experiment was carried out using 72 soil samples collected from a pool in Western Morocco and placed in containers. Three types of laboratory treatments were applied, each combined with control treatments: soil disturbance (control/disturbed), hydrology (flooded, saturated and dry) and seed addition (sowing/no sowing). The total biomass, the annual and perennial species richness were calculated for each sample to test the effects of disturbance, hydrology and seed addition on the biomass and species richness of the various plant communities. The results show that disturbance reduces the total biomass, especially of perennials, but without significantly increasing the richness of annuals. Seed addition does not affect the total biomass and reduces total richness only in saturated soil, where biomass production is high. The most extreme stress conditions (drought and flooding) limit the abundance of species and therefore competition.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2009	634	1					77	86		10.1007/s10750-009-9894-6							WOS:000269190100006

Reproductive and recruitment traits as indicators of the invasive potential of Kalanchoe daigremontiana (Crassulaceae) and Stapelia gigantea (Apocynaceae) in a Neotropical arid zone	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Populations of two ornamental exotic species, Kalanchoe daigremontiana and Stapelia gigantea, have been recently detected inside a protected area containing arid ecosystems in Venezuela. We indirectly tested their invasive potential by characterizing their reproductive biology and recruitment patterns and comparing our estimates against Baker's Law and reproductive profiles reported for invasive plants. K. daigremontiana is autogamous, produces > 16,000 seeds per plant and also reproduces clonally. Despite low seed viability (17.9%) arid germination rates (11.9%), seeds were present in the seed bank. Plantlets of asexual origin showed high survival (75-100%) compared to seedlings of sexual origin (10%). S. gigantea is self-incompatible, xenogamous and produces close to 1500 seeds per m(2) of plant tissue. Seed viability (77%) and germination rates (62%) were high, but this species is not represented in the seed bank. It has a vegetative growth. A combination of reproductive and recruitment attributes, which match those considered in Baker's Law and others reported for invasive plants, confer K. daigremontiana and S. gigantea the potential to invade Neotropical arid zones; the former mainly through selfing and production of numerous asexual plantlets, and the latter through an association with a locally abundant pollinator and production of wind dispersed seeds.

Geographic variation in dynamics of an annual plant with a seed bank	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P>1. Most population dynamics studies are geographically restricted, yet species ranges are large. We performed multiyear roadside surveys of the sunflower, Helianthus annuus, at two locations that differ in precipitation (eastern Kansas, KS; western Nebraska, NE). Our goals were to (i) document if there was geographic variation in dynamics and evaluate the role of habitat variables and the landscape matrix; (ii) determine the likely amount of occupiable habitat and (iii) explore the role of seed banks in dynamics. 2. Geographical variation: Occupancy and mean numbers of plants per occupied roadside unit were generally higher in NE than KS. Sunflower abundance was linearly related to spring precipitation in NE but not in KS. Soil disturbance was associated with increased occupancy and apparent colonization, and reduced apparent extinction. Variation in the landscape adjacent to roads had a larger effect on occupancy in KS than in NE. In KS, smaller populations were more prone to apparent extinction; NE results were more variable. Note that we refer to 'apparent' colonization or extinction because seed banks may persist even when above-ground plants are absent. 3. Occupiable habitat: 25% of the roadside was never occupied by sunflowers in KS, despite surveying for 6 years. An asymptotic limit to occupancy in NE was not apparent, but fewer years were surveyed. 4. Seed banks: Seed banks appear prevalent. The strongest evidence comes from a year following a spring drought in NE, when 100s to 1000s of plants were found in units that lacked plants the year before. 5. Synthesis. We found both geographical similarities (role of soil disturbance, seed banks) and differences (response to rainfall variation, importance of landscape matrix) in sunflower dynamics. Our work suggests that for appropriate species (including many weedy and invasive plants), replicate roadside surveys are an efficient way to evaluate geographic variation in dynamics, the landscape matrix and habitat characteristics across a broad geographic area. Such data help bridge the gap between broad-scale distributional studies and small experimental plot studies, and provide insights on the population dynamics that underlie species ranges.																	0022-0477					NOV	2009	97	6					1390	1400		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01581.x							WOS:000270787100030						
J	Taylor, K				Taylor, Kenneth			Biological Flora of the British Isles: Urtica dioica L.	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P> This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Urtica dioica that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Urtica dioica is a tall, usually dioecious, rhizomatous, perennial herb with numerous stinging hairs, probably native in fens and semi-natural ancient woodlands, but widely naturalized in a range of habitats and abundant throughout the British Isles. British material is mainly ssp. dioica which also extends throughout Europe, and locally ssp. galeopsifolia (without stinging hairs) which is also found in western, central and eastern Europe. Urtica dioica is a moderately shade-tolerant species, which occurs on most moist or damp, weakly acid or weakly basic, richly fertile soils. A highly competitive ruderal species, Urtica dioica often forms monospecific stands which are not infrequently the product of a single individual that has spread by means of horizontal rhizomes. Urtica dioica has frequently been described as a nitrophile, but there are many soils in which the supply of inorganic nitrogen is adequate for growth. However, there are other soils in which growth is checked with symptoms of severe phosphorus deficiency unless soluble phosphate is added to the soil. This is especially so in the long-established deciduous woodlands, and where there has been no addition of fertilizers to the soil. The growth responses of U. dioica to the availability, source and utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus have been examined experimentally in some detail. Urtica dioica with its stems and leaves densely covered with stinging hairs, which release potential pain-inducing toxins when brushing contact is made with them, is rarely eaten by cattle and rabbits, but is palatable to some species of snail. It is the food plant of the larvae of a number of attractive butterflies and other phytophagous insects. Male clones of U. dioica flower in advance of female clones. The pollen grains are extremely small. It is usually wind-pollinated, but occasionally insect-pollinated. The low seed mass of U. dioica enables the production of vast numbers of seeds. Few of the seeds germinate in the period immediately following dispersal, and the species maintains a seed bank that changes little in size with season and is large in relation to annual seed production.																	0022-0477					NOV	2009	97	6					1436	1458		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01575.x							WOS:000270787100035

Effects of Nutrient Manipulations and Grass Removal on Cover, Species Composition, and Invasibility of a Novel Grassland in Colorado	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Cover and richness of a 5-year revegetation effort were studied with ,respect to small-scale disturbance and nutrient manipulations. The site, originally a relict tallgrass prairie mined for gravel, was replanted to native grasses using a seed mixture of tall-, mixed-, and short-grass species. Following one wet and three relatively dry years, a community emerged, dominated by species common in saline soils not found along the Colorado Front Range. A single species, Alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), composed nearly 50% of relative vegetation cover in control plots exhibiting a negative relationship between cover and richness. Seeded species composed approximately 92% of vegetation cover. The remaining 8% was composed of weeds from nearby areas, seed bank survivors, or mix contaminants. Three years of soil nutrient amendments, which lowered plant-available nitrogen and phosphorus, significantly increased relative cover of seeded species to 97.5%. Fertilizer additions of phosphate enhanced abundance of introduced annual grasses (Bromus spp.) but did not significantly alter cover in control plots. Unmanipulated 4-m2 plots contained an average of 4.7 planted species and 3.9 nonplanted species during the 5-year period, whereas plots that received grass herbicide averaged 5.4 nonplanted species. Species richness ranged from an average 6.9 species in low-nutrient, undisturbed plots to 10.9 species in the relatively high-nutrient, disturbed plots. The use of stockpiled soils, applied sparingly, in conjunction with a native seed mix containing species uncommon to the preexisting community generated a species-depauperate, novel plant community that appears resistant to invasion by ruderal species.

Sawdust Addition Reduces the Productivity of Nitrogen-Enriched Mountain Grasslands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of mountain grasslands has boosted grasses and fast-growing unpalatable plants at the expense of slow-growing species, resulting in a significant loss in biodiversity. A potential tool to reduce nutrient availability and aboveground productivity without destroying the perennial vegetation is carbon (C) addition. However, little is known about its suitability under severe climatic conditions. Here, we report the results of a 3-year field study assessing the effects of sawdust addition on soil nutrients, aboveground productivity, and vegetational composition of 10 grazed and ungrazed mountain grasslands. Of particular interest was the effect of C addition on grasses and on the tall unpalatable weed Veratrum album. After 3 years, soil pH, ammonium, and plant-available phosphorus were not altered by sawdust application, and nitrate concentrations were marginally higher in treatment plots. However, the biomass of grasses and forbs (without V. album) was 20-25% lower in sawdust-amended plots, whereas the biomass of V. album was marginally higher. Sawdust addition reduced the cover of grasses but did not affect evenness, vegetation diversity, or plant species richness, although species richness generally increased with decreasing biomass at our sites. Our results suggest that sawdust addition is a potent tool to reduce within a relatively short time the aboveground productivity and grass cover in both grazed and ungrazed mountain grasslands as long as they are not dominated by tall unpalatable weeds. The technique has the advantage that it preserves the topsoil and the perennial soil seed bank.

Botanic gardens and the conservation of tree species	TRENDS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The general role of botanic gardens in plant conservation has been widely accepted since the 1970 s and many threatened plant species are now in well-documented living collections and seed banks. Conserving tree species in ex situ collections still presents particular challenges. Many trees have so-called 'recalcitrant' seeds that cannot be stored in conventional seed banks and the sheer size of living trees restricts the number of individuals of a particular species that can be grown in a botanic garden. Even if space is available, is ex situ conservation a desirable option and how does this compare with conserving tree species in their natural habitats? In reality, conservation action for globally threatened tree species, by either in situ or ex situ means, remains inadequate and steps should be taken to combine approaches to prevent the urgent loss of tree species worldwide.																	1360-1385					NOV	2009	14	11					581	583		10.1016/j.tplants.2009.08.013							WOS:000272501700003	19781976

The science and economics of ex situ plant conservation	TRENDS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Ex situ seed storage underpins global agriculture and food supplies and enables the conservation of thousands of wild species of plants within national and international facilities. As an insurance policy against extinction, ex situ seed conservation is estimated to cost as little as 1% of in situ conservation. The assumptions, costs, risks and scientific challenges associated with ex situ plant conservation depend on the species, the methods employed and the desired storage time. Recent, relatively widespread evidence of less than expected longevity at conventional seed bank temperatures, innovations in the cryopreservation of recalcitrant-seeded species and economic comparators provide compelling evidence that ultra-cold storage should be adopted for the long-term conservation of plants. Policy instruments, such as the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (2011-2020), should respond to the evidence base and promote the implementation of cryopreservation for both tropical and temperate plants.

Soybean Canopy and Tillage Effects on Emergence of Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) from a Natural Seed Bank	WEED SCIENCE												Field experiments were conducted in 2004, 2005, and 2006, at Pendleton, SC, to determine the effects of soybean canopy and tillage on Palmer amaranth emergence from sites with a uniform Population of Palmer amaranth. In 2006, the effect of soybean canopy was evaluated only in no-tillage plots. Palmer amaranth emerged from May 10 through October 23, May 13 through September 2, and April 28 through August 25 in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. Two to three consistent emergence periods occurred from early May through mid-July. Shallow (10-cm depth) spring tillage had minimal influence on the cumulative emergence of Palmer amaranth. Increase in light interception following soybean canopy formation was evident by early July, resulting in reduced Palmer amaranth emergence, especially in no-tillage conditions. In no-tillage plots, from 32 or 33 d after soybean emergence through senescence, Palmer amaranth emergence was reduced by 73 to 76% in plots with soybean compared with plots without soybean. Emergence of Palmer amaranth was favored by high-thermal soil amplitudes (10 to 16 C) in the absence of soybean. Of the total emergence during a season, >90% occurred before soybean canopy closure. The seedling recruitment pattern of Palmer amaranth from this research suggests that, although Palmer amaranth exhibits an extended emergence period, cohorts during the peak emergence periods from early May to mid-July need greater attention in weed management.

The seed banks were from four typical 22-year-old plantations. i.e., legume, mixed-conifer, mixed-native, and Eucalyptus overstory species. Species diversity in the seed banks was low, and the vegetation species differed from those found in the seed bank in each plantation. A total of 1211 seedlings belonging to eight species emerged in a seedling germination assay, among which Cyrtococcum patens was most abundant. All species detected were shrubs and herbs, and no viable indigenous tree seeds were found in soil samples. Size and species composition of the seed banks might be related to the overstory species compositions of the established plantations. The seed bank density in soils was highest in the mixed-conifer plantation followed by Eucalyptus, mixed-native, and legume plantations. Species richness among the seed banks of plantations was ranked as follows Eucalyptus > mixed-conifer > mixed-native = legume. The results indicated that the soil seed banks of the current plantations are ineffective in regenerating the former communities after human disturbances. Particularly, the absence of indigenous tree species seeds in the seed banks would limit regeneration and probably contribute to arrested succession at the pioneer community stage. It would appear from these data that the soil seed banks under the current plantations should not be considered as a useful tool leading the succession to more natural stages. Introduction of target indigenous species by artificial seeding or seedling planting should be considered to accelerate forest regeneration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dolle, M; Schmidt, W				Doelle, Michaela; Schmidt, Wolfgang			The relationship between soil seed bank, above-ground vegetation and disturbance intensity on old-field successional permanent plots	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions How does disturbance and successional age influence richness, size and composition of the soil seed bank? What is the potential contribution of the soil seed bank to the plant community composition on sites differing in their successional age or disturbance intensity? Location Experimental Botanical Garden of Gottingen University, central Germany. Methods Above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank were studied on formerly arable fields in a 36-year-old permanent plot study with five disturbance intensities, ranging from yearly ploughing via mowing to long-term uninterrupted succession. We compared species compositions, seed densities and functional features of the seed bank and above-ground vegetation by using several methods in parallel. Results The seed bank was mainly composed of early successional species typical of strongly disturbed habitats. The difference between seed bank composition and above-ground vegetation decreased with increasing disturbance intensity. The species of greatest quantitative importance in the seed bank was the non-native forb Solidago canadensis. Conclusions The ability of a plant community to regenerate from the soil seed bank dramatically decreases with increasing time since abandonment (successional age) and with decreasing disturbance intensity. The present study underlines that plant species typical of grasslands and woodlands are limited by dispersal capacity, owing to low capacity for accumulation of seeds in the soil and the fact that most species do not build up persistent seed banks. Rare and target species were almost absent from the seed bank and will, after local elimination, depend on reintroduction for continuation of their presence.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				OCT	2009	12	4					415	428									WOS:000269455100003						
J	Prober, S; Taylor, S; Edwards, R; Mills, B				Prober, Suzanne; Taylor, Susan; Edwards, Robyn; Mills, Brett			Effectiveness of repeated autumn and spring fires for understorey restoration in weed-invaded temperate eucalypt woodlands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Can strategic burning, targeting differing ecological characteristics of native and exotic species, facilitate restoration of native understorey in weed-invaded temperate grassy eucalypt woodlands? Location Gippsland Plains, eastern Victoria, Australia. Methods In a replicated, 5-year experimental trial, the effects of repeated spring or autumn burning were evaluated for native and exotic plants in a representative, degraded Eucalyptus tereticornis grassy woodland. Treatments aimed to reduce seed banks and modify establishment conditions of exotic annual grasses, and to exhaust vegetative reserves of exotic perennial grasses. Treatments were applied to three grassland patch types, dominated by the native grass Austrodanthonia caespitosa, ubiquitous exotic annuals, or the common exotic perennial grass Paspalum dilatatum. Results The dominant native grass Austrodanthonia caespitosa and native forbs were resilient to repeated fires, and target exotic annuals and perennials were suppressed differentially by autumn and spring fires. Exotic annuals were also suppressed by drought, reducing the overall treatment effects but indicating important opportunities for restoration. The initially sparse exotic geophyte Romulea rosea increased in cover with fire and the impact of this species on native forbs requires further investigation. There was minimal increase in diversity of subsidiary natives with fire, probably owing to lack of propagules. Conclusions While fire is often considered to increase ecosystem invasibility, our study showed that strategic use of fire, informed by the relative responses of available native and exotic taxa, is potentially an effective step towards restoration of weed-invaded temperate eucalypt woodlands.

Canopy Seed Banks as Time Capsules of Biodiversity in Pasture-Remnant Tree Crowns	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Tropical pastures present multiple barriers to tree regeneration and restoration. Relict trees serve as "regeneration foci" because they ameliorate the soil microclimate and serve as safe spots for dispersers. Here, we describe another mechanism by which remnant trees may facilitate pasture regeneration: the presence of seed banks in the canopy soil that accumulates from decomposing epiphytes within the crowns of mature remnant trees in tropical cloud forest pastures. We compared seed banks of canopy soils (histosols derived from fallen leaves, fruits, flower, and twigs of host trees and epiphytes, dead bryophytes, bark, detritus, dead animals, and microorganisms, and dust that accumulate on trunks and the upper surfaces of large branches) in pastures, canopy soils in primary forest trees, and soil on the forest floor in Monteverde, Costa Rica. There were 5211 epiphytic and terrestrial plant seeds in the three habitats. All habitats were dominated by seeds in a relatively small number of plant families, most of which were primarily woody, animal pollinated, and animal dispersed. The density of seeds on the forest floor was greater than seed density in either pasture-canopy or forest-canopy soils; the latter two did not differ. Eight species in 44 families and 61 genera from all of the habitats were tallied. There were 37 species in the pasture-canopy soil, 33 in the forest-canopy soil, and 57 on the forest floor. Eleven species were common to all habitats. The mean species richness in the pasture canopy was significantly higher than the forest canopy (F = 83.38; p < 0.02). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed that the communities were distinct. Greenhouse experiments verified that many of these seeds were viable, with 29 taxa germinating (23 taxa in pruned mats [mimic of exposed conditions] and 16 taxa in control mats [intact conditions]) within 2 months of observation. Nearly half the species that germinated were characteristic of primary forests (primary forest samples, 19%; pasture samples, 29%). This supports the idea that canopy seed banks of pasture trees can function as time capsules by providing propagules that are removed in both space and time from the primary forest. Their presence may enhance the ability of pastures to regenerate more quickly, reinforcing the importance of trees in agricultural settings.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				OCT	2009	23	5					1117	1126		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01235.x							WOS:000269802200014	19438870

Here, we propose that the control of sediment erosion and deposition by riparian vegetation is a key geomorphological and ecological (i.e. biogeomorphic) function within fluvial corridors. In a 3 year study, we investigated the correlations between riparian vegetation and hydrogeomorphic dynamics along a transverse gradient from the main channel to the floodplain of the River Tech, France. Sediment erosion and deposition rates varied significantly along the transverse gradient as a function of the vegetation biovolume intercepting water flow. These effects, combined with the extremely strong mechanical resistance of pioneer woody structures and strong resilience of pioneer labile herbaceous communities, Populus nigra and Salix spp., explain the propensity of biogeomorphic succession (i.e. the synergy between vegetation succession and landform construction) to progress between destructive floods. This geomorphological function newly identified as an 'ecosystem function' per se encompasses the coupling of habitat and landform creation, maintenance and change with fundamental ecosystem structural changes in space and in time. Three different biogeomorphic functions, all related to the concept of ecosystem engineering, were identified: (i) the function of pioneer herbaceous communities to retain fine sediment and diaspores in the exposed zones of the active tract near the water resource, facilitating recruitment of further herbaceous and Salicacea species; (ii) the function of woody vegetation to drive the construction of forested islands and floodplains; and (iii) the function of stabilised riparian forests to act as 'diversity reservoirs' which can support regeneration after destructive floods. Overall, this study based on empirical data points to the fundamental importance of sediment flow control by pioneer riparian vegetation in defining fluvial ecosystem and landform organisation in time and in space.

Climate change and bet-hedging: interactions between increased soil temperatures and seed bank persistence	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												In order to predict the long-term consequences of climate change, it is necessary to link future environmental changes to mechanisms that control plant population processes. This information can then be incorporated into strategies to more accurately model climate change impacts on species or to estimate future extinction risks. We examined the impact of increased temperatures on the longevity and dynamics of the persistent soil seed banks of eight ephemeral species from arid Australia. We found that the predicted global temperature increases under climate change will be reflected in increased soil temperatures, and that seeds in the soil seed bank will be exposed to long durations of high temperatures over the summer months. Three of the eight species studied had significantly greater levels of germination after exposure to predicted increased soil temperatures. Another species displayed a dramatic decrease in seed viability after such exposure. The capacity of such species to use the seed bank to bet hedge against rainfall events that cause germination but are insufficient to allow plant maturation, is compromised by increased germinability and subsequent loss or reduction of seed bank persistence. These predicted changes in the dynamics of soil seed banks increase the risk of local extinctions of these species, while the composition of the community may be altered by changes in species abundance. Our results show that the risk spreading mechanism provided by persistent seed banks could be compromised by the mechanistic impact of forecast temperature increases in arid habitats, and highlight the need to understand mechanisms that control population dynamics when attempting to address likely future impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

Seed banks in a degraded desert shrubland: Influence of soil surface condition and harvester ant activity on seed abundance	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We compared seed banks between two contrasting anthropogenic surface disturbances (compacted, trenched) and adjacent undisturbed controls to determine whether site condition influences viable seed densities of perennial and annual Mojave Desert species. Viable seeds of perennials were rare in undisturbed areas (3-4 seeds/m(2)) and declined to <1 seed/m(2) within disturbed sites. Annual seed densities were an order of magnitude greater than those of perennials, were one-third the undisturbed seed densities on compacted sites, but doubled on trenched sites relative to controls. On trenched sites, greater litter cover comprising the infructescences of the dominant spring annuals, and low gravel content, enhanced seed densities of both annuals and perennials. Litter cover and surface ruggedness were the best explanations for viable perennial seed densities on compacted sites, but litter cover and the presence of a common harvester ant explained annual seed densities better than any other surface characteristics that were examined. Surface disturbances can have a varied impact on the condition of the soil surface in and lands. Nevertheless, the consistently positive relationship between ground cover of litter and viable seed density emphasizes the importance of litter as an indicator of site degradation and recovery potential in arid lands.

In laboratory-produced cysts, the dormancy period was estimated to be less than 2 weeks. A vernalization period was not required prior to germination. However, after 1 month of dark-storage at 6 degrees C, excystment was obtained 2-3 days from re-exposure to favourable conditions thereby suggesting that germination was sychronized. Germination patterns and germling cell viability in laboratory-produced cysts were similar to those exhibited in natural cysts. The following conditions optimized germination: temperature between 14 and 26 degrees C, salinity between 30 and 38 psu and light exposure for >1 h at 100 mu moles photons m(-2)s(-1). Similar conditions prevailed at the commencement of and during Alexandrium blooms in Thau lagoon, suggesting that cysts may germinate shortly after being recruited from sediment re-suspensions. Accordingly, cyst bank germinations contribute to the initial seeding of blooms, and subsequently germinations of newly formed cysts can help to maintain blooms.In cyst banks, the high germination capabilities seem, however, to be counter-balanced by the low viability of cyst progeny, as estimated from the realized seeding ratio. This ratio is proposed as a means of quantifying the potential for cyst banks to regenerate planktonic populations.

J	Rajaniemi, TK; Turkington, R; Goldberg, D				Rajaniemi, Tara K.; Turkington, Roy; Goldberg, Deborah			Community-level consequences of species interactions in an annual plant community	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How does the intensity of species interactions affect species and functional group composition of an annual plant community? Location: Sede Boqer, Negev Desert, Israel. Methods: The potential for competitive interactions in two annual plant communities (desert and coastal) from semi-stabilized sand dunes was manipulated by varying seed bank density and therefore the number of potentially interacting individuals. Communities were exposed to three different irrigation regimes, mimicking precipitation at the desert site, the coastal site, and an intermediate precipitation level. Plots were maintained for 3 years, and percentage cover of each species in the plots was recorded at the end of each growing season. We used redundancy analysis to test for effects of initial density, irrigation, and year on the species and functional group composition of the communities. Results: Initial density had significant effects on species composition, and these effects remained significant over 3 years, even as total community percentage cover became more similar among treatments over time. Density effects did not depend on resource availability (irrigation level). Functional group identity or individual plant size did not predict which species would be good competitors, and a species' competitive ability did not predict its abundance in the field. Conclusions: Species interactions strongly affect community composition, and those effects carry over into subsequent years such that competition does not lead to convergence in community structure over time. However, the particular changes in composition observed were not predictable by some of the traits that have been found important in individual-level experiments. We speculate that the outcome of competition in diverse communities will depend on multiple traits, in contrast to the outcome of individual-level pairwise experiments. We also speculate that the shift in composition with density could mean that local variation in density may contribute to maintenance of diversity in this system.

Interactions between these major factors were studied together in a semiarid sand dune grassland. Location: Eastern Inner Mongolia, China. Methods: The Study system used four sites of fixed, semifixed, semishifting and shifting sand dune grasslands, representing a gradient of habitat degradation. We investigated the density of germinable seeds deposited in the top 5 cm of soil and in situ seedling emergence (number of seedlings emerging early in the growing season) and establishment (number of plants recruited at the end of the growing season) at three topographic positions (dune top, windward and leeward sides) within each site over 2 years that differed in rainfall. Habitat characteristics (i.e. vegetation cover, plant species composition and diversity, soil moisture and nutrient availability and soil erodibility) of the four sites were also measured. Results: Habitat degradation (i.e. decreased vegetation cover and enhanced wind erosion rate) significantly reduced the size of the germinable soil seed bank. On average, germinable seed number from the high-vegetation cover fixed dune was 36-fold larger than the low-vegetation cover shifting dune, and eight- and two-fold larger, respectively, than the semishifting and semifixed dunes with intermediate vegetation cover. We observed within-habitat variability in seed distribution, but among-topographic position variation differed among habitats. Seedling recruitment showed large between-year, and among- and within-habitat variability, but these variations varied significantly depending on the response variables evaluated (i.e. initial seedling density, final plant density, emergence rate and recruitment rate). Path analysis revealed complex density-dependent positive and negative, direct and indirect effects of germinable seed density and initial seedling density on recruitment, but the relative importance of these density-dependent effects varied depending on habitat type and rainfall availability. Conclusion: Our results suggest that habitat degradation, microtopography and rainfall availability interact in shaping sand dune seed bank and plant community recruitment patterns and dynamics. Their effects were mainly mediated through changes in both the biotic and abiotic environment during the process of habitat deterioration.

J	Maren, IE; Vandvik, V				Maren, Inger E.; Vandvik, Vigdis			Fire and regeneration: the role of seed banks in the dynamics of northern heathlands	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: How do species composition and abundance of soil seed bank and standing vegetation vary over the course of a post-fire succession in northern heathlands? What is the role of seed banks-do they act as a refuge for early successional species or call they simply be seen as a spillover from the extant local vegetation? Location: Coastal Calluna heathlands, Western Norway. Methods: We analysed vegetation and seed bank along a 24-year post-fire chronosequence. Patterns ill community composition, similarity and abundances were tested using multivariate analyses, Sorensen's index of similarity, vegetation cover and seedling counts. Results: The total diversity of vegetation and seed bank were 60 and 54 vascular plant taxa, respectively, with 39 shared species, resulting in 68% similarity overall. Over 24 years, the heathland community progressed from open newly burned ground via species rich graminoid- and herb-dominated vegetation to mature Calluna heath. Post-fire Succession was not reflected in the seed bank. The 10 most abundant species constituted 98% of the germinated seeds. The most abundant were Calluna vulgaris (49%; 12018 seeds m(-2)) and Erica tetralix (34%; 8414 seeds m(-2)). Calluna showed significantly higher germination the first 2 years following fire. Conclusions: Vegetation species richness, ranging from 23 to 46 species yr(-1), showed a unimodal pattern over the post-fire succession. In contrast, the seed bank species richness, ranging from 21 to 31 species yr(-1) showed no trend. This suggests that the seed bank act as a refuge; providing a constant source of recruits for species that colonise newly burned areas. The traditional management regime has not depleted or destroyed the seed banks and continued management is needed to ensure sustainability of northern heathlands.

J	Tsuyuzaki, S				Tsuyuzaki, Shiro			Causes of plant community divergence in the early stages of volcanic succession	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How do temporal changes in plant communities occur after volcanic eruptions? What characteristics determine successional divergence or convergence? Location: The summit area Of Mount Usu, northern Japan, completely destroyed by 1-3 m of thick ash and Pumice during the 1977-1978 eruptions. Habitats were classified into three types: gullies where the pre-eruption topsoil was exposed due to the erosion of tephra (EG), gullies covered with tephra (CG), and Outside of gullies covered with thick tephra (OG). Methods: Plant community structure was monitored for 15 years from 1983 to 1997 in 14 2m x 5m permanent plots. The data were Summarized by species diversity, life form, and the detrended correspondence analysis. Results: The common species were perennial herbaceous plants, but habitat preferences differed between species. Seed bank species, including a nitrogen fixer Trifolium repens, were dominant in EG, and excluded the establishment of the later colonists. Pioneer trees slowly increased in cover. The detrended correspondence analysis indicated that species composition in the earlier stages did not differ greatly between plots. Thereafter, three patterns of temporal community changes Were observed: seed bank species persisted in EG, and in OG and CG forest development proceeded or community structure did not change greatly. Conclusion: Pre-eruption topsoil contributed to revegetation by the supply of seed bank and nutrients in the earliest stages, but resulted in the delay of forest development due to the persistence of seed bank species. Plant community divergence was driven by the persistence of earlier colonists.

J	Azeez, JO				Azeez, J. O.			Effects of Nitrogen Application and Weed Interference on Performance of Some Tropical Maize Genotypes in Nigeria	PEDOSPHERE												Low soil nitrogen (N) and weed infestations are some of the major constraints to maize production in Nigeria. A split-split plot experiment in a randomized complete block design with three replicates was established at two sites with different agroecological zones, Ikenne (Typic Paleudalf) and Shika (Typic Tropaquept), in Nigeria in 2002 and 2003 rainy seasons to investigate the responses of four maize genotypes (Oba super II, Low N pool C2, TZB-SR, and ACR 8328 BN C7) to N fertilizer applied at four rates, 0, 30, 60, and 90 kg N ha(-1), and three weed pressure treatments, no weed pressure (weekly weeding), low weed pressure (inter-row weekly weeding), and high weed pressure (no weeding throughout the growing season). Growth and yield parameters of maize and weeds were taken at flowering and harvest. The results indicated that there was a significant reduction in maize leaf area, leaf area index, and photosynthetically active radiation due to weed interference at both sites. The application of nitrogen at 90 kg N ha(-1) significantly increased maize leaf area. Reductions in maize growth and yield at flowering and harvest were significant due to weed interference at both Ikenne and Shika, thus showing that the reductions in maize growth and yield due to weed interference were not ecological zone specific even though weed species and their seed banks may differ. Ameliorative management options could thus be the same in the two agroecological zones. Application of 90 kg N ha(-1) led to a significant increase in maize grain yield at Shika while there was no fertilizer effect at Ikenne on grain yield. There was no significant difference between 60 and 90 kg N ha(-1), suggesting that 60 kg N ha(-1) could be a possible replacement for the higher fertilizer rate at least for the identified maize genotypes. Low weed pressure treatment led to 26% and 35% reductions in maize grain yield at Ikenne and Shika, respectively, while 22% and 51% reductions, respectively, were observed due to high weed pressure. Generally, maize grain yield was higher at Ikenne than Shika. The maize genotypes Low N pool C2 and ACR 8328 BN C7 performed better than the other genotypes at Ikenne while the maize genotype Oba super II had the best performance at harvest at Shika. Application of nitrogen increased weed biomass at flowering at Ikenne. The maize grain yield was highest in the N-efficient genotypes, Oba super II and Low N pool C2; the susceptible genotype TZB-SR had the least yield at Shika. There existed a negative and significant correlation between maize grain yield and weed biomass at both sites.

J	White, E; Vivian-Smith, G; Barnes, A				White, Eve; Vivian-Smith, Gabrielle; Barnes, Anna			Variation in exotic and native seed arrival and recruitment of bird dispersed species in subtropical forest restoration and regrowth	PLANT ECOLOGY												Invasive bird-dispersed plants often share the same suite of dispersers as co-occurring native species, resulting in a complex management issue. Integrated management strategies could incorporate manipulation of dispersal or establishment processes. To improve our understanding of these processes, we quantified seed rain, recruit and seed bank density, and species richness for bird-dispersed invasive and native species in three early successional subtropical habitats in eastern Australia: tree regrowth, shrub regrowth and native restoration plantings. We investigated the effects of environmental factors (leaf area index (LAI), distance to edge, herbaceous ground cover and distance to nearest neighbour) on seed rain, seed bank and recruit abundance. Propagule availability was not always a good predictor of recruitment. For instance, although native tree seed rain density was similar, and species richness was higher, in native plantings, compared with tree regrowth, recruit density and species richness were lower. Native plantings also received lower densities of invasive tree seed rain than did tree regrowth habitats, but supported a similar density of invasive tree recruits. Invasive shrub seed rain was recorded in highest densities in shrub regrowth sites, but recruit density was similar between habitats. We discuss the role of microsite characteristics in influencing post-dispersal processes and recruit composition, and suggest ways of manipulating these processes as part of an integrated management strategy for bird-dispersed weeds in natural areas.																	1385-0237					OCT	2009	204	2					231	246		10.1007/s11258-009-9587-2							WOS:000269209400007

Seeds of P. serotina were collected following anthesis in the first week of July and thereafter at fortnightly intervals. Seed dormancy, temperature requirements for germination and the soil seed bank were investigated. At maturation (about 105 days after anthesis), seed moisture content had decreased to around 13.7%, and 44% of the seeds had attained the capacity to germinate. Mature seeds of P. serotina exhibited physiological dormancy, germinating only after a long cold, moist stratification period. Highest germination percentage occurred in seeds treated with gibberellic acid (GA(3)), at 10A degrees C. We found no evidence that P. serotina forms a persistent seed bank but noticed a persistent seedling bank in the field.

Mutual influence of forests and pastures on the seedbanks in the Eastern Amazon	WEED RESEARCH												The objective of this study was to compare the floristic composition and species diversity existing in the seed-banks of forests and pastures. The seedbanks were sampled in three forest and three pastures areas in a community of smallholder farmers, in Para state, Brazil. Seedling emergence in a glasshouse was used to quantify and identify the seeds. The total densities and diversity of the seedbanks were not significantly different among the pastures and forests, but the floristic composition was different. The herbaceous species predominated in both the pastures and the forests, but in the forest the abundance of shrub and tree was higher than herb. The seed density of several pioneer woody species was higher in the forests and the density of several herbaceous species was greater in the pastures. The influence of the forest species on the pastures and of the pastures species on the forests is a result of the initial process of human occupation and illustrates a dynamic that can lead to both the conservation of forest species and the spread of weed species. Actions should be carried out to avoid disturbance in the forests and improve biodiversity preservation in rural areas.

Demographic and Genetic Patterns of Variation among Populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from Contrasting Native Environments	PLOS ONE												Background: Understanding the relationship between environment and genetics requires the integration of knowledge on the demographic behavior of natural populations. However, the demographic performance and genetic composition of Arabidopsis thaliana populations in the species' native environments remain largely uncharacterized. This information, in combination with the advances on the study of gene function, will improve our understanding on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution in A. thaliana. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report the extent of environmental, demographic, and genetic variation among 10 A. thaliana populations from Mediterranean (coastal) and Pyrenean (montane) native environments in northeast Spain. Geographic, climatic, landscape, and soil data were compared. Demographic traits, including the dynamics of the soil seed bank and the attributes of aboveground individuals followed over a complete season, were also analyzed. Genetic data based on genome-wide SNP markers were used to describe genetic diversity, differentiation, and structure. Coastal and montane populations significantly differed in terms of environmental, demographic, and genetic characteristics. Montane populations, at higher altitude and farther from the sea, are exposed to colder winters and prolonged spring moisture compared to coastal populations. Montane populations showed stronger secondary seed dormancy, higher seedling/juvenile mortality in winter, and initiated flowering later than coastal populations. Montane and coastal regions were genetically differentiated, montane populations bearing lower genetic diversity than coastal ones. No significant isolation-by-distance pattern and no shared multilocus genotypes among populations were detected. Conclusions/Significance: Between-region variation in climatic patterns can account for differences in demographic traits, such as secondary seed dormancy, plant mortality, and recruitment, between coastal and montane A. thaliana populations. In addition, differences in plant mortality can partly account for differences in the genetic composition of coastal and montane populations. This study shows how the interplay between variation in environmental, demographic, and genetic parameters may operate in natural A. thaliana populations.

J	Gazol, A; Ibanez, R				Gazol, Antonio; Ibanez, Ricardo			Different response to environmental factors and spatial variables of two attributes (cover and diversity) of the understorey layers	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We investigated the relationships among the vertical layers of a temperate forest and the power of environmental and spatial factors to explain the variation in two attributes of shrub and herbaceous layers: cover and diversity. In the study site, 102 square plots with sides of 20 m were established in a stratified random design. Among the environmental factors we studied overstorey related factors, soil attributes and topographic related variables. To use the space as an explanatory variable, we applied the Principal Coordinates of Neighbourhood Matrices method. Variation partitioning with regression analyses was used to discover which variables better explained variation in cover and diversity within the shrub and herbaceous layers. The spatial patterns displayed by cover and diversity in the shrub and herbaceous layer were more similar between both layers than within the same layer. Along the same lines, the amount of variance explained by all the environmental (overstorey, soil and topography) and spatial variables together was higher in the models of cover than in those of diversity. The differences in the explained variation were primarily due to the higher spatial fraction in the models of cover. In general, shrub and herbaceous cover was higher on southern slopes with a more diverse overstorey, high values of soil temperature and low values of litter cover. Otherwise, higher values of shrub and herbaceous diversity were found on steep slopes with low values of leaf litter cover. However, while higher values of shrub diversity were found on southern slopes, herbaceous values were more patchily distributed. The differences in the amount of variation explained by the spatial variables in both attributes (cover and diversity) indicate their different spatial arrangement at the scale which we considered. While values of cover were more continuous in space, those of diversity showed a patchy distribution of higher values. The presence of this spatial component could be interpreted as the importance of seed dispersal or unmeasured environmental variables. The results indicate that the lack of management in temperate forests allows species movement in a heterogeneous environment favouring higher values of cover and diversity in the understory layers.

Yield losses of soybean and maize by competition with interseeded cover crops and weeds in organic-based cropping systems	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Weed management is a major issue inorganic farming systems. Although interseeding cover crops is one alternative to herbicides, cover crops often suppress not only weeds but also main crops. Therefore, using cover crops for weed control without adverse effects on main crop growth is important. To verify the effect of covercrops on competition between main crops, cover crops and weeds in a snowy-cold region, main crops soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in 2005 and maize (Zea mays L.) in 2006 were grown with cover crops winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), respectively. The cover crops were sown on three sowing dates: before main crop planting (Pre-MC), on the same date of main crop planting (Syn-MC) and after main crop planting (Post-MC). A plot without cover crops (Sole-MC) was used as a control. The dry weight (DW), vegetation cover ratio (VCR), vertical community structure and chlorophyll content were measured to estimate the competition between main crops, cover crops and weeds. Weed DW was suppressed significantly by sowing cover crops in both soybean and maize. This weed suppression was associated with the increase of VCR of main crops plus cover crops at the early growth stage of main crops. Soil seed banks of dominant weed also became lower by sowing cover crops, implying the importance of proper weed management for suppressing weeds successively. In addition, the sowing dates of cover crops had large effects on main crops DW especially in maize, i.e., it was significantly lower in Pre-MC and Syn-MC than in Post-MC. Although the cover (:top height was markedly shorter than the main crop height, the chlorophyll content of the main crops was significantly lower when cover crops were sown earlier. These results suggest that the growth inhibition of main crops by cover crops was partly caused by competition for nutrients between main crops and cover crops, and this growth inhibition was alleviated when cover crops were sown after the establishment of main crops. Consequently, soybean yield was the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 29%, 18% and 7% in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively, and maize yield was also the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 68%, 100% and 24% in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively. It was concluded that weeds could be controlled effectively by sowing cover crops after planting main crops in organic farming systems in a snowy-cold region. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mortality of exotic and native seeds in invaded and uninvaded habitats	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We examined seed survival in exotic- and native-dominated grasslands by placing seeds of a once-pervasive native grass species, Nassella pulchra, and two of the most common, widespread exotic grass species, Avena fatua and Bromus hordeaceus, in mesh bags in the field for 3 months. Compared to germination of unexposed seeds not placed in the field, exotic species experienced an approximately 40% reduction in viability, whereas the mortality experienced by the native species was < 20%. Despite these differences, germination rates of exposed seeds were similar between native and exotic species because native N. pulchra seeds had lower initial viability prior to entering the seed bank. Seed mortality did not differ based on whether seeds were placed in habitats dominated by exotic or native grasses. Rather, our results suggest that re-establishment of native N. pulchra must focus on maximizing seed viability and survival, and that A. fatua and B. hordeaceus overcome relatively higher losses of viable seeds in the seed bank, potentially by producing large numbers of highly viable seeds.

Managing maize production in shifting cultivation milpa systems in Yucatan, through weed control and manure application	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Milpa cultivation involving cutting an area of forest, burning, and planting crops has existed in the Yucatan Peninsula for more than three millennia. Fallow periods are short and decreasing, leading to a productivity collapse of the system. Technologies that increase yield and maintain plots under cultivation have the potential to decrease the land area needed for family food production, resulting in more mature forests. This study was undertaken to examine the relative importance and potential interactions of declining fertility and increasing weed pressure in reducing maize (Zea mays L.) yields, and to examine the effectiveness of combinations of weed control and sheep manure fertilization rates in sustaining productivity. The study sites were located near Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. The experimental design with three replicates consisted of two sites, 2 cultivation years (1 or more than 1 year of cultivation), three sheep manure application rates (none, 4 Mg DM ha(-1), and 8 Mg DM ha(-1)), and three weed control treatments (none, traditional hand weeding, and herbicide). Measurements included labor required for weed control, weed cover, and maize leaf, stem, and grain harvest and quality. Considerably more labor was needed for hand weeding than for chemical control. At harvest, grass and woody weed cover was greatest for plots with hand or no weed control. Herbicide and, to a lesser extent, hand weeding were effective in controlling herbaceous weeds after the first year of cultivation. Manure applications of 4 Mg DM ha(-1) and 8 Mg DM ha(-1) increased grain yields by one half(415 kg DM ha(-1) and 425 kg DM ha(-1)), stem yields by 36% (549 kg DM ha(-1)) and 50% (758 kg DM ha(-1)), and leaf yields by 40% (386 kg DM ha(-1)) and 45% (431 kg DM ha(-1)). With increasing cultivation year, chemical weed control was more effective than hand weed control in maintaining yields. Treatments had minor effects on protein and fiber concentrations of leaf, stem, and grain. Modest manure fertilization combined with chemical weed control has the potential to maintain or increase yields in repeatedly cultivated plots. Manure application could be implemented and maintained on smallholder farms with sheep. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Goslee, S; Sanderson, M; Gonet, J				Goslee, Sarah; Sanderson, Matt; Gonet, Jeffery			No Persistent Changes in Pasture Vegetation or Seed Bank Composition after Fallowing	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												The practice of fallowing pastures during the growing season is intended to increase plant diversity and allow natural reseeding of forage grasses. Fallowing delivers these benefits in New Zealand, but has been adopted on rotationally stocked farms in the northeastern United States with little or no quantitative assessment. Allowing the pasture to remain ungrazed may allow weedy species to produce seeds, and could reduce legume populations. We measured the seed bank composition (n = 23) and above-ground vegetation (n = 32) in paddocks that had been fallowed from 0-6 yr previously on an organic dairy in Maryland. Transect sampling was used to characterize the canopy cover of the dominant species three times per year for 3 yr. Germinable seed was identified from 5-cm soil cores collected in the spring and autumn in 2 yr. Fallowing did not produce any changes that persisted for more than 2 yr in either the seed bank or the vegetation of this farm. Tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbyshire] and other pasture grasses set seed, increasing in the seed bank during the fallow year, but this did not produce long-term changes in either the seed bank or the vegetation. The proportion of weedy forbs in the seed bank increased, and the legume cover decreased, but only temporarily. Natural reseeding of tall fescue promoted by fallowing did not cause changes in the vegetation, but could lead to increased endophyte infestation in the endophyte-free tall fescue originally planted.																	0002-1962					SEP-OCT	2009	101	5					1168	1174		10.2134/agronj2008.0243							WOS:000269729400018						
J	Sanchez-Lafuente, AM; Parra, R				Sanchez-Lafuente, Alfonso M.; Parra, Raquel			Implications of a long-term, pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits in a generalist herb	ANNALS OF BOTANY												The phenotypic selection of a diverse insect assemblage was studied on a generalist plant species (Paeonia broteroi) in ten flowering seasons, with tests for whether visitor preferences for plants with larger flowers eventually translated into significant differences among plants in visitation rates, seed production, seed mass, seed germination and seedling survival. Selection gradients were used to assess if selection on flower size contributed to explain differences in visitation rates, seed production and seed mass. First, independent analyses were carried out for each season; then for the ten season as a whole. Seedling emergence and survival were assessed by generalized linear models. Directional selection was found on flower size through visitation rates and seed production, and stabilizing selection through seed mass. Thus, larger flowers were more visited, and produced more, but lighter seeds, than smaller flowers. The results suggest a conflicting selection on flower size through seed number and size. Floral integration found in the study populations was larger than that in populations of a distant region. Finally, seed size did not influence seedling emergence and survival; thus, any advantages of seed size may be constrained under natural conditions before plants become reproductive individuals. Plants with larger flowers may be benefited by producing more lighter seeds than fewer heavier ones, as they may contribute disproportionately to the seed bank, and have better chances that any descendant could eventually recruit. However, it seems unlikely that differences in flower size and integration found among populations in different regions could have been originated by rapid evolutionary change. First, because of the conflicting selection described; second, because of the remarkably low seedling survival found under natural conditions. Consequently, the influence of pollinator selection alone does not seem to explain differences in flower size and integration.

J	Saatkamp, A; Affre, L; Dutoit, T; Poschlod, P				Saatkamp, Arne; Affre, Laurence; Dutoit, Thierry; Poschlod, Peter			The seed bank longevity index revisited: limited reliability evident from a burial experiment and database analyses	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Seed survival in the soil contributes to population persistence and community diversity, creating a need for reliable measures of soil seed bank persistence. Several methods estimate soil seed bank persistence, most of which count seedlings emerging from soil samples. Seasonality, depth distribution and presence (or absence) in vegetation are then used to classify a species' soil seed bank into persistent or transient, often synthesized into a longevity index. This study aims to determine if counts of seedlings from soil samples yield reliable seed bank persistence estimates and if this is correlated to seed production. Seeds of 38 annual weeds taken from arable fields were buried in the field and their viability tested by germination and tetrazolium tests at 6 month intervals for 2 center dot 5 years. This direct measure of soil seed survival was compared with indirect estimates from the literature, which use seedling emergence from soil samples to determine seed bank persistence. Published databases were used to explore the generality of the influence of reproductive capacity on seed bank persistence estimates from seedling emergence data. There was no relationship between a species' soil seed survival in the burial experiment and its seed bank persistence estimate from published data using seedling emergence from soil samples. The analysis of complementary data from published databases revealed that while seed bank persistence estimates based on seedling emergence from soil samples are generally correlated with seed production, estimates of seed banks from burial experiments are not. The results can be explained in terms of the seed size-seed number trade-off, which suggests that the higher number of smaller seeds is compensated after germination. Soil seed bank persistence estimates correlated to seed production are therefore not useful for studies on population persistence or community diversity. Confusion of soil seed survival and seed production can be avoided by separate use of soil seed abundance and experimental soil seed survival.

J	Thornby, DF; Walker, SR				Thornby, David F.; Walker, Steve R.			Simulating the evolution of glyphosate resistance in grains farming in northern Australia	ANNALS OF BOTANY												The evolution of resistance to herbicides is a substantial problem in contemporary agriculture. Solutions to this problem generally consist of the use of practices to control the resistant population once it evolves, and/or to institute preventative measures before populations become resistant. Herbicide resistance evolves in populations over years or decades, so predicting the effectiveness of preventative strategies in particular relies on computational modelling approaches. While models of herbicide resistance already exist, none deals with the complex regional variability in the northern Australian sub-tropical grains farming region. For this reason, a new computer model was developed. The model consists of an age- and stage-structured population model of weeds, with an existing crop model used to simulate plant growth and competition, and extensions to the crop model added to simulate seed bank ecology and population genetics factors. Using awnless barnyard grass (Echinochloa colona) as a test case, the model was used to investigate the likely rate of evolution under conditions expected to produce high selection pressure. Simulating continuous summer fallows with glyphosate used as the only means of weed control resulted in predicted resistant weed populations after approx. 15 years. Validation of the model against the paddock history for the first real-world glyphosate-resistant awnless barnyard grass population shows that the model predicted resistance evolution to within a few years of the real situation. This validation work shows that empirical validation of herbicide resistance models is problematic. However, the model simulates the complexities of sub-tropical grains farming in Australia well, and can be used to investigate, generate and improve glyphosate resistance prevention strategies.

Reproductive potential and seedling establishment of the invasive alien tree Schinus molle (Anacardiaceae) in South Africa	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Schinus molle (Peruvian pepper tree) was introduced to South Africa more than 150 years ago and was widely planted, mainly along roads. Only in the last two decades has the species become naturalized and invasive in some parts of its new range, notably in semi-arid savannas. Research is being undertaken to predict its potential for further invasion in South Africa. We studied production, dispersal and predation of seeds, seed banks, and seedling establishment in relation to land uses at three sites, namely ungrazed savanna once used as a military training ground; a savanna grazed by native game; and an ungrazed mine dump. We found that seed production and seed rain density of S. molle varied greatly between study sites, but was high at all sites (384 864-1 233 690 seeds per tree per year; 3877-9477 seeds per square metre per year). We found seeds dispersed to distances of up to 320 m from female trees, and most seeds were deposited within 50 m of putative source trees. Annual seed rain density below canopies of Acacia tortillis, the dominant native tree at all sites, was significantly lower in grazed savanna. The quality of seed rain was much reduced by endophagous predators. Seed survival in the soil was low, with no survival recorded beyond 1 year. Propagule pressure to drive the rate of recruitment: densities of seedlings and sapling densities were higher in ungrazed savanna and the ungrazed mine dump than in grazed savanna, as reflected by large numbers of young individuals, but adult : seedling ratios did not differ between savanna sites. Frequent and abundant seed production, together with effective dispersal of viable S. molle seed by birds to suitable establishment sites below trees of other species to overcome predation effects, facilitates invasion. Disturbance enhances invasion, probably by reducing competition from native plants.

Several theoretically expected issues, such as sudden extinction of small populations with low genetic diversity, limited seed production in small-sized local populations, and significantly high heterozygosity in adults that have survived environmental change, were ascertained through integrated studies on demography with discrimination of genets and genetics using highly polymorphic genetic markers. investigation of genetic properties of the remnant soil seed bank suggested that the seed bank could potentially restore genetic diversity, although the fitness reduction of seed banks caused by inbreeding could affect the success of restoration. As a result of restoration efforts, increases in the number of local populations and genets in the Lake Kasumigaura metapopulation have led to population recovery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Patch size effects on plant species decline in an experimentally fragmented landscape	ECOLOGY												Understanding local and global extinction is a fundamental objective of both basic and applied ecology. Island biogeography theory (IBT) and succession theory provide frameworks for understanding extinction in changing landscapes. We explore the relative contribution of fragment size vs. succession on species' declines by examining distributions of abundances for 18 plant species declining over time in an experimentally fragmented landscape in northeast Kansas, USA. If patch size effects dominate, early-successional species should persist longer on large patches, but if successional processes dominate, the reverse should hold, because in our system woody plant colonization is accelerated on large patches. To compare the patterns in abundance among patch sizes, we characterize joint shifts in local abundance and occupancy with a new metric: rank occupancy-abundance profiles (ROAPs). As succession progressed, statistically significant patch size effects emerged for 11 of 18 species. More early-successional species persisted longer on large patches, despite the fact that woody encroachment (succession) progressed faster in these patches. Clonal perennial species persisted longer on large patches compared to small patches. All species that persisted longer on small patches were annuals that recruit from the seed bank each year. The degree to which species declined in occupancy vs. abundance varied dramatically among species: some species declined first in occupancy, others remained widespread or even expanded their distribution, even as they declined in local abundance. Consequently, species exhibited various types of rarity as succession progressed. Understanding the effect of fragmentation on extinction trajectories requires a species-by-species approach encompassing both occupancy and local abundance. We propose that ROAPs provide a useful tool for comparing the distribution of local abundances among landscape types, years, and species.																	0012-9658					SEP	2009	90	9					2577	2588		10.1890/08-1405.1							WOS:000269025700025	19769135

Exotic earthworms were shown to alter plant community composition of the understory of deciduous forests previously devoid of earthworms. We investigated the effect of two exotic earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris L. and Octolasion tyrtaeum Savigny) belonging to different ecological groups (anecic and endogeic) on the emergence of plants from the seed bank of a northern North American deciduous forest using the seedling emergence method. We hypothesized that (1) exotic earthworms change the seedling emergence from the plant seed bank, (2) L. terrestris increases the emergence of plant seedlings of the deeper soil layer but decreases that of the upper soil layer due to plant seed burial, and (3) O. tyrtaeum decreases plant seedling emergence due the damage of plant seeds. Indeed, exotic earthworms altered the emergence of plant seedlings from the seed bank and the functional composition of the established plant seedlings. Surprisingly, although L. terrestris only marginally affected seedling emergence, O. tyrtaeum changed the emergence of native plant species from the seed bank considerably. In particular, the number of emerging grass and herb seedlings were increased in the presence of O. tyrtaeum in both soil layers. Moreover, the impacts of earthworms depended on the identity of plant functional groups; herb species benefited, whereas legumes suffered from the presence of exotic earthworms. The results highlight the strong effect of invasive belowground ecosystem engineers on aboveground ecosystem characteristics and suggest fundamental changes of ecosystems by human-spread earthworm species.

Evolution over 16 years in a bulk-hybrid population of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) at two contrasting sites in south-western Australia	EUPHYTICA												Evolution was measured over 16 years in a self-regenerating, bulk-hybrid subterranean clover population, consisting of F (2) seed from 253 crosses, sown at Nabawa and Mt Barker, short and long growing season sites, respectively, in south-western Australia. Seed bank samples harvested annually were grown in a common garden. Experiment 1 measured flowering time in plants from each year, while Experiment 2 measured 26 variables in the populations 3 and 16 years after sowing, in comparison with the ancestral population. Changes in population means were observed in 20 characters and variability declined in 11 characters at one or both sites, with much of this occurring within the first three years. Natural selection at Nabawa favoured early flowering of long duration, thick peduncles, high harvest index and high hardseededness. At Mt Barker it favoured late flowering of short duration, large leaves and long, thick petioles at flowering, thick stems with long internodes, long, thin peduncles with a high burial angle, large plants at maturity, low hardseededness and high biochanin A and total isoflavone contents. High seed production capacity, with high seed weight and seeds per burr, was important at both sites. The use of bulk-hybrid populations is demonstrated as a low-input means of breeding and selecting well-adapted subterranean clovers.																	0014-2336	1573-5060				SEP	2009	169	1					31	48		10.1007/s10681-009-9906-7							WOS:000268299900003

Statistical analyses of these measurements were performed to investigate the interaction between seeds or seedlings and environmental factors. Also, the process of habitat choice during the expansion of S. alterniflora was explored. The results show that, in the upper soil seed bank (0-5 cm), both the ratio of germinated seeds and the ratio of survival seedlings to total seeds do not differ significantly among the three habitats. However, in the lower soil seed bank (5-10 cm), these ratios differ significantly, suggesting the seed-seedling conflict of S. alterniflora generally occurs in the lower soil seed bank. The remarkable conflict occurs in the meadow habitat. Greenhouse experiments indicate that the germination rate decreases significantly and the mortality of pre-emerged seedlings increases significantly with increasing burial depth. The maximal burial depth of emerged seedlings varies with sediment types. Comparisons of burial depth effects on seedling height, mesocotyl length, coleoptile length, and root length show that the major responses of S. alterniflora pre-emerged seedlings to the burial treatments are the elongation of coleoptiles and mesocotyls, which favor seedling survival by enhancing aeration and accelerating emergence. These results suggest that burial treatment is a key selection factor, which leads to the seed-seedling conflict in recruitment of S. alterniflora population, and directly affects the expansion rate and the area infected by S. alterniflora.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2009	630	1					287	297		10.1007/s10750-009-9822-9							WOS:000267030500022

Response of a Louisiana Oligohaline Marsh Plant Community to Nutrient Availability and Disturbance	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Aboveground plant community dynamics in an oligohaline marsh at Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, U.S.A., were assessed in response to nutrient loading (3 N x 3 P factorial) and disturbance (both planned herbicide treatment and stochastic tropical storm or hurricane disturbances). Sampling was conducted seasonally from April 2004 to September 2006. Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus are codominant plant species in this marsh. Although Spartina patens displayed increased aboveground cover under the low N addition (20 g N m(-2) y(-1)) relative to ambient conditions or high N addition (40 g N m(-2) y(-1)), increased N or P loading did not result in a shift in plant community composition or species richness during the study period. Schoenoplectus americanus consistently had higher leaf tissue N and generally higher leaf tissue P than Spartina patens regardless of treatment. Our results indicate that Schoenoplectus americanus is more resilient than Spartina patens to disturbances that do not increase marsh surface elevation, such as minor disturbances (e.g., prolonged flooding events) or prescribed burning, which is often utilized as a management technique to increase the relative abundance of Schoenoplectus americanus in this marsh type. Similarly, Schoenoplectus americanus was able to recolonize the herbicide treatment plots to some degree during the study via a combination of seed bank and rhizome tillering, whereas Spartina patens remained essentially absent. Hurricane Katrina deposited significant amounts of sediment (average of +27 cm) into plots that survived the storm (August 29,2005). By 2006, this elevation increase resulted in a significant increase of both Spartina patens cover and species richness, suggesting that a shift in the relative abundance of the two codominants is mitigated by disturbance type and the resultant effect of disturbance on the abiotic environment, particularly marsh surface elevation.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2009					54		174	185		10.2112/SI54-014.1							WOS:000209448000017						
J	Gioria, M; Osborne, B				Gioria, Margherita; Osborne, Bruce			The impact of Gunnera tinctoria (Molina) Mirbel invasions on soil seed bank communities	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the impact of invasive alien plant species on the soil seed bank. Soil seed banks play an important role in determining the composition and dynamics of the vegetation through time. Therefore, an ability to form a persistent seed bank and/or a capacity to alter the structure of the seed bank of invaded communities could be important factors in determining the success of many alien plant species. In this study, we report on a detailed assessment of the characteristics of the seed bank community associated with the herbaceous plant invader, Gunnera tinctoria, a newly emerging and potentially globally significant invasive plant species. This species, native to South America, is invasive in a range of wet habitats in Europe, Australasia and the USA. A comprehensive assessment of the seed bank of invaded and comparable uninvaded areas was made at two points in time (May and October), at three sites in western Ireland. The seedling emergence approach was used to assess the structure (diversity, dominance and abundance) of the soil seed bank. Differences between invaded and uninvaded seed bank communities were investigated at the spatial scales of site, plot and depth. Gunnera tinctoria formed a large persistent seed bank at the study sites. Approximately 30 000 seedlings per square metre emerged from soils collected from invaded areas, of which 30% were found in deep soil layers. Seedlings of this invader represented 53-86% of the total number of seedlings associated with invaded areas. Both the transient and the more persistent component of the seed bank of invaded communities were significantly less diverse and abundant than those of uninvaded areas, and were characterized by higher dominance, even when seedlings of the invader were not included in the analysis. The seed bank of invaded areas was largely composed of seeds of agricultural weeds in addition to those of the invader. These results suggest that G. tinctoria has the capacity to profoundly alter the seed bank of invaded communities. These results have direct relevance for the development of control and management strategies, for this and other comparable invasive species, which should account for both quantitative and qualitative alterations in the seed bank community. Our study also suggests that control measures that result in disturbance of areas colonized by G. tinctoria could promote the germination of undesirable weeds.

Clonal architecture in an intertidal bed of the dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii in the Northern Wadden Sea: persistence through extreme physical perturbation and the importance of a seed bank	MARINE BIOLOGY												Genotypic structure and temporal dynamics of the dwarf seagrass, Zostera noltii, were studied in an intertidal meadow that has persisted since prior to 1936 near the Wadden Sea island of Sylt. Samples were collected from two 10 x 10 m plots separated by 250 m from May 2002 to June 2005 and from four 1 x 1 m plots from June 2003 to September 2004. All the samples were genotyped with nine microsatellite loci. No genotypes were shared between the plots separated by 250 m. Genetic diversity was higher in the Wadden Sea than in the other regions of its geographic range. The average clone size (genets) (SD) in the two plots was 1.38 (0.26) and 1.46 (0.4) mA(2), respectively, with a range up to 9 mA(2) and < 20% persisted for > 4 years. A high genetic and genotypic diversity was maintained by annual recruitment of seedlings despite a dramatic decrease in ramet density that coincided with the severe heat stress event of 2003. Fine-scale (1 mA(2)) analysis suggested that extensive loss of seagrass cover precluded space competition among the genets, while a persistent seed bank prevented local extinction. Long-term persistence of Z. noltii meadows in the intertidal Wadden Sea was achieved by high genet turnover and frequent seedling recruitment from a seed bank, in contrast to the low diversity observed in large and long-living clones of Z. noltii and other seagrasses in subtidal habitats.

J	Van Rossum, F				Van Rossum, F.			Pollen dispersal and genetic variation in an early-successional forest herb in a peri-urban forest	PLANT BIOLOGY												In order to conserve forest plant species under the particularly high constraints that represent urban surroundings, it is necessary to identify the key factors for population persistence. This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and high genetic differentiation (F(ST)), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.																	1435-8603					SEP	2009	11	5					725	737		10.1111/j.1438-8677.2008.00176.x							WOS:000268793400010	19689780

Recolonization potential of bryophyte diaspore banks in harvested boreal mixed-wood forest	PLANT ECOLOGY												Bryophyte diaspore banks are a potential source of reproductive propagules that may be able to colonize newly available habitat after forest harvesting. However, their role and the factors influencing the successful establishment of species remain poorly understood. To investigate these aspects of diaspore banks, we obtained mineral soil samples from mixed and coniferous stands of boreal mixed-wood forest in northern Alberta, Canada, which had recently experienced a range of harvesting intensities. Samples were germinated in growth cabinets under two light regimes. The composition of germinated bryophyte species was compared among forest types, harvesting intensities, and light levels, and also related to edaphic conditions and geographic location of the sample site. Germinated species composition was not related to forest type or harvesting intensity, but was associated with measured edaphic variables and geographic space, indicating that similarity in species composition reflected similarity in edaphic conditions and spatial proximity. This was partly because of spatial dependence of edaphic variables. Light intensity had a significant influence on the development of species assemblages and individual species responses. Richness and cover of acrocarpous mosses (fugitive, colonist, and shuttle life-history strategies) were significantly reduced under low light conditions, but pleurocarpous mosses (perennial strategy) were not affected. Shannon diversity and the frequency of reproduction were significantly greater with high light. Pleurocarpous mosses that are characteristic of intact forests germinated frequently, suggesting that diaspore banks may influence their recovery after disturbance. Diaspore banks are a repository of species at sites affected by forest harvesting; however, diaspore germination and establishment will be constrained by the local environment, including edaphic conditions and light intensity.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				SEP	2009	204	1					55	68		10.1007/s11258-008-9565-0							WOS:000268328200006

Divergence in germination traits among arctic and alpine populations of Koenigia islandica: light requirements	PLANT ECOLOGY												Light is known to regulate conservative germination strategies and the formation of seed banks. Although these strategies are crucial to survival in tundra environments-especially for annuals-light requirements for germination in arctic-alpine species are seldom investigated. Furthermore, environmental differences between arctic and alpine regions are expected to lead to evolutionary divergence among conspecific populations in seed germination strategies. In this study, we report important differences in germination light requirements among six arctic and alpine populations of the annual Koenigia islandica. Light had little effect on germination of the seeds from Iqaluit (Nunavut, Canada), Yukon (Canada), and Jasper (Alberta, Canada), whereas the seeds from the most severe climates, Svalbard (Norway) and Colorado (USA), had strong light requirements. Stratification of the seeds had little influence on their germination light requirements, with the exception of the population from Dovre (Norway), in which it induced a strong light requirement. Possible adaptive explanations and some implications of these observed germination patterns are discussed.

Plantations in Southwest Georgia?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												In the southeastern United States, private forestland managers are under increased pressure to provide wildlife habitat and biodiversity in addition to commercial products such as timber. This study used a stand classification scheme based on vegetation biodiversity from Hedman et al. to compare seed bank composition of benchmark (BM) and nonbenchmark (NBM) Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands. In theHedman et al. study, BM stands contained species associated with Longleaf pine (P. palustris)/Wiregrass (Aristida stricta) communities, whereas NBM stands contained species associated with disturbed sites. The current vegetation of the BM and NBM stands had an average cover of 7.9%/m2 and an average richness of 11 species/m2. The intent for this study was to assist in understanding the potential role of the seed bank during stand development and restoration. We collected seed bank samples from six pine plantations in the winter of 2006. Seed bank samples yielded 2,885 germinants representing 56 unique species but only 4 were found in both current herbaceous vegetation plots and seed bank. The seed bank was dominated by native dicots. In BM stands, 76% of species were native, whereas in NBM stands, 69% were native. Seed bank samples from NBM stands had greater species richness (p = 0.03) and total germinants (p = 0.03) than BM stands. Although the seed bank in all stands was dominated by native species, our data suggest that the seed bank under P. taeda stands should not be viewed as the sole source of native species for most restoration goals.																	1061-2971					SEP	2009	17	5					586	596		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00457.x							WOS:000269978600004

In this study, data are presented on leaf and reproductive phenology, fruit production and seedling demography of a population of an endemic tree species of Southern Central America, Caryocar costaricense. This species has been affected by selective logging and forest fragmentation of its habitat. Phenology was studied by observation of 15-22 tree crowns during two reproductive periods (2003 and 2005). Circular plots were established around I I adult trees to count the number of fallen fruits and seedlings during three years (2003, 2004, 2005). Although reproductive phenology is restricted to the short dry season in this species, seed germination occurred year-round. Fruit and seedling production shows a strong inter-individual variation within the study populations, with two large trees producing nearly 50%-70% of the fruits and seedlings during two years. Most of the seeds that fall beneath the tree crown are covered by litterfall or removed by fauna. We found evidence that many of these seeds become part of a seed bank in the forest floor. Because of the observed reproductive dominance of few large trees in these populations, we propose that selective logging on reproductive trees can severely impact the recruitment of this species.

J	Gruber, S; Claupein, W				Gruber, Sabine; Claupein, Wilhelm			Effect of tillage intensity on weed infestation in organic farming	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Conservation tillage is not yet widely accepted by organic farmers because inversion tillage is considered to be necessary for weed control. Three long-term experiments were established with combinations of reduced and conventional plough tillage and stubble tillage to determine weed infestation levels in organic farming, i.e. herbicide application being excluded. Experiment 1 (with very low stocking density of perennial weeds) showed that in presence of primary tillage by mouldboard ploughing the number of annual weeds was nearly unaffected by the mode of stubble tillage. In experiment 2, however, with Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) being artificially established, thistle density was significantly affected by stubble tillage and by a perennial grass-clover forage crop. Experiment 3 combined two levels of stubble tillage (skimmer plough, no stubble tillage = control) with four implements of primary tillage in the order of decreasing operation depth (deep mouldboard plough, double-layer plough, shallow mouldboard plough or chisel plough). Primary tillage by chisel plough resulted in significantly highest annual weed density compared to all other treatments. The natural C. arvense infestation in experiment 3 showed highest shoot density in the "skimmer plough/chisel plough" treatment compared to the lowest infestation in the "skimmer plough/double-layer plough" treatment. The poor capacity of the chisel plough for weed control was also reflected by the soil seed bank (5500 m(-2) C. arvense seeds for chisel plough, <300 seeds for all other primary tillage). A reduced operation depth of the mouldboard plough ("shallow mouldboard plough") seemed to have an insufficient effect in controlling C. arvense infestation as well. Stubble tillage by the skimmer plough in addition to nearly any primary tillage operation largely reduced both annual weeds and thistle shoots. Most effective in controlling C. arvense was also a biennial grass-clover mixture as part of the crop rotation. Double-layer ploughing is a compromise between soil inversion and soil loosening/cutting and can be regarded as a step towards conservation tillage. In terms of controlling annual weeds and C. arvense, the double-layer plough was not inferior to a deep mouldboard plough and seems to be suitable for weed control in organic farming. Tilling the stubble shallowly after harvest can support weed control in organic farming remarkably, particularly in reducing C. arvense. If no noxious, perennial weeds occur and primary tillage is done by soil inversion, an omission of stubble tillage can be taken into consideration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of different weed management systems on the weed populations, and seedbank composition and distribution in tropical coconut plantations	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Weeds are a perennial problem in coconut plantations and cause significant losses in the nut yield. The occurrence of a wide range of weeds also causes difficulties in their eradication. The influence of five different weed management practises on the distribution and composition of the soil weed seed bank in coconut plantations in the low-country dry zone of Sri Lanka was evaluated. The treatments imposed included the application of glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl]-glycine), cover cropping with Pueraria phaseoloides, tractor harrowing, tractor slashing, and tractor plowing. All the treatments were applied twice per year, except for the cover cropping treatment. In terms of a reduction in the weed biomass, the application of glyphosate and cover cropping (Pueraria) were more efficient in reducing the ground weed population. These methods were very effective in reducing the weed seed density in the top soil layers. Plowing and harrowing significantly reduced the seed bank in the top soil layers and shifted significant numbers of weed seeds to deeper soil profiles. However, the total germinated weed seed count increased by 123.5, 691.4, 1133.1, and 1216.5% in the 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, and 25-30 cm soil depths, respectively, compared with the initial germinated weed seed count in the plowing treatment. Considering all the soil layers, the decline in the germinating weed seed count was very high in the treatment plots with cover cropping and the application of glyphosate; thus, these are considered to be the best practises to reduce the germinating weed seed count in the soil of coconut plantations.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				SEP	2009	9	3					209	216		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2009.00341.x							WOS:000269060500004

To understand the influence of tillage systems on the germination ecology and seedbank dynamics of naturalized Italian ryegrass, we compared the fate of the seeds that were after-ripened in the soil with that of the seeds on the soil surface, and then examined the germination characteristics of the seeds retrieved from both treatments by germination tests in both a light/dark (12 h photoperiod) condition and in constant darkness. The seedling emergence was greater initially for the seeds after-ripened on the soil surface than for the seeds in the soil. The component of emergent seeds after-ripened on the soil surface increased as time passed during the summer, whereas that of emergent seeds in the soil scarcely increased. This contrasting emergence was, in part, attributable to the ability of the seeds to germinate at higher temperatures in the light/dark condition than in constant darkness. These results suggest that untilled systems, which leave many seeds on the soil surface, might promote the rapid depletion of Italian ryegrass seeds through germination before wheat sowing in early winter. In contrast, seed burial by tillage might inhibit the germination of the seeds and form a large transient seed bank available to germinate during the wheat-growing season.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				SEP	2009	9	3					217	224		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2009.00342.x							WOS:000269060500005

Spatial Distribution and Temporal Stability of Prostrate Knotweed (Polygonum aviculare) and Corn Poppy (Papaver rhoeas) Seed Bank in a Cereal Field	WEED SCIENCE												The knowledge of weed distribution in a field is a key factor to manage weeds effectively. The feasibility of using weed distribution maps for site-specific weed control will largely depend on the stability of the spatial distribution of the populations. Seed banks are the most reliable way of telling the area's weediness, but the effect of regular herbicide applications on its stability is largely unknown. A field experiment was conducted during 3 yr in a winter wheat Field under herbicide treatments with the aim of studying the seed bank's spatial distribution of prostrate knotweed and corn poppy and the spatiotemporal stability of their populations. Soil samples were taken each year on the same locations, and seed abundance was measured by germination in greenhouse. Both species accounted for more than 10% of the broad-leaved weed seed bank and they were selected for further analysis. Prostrate knotweed seed-bank density decreased 76% and corn poppy 88% in 3 yr. Spatial distribution was described by spherical isotropic semivariograms. Distance of spatial dependence (range) of prostrate knotweed and corn poppy decreased 33 and 11% respectively, and the spatial variability (sill) decreased 96 and 99%. Yearly spatial seed distribution was compared for each species and no temporal stability was observed over a 3-yr period. The lack of stability was attributed to the important decrease of seed density over time and the increase in the short-range variability (nugget). However, for prostrate knotweed, the location of minima and maxima were roughly the same between years, allowing farmers to extend the period Of use of the weed distribution maps. Although spatial distribution of seed banks can be affected by processes that promote fast changes in the densities of weed populations, this fact does not mean that weed distribution maps could not be used in consecutive seasons.

Effects of Initial Seed-Bank Density on Weed Seedling Emergence during the Transition to an Organic Feed-Grain Crop Rotation	WEED SCIENCE												The transition period to certified organic production can present a significant weed management challenge for growers. Organic certification requires that prohibited fertilizers and pesticides must not have been used for 36 mo before harvest of the first organic crop. Understanding how organic management practices and initial weed seed-batik densities affect weed population dynamics during the transition period may improve weed management efficacy and adoption of organic practices. We examined how tillage systems (full or reduced) and cover crop species planted during the First transition year (rye or a mixture of timothy and red clover) affect the seedling densities of three common annual weed species, common lambsquarters, velvetleaf, and foxtail spp., during the 3-yr transition period. Weed seeds were applied in a one-time pulse at the beginning of the study at three densities, low, medium, and high (60, 460, and 2,100 seeds m(-2), respectively), and cumulative seedling densities of each species were assessed annually. Treatment factors had variable and species-specific effects on weed seedling densities. In general, the full-tillage system, with an initial cover crop of timothy and red clover, resulted in the lowest density of weed seedlings following seed-bank augmentation. There was little consistent association between the initial densities of applied weed seeds in the weed seed bank at the start of the transition and weed seedling densities at the end of the transition period. This suggests that when multiple crop and weed cultural management practices are employed during the organic transition period, initial failures in weed management may not necessarily lead to persistent and intractable annual weed species management problems following organic certification.

POTENTIAL PROPAGULE SOURCES FOR REESTABLISHING VEGETATION ON THE FLOODPLAIN OF THE KISSIMMEE RIVER, FLORIDA, USA	WETLANDS												After channellization of the Kissimmee River, the primary land use of the drained floodplain was cattle pasture but included sod farms. A project to restore the river began in 1999. One of its goals is to reestablish the three dominant, pre-channelization vegetation types (wetland shrub, broadleaf marsh, and wet prairie) in areas where they previously were found. We investigated whether indicator species of these three vegetation types were present in 53 permanent quadrats on the drained floodplain. All seven indicator species were found in the permanent quadrats. We also examined three potential sources of propagules (relict wetlands, seed banks, and several surrogates of hydrochory) for these indicator species. All seven species were found in adjacent relict wetlands; and six were found in the seed banks of permanent quadrats. Based on binomial logistic regressions, the presence of relict wetlands and surrogates for flooding (relative elevation, total days flooded) can predict the presence or absence of most of these indicator species. Sod farming reduced the presence of wet-prairie and broadleaf marsh indicator species in permanent quadrats, in adjacent relict wetlands and in the seed bank. The potential importance of relict wetlands for the re-vegetation of the floodplain was our most important finding.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2009	29	3					976	987		10.1007/BF03173624							WOS:000272944400019

This study presents data on seed quantity and quality for black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), a semiserotinous conifer that dominates large areas of North American boreal forest. We sampled seed rain and viability for 2 years after fire (2005-2007) in 39 sites across interior Alaska that burned in 2004. All sites were dominated by black spruce before they burned. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relative importance of prefire spruce abundance, topography effects, canopy fire severity, and distance to unburned stands in explaining variations in black spruce seed rain. Prefire basal area of spruce that remained standing after fire was a significant predictor of total seed rain, but seed viability was more strongly related to site elevation, canopy fire severity, and distances to unburned stands. Although positive relations between tree basal area and the size of the aerial seed bank may place a first constraint on seed availability, accurate prediction of postfire viable seed rain for serotinous conifers also requires consideration of the effects of abiotic stress and canopy fire severity on seed viability.

Temporal variation of soil seed banks in two different dune systems in northeastern Inner Mongolia, China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												To assess the potential contribution of soil seed banks to seedling recruitment, and to the vegetative processes of dune systems in semi-arid areas, a comparison of temporal variation in soil seed bank was made between active and stabilized dune systems in northeastern Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that between-year difference in seed density for the stabilized system was smaller than that for the active one, but there were similar variations with season in seed bank for both dune systems. Furthermore, seed densities of the dominant species on the respective dune type (i.e., annuals on the stabilized dune and psammophytes on the active dune) varied more sharply with season, but more gently in annual variation than those of other phytogroups. These findings suggest that (1) seeds of annuals in the soil of the stabilized dune, or seeds of psammophytes in the soil of the active dune contributed much to seedling recruitment or plant species colonization, (2) the relationship between soil seed bank and seedling recruitment was complex in both dune systems.

Diet of two sympatric Pheidole spp. ants in the central Monte desert: implications for seed-granivore interactions	INSECTES SOCIAUX												Ants of the genus Pheidole are important seed consumers in several desert ecosystems. In South American deserts, although several Pheidole spp. have been characterized as seed harvesters, studies on their diet and ecological role are still missing. Pheidole spininodis (Mayr) and Pheidole bergi (Mayr) are capable of removing seeds in the central Monte desert. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the diet of these species and to interpret the results in the context of seed-granivore interactions. Diet was estimated during mid-summer by collecting items brought back to the nest by foragers in ten colonies per species. While P. spininodis was mainly granivorous, P. bergi was mainly insectivorous. However, they both collected similar to 40% of other types of items. Among seeds, the diet of P. spininodis included mostly grass seeds, whereas the diet of P. bergi was mainly made up of shrub and tree seeds, usually retrieved cooperatively. This behavior allowed P. bergi to carry larger seeds, resulting in diet partitioning in terms of seed size. However, diet of P. spininodis is very similar to that of three sympatric Pogonomyrmex species. Thus, specialized harvester ants remove large quantities of grass seeds in the central Monte desert during the summer, potentially affecting their abundance in the soil seed bank. P. bergi directs its feeding pressure to shrub and tree seeds, and although seeds constitute similar to 10% of its diet, its high colony density and high activity levels, added to the lower proportion of large seeds in the soil seed bank, indicate that their importance as seed consumers cannot be ruled out.				di Pasquo, Federico/R-9201-2019													0020-1812					AUG	2009	56	3					277	283		10.1007/s00040-009-0021-5							WOS:000268102600007						
J	Martin, KL; Kirkman, LK				Martin, Katherine L.; Kirkman, L. Katherine			Management of ecological thresholds to re-establish disturbance-maintained herbaceous wetlands of the south-eastern USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. The restoration of disturbance-maintained ecosystems may require management to overcome ecological thresholds and re-establish feedbacks that perpetuate an alternative community. We use hardwood-dominated depression wetlands (locally known as oak domes) embedded in the fire-maintained longleaf pine-wiregrass Pinus palustris-Aristida stricta ecosystem as an example where concepts developed from alternative state theory are applied to practical restoration. 2. As extant communities were not available as reference sites, we based our restoration objectives on knowledge of vegetation dynamics, land-use history and historical data. We quantified a hardwood encroachment pattern beginning with the establishment of central nuclei during fire-free periods. Expansion of this core of hardwoods is positively reinforced by the accumulation of fuels that impede the spread of fire. 3. In order to examine the feasibility of re-establishing herbaceous communities, we selected 10 depression wetlands in 2000 and randomly assigned a hardwood removal treatment to half of them. During the transition period of fine fuel accumulation, we adapted the management regime as necessary for control of hardwood re-sprouts and to promote the development of a fire-maintained community. 4. After 5 years, hardwood removal communities had shifted toward herbaceous dominance, characterized by multi-layered, species-rich, native, wetland-specific ground flora. The rapid recovery of herbaceous species was probably possible because of initial seedling recruitment from a persistent wetland soil seed bank. This immediate recruitment of herbaceous vegetation produced fine fuels, allowing for the reintroduction of frequent prescribed fire and, thus, the re-establishment of the herbaceous community-fire feedback mechanism necessary to maintain the community state. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings confirm that it is possible to re-establish a rare alternative community state in a fire-maintained ecosystem. Establishment of a desired transition trajectory required decoupling ecological feedbacks that inhibit reintroduction of fire while facilitating positive feedbacks to promote fire. Our approach incorporating ecological thresholds and biotic legacies, such as a persistent seed bank, can serve as a model to inform restoration strategies for other disturbance-maintained ecosystems.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions The relationship between fire, aridity and seed banks is poorly understood in plant community ecology. We tested whether there was a close correspondence between the seed bank and standing vegetation composition with time-since-fire in a desert. We also examined whether longer-lived species showed seed limitation relative to more ephemeral species, as this could influence grass-woody ratios in a major biome. Location Dune hummock grasslands/shrublands of central Australia. Methods The effects of time-since-fire on floristic and functional group composition were examined by comparing plots unburned since 1984 against plots that had been burned in 2002. Three methods were used to quantify seed abundances: a germination trial using heat and smoke application, a flotation method, and a sieving method. Results Seed bank densities were very low (< 3000 m(-2)). Species similarity between the seed bank and standing vegetation was high at sites recently burned (0.86) and low in sites long-since burned (0.52). The relative abundance of ephemeral species in the seed bank peaked in recently burned plots, but the relative abundance of seeds of woody species did not match the pattern of abundance in the standing vegetation. Remarkably, the dominant perennial grasses and woody species were either absent from the seed bank or present at extremely low abundances. Discussion Differences in the relative abundance of ephemeral species between standing vegetation and seed bank relate to the post-fire succession process. The small soil pool of seed from woody species may be explained by allocation to belowground carbohydrate storage over seed production. Field observations suggest, however, that production of strongly dormant seed can be prolific and that high levels of seed predation make this system strongly seed-limited. The discovery of this seed bank syndrome indicates that shifts in grass-woody ratios can be driven by the juxtaposition of unpredictable seed rain and fire events in these desert dunes. However, estimates of grass-woody ratios due to changing fire regimes will be difficult to predict.

Location Benesov nad Lipou, Ceskomoravska vrchovina (Czech-Moravian uplands), Czech Republic Methods We designed a 5-year container experiment in which plant succession started from scratch. Soil conditions were constant and all containers were filled with homogeneous substrate containing no propagules. We placed the containers in two contrasting habitats (meadow and floodplain) under identical climatic conditions but differing in surrounding vegetations and hence seed input. New containers were installed (and hence succession started) in two subsequent years, twice in each year (spring and autumn). We assume that the individual dates would lead to differences in propagule input and weather conditions. Results Although both year and season of succession initiation considerably affected the initial species composition, we observed a pronounced convergence within the set of containers located in each habitat. However, the similarity of containers initiated at the same time but located in different habitats decreased over the course of succession. Final composition of the meadow and floodplain containers was therefore mostly determined by permanent seed input from their nearby neighborhood. Conclusions This study demonstrated that propagule availability is an important determinant of the course of succession, and that differential seed input leads to different pathways of succession, even when all other environmental conditions are equal.

Vegetation and seed bank dynamics in a tidal freshwater marsh	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions What are the feedbacks among the seed bank, parent vegetation, and landscape structure that control plant species turnover in space and time in a tidal freshwater marsh? How can these feedbacks be used to better understand marsh community dynamics and to establish restoration practices that seek to restore vegetation diversity of this important and widely distributed ecosystem? Location Potomac River, Virginia, United States (15 km south of Washington, DC). Methods We sampled the seed bank and standing vegetation in a tidal freshwater marsh and explored similarities between seed bank and vegetation composition through space and time. We then investigated marsh surface elevation, distance to nearest tidal channels, and life history of component species as potential explanations for the observed vegetation patterns. Results The composition of individual plots changed considerably from year to year; however, the composition at broader spatial (whole marsh) and temporal (4 years) scales was relatively stable. Species composition of the seed bank was dissimilar to both the previous and current year's standing vegetation, and similarity to standing vegetation was particularly low in plots dominated by annual species. Landscape structure and life history characteristics of individual species best explained the spatiotemporal variability in marsh vegetation. Conclusions Restoration designs should be landscape-dependent and explicitly incorporate spatially structured elements such as elevation gradients to maximize community diversity in reconstructed tidal freshwater marshes. Optimal designs include areas of high seed input, areas of high species turnover, as well as other areas of greater stability.

Hybridization within the Beta vulgaris species complex is of immediate concern; crop lineages (B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) hybridize easily with their wild relatives (B. vulgaris ssp. maritima) thereby threatening wild beet gene diversity with genetic swamping. Hybridization 'hotspots' occur in European seed production areas because inland ruderal wild beets occur and reproduce in sympatry with cultivated beets. We studied gene flow occurring between seed-producing cultivars and ruderal wild B. vulgaris in southwestern France to determine whether feral beets, arising from unharvested cultivated seed, represent an opportunity for crop-to-wild gene flow. We surveyed 42 inland ruderal beet populations located near seed production fields for nucleo-cytoplasmic variation and used a cytoplasmic marker diagnostic of cultivated lines. Occurrence of cultivated-type cytoplasm within ruderal populations clearly reflected events of crop seed escape. However, we found no genetic signatures of nuclear cultivated gene introgression, which suggests past introgression of cultivated cytoplasm into a wild nuclear background through seed escape rather than recent direct pollen flow. Overall, patterns of genetic structure suggested that inland ruderal wild beet populations act as a metapopulation, with founding events involving a few sib groups, followed by low rates of seed or pollen gene flow after populations are established. Altogether, our results indicate that a long-lived seed bank plays a key role in maintaining cultivated-type cytoplasm in the wild and highlight the need for careful management of seed production areas where wild and cultivated relatives co-occur.

Evaluating the invasiveness of Acacia paradoxa in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We present the first detailed survey of a population of Acacia paradoxa DC. (syn. Acacia armata R.Br.), Kangaroo Thorn, in South Africa. The species is listed under the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act as a category I invasive plant and, until 2008, was being managed as part of Working for Water's general alien clearing operations. Acacia paradoxa is currently restricted to a small population (similar to 11,350 plants over similar to 295 ha) on the northern slopes of Devil's Peak, Table Mountain National Park in the Western Cape. Its distribution is highly clumped, and at a local scale it has formed thick stands of up to 20 plants m(-2). Using a bioclimatic model we predict that it has a large potential distribution in South Africa, especially along the southern coast. We confirmed the categorisation of A. paradoxa as a potential landscape transformer that requires immediate control by conducting a formal risk assessment using the Australian Weed Risk Assessment system. However, the population appears to be spreading slowly, and, while there is a significant seed-bank in some places (similar to 1000 seeds m(-2)), this is largely restricted to below the canopy of existing plants. Therefore, the population has not and likely will not rapidly spread in area, and so containment is feasible.

Community structure of a southern Chihuahuan Desert grassland under different grazing pressures	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The effect of different grazing intensities on the semiarid grasslands of the southern Chihuahuan Desert was studied using a fence-line contrast between a moderately grazed cattle ranch, from which goats and sheep had been excluded for forty-five years, and an ejido, heavily overgrazed for at least the last century. Each plant species density and cover was quantified in three distinctive microhabitats on the ranch and on the adjacent common-use rangelands. The results indicated that three grass species were important in the dynamics of this rangeland. Hilaria belangeri, a stoloniferous, mat-forming grass species, was dominant on the heavily grazed ejido, but is in the process of being replaced by two taller grasses, Bouteloua gracilis and Boutleloua curtipendula, on the more moderately grazed ranch. These data suggest that the dynamics of this system in the semiarid grasslands of the southern Chihuahuan Desert are based primarily on two functional groups of species. Members of the first functional group are stoloniferous and clonal. Their growth form slows the rate of surface water movement, thereby controlling erosion while building up the soil by entrapping debris. In contrast, the second functional group is comprised of non-stoloniferous grasses that are described variously as bunch, tufted or tussock grasses in the literature. These species have the capacity to invade, overtop and replace individuals of the first functional group. They are limited in their lateral growth by their rhizomatous growth habit, which is much less efficient in co-opting space. Finally, there is, at least, a third functional group of much taller grasses present that are limited in these rangelands to refuges by the heavy grazing. These species are usually obligate seed producers. Such species have the potential to replace members of the earlier functional groups by overtopping them. They are limited by their inability to reproduce vegetatively, once established by their seed bank. This research suggests that restoration of the heavily eroded, semiarid grasslands of the southern Chihuahuan Desert must begin with the re-establishment of members of the first functional group. These species have the ability to facilitate the entry of the later functional groups and, in turn, be replaced competitively by them. (C) 2009 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Now vegetation is distributed in patches, due to the effect of grazing, namely: middle height (dominated by non-forage species), low (dominated by forage species) and the co-dominated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the differences in a few structural variables between patches and their influence on the seed bank in the province of La Pampa, Argentina. For this description in the gramineous-herbaceous structure, aerial cover was established, along with humus cover, soil proportion, cover by species, density of perennial gramineous and gramineous seed bank. The specific diversity and richness was established from the vegetation cover; for Diversity, the Shannon-Weaver index was used. We found that grazing affected the structural variables evaluated and had a repercussion on the seed bank. The vegetation cover reached its highest in patches dominated by non-forage species, while diversity and richness was present in patches dominated by lower forage and co-dominated species. In the seed bank of the patches of forages, there is abundant Stipa trichotoma, a perennial, non-forage species. If we add that grazing in Piptochaetium napostaense affects productivity, vigor and permanence of plants, we would be facing a spiral of degradation.																	1405-3195					JUL-AUG	2009	43	5					529	537									WOS:000268846400008

Spatial distribution of weed diversity within a cereal field	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Weeds are key components of agroecosystems because they support biological diversity within crop fields. Ecological indicators of weed diversity are usually assessed on a field scale, but weeds are distributed unevenly within fields. Here, we explore spatial distribution of diversity in weed seed banks, and how a failure of grass weed control may affect biodiversity indicators. We studied spatial distribution and stability of species richness, Shannon's diversity index, and Pielou's evenness index of a weed seed bank, site-specifically and for the entire field, over three years in a commercial winter wheat field regularly treated with narrow-and broad-leaved herbicides. 254 soil samples were taken on 10 m x 10 m grids at the beginning of each season. Seeds were identified by germination in a greenhouse and indices were assessed for each point. The spatial structure of the indices was described by spherical isotropic semivariograms. Our findings show that diversity and evenness computed for the entire field both decreased by 63% after lack of grass weed control, and increased 32% and 31%, respectively, the following year. However, richness, diversity and evenness were not homogeneous across the field. Diversity and evenness became increasingly patchy over time, as shown by a spatial dependence increasing by 21% and 40%, respectively, after two years. This finding is related to the reduction in the patch extension of broad-leaved species due to broad-leaved herbicide application each year and the expansion of grass patches due to the lack of grass control in the first year. Spatial location of patches was not stable over time. Nevertheless, weedy areas remained on the field and represent plant diversity caches that may contribute to maintaining global biodiversity. This information is missed if a single biodiversity index is computed for the entire field. Knowledge of spatial distribution of weed diversity within a field will be useful for identifying wildlife conservation areas and understanding changes in biodiversity in cropland ecosystems better.

J	Rodrigo, MA; Alonso-Guillen, JL; Cirujano, S; Soulie-Marsche, I				Rodrigo, Maria A.; Luis Alonso-Guillen, Jose; Cirujano, Santos; Soulie-Marsche, Ingeborg			Former charophyte communities in l'Albufera de Valencia revealed by a study of the sediment bank oospores	ANALES DEL JARDIN BOTANICO DE MADRID												Charophyte oospores and their features (size, shape, colour, outer wall ornamentation, etc.) are able to persist in seed banks of aquatic ecosystems. Thus, these characteristics can be used for taxonomic species identification, thereby providing knowledge about the specific composition of the charophyte community in a habitat that currently lacks, or has greatly altered, submerged vegetation. Several years ago, l'Albufera de Valencia lost the charophyte meadows that covered the lake bottom in the past, which had never been studied in detail. Several sediment cores were extracted from the lagoon at three sites and the oospores and gyrogonites were isolated and characterized. The oospore/gyrogonite densities in the sediment layers were estimated. Ten different taxa have been identified: six belonging to genus Chara [Ch. vulgaris, Ch. hispida var. major, Ch. fragilis (Ch. globularis), Ch. hispida var. baltica, Ch. aspera, Ch. tomentosa]; one Nitella species (N. hyalina), two Tolypella species (T. glomerata and T. hispanica) and one Lamprothamnium species (L. papulosum). The latter, which indicates the period when water salinity was high in the lagoon, was found in the deepest sediment layers. An increase in the oospore abundance and diversity was observed in line with sediment depth. This indicates, on the one hand, that the lagoon went through different ecological stages (with important changes in salinity, mainly) and, on the other hand, the eutrophication process that the lagoon has been undergoing for at least the last 45 years, has progressively affected the abundance and diversity of the charophyte community.

J	Steinhardt, T; Selig, U				Steinhardt, Tim; Selig, Uwe			Comparison of recent vegetation and diaspore banks along abiotic gradients in brackish coastal lagoons	AQUATIC BOTANY												Submerged vegetation and diaspore banks were investigated in three shallow brackish lagoons along the German southern Baltic Sea coast. The distribution of vegetation and diaspores was analysed at three depths (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 m) on three transects in each lagoon along salinity and nutrient gradients. Thirteen taxa of submerged vegetation were identified in three lagoons: 8 angiosperms and 5 charophytes. The diaspore analysis yielded 11 taxa of submerged diaspore types: 7 angiosperm taxa and 4 charophyte taxa groups. Salinity and nutrient gradients are the key factors governing the distribution of the vegetation and diaspore banks here. Statistical analysis (SIMPER) of vegetation and diaspore bank show differences in dissimilarities, i.e. Bray-Curtis similarities subtracted from 100, between the lagoon parts and between the lagoons. These differences increased with increasing intensity of the salinity and nutrient gradients. We argue that the diaspore bank reflects the former vegetation gradients shaped primarily by salinity gradients, whereas the present vegetation gradients are more affected by eutrophication. Vegetation Surveys and diaspore bank analyses therefore supplement each other, and their combined use provides insight into former as well as recent gradients in the vegetation and the factors governing these gradients.

Vegetation communities in continental boreal wetlands along a salinity gradient: Implications for oil sands mining reclamation	AQUATIC BOTANY												Oil sands mining is a major disturbance to boreal landscapes in north-eastern Alberta, Canada. Freshwater peatlands dominate the landscape prior to mining, but the post-mining reclamation landscape will have wetlands that span a salinity gradient. Little is known about the native Vegetation communities in subsaline and saline marshes in the boreal region, yet these communities offer the best potential for reclamation of wetlands after oil sands mining. The overall intent of this study is to provide information oil natural wetland communities along a gradient of salinities that can be used to enhance oil sands wetland reclamation. Our specific study objectives were to: (I) characterize environmental conditions of industrial and natural wetlands, (2) characterize vegetation communities (Composition and diversity) lit these wetlands, (3) and explore how vegetation communities (composition and diversity) may be influenced by environmental conditions. We Surveyed vegetation communities and environmental variables in 25 natural boreal wetlands along a salinity gradient and in 10 industrial marshes ill the oil sands mining region. We observed all electrical conductivity (EC) range of 0.5-28 mS cm(-1) in the wetlands, indicating that salinity similar to or higher than anticipated for oil sands reclamation is naturally present in some boreal wetlands. We observed low species richness in both industrial and natural wetlands. There were 101 plant species observed in all the wetlands, with 82 species recorded in the natural wetlands and 44 species in industrial wetlands. At the plot level, richness decreased with increasing EC and pH, but increased with soil organic matter. Using Cluster Analysis and indicator species analysis we defined 16 distinct vegetation community types, each dominated by one or two species of graminoid vegetation. In general these communities resembled those of boreal or prairie marshes. Electrical conductivity, pH, and water depth were important factors correlating with community composition Of the wetlands, however peat depth and soil organic content did not differ among community types. Not all community types were present in industrial wetlands, indicating that these communities may need to be planted to enhance overall diversity ill future reclaimed oil sands wetlands.

Distribution, species composition and management implications of seed banks in southern New England coastal plain ponds	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Buried seeds that germinate during periods of low water or water level drawdown can play important roles in shaping plant community composition, community dynamics and species richness in ecosystems with fluctuating water levels. Northeastern US coastal plain ponds have fluctuating water levels and contain a characteristic shoreline flora that contains many rare plants. The objectives of this study were to: (1) test whether geographically distant ponds in Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard had distinct seed banks, (2) determine if hydrologic status as permanent and ephemeral ponds led to differences in seed banks, and (3) examine seed diversity and seed abundance across gradients of shoreline elevations and sediment characteristics. Viable seeds of 45 plant species were identified from nine ponds. Native species dominated pond-shore seed banks and made up 89-100% of all species. There was high overlap in seed bank composition across hydrological classes and geographic regions. One hydrological class captured 73-76% of total species and one geographical region captured 69-78% of the total species recovered from the entire suite of seed bank samples. Seeds were relatively evenly distributed along the shorelines of ephemeral ponds but seed diversity and abundance were lower at low elevations in permanent ponds. Results suggest that strategies to protect pond shorelines to capture maximum diversity of coastal plain pond plants contained in pond sediment seed banks should be implemented across pond hydrologic classes and across a wide geographic area. Shoreline seed distributions indicate that ground-water withdrawals or climate changes that lower pond water levels in permanent ponds will reduce the diversity and abundance of plants recovered from seed banks by shifting water levels to a shoreline zone of high sediment organic matter where seed densities are lower. This effect will be much less in ephemeral ponds where seed diversity and abundance on pond bottoms was high. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Classification of canola (Brassica napus) winter cultivars by secondary dormancy. Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 613-619. Secondary dormancy is the major reason for seed persistence of canola (Brassica napus L.) in the soil. Volunteers emerging from the soil seed bank can lead to unwanted gene dispersal. More than 40 B. napus canola cultivars were tested for secondary dormancy under laboratory conditions. All cultivars were classified into groups of low, medium, and high dormancy by performing a cluster analysis. The results Suggest that secondary dormancy is a cultivar-specific trait. Additionally, inter-year variation in dormancy indicates that it seems to be influenced by a set of environmental factors. Among years, classification Of cultivars based on relative rank was more robust than classification based on absolute dormancy values. The classification of cultivars by their dormancy level would allow farmers to select and grow low-dormancy cultivars. Knowledge about the relative secondary dormancy of the Currently grown cultivars could help growers and breeders lower canola seed bank persistence.																	0008-4220					JUL	2009	89	4					613	619		10.4141/CJPS08190							WOS:000268625000003

Based on that, the objective of this paper is to characterize the seed rain and to establish its relation with some aspects of the vegetation in one part of a height sandbank forest located in Ilha Comprida. Wooden traps made with base and cover of fine-mesh nylon were distributed on Me area. A total of 50 species were collected, pertaining to 19 families (72.6% zoochoric and 27.33% anemochoric). The height level of concentration of zoochoric seeds indicates that the forest possess a reasonable level of conservation. The height density of allochthonous seeds (47.06%) found in the studied area indicates increase of floristic similarity among the vegetation mosaics in a long period: however, this is possible only when the soil condition is similar.				dos Santos Junior, Nelson/D-3838-2012													0104-7760					JUL-SEP	2009	15	3					355	365									WOS:000272151300013

Soil seed bank formation during early revegetation after hydroseeding in reclaimed coal wastes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The soil seed bank is an important component of ecosystem resilience and represents a stock of regeneration potential in many plant assemblages; however, little is known about the initial development of seed bank during restoration. We characterized the size and composition of the soil seed bank in a reclaimed coal mine in Spain. For that, the initial seed bank of soil-forming material and cattle manure that was spread over it analyzed before hydroseeding. Later, the seed bank that developed in the two seasons (2.3 years) after hydroseeding was resampled, taking in consideration the distance to natural communities and topography. The seed bank increased from virtually nothing to 1813 seeds m(-2) over the study period, and was composed of mainly native species, which were more abundant near seed sources in the adjacent landscape. Topography only influenced the size of the hydroseeded species seed bank, with four species comprising approximately 45% of the seed bank. There were also variations in seed bank species number and composition in the different areas of the same mine. These results emphasize the necessity of taking care when including foreign species in a hydroseeding mixture, and of considering seed bank development within each area of a site in management planning. Otherwise differences may condition the future vegetation recovery from the desired target, creating very different communities in very close proximity. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Genetic structure of seedling cohorts following repeated wildfires in the fire-sensitive shrub Persoonia mollis ssp nectens	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Increased fire frequency is seen as a key threat to plant populations in Mediterranean-type ecosystems across the globe. Short inter-fire periods may exhaust soil-stored and fire-stimulated seed banks of fire-sensitive species, reducing actual and effective population sizes and eroding genetic diversity. 2. Here we used microsatellite genotyping to investigate the genetic impacts of repeated wildfires and, in particular, the contribution of above-ground genetic processes (seed and pollen dispersal) to the genetic structuring and composition of post-fire recruits in an isolated population of the fire-sensitive shrub Persoonia mollis ssp. nectens. 3. We tested the hypothesis that limited pollen and seed dispersal, in combination with the potentially patchy effects of fire at a fine scale within populations, would generate a highly structured population, a decline in genetic diversity after each fire and genetic heterogeneity between successive cohorts. 4. Wildfires killed all 25 adult plants in 1997 and, in 2001, killed all of the 476 seedlings remaining from the 1997 seedling cohort. Although there was no possibility of replenishment of the seed bank in the interval between fires, a second cohort of 381 seedlings emerged after the 2001 fire. 5. We found no evidence that successive fires produced either a decline in genetic diversity, as measured by allelic richness or expected heterozygosity, or the genetic differentiation of adult and successive seedling cohorts (Pairwise F-ST = -0.0125 to 0.0009). The seedling cohorts displayed less genetic structuring than anticipated. Spatial genetic structure was low, ranging from Sp = 0.02 in the 1997 seedlings to Sp = 0.06 in the 2001 seedlings, and using parentage analysis, we found that seedlings clustered under dead adults rarely reflected simple seed shadows. 6. Synthesis. Overall, we found that a numerically large seed bank with a bet-hedging strategy of staged seed germination, in combination with genetic mixing achieved by both pollen and seed dispersal, provides a powerful buffer against the negative impacts of frequent fire in P. mollis ssp. nectens.

J	Prada, D				Prada, Dario			Molecular population genetics and agronomic alleles in seed banks: searching for a needle in a haystack?	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Seed banking has been the single most significant reaction of the research community to the alarming rates of plant genetic erosion occurring in the wild. One enduring challenge for a wiser utilization of the resources enclosed in seed banks, however, has been the estimation of their genetic potentials for agriculture's benefit. Key to detecting in landraces and/or wild relatives of modern crops any allelic variant lost during domestication and crop improvement is the use of molecular information to determine structure, evolution, and function of the genes harbouring these alleles. This paper reviews some of the theoretical and statistical issues surrounding the use of molecular population genetics tools for the detection of agronomical valuable alleles in seed banks. Emphasis is made on the technical limitations imposed by seed banking that may lessen the success of integrated and multi-disciplinary molecular approaches. The influence that population stratification and linkage disequilibrium exert on specific experimental designs for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of potential agronomic-related genes is also examined.																	0022-0957	1460-2431				JUL	2009	60	9					2541	2552		10.1093/jxb/erp130							WOS:000266957900010	19451185

Soil seed stocks changed depending on management strategies efforts and some environmental factors in rangeland sites. Knowledge about soil seed banks and vegetation in these ecosystems was crucial for guiding the restoration efforts. This study examined the size, composition and species richness of the soil seed banks in grazed and ungrazed sites. Forty seven species of botanical composition of the seed stocks were identified, 29 species of them were common to both sites. Seedling number in grazed site was higher than in ungrazed site in the soil stocks. Seeds of desirable grasses and legume species were higher in the grazed site. Similarity index of seedling composition between grazed and ungrazed site was 57.11 %. The results implied that under current grazing condition on the rangelands in the region, range vegetation was not extremely degraded and may be regenerated by soil seed stocks in the case of unexpected degradation event.

We have analyzed the seed bank composition in a pasture community of Tenerife, one of the richest communities of the archipelago with a high environmental and social importance due to the dependence of local population of the maintenance of the pastures and because the unquestionable inheritage value. We analyzed the soils seed bank composition in ten plots (replicated in three seed banks) in the area with different soil nutrient composition. Soil nutrient composition of the plots was also analyzed. Our results revealed that the density of leguminous in the plots can be explained due to P and pH, while grasses can be explained by CIC and pH and the other group of species (non-grasses and leguminous) by K and EC. The analysis of species composition in relation to the nutrient content of the soils revealed a big heterogeneity. Because there is broad soil variability in the pastures, a high number of species are found. High number of gasses was found in different situations, as in poor soils and very rich soils, and in other groups. This diversity can be very useful in order to manage the pastures for the maintenance of local activity as goat grazing.

Importance of nurse logs as a substrate for the regeneration of pioneer tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Fallen tree trunks ('nurse logs') are important recruitment sites for trees in temperate forest, however nurse log use is seldom reported in tropical forests. We predicted that logs should be important for the regeneration of small-seeded tropical pioneer species because surface leaf litter and competition with established vegetation reduces the establishment success of these species from soil seed banks. In a survey oil Barre, Colorado Island, Panama, we found that pioneer seedlings were present oil logs in 40 of 95 recent treefall gaps. In gaps where seedlings were present oil logs, seedling density was not significantly different from adjacent areas of soil. However, species composition was significantly different: logs were disproportionately colonized by smaller-seeded and wind-dispersed species. In growing-house experiments using 1.2 species. we found that wood substrate had little effect: oil seed germination. In contrast, seedling growth was 50%, lower on decayed wood than soil. Furthermore, species growth rates on wood were not significantly correlated with growth rates in soil (df = 10, r = 0.48). If establishment on logs eventually leads to recruitment to the forest canopy, then logs may promote the maintenance of diversity by favouring a different group of species from those that recruit in Soil.

ABSENCE OF TREE SEEDS IMPEDES SHRUBLAND SUCCESSION IN SOUTHERN CHINA	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE												WANG J, ZOU C, REN H & DUAN WJ. 2009. Absence of tree seeds impedes shrubland succession in southern China. Change in landuse in southern China has resulted in the abandonment of over 40 million ha of degraded grazing pasture and cultivated farmland, which have consequently converted to shrubland. Shrubland has low economic value and provides limited ecosystem services but is now the dominant vegetation in three provinces of southern China. Effective management of such shrubland ecosystem requires improved understanding of many ecological factors, including sources of viable seeds in the soil seed bank and the interaction between the seed bank and the current vegetation. We investigated the soil seed bank in a shrubland using a seedling germination assay, and compared the species composition in the seed bank with vegetation community using Sorensen's coefficient. While total sced bank density in the shrubland was high, the Sorensen's coefficient and species richness in the soil seed hank were low. The soil seed bank was mainly dominated by grass and shrub Species; no pine or other indigenous tree seeds were detected. Our findings suggest that. the limited seed source of tree species is one of the primary factors slowing or stopping secondary succession in southern China. Direct planting of-tree seedlings may facilitate secondary succession in the severely degraded shrublands.

Seed banks cause elevated generation times and effective population sizes of Arabidopsis thaliana in northern Europe	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												It is commonly found that effective population sizes of natural populations are much smaller than census sizes of plants and animals. However, theoretical studies have shown that factors rarely investigated empirically, like seed banks in plants and diapause in animals, may have profound influence on effective sizes. Here we investigate whether the presence of seed banks can explain the relatively high genetic variability observed in northern European Arabidopsis thaliana populations with small census sizes. We have genotyped three above- and below- ground cohorts in 27 Norwegian populations using single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Although the populations varied extensively in levels of variability within and between cohorts, standard genetic population measures were comparable to those obtained in previous studies on above-ground cohorts using microsatellite markers. Estimated effective population sizes are larger for total populations (containing both seed bank and above-ground cohorts for 1 year) compared to each of the cohorts considered separately. Using a conservative approach, we find that the effective sizes are larger than census sizes of local populations, and that the effective generation time is higher than 1 year (3-4 years, on average), making A. thaliana a perennial semelparous plant at many northern European localities.

Current Status and Future Development of the Only Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic White-cedar) Population in Pennsylvania	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												We assessed the Current status and potential future development of the only Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) population in Pennsylvania (Spruce Flats Bog in Westmoreland County). We counted all stems, in the population and measured the diameter at breast height of all stems >= 1.4 m in height. Increment cores were collected and analyzed from 93 trees to quantify age distribution. We also evaluated relationships among cedar regeneration, microtopography, and other potentially competitive vegetation. Potential recruitment front the seed bank was assessed via the germination method using soil samples from 46 hummocks in the bog. The population consisted of 395 stems with stern size structure characterized by an "inverse-J" distribution; most steins (67%) were < 1.4 in in height. The oldest individuals were established in the 1940s, but recruitment has been steady since initial establishment. Hummock area and mean height above the water table were positively related to the abundance of C thyoides. No C. thyoides seeds, germinated from soil samples during a 14-month period, indicating that the bog's seed bank may have limited potential to contribute to recruitment. We suggest that this population has naturalized from plantings in the 1940s, with most recent recruitment having been vegetative. Because of previous extirpation of C. thyoides from Pennsylvania wetlands, the naturalization of this population has conservation value. Although the population size is probably limited by the number of microsites sufficiently high above the water table to avoid excessive inundation, direct management of this Population does not currently appear to be necessary in order to ensure its continued survival.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				JUL	2009	29	3					216	223		10.3375/043.029.0303							WOS:000269119700003

In situ characterization was conducted through interviews with the owners of the plants and environmental observations. Leaf or petal tissue as well as seed samples were collected for genetic characterization by single sequence repeats markers and for storage in germplasm banks, respectively. The plants were maintained in dooryards and used mainly for medical purposes. The genetic analysis showed no heterozygous plants at the loci tested (f = 1), indicating that reproduction occurs mainly through selfing. The total genetic diversity was high (H-e = 0.39); and a high level of differentiation was observed between cotton plants from the two states (F-ST = 0.36). Conventional methods of in situ maintenance of G. barbadense populations are not applicable. The conservation of the genetic variability of populations present in the two states could be achieved through germplasm collection and establishing of ex situ seed banks.

Soil type does not affect seed ageing when soil water potential and temperature are controlled	PLANT AND SOIL												To investigate the effects of soil type on seed persistence in a manner that controlled for location and climate variables, three weed species-Gomphocarpus physocarpus (swan plant), Avena sterilis ssp. ludoviciana (wild oat) and Ligustrum lucidum (broadleaf privet)-were buried for 21 months in three contrasting soils at a single location. Soil type had a significant effect on seed persistence and seedling vigour, but soil water content and temperature varied between soils due to differences in physical and chemical properties. Warmer, wetter conditions favoured shorter persistence. A laboratory-based test was developed to accelerate the rate of seed ageing within soils, using controlled superoptimal temperature and moisture conditions (the soil-specific accelerated ageing test, SSAAT). The SSAAT demonstrated that soil type per se did not influence seed longevity. Moreover, the order in which seeds aged was the same whether aged in the field or SSAAT, with L. lucidum being shortest-lived and A. sterilis being longest-lived of the three species.

Rapid Seed Bank Development in Restored Tidal Freshwater Wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Studies of seed bank development have rarely been included in evaluations of wetland restoration. We compared the seed bank of a recently restored tidal freshwater marsh in Washington, D.C., Kingman Marsh, with seed banks of another restored site (Kenilworth Marsh) and two reference marshes (Dueling Creek and Patuxent Marsh). The density and richness of emerging seedlings from Kingman Marsh seed bank samples increased from less than 4 seedlings and 2 taxa/90-cm(2) sample in 2000 (the year of restoration) to more than 130 seedlings and 10 taxa/90-cm(2) sample in 2003. The most important seed bank taxa at Kingman Marsh included Cyperus spp., Juncus spp., Lindernia dubia, Ludwigia palustris, and the non-native Lythrum salicaria. These taxa are not abundant in most mid-Atlantic tidal freshwater marshes but are almost identical to those described for a created tidal freshwater wetland in New Jersey. Seed banks of both the restored sites contained few seeds of several important species found at the reference sites. Flooding had a significant negative effect on emerging seedling density and taxa density, suggesting that slight decreases in soil elevation in restored wetlands will dramatically decrease recruitment from the seed bank. Because seed banks integrate processes affecting growth and reproduction of standing vegetation, we suggest that seed banks are a useful metric of wetland restoration success and urge that seed bank studies be incorporated into monitoring programs for restored wetlands.

J	Beckie, HJ; Reboud, X				Beckie, Hugh J.; Reboud, Xavier			Selecting for Weed Resistance: Herbicide Rotation and Mixture	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Herbicide rotations and mixtures are widely recommended to manage herbicide resistance. However, little research has quantified how these practices actually affect the selection of herbicide resistance in weeds. A 4-yr experiment was conducted in western Canada From 2004 to 2007 to examine the impact of herbicide rotation and mixture in selecting for acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor resistance in the annual broadleaf weed, field pennycress, co-occurring in wheat. Treatments consisted of the ALS-inhibitor herbicide, ethametsulfuron, applied in a Mixture with bromoxynil/MCPA formulated herbicide (photosystem-II inhibitor/synthetic auxin), or in rotation with the non-ALS inhibitor at an ALS-inhibitor application frequency of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% (i.e., zero to four applications, respectively) over the 4-yr period. The field pennycress seed batik at the start of the experiment contained 5% ethametsulfuron-resistant seed. Although weed control was only marginally reduced, resistance frequency of progeny of survivors increased markedly after one ALS-inhibitor application. At the end of the experiment, the level of resistance in the seed bank was buffered by susceptible seed, increasing from 29% of recruited seedlings after one application to 85% after four applications of the ALS inhibitor. The level of resistance in the seed bank for the mixture treatment after 4 yr remained similar to that of the nontreated (weedy) control or 0% ALS-inhibitor rotation frequency treatment. The results of this study demonstrate how rapidly ALS-inhibitor resistance can evolve as a consequence of repeated application of herbicides with this site of action, and supports epidemiological information from farmer questionnaire surveys and modeling Simulations that mixtures are more effective than rotations in mitigating resistance evolution through herbicide selection.

J	Xiao, DR; Zhang, LQ; Zhu, ZC				Xiao, Derong; Zhang, Liquan; Zhu, Zhenchang			A study on seed characteristics and seed bank of Spartina alterniflora at saltmarshes in the Yangtze Estuary, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Since Spartina alterniflora was introduced into the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve in 1995, there has been a rapid expansion of this species, seriously threatening the overall biodiversity. In this study, the seed production, germination characteristics and soil seed bank of S. aterniflora were studied at the nature reserve along an intertidal gradient where this invasive species distributed and spread. The results showed that the middle intertidal zone (MIT) had the largest seed production and higher viability than those of lower (LIT) and higher (HIT) intertidal zones. The differences in seed production among these sites were largely dependent on the higher percentage of fruiting culms, longer spike and higher seed number per spike. The differences in seed viability among these sampling sites seemed largely dependent on the higher seed weight at the site MIT. The chilling treatment (at low temperature and in moist conditions) could significantly enhance the germinability, of S. alterniflora seeds and shorten the time of onset seed germination. The seeds from the site MIT had much higher germinability than the sites LIT and HIT. The highest density of soil seed bank was recorded at the site of MIT, where had the highest seed production. By July, before there was any replenishment with fresh seeds from the current year, the soil seed bank was completely exhausted and the persistent time of soil seed bank for S. alterniflora was less than 9 months, which is in agreement with that of the transient seed bank. The results from this study indicated that the seed propagation could have an important attribution to the spreading of this invasive plant and the implications in terms of controlling and managing the invasion of S. alterniflora at the nature reserve were discussed.

Previous studies have primarily been conducted in the laboratory using a single water treatment. However, when this method is used, it is difficult to optimize the water conditions for the needs of the individual species of seeds. Additionally, the germination conditions for seedlings in the laboratory are different from those in nature. To avoid these issues, we conducted experiments to activate soil seed banks in the field using different water treatments. The results revealed that: (1) generally, the number of species and quantity of seedlings decrease gradually as the water supply decreases, but that for several species most seedlings did not appear when they were provided with the greatest amount of water, and (2) different species present different germination characteristics. According to the rate of seedling emergence, the species were classified into two germination types: fast and slow. In addition, each species also had a unique climax period of emergence, which was delayed with a decrease in water supply. Therefore, the amount of water provided is vital to seedling emergence, and various water treatments should be evaluated when studying the characteristics of different species in soil seed banks. For the lower reaches of the Tarim River, the optimal soil moisture for seedling emergence ranged from 23% to 28%, and seedling conservation should be strengthened during the climax period of emergence (9 15 days from the day when water became available). These results highlight the importance of the use of an optimal water treatment and demonstrate the danger of using a single treatment method. Our results also emphasize the need for a preliminary study prior to conducting studies to evaluate seed banks. (C) 2009 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Heliotropium europaeum only germinates following sufficient rainfall to allow reproduction	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Regions with Mediterranean climates are seasonally and and provide a niche for ephemeral species which germinate following discrete and variable rainfall during summer. These species must be able to detect when conditions are suitable for completion of their life cycle. Common heliotrope (Heliotropium europaeum) is one such species. It is considered a weed in its naturalised habitat in southern Australia as it uses resources that could be used by ensuing crops, and is toxic to livestock. We examined common heliotrope's germination responses to temperature and water potential, the effect of simulated rainfall on seedling emergence and plant growth in lysimeters. Fresh seeds of common heliotrope have relatively high optimum temperatures and water potentials for germination (around 35 degrees C and 0 MPa). Germination percentage of seeds extracted from the soil seed bank varies seasonally. In the soil types and climate of the study area, 24.2 mm is the minimum amount of rainfall resulting in emergence. Evapotranspiration required to reach minimal reproductive output was 19.4 mm. Common heliotrope's germination requirements have been selected to ensure that it will only germinate after sufficient rainfall to allow reproductive output. This is the mechanism through which common heliotrope detects its temporal niche. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of fire and environmental variables on plant structure and composition in grazed salt desert shrublands of the Great Basin (USA)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Fire in shrub-dominated portions of the Great Basin. largely fueled by non-native annuals such as Bromus tectorum, has become an important structuring force altering vegetation composition and soil characteristics. The extent to which fire affects native species in drier portions of the Great Basin, termed salt desert, is poorly documented. We conducted a survey of grazed salt desert habitat in northwestern Nevada 5 years after wildfires burned 650,000 ha, with the goal of investigating community response to fire and factors correlating with post-fire recovery. We found that recruitment of a dominant shrub, Artemisia spinescens, is severely restricted following fire: it occurred in only 2 of the 24 burned sites. The co-dominant shrub, Atriplex confertifolia, occurred in most burned sites although on average its percent cover was one-third lower than adjacent unburned sites. Biotic soil crust cover was four times lower, and non-native species cover 5 times higher, in burned sites compared to unburned. Ordination analyses confirmed differences among plant communities in burned versus unburned sites, with environmental variables soil conductivity, plant litter, soil potassium (K+) and pH explaining 38% of the variance in community composition. However, we found no environmental predictors of recovery for native species in burned sites. Future recruitment is likely to be further limited, as fire frequency in the salt desert is expected to increase with invasion by non-native annual grasses and with global climate change.

Traditional Amerindian cultivators combine directional and ideotypic selection for sustainable management of cassava genetic diversity	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Plant domestication provides striking examples of rapid evolution. Yet, it involves more complex processes than plain directional selection. Understanding the dynamics of diversity in traditional agroecosystems is both a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology and a practical goal in conservation. We studied how Amerindian cultivators maintain dynamically evolving gene pools in cassava. Farmers purposely maintain diversity in the form of phenotypically distinct, clonally propagated landraces. Landrace gene pools are continuously renewed by incorporating seedlings issued from spontaneous sexual reproduction. This poses two problems: agronomic quality may decrease because some seedlings are inbred, and landrace identity may be progressively lost through the incorporation of unrelated seedlings. Using a large microsatellite dataset, we show that farmers solve these problems by applying two kinds of selection: directional selection against inbred genotypes, and counter-selection of off-type phenotypes, which maintains high intra-landrace relatedness. Thus, cultural elements such as ideotypes (a representation of the ideal phenotype of a landrace) can shape genetic diversity.

Although a few stand-level studies have been conducted, a broad-scale study is needed to understand the general tendency of vegetation recovery and to obtain information for the management of such extensively distributed abandoned clearcut sites. This study is a province-level study that aims to interpret the patterns and factors in early-stage vegetation recovery at abandoned plantation clearcut sites. We also discuss the potential indicators that may determine whether a certain site recovers towards evergreen broad-leaved forest consisting of Castanopsis cuspidata and Quercus glauca or towards deciduous broad-leaved forest comprising Q. serrata and Q. acutissima. A cluster analysis revealed that five types of vegetation (evergreen trees, evergreen trees-deciduous pioneer shrubs, pioneer species, deciduous trees, and deciduous shrubs) were observed from an early stage of succession. The first two vegetation types were considered to recover successfully to the target vegetation of evergreen broad-leaved forest, but the remaining three vegetation types did not show any tendency to recover to the target vegetations. According to the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, a smaller size of the abandoned site with adjacent evergreen broad-leaved forest and a longer time after clearcutting were identified as factors that enhance the invasion of evergreen tree species; these factors are also useful to predict the future successional tendency. In conjunction with these factors, the existence of regeneration sources (i.e., stumps) that allow sprouting appeared to be an important indicator for predicting the early-stage vegetation recovery.																	1341-6979	1610-7403				JUN	2009	14	3					135	146		10.1007/s10310-009-0118-8							WOS:000266160200002

(Leguminosae) seeds at individual tree level	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												To demonstrate the seed dormancy and germination characters of Robinia pseudoacacia L., an exotic tall tree species in Japan, we applied scarification, cold stratification, diurnal thermal regime, heat shock, and/or winter weathering treatments to the seeds. These characters differed markedly among three seed sources (Trees K, B, and I). Scarification revealed that most seeds from Tree K showed physical dormancy, whereas those from Tree B had no physical dormancy. The seeds from Tree I showed weak physical dormancy so that the seeds eventually germinate without any treatments as time goes by. The physical dormancy in Tree K was broken by a long, high heat shock treatment. The results imply that seeds from Tree K respond to fire in natural conditions. Seeds from Tree I responded to a wide range of thermal regimes, except for long, high heat shock. In contrast, most seeds from Tree B absorbed water during cold stratification and some germinated. However, many seeds from Tree B died in the soil during the winter, presumably because of microbial and fungal infections. Seeds from Trees I and B acquired physical dormancy by weathering during the winter, implying that seedpods that remain in the crown function as an aerial seed bank. R. pseudoacacia may be able to produce various levels in dormancy with respect to the winter condition.																	1341-6979					JUN	2009	14	3					167	177		10.1007/s10310-009-0117-9							WOS:000266160200005

Stimulating a Great Lakes coastal wetland seed bank using portable cofferdams: implications for habitat rehabilitation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Coastal wetland seed banks exposed by low lake levels or through management actions fuel the reestablishment of emergent plant assemblages (i.e., wetland habitat) critical to Great Lakes aquatic biota. This project explored the effectiveness of using portable, water-filled cofferdams as a management tool to promote the natural growth of emergent vegetation from the seed bank in a Lake Erie coastal wetland. A series of dams stretching approximately 450 m was installed temporarily to isolate hydrologically a 10-ha corner of the Crane Creek wetland complex from Lake Erie. The test area was dewatered in 2004 to mimic a low-water year, and vegetation sampling characterized the wetland seed bank response at low, middle, and high elevations in areas open to and protected from bird and mammal herbivory. The nearly two-month drawdown stimulated a rapid seed-bank-driven response by 45 plant taxa. Herbivory had little effect on plant species richness, regardless of the location along an elevation gradient. Inundation contributed to the replacement of immature emergent plant species with submersed aquatic species after the dams failed and were removed prematurely. This study revealed a number of important issues that must be considered for effective long-term implementation of portable cofferdam technology to stimulate wetland seed banks, including duration of dewatering, product size, source of clean water, replacement of damaged dams, and regular maintenance. This technology is a potentially important tool in the arsenal used by resource managers seeking to rehabilitate the functions and values of Great Lakes coastal wetland habitats.

J	Gioria, M; Osborne, B				Gioria, Margherita; Osborne, Bruce			Assessing the impact of plant invasions on soil seed bank communities: use of univariate and multivariate statistical approaches	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Are soil seed banks affected by invasions of alien plants? How can we rigorously assess alterations in seed bank communities associated with invasive species and account for the high spatial variability of seed bank data? How do multivariate approaches compare with more traditional approaches based on analysis of variance? Three riparian sites, Ireland. A protocol based on a combination of multivariate techniques was used to characterize soil seed bank communities associated with the herbaceous invasive species Heracleum mantegazzianum in May and October. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test the effects of the factors "invasion", "site", "plot" and "depth" on the soil seed bank, while multivariate analysis of dispersion (PERMDISP) provided a measure of the variability of seed bank data at different spatial scales. Similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER) was used to identify the species that contributed most to the differences between invaded and uninvaded communities. A comparison between the results of PERMANOVA and ANOVA analyses was also made. The composition of seed bank communities invaded by H. mantegazzianum differed significantly from that of uninvaded seed banks. Invaded seed banks were less diverse and had reduced abundance, and were dominated by only a few species, such as Urtica dioica and Juncus effusus. Such patterns were recorded at each of three depth categories, indicating that invasive plants can affect both the transient and the more persistent component of the soil seed bank. Seed bank variability was significantly higher within uninvaded areas, supporting the notion that invasions tend to lead to more homogeneous communities. The analytical protocol used in this study was effective in quantifying the effect of plant invasions, at different spatial scales, providing a statistically robust analysis of alterations in soil seed bank communities. Compared to ANOVA, this protocol provided more biological information and was more appropriate for analysis of the data. This approach is therefore recommended in soil seed bank and invasion ecological studies.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Habitat fragmentation is considered a leading cause of plant extinction, and matrix models provide a powerful set of tools with which to identifying mechanisms that influence population declines. We surveyed the ecological literature to determine what components of plant demography have been studied in fragmented habitats, and determined the elasticity values of the vital rates influenced by these components. We found that there is a major disparity between the ecological processes and stages of life history with large demographic impacts and the focus of empirical research on plants in fragmented habitats. While the growth and survivorship of large, established individuals have the highest elasticity values, the focus of empirical research has been on components of reproduction and seedling dynamics. We argue that elucidating the demographic mechanisms underlying population declines in fragmented habitats, and developing strategies for mitigating these declines, will be challenging without a greater focus on understanding how fragmentation alters adult plant growth and survivorship.

We analysed genetic differentiation and flowering time variation of two floral variants of Capsella bursa-pastoris, the Spe variant and the wild-type, which occur sympatrically in a vineyard in southwest Germany. The Spe variant is characterized by an additional whorl of stamens instead of petals and was formerly classified as an independent taxon 'Capsella apetala' Opiz. Amplified fragment length polymorphism and allozyme analysis revealed a substantial genetic differentiation of the two floral variants and a higher genetic variation within the wild-type subpopulation compared with the Spe subpopulation. The low genetic variation in the mutant provided evidence of a recent local origin or recent introduction. Flowering time analysis indicated that, within the analysed population, the Spe variant flowers significantly later than the wild-type (P < 0.001). We conclude that the evolution and persistence of Spe within a wild-type population is facilitated by high selfing rates and been enhanced by a shift in flowering phenology. Hence, our data provide substantial evidence that the Spe phenotype has established itself as an isolated entity within a wild-type population and may thus serve as a model for the analysis of the evolutionary significance of homeotic mutants in wild populations.

J	Middleton, BA				Middleton, Beth A.			Regeneration potential of Taxodium distichum swamps and climate change	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seed bank densities respond to factors across local to landscape scales, and therefore, knowledge of these responses may be necessary in forecasting the effects of climate change on the regeneration of species. This study relates the seed bank densities of species of Taxodium distichum swamps to local water regime and regional climate factors at five latitudes across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley from southern Illinois to Louisiana. In an outdoor nursery setting, the seed banks of twenty-five swamps were exposed to non-flooded (freely drained) or flooded treatments, and the number and species of seeds germinating were recorded from each swamp during one growing season. Based on ANOVA analysis, the majority of dominant species had a higher rate of germination in non-flooded versus flooded treatments. Similarly, an NMS comparison, which considered the local water regime and regional climate of the swamps, found that the species of seeds germinating, almost completely shifted under non-flooded versus flooded treatments. For example, in wetter northern swamps, seeds of Taxodium distichum germinated in non-flooded conditions, but did not germinate from the same seed banks in flooded conditions. In wetter southern swamps, seeds of Eleocharis cellulosa germinated in flooded conditions, but did not germinate in non-flooded conditions. The strong relationship of seed germination and density relationships with local water regime and regional climate variables suggests that the forecasting of climate change effects on swamps and other wetlands needs to consider a variety of interrelated variables to make adequate projections of the regeneration responses of species to climate change. Because regeneration is an important aspect of species maintenance and restoration, climate drying could influence the species distribution of these swamps in the future.

A comparison of seed banks across a sand dune successional gradient at Lake Michigan dunes (Indiana, USA)	PLANT ECOLOGY												In habitats where disturbance is frequent, seed banks are important for the regeneration of vegetation. Sand dune systems are dynamic habitats in which sand movement provides intermittent disturbance. As succession proceeds from bare sand to forest, the disturbance decreases. At Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, we examined the seed banks of three habitat types across a successional gradient: foredunes, secondary dunes, and oak savanna. There were differences among the types of species that germinated from each of the habitats. The mean seed bank density increased across the successional gradient by habitat, from 376 to 433 to 968 seeds m(-2), but with foredune and secondary dune seed bank densities being significantly lower than the savanna seed bank density. The number of seeds germinated was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, demonstrating for this primary successional sequence that seed density increases with stage and age. The seed bank had much lower species richness than that of the aboveground vegetation across all habitats. Among sites within a habitat type, the similarity of species germinated from the seed banks was very low, illustrating the variability of the seed bank even in similar habitat types. These results suggest that restoration of these habitats cannot rely on seed banks alone.																	1385-0237					JUN	2009	202	2					299	308		10.1007/s11258-008-9484-0							WOS:000265826700009

Impacts of alien plant invasions on species richness in Mediterranean-type ecosystems: a meta-analysis	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Besides a general consensus regarding the negative impact of invasive alien species in the literature, only recently has the decline of native species attributable to biological invasions begun to be quantified in many parts of the world. The cause-effect relationship between the establishment and proliferation of alien species and the extinction of native species is, however, seldom demonstrated. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) to examine: (1) whether invasion of alien plant species indeed causes a reduction in the number of native plant species at different spatial and temporal scales; (2) which growth forms, habitat types and areas are most affected by invasions; and (3) which taxa are most responsible for native species richness declines. Our results confirm a significant decline in native species richness attributable to alien invasions. Studies conducted at small scales or sampled over long periods reveal stronger impacts of alien invasion than those at large spatial scales and over short periods. Alien species from regions with similar climates have much stronger impacts, with the native species richness in South Africa and Australia declining significantly more post-invasion than for European sites. Australian Acacia species in South Africa accounted for the most significant declines in native species richness. Among the different growth forms of alien plants, annual herbs, trees and creepers had the greatest impact, whereas graminoids generally caused insignificant changes to the native community. Native species richness of shrublands, old fields and dune vegetation showed significant declines, in contrast to insignificant declines for forest habitats.

O.; Insausti, Pedro			Soil moisture conditions affect the sensitivity of Bromus catharticus dormant seeds to light and the emergence pattern of seedlings	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The soil moisture regime may affect dormancy of seeds and their sensitivity to signals that promote germination. We studied the effect of moisture regime on the sensitivity to light of dormant Bromus catharticus seeds, and on the emergence pattern of seedlings. Seeds were incubated under continuously hydrated, continuously dehydrated, or fluctuating moisture regimes in a controlled environment (25 degrees C, darkness) for 2 months. After moisture treatments, seeds were exposed to red or far-red light pulses, or to darkness, to determine germinability. In addition, grassland mesocosms with intact seed bank and vegetation were irrigated or subjected to a drought regime in a glasshouse at summer temperatures. After 2 months, the temperature was reduced to correspond to grassland temperatures in autumn; the canopy was removed and half of the mesocosms were covered with filters that exclude red light. Density of B. catharticus seedlings was evaluated after 2 weeks. Dormancy decreased in continuously hydrated seeds but they still required red light for germination. In contrast, an important fraction of seeds that experienced continuously dehydrated or fluctuating moisture regimes germinated in darkness or after far-red light pulses. In the mesocosms that had experienced a soil drought, a higher density of seedlings emerged in the absence of red light than in the daily irrigated mesocosms. This indicates that a fraction of B. catharticus seeds acquired the capability to germinate under the canopy, especially in the drought moisture regime. Results indicate that the soil moisture environment experienced during dormancy affects the sensitivity to light of B. catharticus seeds, as well as the emergence pattern of seedlings.																	0960-2585					JUN	2009	19	2					81	89		10.1017/S0960258509301087							WOS:000266216800003

Forest seed banks along an intensity gradient of ancient agriculture	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Recently, forest seed banks were proven to not only reflect former (decades-old) but also ancient (centuries-old) land use. Yet, as land-use intensity determines the magnitude of seed-bank changes in recent forests, this study aims to identify whether an ancient land-use gradient would also be reflected in the seed bank. On a forested 1600-year-old archaeological site, five different land-use intensities were mapped and sampled. Apart from seed density, species richness and composition, functional seed-bank types, defined by nine seed-bank-related plant traits, were related to the land-use intensity gradient. The land-use gradient from gardens to undisturbed sites was still clearly reflected in the soil seed bank. Six emergent functional seed-bank types, characterized by specific plant traits, changed significantly in abundance, parallel to the land-use gradient. In particular, dispersal agent (and related traits) proved an important explanatory trait of present (functional) seed-bank patterns. Poor dispersers (large and heavy seeds) were not found in the intensively used areas, contrary to animal-dispersed species. Wind-dispersers may have been inhibited in the extension of their distribution by recruitment bottlenecks (low seed production) and/or competitive exclusion. Additionally, the agricultural land-use probably introduced ruderal species into the seed bank of the most intensively used areas, yielding a simultaneous increase in vegetation-seed-bank dissimilarity with land-use intensity, eliminating present vegetation as a driver behind the differences over the seed-bank gradient. We conclude by arguing how coppice-with-standards management possibly maintained the seed-bank gradient.

Impact of cropping systems on the weed seed banks in the northern Great Plains, USA	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Very little research has been done on weed seedbank communities in the northern Great Plains region of the USA. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of management systems on the weed seed banks and to assess the relationship between the weed seed banks and the above-ground weed communities. The seed banks were sampled along a range of areas of above-ground weed diversity in organic and conventional spring wheat production fields near Big Sandy, Montana, over 2 years. Eight 1 m x 0.33 m areas were selected in each field to encompass a wide range of above-ground weed diversity and soil cores were taken in each area to a depth of 20 cm and split in half at 10 cm. The number of seeds recovered from the top 10 cm of soil and the 10-20 cm depth were significantly affected by the sampling year and an interaction between the cropping system and the sampling year. The year was the only significant predictor affecting the weed seedbank diversity at both depths. A significant interaction between the management system and the year observed at the 10-20 cm sampling depth reflected the higher rate of decrease in diversity occurring between 2005 and 2006 in the conventionally managed fields compared with the organic fields. A multivariate ordination indicated that, although the year played a significant role in determining the weed seedbank communities, the management system had a role only during 2006. We failed to detect strong correlations between the above-ground and underground weed communities. The results of this study suggest that, in the studied region, yearly fluctuations in environmental factors have significant impacts on the weed seed banks.																	1444-6162	1445-6664				JUN	2009	9	2					160	168		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2009.00334.x							WOS:000266074000009

One of the most successful invasive species is Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass), which is having marked impacts on native plant communities and ecosystem processes. However; we know little about the effects of this invasion on native animal species in the Intermountain West. Because ants have been used to detect ecological change associated with anthropogenic land use, they seem well suited for a preliminary evaluation of the consequences of cheatgrass-driven habitat conversion. In our study, we used pitfall traps to assess ant community assemblages in intact sagebrush and nearby cheatgrass-dominated vegetation. Ant abundance was about 10-fold greater in cheatgrass-dominated plots than in sagebrush Plots. We also noted differences in diversity and evenness between habitat types at both the species and the functional-group levels of organization. At the species level, Shannon's diversity index was greater in sagebrush plots than in cheatgrass-dominated Plots. However, at the functional-group level, Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices and the Brillouin evenness index were greater in cheatgrass-dominated plots than in sagebrush plots. Further, common species/functional groups tended to be more abundant while less common species/functional groups tended to be less abundant in cheatgrass-dominated plots compared to intact sagebrush plots. Patterns appear to be at least partially related to resource availabilities. This initial survey of ant communities front intact-native and altered vegetation types may be indicative of similar trends of biodiversity shifts throughout the Intermountain West where cheatgrass has successfully replaced native species. We also discuss the implications of ant communities on land management activities, specifically in the context of aridland restoration.

Using a 14-year data set, we evaluated the relative influence of 38 biotic and abiotic factors on annual aboveground biomass of an intermediate coastal marsh on the upper Gulf Coast of Texas. We used visual obstruction (VO) measurements as a surrogate variable in a prediction model to estimate available aboveground biomass in the marsh. Available biomass was greatest (3.34 kg/m(2)) when sampling site was flooded. Plant growth form, type of animal present, and composition of the ground cover influenced biomass of the marsh. Presence of insects was related to biomass (regression beta weight = 0.28), uniquely accounting for 7.6% of the incremental variance in biomass. The presence of moderate amounts of litter was also related to available biomass (beta weight = 0.86). Soil capping had little or no influence on aboveground biomass. Implementing standard protocols for long-term vegetation monitoring can be cost and time intensive. Our results suggest quantitative measurement of VO and qualitative observation of few variables (standing water, insects, and litter) measured annually can yield a reasonable assessment of aboveground biomass of intermediate coastal marshes.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2009	29	2					690	696		10.1672/06-176.1							WOS:000268987300026

IMPACT OF MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER EFFLUENT ON SEED BANK RESPONSE AND SOILS EXCAVATED FROM A WETLAND IMPOUNDMENT	WETLANDS												Intensive management of wetlands to improve wildlife habitat typically includes the manipulation of water depth, duration, and timing to promote desired vegetation communities. Increased societal, industrial, and agricultural demands for water may encourage the use of alternative sources such as wastewater effluents in managed wetlands. However, water quality is commonly overlooked as an influence on wetland soil seed banks and soils. In four separate greenhouse trials conducted over a 2-yr period, we examined the effects of municipal wastewater effluent (WWE) on vegetation of wetland seed banks and soils excavated from a wildlife management area in Missouri, USA. We used microcosms filled with one of two soil materials and irrigated with WWE, Missouri River water, or deionized water to simulate moist-soil conditions. Vegetation that germinated from the soil seed bank was allowed to grow in microcosms for approximately 100 d. Vegetative taxa richness, plant density, and biomass were significantly reduced in WWE-irrigated soil materials compared with other water sources. Salinity and sodicity rapidly increased in WWE-irrigated microcosms and probably was responsible for inhibiting germination or interfering with seedling development. Our results indicate that irrigation with WWE promoted saline-sodic soil conditions, which alters the vegetation community by inhibiting germination or seedling development.																	0277-5212					JUN	2009	29	2					713	723		10.1672/08-58.1							WOS:000268987300029

However, studies to date have often failed to detect costs of reproduction, with survival costs among the less documented. We investigated the cost of reproduction in Helianthemum squamatum (Cistaceae), a short-lived perennial of semiarid Mediterranean environments. After experimental flower removal, we evaluated next season's growth, reproduction, and survival of the plants. We also monitored an indicator of plant physiological status (F(v)/F(m)) and leaf nutrient concentration at key phenological stages during reproduction. Survival rate in deblossomed plants was significantly higher than in control plants. As far as we know, this is the first experimental evidence of a survival cost of reproduction in a perennial plant. In contrast, no cost to growth or reproduction was found during the next season, and no significant differences in F(v)/F(m) or leaf nutrients were found between control and deblosomed plants. Helianthemum squamatum's success in semiarid Mediterranean ecosystems seems to rely on a persistent seed bank, combined with a sustained high reproductive output at the expense of survival. We conclude that this strategy might be more common than previously thought among short-lived shrubby plants growing in stressful Mediterranean areas.

Charophyte oospores represented almost 72% of the sexual propagules ill the sediment with a mean oospore density of 31,306 oospores m(-2). This was followed by the seeds of the intertidal salt marsh plant Sarcocornia perennis (18%) (7929 seed m(-2)) and the submerged angiosperm Ruppia cirrhosa (7%) (2852 seeds m(-2)). The remaining 3% was made Up of a mixture of species Such as Salicornia meyeriana, Sporobolus virginicus, Stukenia pectinata, Bolboschoenus maritimus and terrestrial species. Although seed density did not differ significantly with depth, seeds Still occurred at 20 cm depth providing a regeneration Source in tile event of sediment disturbance. Three salinity (0, 17 and 35 PSU) and moisture treatments (exposed, waterlogged and submerged) were applied to collected sediment to determine how fast species Would germinate. S. perennis germinated after 3 d to a maximum of 82%. Submerged species began to germinate only after 18 d (Chara vulgaris and R. cirrhosa) and had low germination percentages of between 11 and 15% after 91 d. Results from this Study indicate that in tile event of unpredictable disturbance events such as water level fluctuations, large sediment seed reserves would ensure habitat persistence.

Ellen			Effects of Contemporary Winter Seismic Exploration on Low Arctic Plant Communities and Permafrost	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We studied effects of oil and gas exploration, using the most recent seismic exploration technologies, on tundra plant communities and soils in four vegetation types in the Low Arctic of western Canada, two to three years post-disturbance. For all four vegetation types, seismic lines had less vascular plant cover and more bare ground than adjacent "reference" tundra. For the two upland tundra vegetation types, mosses and lichens were less abundant on seismic lines than in reference plots. There were no apparent differences in organic layer thickness between seismic lines and reference areas, but active layer depth (at the time of sampling) was significantly greater on seismic lines for the upland tundra and one of the wed and vegetation types. Diversity and richness were lower, and community composition was different, on seismic lines (as compared to reference plots) in upland tundra vegetation types but not in wetland types. The results suggest that (I) upland vegetation types are less resistant to seismic disturbance, (2) active layer depth increases following seismic disturbance, and (3) impacts from modern seismic techniques in upland tundra are similar to. or somewhat greater than, the initial impacts observed from the earliest phases of winter exploration similar to 30 years ago.																	1523-0430					MAY	2009	41	2					228	237		10.1657/1938-4246-41.2.228							WOS:000266252900009

Alejandro			Flooding and grazing promote germination and seedling establishment in the perennial grass Paspalum dilatatum	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Seed germination and seedling emergence are key processes for population recruitment. Flooding and grazing are disturbances forming gaps that may strongly influence recruitment patterns in space and time, but their combined effects and action mechanisms have rarely been addressed. In this study we analysed the effects of microhabitat conditions associated with winter flooding and spring-summer defoliation on seed germination and seedling establishment of Paspalum dilatatum, a dominant perennial C(4) grass in native grasslands of the Flooding Pampa, Argentina. The dynamics of seedling emergence from natural seed banks and buried seeds was studied in a factorial experiment with flooding and defoliation treatments applied to soil monoliths (mesocosms) collected from natural grassland. Additional laboratory experiments were applied to investigate seed germination under different combinations of temperature, light quality and simulated flooding. Seed germination and seedling emergence of P. dilatatum were promoted by flooding and high intensity defoliation. Gaps generated by flooding were maintained by high intensity defoliation exercising a synergistic effect on survival seedlings. Flooding resulted in the breaking of seed dormancy and higher germination rates associated with alternating temperature and the activation of the phytochrome system.

Five sites along an elevational gradient were chosen, one in each of the main zones (mudflat, Scirpus monoculture, Scirpus-Spartina mixture, Spartina monoculture and Spartina-Phragmites mixture). Three surveys were performed just after seed rain, before germination and after germination, respectively During the period of November 2005 to May 2006, soil seed density of Scirpus mariqueter declined by 36%, and that of Spartina alterniflora by 58%. The spatial distributions of their seed banks were also different. Soil seed density of Scirpus mariqueter was not determined directly by seed production, but positively correlated with total aboveground biomass of the whole plant community. On the contrary, soil seed density of Spartina alterniflora just after seed rain (November) was significantly correlated with seed production, but had a poor relationship with the community's aboveground biomass. Our results indicated that other factors such as tidal movement might have had great influence on dispersal of Scirpus mariqueter, which would also affect its population dynamics. The understanding of this process can help us improve the conservation and restoration efforts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lindner, A				Lindner, Andre			A rapid assessment approach on soil seed banks of Atlantic forest sites with different disturbance history in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study represents a rapid assessment approach on the composition of soil seed banks in the Atlantic rainforest in Brazil and therefore marks a tool for the fast estimation of one important aspect of the regeneration ability of forest sites with different disturbance histories. The project was carried out in a private reserve in the state of Rio de Janeiro, where research plots were established in three different forest sites: in continuous forest where selective logging took place, in forest regrowth after complete cutdown about 60 years ago and in a forest fragment. Additionally data from another forest remnant in this region were added to compare especially the results concerning the influence of fragmentation processes on soil seed bank structure. With remarkably less sampling effort compared to germination experiments the sieving method is resulting in a fast gain of information on this particular topic which still is comparable to already published results. Every investigation site in our study differs considerably in soil seed bank composition concerning their disturbance history. Furthermore coherences between canopy structure and the density of small-sized seeds in the soil, as well as edge effects within the forest fragments were observed. We recognised a higher amount of small seeds under more open canopy conditions in general and discovered trends of higher species richness near the forest boundary in the forest fragments. This rapid assessment approach might be an easy to handle tool and a practical alternative to more extensive germination experiments for upcoming investigations on the regeneration capability in highly fragmented and disturbed landscapes like the Atlantic rainforest.

J	Brys, R; Jacquemyn, H				Brys, Rein; Jacquemyn, Hans			Biological Flora of the British Isles: Primula veris L.	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Primula veris that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and diseases, history and conservation. Primula veris is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte, mostly found in well-drained, herb-rich meadows and grasslands, in scrub or woodland rides and edges, and on calcareous cliffs. It occurs on base-rich loams or clays, on limestone, and sometimes in dunes. Native to the British Isles, it is characteristic of many mesotrophic and calcicolous lowland grassland communities, but it also extends into upland valleys in northern England and Scotland. In Ireland it is also native and most abundant in the central plain. Primula veris occurs throughout the temperate areas of Europe as far east as the Russian border. Primula veris is a shade-intolerant species that shows reduced performance and flowering under shade or increased competition. The species is not able to penetrate anoxic soil layers and is therefore mostly absent from locations that are characterized by a high water table. It has a well-developed drought tolerance. Primula veris is an obligate outbreeder which entirely depends on foraging insects for successful pollination. Although the species shows heterostyly, with two reciprocal morphs (pin and thrum), only relatively low levels of intermorph pollination have been reported. Seed dispersal is restricted to a few centimetres from maternal plants, whereas pollen flow is wider, but still limited to a few metres from parental plants. Both are factors that contribute to a significantly fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood size. At several locations throughout the British Isles, P. veris occurs together with P. elatior and especially P. vulgaris. The hybrid P. veris x P. vulgaris = P. x polyantha occurs frequently in mixed populations, whereas the hybrid P. veris x P. elatior = P. x media has been rarely reported in Britain. Although P. veris is still a widespread grassland herb, it is less abundant in the British Isles and continental Europe than before. This decline can be attributed to changes in land-use practices, such as the loss of traditional hay-meadow management, the loss of grazing and an increase of ploughing, in combination with ongoing destruction and nutrient enrichment of permanent grasslands. However, from 1980 onwards the species has increased substantially in many areas of the UK, largely because its seeds are included in wildflower seed-mixtures that are sown on new or upgraded road and motorway verges, embankments and urban conservation areas.

Seeds were collected from 54 soil samples taken under three sleeping sites and adjoining control sites. at three positions according to a fixed grid and at three different depths (0-2, 2-4 and 4-6 cm). Despite large differences between the three sites, defecation areas (latrines) were found to contain more seeds and higher sued diversity than control areas. Seed density decreased with depth ill the top 6 cm ill two sites but not ill the third. Shannon diversity decreased with depth in both defecation and control areas. Differences in the distribution of seeds of different species were found according to size and growth habits (pioneer vs non-pioneer species). The viability of seeds, ascertained from toughness and integrity of the seed coal, varied according to depth, site and defecation. Seed viability was oil average higher in defecation areas compared with control areas.

These metabolites could inhibit seed germination or germ tube elongation, so preventing attachment to the host plant, or, conversely, stimulate seed germination in the absence of the host, contributing to a reduction in the parasite seed bank. Some of the fungal metabolites assayed were very active even at very low concentrations, such as some macrocyclic trichothecenes, which at 0.1 mu m strongly suppressed the germination of Orobonche romosa L. seeds. Interesting results were also obtained with some novel toxins, such as phyllostictine A, highly active in reducing germ tube elongation and seed germination both of O. ramosa and of Cuscuta campestris Yuncker. Among the amino acids tested, methionine and arginine were particularly interesting, as they were able to suppress seed germination at concentrations lower than 1 mM. Some of the fungal metabolites tested were also able to stimulate the germination of O. ramosa seeds. The major findings in this research field are described and discussed.

The evaluation was carried out in 12 plots of 10 x 10 m systematically distributed in each area. Four subplots of 0.5 m x 0.5 m were randomly distributed in each plot. Two subplots were used to evaluate the seed bank in the litter and two in the soil sample at the 0 - 5 cm depth. The sampling was accomplished in September 2001 in the natural forest remainders and in the eucalyptus plantation and, in September 2002, in the reforested areas. The soil and the litter were conditioned in plastic pots, and incubated with periodic irrigations for the seed germination during seven months, in two greenhouse environment conditions: one at 100% sunlight and the other, under a screen that provides a 70% sunlight reduction. In the composition of all sample area seed banks, there was a predomination of pioneer species at the early successional stages. The most important arboreal species were Aloysia virgata and Cecropia hololeuca. The reforestation with native species provided a seed bank with a greater diversity of native arboreal species than the eucalyptus plantation. The present study indicates that the similarity between the planted and natural forest should be enhanced over the time.

Laurence M.; Edwards-Jones, Gareth			Can soil seed banks contribute to the restoration of dune slacks under conservation management?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Does the soil seed bank resemble the former early successional stages of a dune slack system more than the established later successional vegetation? Does it have the potential to contribute to the conservation of a highly endangered habitat? Location: Dune slacks at Newborough Warren, UK. Methods: The composition of the soil seed bank in two depth layers was determined using the seedling emergence method between March 2004 and April 2005. Long-term monitoring data on the floristic composition of the established vegetation were obtained from the national conservation agency, and additional monitoring was undertaken in 2003. Floristic composition, seed weights, seed longevity of component species and Ellenberg indicator values were used to compare the seed bank and established vegetation. Results: The soil seed bank was diverse and contained typical dune slack species, species of early successional stages and species of conservation interest. A comparison between the composition of the seed bank and historical data on the composition of the established vegetation showed that the seed bank reflects earlier successional stages more closely than the current aboveground vegetation. This study increases the scarce information currently available on the seed bank ecology of several species, including two orchid species. Conclusions: The soil seed bank can be expected to contribute to vegetation change after disturbance. Stimulation of germination from the seed bank through management may contribute to the conservation of both characteristic and threatened species typical of dune slacks.

J	Koocheki, A; Nassiri, M; Alimoradi, L; Ghorbani, R				Koocheki, Alireza; Nassiri, Mehdi; Alimoradi, Leila; Ghorbani, Reza			Effect of cropping systems and crop rotations on weeds	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Dynamics of weed populations in arable fields are influenced by environmental and soil characteristics and also by cropping system and management practices. Manipulation of cropping systems to improve weed management requires a better understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of weeds, seed losses and seed production. To assess the effect of different cropping systems and various crop rotations on the weed population and seed bank, we conducted a field study at the experimental farm in Khorasan Agricultural Research Center, Mashhad, Iran. The experimental design was a split plot with 3 crop rotations as the main plots, and five cropping systems consisting of high-input, medium-input, low-input, organic and integrated systems applied to the sub-plots. Our results show that weed seed densities in organic and integrated cropping systems, of about 5000-6000 seeds/m(2) were higher than conventional and high-input cropping systems showing about 2000 seeds/m(2). Weed seed density in continuous winter wheat of approximately 6300 seeds/m(2) was higher than other rotations with about 5000 seeds/m(2). Weed composition in the high-input system was 11 species with 66 plants/m(2). Whereas in the low-input and organic systems, the weed populations were 15 and 13 species with 145 and 220 plants/m(2), respectively. Changes in weed seed bank density and species composition often occur when crop management practices and crop rotations are altered. For example, continuous winter wheat fields showed more annual grass weeds, but broadleaf weeds were more abundant in sugar beet-winter wheat rotation. The weed population in continuous winter wheat plots comprised 90% grass and sedge weeds, while in sugar beet-wheat rotation, it was only 43% of total weed density. Broadleaf weeds were 55.2% in sugar beet-winter wheat but 9.4% of total weed density in continuous winter wheat. Different rotations that include crops with different life cycles such as winter wheat-maize and winter wheat-sugar beet could lead to additional benefits of reducing the weed seed bank.

Modes of Crown Vetch Invasion and Persistence	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Plant invasions have been hypothesized to proceed at the local scale (i.e., individual patch or stand) according to one of several distinct spatial patterns. However, few studies have attempted to reconstruct the patterns of perennial herbaceous plant invasions at local scales due to difficulty in determining the age of individuals. We used herb chronology to determine the ages of roots within several crown vetch patches in order to characterize the spatial age structure of these patches. Additionally, we examined both sexual and vegetative crown vetch reproduction, with regard to potential impacts on local spread and persistence, through seed bank sampling and greenhouse experiments. We found little distinct spatial age structuring in crown vetch patches, perhaps due to a lack of older roots caused by rapid ramet turnover within patches. We also found no support for the hypothesis, proposed by several land managers, that crown vetch builds up a large seed bank. However, we did find that even small fragments of crown vetch plants are capable of vegetative regeneration, which may be important in explaining this species' persistence in spite of control measures.

Long-Term Persistence of Pioneer Species in Tropical Rain Forest Soil Seed Banks	AMERICAN NATURALIST												In tropical forests, pioneer tree species regenerate from seeds dispersed directly into canopy gaps and from seeds that persisted in soil seed banks before gap formation. Life-history models have suggested that selection for the long-term persistence of tree seeds in the soil should be weak because persistence potentially reduces population growth rate by extending generation time and because adult life spans may exceed the return interval of favorable recruitment sites. Here we use accelerator mass spectrometry to carbon-date seeds of three pioneer tree species extracted from undisturbed seed banks in seasonally moist lowland Neotropical forest. We show that seeds of Croton billbergianus, Trema micrantha, and Zanthoxylum ekmannii germinate successfully from surface soil microsites after 38, 31, and 18 years, respectively. Decades-long persistence may be common in large-seeded tropical pioneers and appears to be unrelated to specific regeneration requirements.																	0003-0147					APR	2009	173	4					531	535		10.1086/597221							WOS:000263937300013	19228112					
J	Williams, PR				Williams, Paul R.			Contrasting demographics of tropical savanna and temperate forest eucalypts provide insight into how savannas and forests function. A case study using Corymbia clarksoniana from north-eastern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp. and Corymbia spp.) dominate many communities across Australia, including frequently burnt tropical savannas and temperate forests, which receive less frequent but more intense fires. Understanding the demographic characteristics that allow related trees to persist in tropical savannas and temperate forest ecosystems can provide insight into how savannas and forests function, including grass-tree coexistence. This study reviews differences in critical stages in the life cycle of savanna and temperate forest eucalypts, especially in relation to fire. It adds to the limited data on tropical eucalypts, by evaluating the effect of fire regimes on the population biology of Corymbia clarksoniana, a tree that dominates some tropical savannas of north-eastern Australia. Corymbia clarksoniana displays similar demographic characteristics to other tropical savanna species, except that seedling emergence is enhanced when seed falls onto recently burnt ground during a high rainfall period. In contrast to many temperate forest eucalypts, tropical savanna eucalypts lack canopy-stored seed banks; time annual seed fall to coincide with the onset of predictable wet season rain; have very rare seedling emergence events, including a lack of mass germination after each fire; possess an abundant sapling bank; and every tropical eucalypt species has the ability to maintain canopy structure by epicormically resprouting after all but the most intense fires. The combination of poor seedling recruitment strategies, coupled with characteristics allowing long-term persistence of established plants, indicate tropical savanna eucalypts function through the persistence niche rather than the regeneration niche. The high rainfall-promoted seedling emergence of C. clarksoniana and the reduction of seedling survival and sapling growth by fire, support the predictions that grass-tree coexistence in savannas is governed by rainfall limiting tree seedling recruitment and regular fires limiting the growth of juvenile trees to the canopy.																	1442-9985					APR	2009	34	2					120	131		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01888.x							WOS:000264306300001

Dane			Lantana (Lantana camara) Seed Bank Dynamics: Seedling Emergence and Seed Survival	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Seed persistence is poorly quantified for invasive plants of subtropical and tropical environments and Lantana camara, one of the world's worst weeds, is no exception. We investigated germination, seedling emergence, and seed survival of two lantana biotypes (Pink and pink-edged red [PER]) in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Controlled experiments were undertaken in 2002 and repeated in 2004, with treatments comprising two differing environmental regimes (irrigated and natural rainfall) and sowing depths (0 and 2 cm). Seed survival and seedling emergence were significantly affected by all factors (time, biotype, environment, sowing depth, and cohort) (P < 0.001). Seed dormancy varied with treatment (environment, sowing depth, biotype, and cohort) (P < 0.001), but declined rapidly after 6 mo. Significant differential responses by the two biotypes to sowing depth and environment were detected for both seed survival and seedling emergence (P < 0.001). Seed mass was consistently lower in the PER biotype at the population level (P < 0.001), but this variation did not adequately explain the differential responses. Moreover, under natural rainfall the magnitude of the biotype effect was unlikely to result in ecologically significant differences. Seed survival after 36 mo under natural rainfall ranged from 6.8 to 21.3%. Best fit regression analysis of the decline in seed survival over time yielded a five-parameter exponential decay model with a lower asymptote approaching -0.38 (% seed survival = [(55 - (-0.38)) . e((k . t))] + -0.38; R-2 = 88.5%; 9 df). Environmental conditions and burial affected the slope parameter or k value significantly (P < 0.01). Seed survival projections from the model were greatest for buried seeds under natural rainfall (11 yr) and least under irrigation (3 yr). Experimental data and model projections suggest that lantana has a persistent seed bank and this should be considered in management programs, particularly those aimed at eradication.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				APR	2009	2	2					141	150		10.1614/IPSM-08-130.1							WOS:000208507300005

Effect of environmental heterogeneity on field germination of Opuntia tomentosa (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae) seeds	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We studied in Opuntia tomentosa the effect of plant shade (orientation and distance), and the place where the seeds remained before germination. Seeds were collected in 1998 and a) sown immediately on soil (non-buried seeds), b) stored in the laboratory and sown on soil during the 1999 rainy season (control) or c) buried after collection (under the shade of a tree, a rock and in an open space), exhumed 7 months later and sown in 1999 (exhumed seeds). Seeds were sown under or outside the shade of several trees: or on the northern, eastern and western sides of a 14-m-tall tree. In 1999, germination was high in all samples, but the control seeds had delayed germination. After two rainy seasons, non-buried seeds had the lowest germination rate. Germination was not affected by the distance from the tree. Outside of the plant's shade, germination was low. Germination was affected more by the environmental heterogeneity than by the individual plant shade. Germination probabilities were the highest at 16-19 degrees C; field germination was zero at 20.6 degrees C. Seed polymorphism and microenvirommental heterogeneity spread germination across two rainy seasons creating a permanent seed bank. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of burial on the germination of Opuntia tomentosa's (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae) seeds	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Opuntia tomentosa seeds have physiological dormancy and a permeable but hard funicular envelope that restricts water Uptake and embryo growth. Dormancy break, germination, and changes in the funiculus were compared in laboratory-stored seeds and in those buried for 7 months at different microsites and later exhumed and stored in the laboratory. The funicular envelopes of both lots were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Seeds in both lots were: scarified with H2SO4 (0, 45, 60 and 90 min), treated with gibberellins (0, 1000 and 2000 ppm) and germinated at the same ages (0, 2, 4, 7, and 10 months after exhumation) at 24 degrees C. Light effect was determined at 24 degrees C and 20-35 degrees C. In laboratory-stored seeds germination was low. Exhumed seeds germinated in similar to 50%, the remaining ones required scarification and gibberellins, but lost dormancy two months later. Gibberellins reduced germination heterogeneity, and scarification reduced germination; the adverse effect of scarification was offset by gibberellins. Exhumed seeds germinated mainly in darkness at 20-35 C and partially in far red light at both temperatures. SEM showed that fungi eroded the funiculus reducing its resistance, O. tomentosa could form a seed bank, ensuring its survival under heterogeneous environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Occurrence of Non-native Species Deep in Natural Areas of the Shawnee National Forest, Southern Illinois, USA	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Biological invasion is a leading threat to the ecological integrity of forest ecosystems around the world. The objective of our study was to examine the relationship between the abundance of non-native species in the vegetation and the soil seed bank to abiotic factors and distance from the nearest forest edge.

The distance of each plot to the closest forest edge was determined using GIS. A 550 cm(3) soil core was extracted from five random points within each of the plots in August 2002 to allow measurement of soil nutrient levels and estimates of the abundance of exotic and native species in the soil seed bank. Soils from these cores were placed in trays in a greenhouse on 10 January 2003. Seedlings emerging from the soil cores were identified and tallied every two weeks until no further seed germination was observed. The plots were located deep in the forest interior (up to 730 in), yet forest edge effects predominate. Distance from forest edges was negatively related to density of both native and non-native species in the seed bank. The largest numbers of non-natives in the seed batik were present in those plots closest to the forest edge. None of the nine important abiotic factors (K, Ca, P, Mg, pH, CEC, and OM, % silt, canopy opening) measured in this Study was related to the seed bank density of the native and non-native species. Potassium was negatively and calcium was positively related to richness of understory native species and distance from forest edge. Phosphorus, Mg, pH, CEC, % silt, OM, and canopy opening were not related to the richness of native species and distance. Commelina communis, Lonicera japonica, Microstegium vimineum, and Rosa mutiflora were non-native species present in the understory vegetation while Barbarea vulgaris, Cardamine hirsuta, Lactuca serriola, Lespedeza cuneata, M. vinzineum, Mollugo verticillata, and Stellaria media were non-native species present in the seed bank. The discordance between non-native species richness in the seed bank and vegetation community indicates that management of invasive species must extend beyond eradication of non-natives in the aboveground vegetation. Land and forest managers should eradicate seedlings of non-native species before they reach seed production stage to decrease their accumulation in the seed bank even at sites located at a great distance from the forest edge.																	0885-8608					APR	2009	29	2					177	187		10.3375/043.029.0210							WOS:000265563000010						
J	Perez-Camacho, L; Rebollo, S				Perez-Camacho, Lorenzo; Rebollo, Salvador			Are irrigation and grazing effects transferred, accumulated, or counteracted during plant recruitment?	PLANT ECOLOGY												How do effects from perturbations such as irrigation and grazing that have an impact at one stage of the recruitment process (e.g., seedling) affect performance at later stages (e.g., adult)? Such effects may be transferred to later stages without any further change (transferred effects), reinforced by a similar effect so that their importance increases (accumulative effect), or counteracted at later stages by an opposite effect (counteractive effect). We analysed the predominance of transferred, accumulative, and counteractive effects depending on (1) organization level (community, functional group, and species levels), (2) life cycle stage (seeds, seedlings, and adults), (3) grass/forb functional group (forbs versus grasses), and (4) seed mass (small-seeded species, medium-seeded species, and large-seeded species). The study was conducted in Alcala de Henares, central Spain. During one annual cycle, we counted the number of readily germinable seeds (3,909 seeds: 2,156 forbs and 1,753 grasses), emerged seedlings (2,126 seedlings: 1,238 forbs and 888 grasses), and surviving seedlings up to reproductive adult status (917 adults: 217 forbs and 700 grasses) of all species (74 species) in a factorial field experiment under three different simulated rainfall and three seasonal sheep grazing regimes in a natural Mediterranean annual plant community composed of forbs (dicotyledonous herbs) and grasses (monocotyledonous herbs). Our main results were: (1) the proportion of transferred and counteractive effects was similar between the three studied organization levels (community, functional group, and species levels); (2) we detected many more counteractive effects in the seedling stage than in the adult stage; (3) we did not find more counteractive effects in forbs versus grasses, but transferred effects were more frequent in grasses; and (4) we found more counteractive effects with decreasing seed mass and more transferred effects with increasing seed mass. Our main conclusions were that the prevalence of counteractive effects reduces the sensitivity of the whole recruitment process and enhances the relative importance of the final stage (adults). The prevalence of transferred effects makes the recruitment process more predictable and more dependent on the early stages (seeds and seedlings).

Morphological dormancy in seeds of the autumn-germinating shrub Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx (Caprifoliaceae)	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												To better understand the germination ecophysiology of the genus Lonicera, the dormancy class, temperature requirements for embryo growth and radicle emergence and phenology of seedling emergence were determined for Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx. At maturity, seeds have an underdeveloped embryo (approximately 28% of the length of full-grown embryos). Embryos in fresh seeds grew to full length at 15, 20, 20/10 and 25/15 degrees C within 3 weeks, but failed to grow at <= 10 degrees C and at 30 degrees C. Radicles emerged from 86-100% of freshly matured seeds in light at 15, 20, 20/10 and 25/15 degrees C within 28 days, but failed to emerge at 10 degrees C. Radicles emerged equally well in a 12 h photoperiod and in continuous darkness at 25/15 degrees C. Rapid embryo growth and germination over a range of conditions indicate that seeds of this taxon have morphological dormancy (MD); this is the first report of MD in a species of Lonicera. Seeds are dispersed in summer, at which time high temperatures promote embryo growth. Embryos grow to the critical length for germination in approximately 1 month; the peak of seedling emergence occurs in early autumn. Radicles emerged within 2 months from 98% of seeds buried at soil depths of 2 cm and 10 cm in the field in August in Sapporo, Japan; thus, seeds have no potential to form a persistent soil seed bank. However, seeds sown too late in autumn for embryos to grow remained viable and germinated the following summer when temperatures were high enough to promote embryo growth.

Spatially explicit population modelling of an Iberian gypsum endemic	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Habitat heterogeneity may influence plant demography because conditions for survival, growth, and reproduction vary within a species' range. We assessed the role of microhabitat spatial structure on the demography of Helianthemum squamatum, a shrubby gypsum specialist endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We evaluated the demographic effect of microhabitat spatial variation using an approach that combined cellular automata with matrix population models, and included environmental and demographic stochasticty. We collected data on seed bank (2003-2005), seedling emergence (2003-2006), and adult survivorship (2004-2007) for H. squamatum in two independent blocks with different grazing intensity in BelinchA(3)n (Cuenca, Spain). We built spatial scenarios for each block based on field data of cover and spatial pattern of four microhabitats: lichenic crust, litter, H. squamatum, and shrub. Seedling survivorship was affected by year, block, and microhabitat, with individuals emerging under conspecifics having the highest survival rate and on litter the lowest in both blocks, whereas the effect of crust and other shrubs differed across blocks. Our models indicated population increase in the block with low grazing, but population decline in the block with intense grazing. We hypothesize that higher pressure of livestock grazing and trampling leads to a shift in relative microhabitat suitability for crust and shrub. This potential effect of grazing on spatial demographic variation opens interesting questions for future research. We emphasize the importance of considering microhabitat spatial structure when evaluating management and conservation strategies.

Potential for seed-mediated gene flow in agroecosystems from transgenic safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) intended for plant molecular farming	TRANSGENIC RESEARCH												Safflower has been transformed for field scale molecular farming of high-value proteins including several pharmaceuticals. Viable safflower seed remaining in the soil seed bank after harvest could facilitate seed and pollen-mediated gene flow. Seeds may germinate in subsequent years and volunteer plants may flower and potentially outcross with commodity safflower and/or produce seed. Seeds from volunteers could become admixed with conventional crops at harvest, and/or replenish the seed bank. Seed in following crops could be transported locally and internationally and facilitate gene flow in locations where regulatory thresholds and public acceptance differ from Canada. Seed-mediated gene flow was examined in three studies. Safflower seed loss and viability following harvest of commercial fields of a non-transgenic cultivar were determined. We assessed seed longevity of transgenic and non-transgenic safflower, on the soil surface and buried at two depths. Finally, we surveyed commercial safflower fields at different sites and measured density and growth stage of safflower volunteers, in other crops the following year and documented volunteer survival and viable seed production. Total seed loss at harvest in commercial fields, ranged from 231 to 1,069 seeds m(-2) and the number of viable seeds ranged from 81 to 518 seeds m(-2). Safflower has a relatively short longevity in the seed bank and no viable seeds were found after 2 years. Based on the seed burial studies it is predicted that winter conditions would reduce safflower seed viability on the soil surface by > 50%, leaving between 40 and 260 viable seeds m(-2). The density of safflower volunteers emerging in the early spring of the following year ranged from 3 to 11 seedlings m(-2). Safflower volunteers did not survive in fields under chemical fallow, but in some cereal fields small numbers of volunteers did survive and generate viable seed. Results will be used to make recommendations for best management practices to reduce seed-mediated gene flow from commercial production of plant molecular farming with safflower.

J	Sabo, KE; Sieg, CH; Hart, SC; Bailey, JD				Sabo, Kyla E.; Sieg, Carolyn Hull; Hart, Stephen C.; Bailey, John Duff			The role of disturbance severity and canopy closure on standing crop of understory plant species in ponderosa pine stands in northern Arizona, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Concerns about the long-term sustainability, of overstocked dry conifer forests in western North America have provided impetus for treatments designed to enhance their productivity and native biodiversity. Dense forests are increasingly prone to large stand-replacing fires; yet, thinning and burning treatments, especially combined with other disturbances such as drought and grazing, may enhance populations of colonizing species, including a number of non-native species. Our study quantifies plant standing crop of major herbaceous species across contrasting stand structural types representing a range in disturbance severity in northern Arizona. The least disturbed unmanaged ponderosa pine stands had no non-native species, while non-native grasses constituted 7-11% of the understory, plant standing crop in thinned and burned stands. Severely disturbed wildfire stands had a higher proportion of colonizing native species as well as non-native species than other structural types, and areas protected from grazing produced greater standing crop of native forbs compared to grazed unmanaged stands. Standing crop of understory plants in low basal area thinned and burned plots was similar to levels on wildfire plots, but was comprised of fewer non-native graminoids and native colonizing plants. Our results also indicate that size of canopy openings had a stronger influence on standing crop in low basal area plots, whereas tree density more strongly constrained understory plant standing crop in dense stands. These results imply that treatments resulting in clumped tree distribution and basal areas <10 m(2) ha(-1) will be more successful in restoring native understory plant biomass in dense stands. Multiple types and severity of disturbances, such as thinning, burning, grazing, and drought over short periods of time can create greater abundance of colonizing species. Spreading thinning and burning treatments over time may reduce the potential for non-native species colonization compared to immediately burning thinned stands.

J	Risberg, L; Granstrom, A				Risberg, Lotta; Granstrom, Anders			The effect of timing of forest fire on phenology and seed production in the fire-dependent herbs Geranium bohemicum and G. lanuginosum in Sweden	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The seasonal distribution of fires is one fire regime variable which has received little attention with regard to its effects on plants. For species with a short life-span that recruits after fire, the seasonal timing of a fire can be expected to be important due to effects on potential growth period and reproduction. We observed phenology and reproductive output in two annual and fire-dependent Geranium spp. in the southern part of the European boreal forest. In a garden experiment with the two species under two levels of nutrition, we established cohorts of seedlings at several dates over three summers. Time from germination to flowering and first mature seed differed little between the two species and levels of nutrition; i.e. plant size or level of nutrition had almost no effect on phenology. However, emergence time controlled the timing of reproduction. Most plants emerging before the second week of July in the garden experiment bolted the same year. Plants emerging later behaved as winter-annuals and started to flower in June the following year, A similar dichotomy was observed for populations of Geranium spp. at a number of burnt forest sites that differed in date of fire. This response is likely controlled by photoperiod. Nevertheless, at sites that burnt early some plants did not bolt in the same season; probably an effect of variable seedling emergence dates in the populations. In both the field and garden experiment, there were plants entering reproduction too late to produce mature seeds. Our results indicate that management fires should be conducted either very early, or during July and August to achieve a high seed production in these rare forest plants.

J	Colbach, N; Monod, H; Lavigne, C				Colbach, Nathalie; Monod, Herve; Lavigne, Claire			A simulation study of the medium-term effects of field patterns on cross-pollination rates in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Gene flow between cultivars within a landscape may lead to impurities that reduce harvest value. In OSR, as for most crops, impurity rates are expected to depend on the spatial distribution of crops over the landscape. However, in contrast to other well-studied crops such as maize, OSR crops generate seed banks in European agro-ecosystems. Gene flow is thus a spatio-temporal process which depends on cropping systems. We therefore aimed at identifying spatial variables that have an effect on regional or local harvest impurities, taking account of the time since the introduction of OSR crops in the regions and of cropping system. Gene flow was simulated over 36 field patterns cultivated with either 15% or 30% of OSR fields, among which 10% or 50% were GM, for three contrasted cropping systems, with the GENESYS software already used for EU co-existence studies. Through regression analyses, we determined spatial and agronomic factors that most affected harvest impurity rates of non-GM OSR after one or seven years of OSR cultivation. The cropping system was the main factor explaining regional harvest impurity rates. Its importance increased after six years of OSR cultivation. For a given cropping system, the regional impurity rate after one year increased linearly with the current proportion of GM crop. In contrast, impurity rates after six years largely depended on the proportions of OSR crop (GM or not) in the two preceding years. During the first year of OSR cultivation, local impurity rates were mostly explained by the distance to the closest GM field. After six years, these rates were mostly explained by the density of GM volunteers in the analysed field and, to a lesser degree, to that of volunteers in neighbour non-OSR fields. Cropping systems were most important in determining impurity rates and the way impurity rates related to regional or local factors. Determination of isolation distances to ensure harvest purity should thus consider past history of OSR cultivation in the area and, in particular, how current or future cropping systems will manage volunteers. Regression quantiles were fitted to the simulated data to determine regional rules (i.e. the maximum regional area of GM OSR and isolation distances between GM and non-GM crops) as a function of the risk accepted by the decision-maker (i.e. the % of situations exceeding harvest impurity thresholds), the cropping system and the volunteer infestation.

J	Van Rossum, F				Van Rossum, Fabienne			Succession stage variation in population size in an early-successional herb in a peri-urban forest	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Urban and peri-urban forests incur high anthropogenic pressures (e.g. recreational activities, artificialization, and eutrophication). Plant species from early-successional, transient, forest habitats, often characterized by a short life span and a persistent seed bank in the soil may differ from late-successional species in key-factors for population persistence. This study investigated variation in population size and seedling recruitment for different forest succession stages and three consecutive years in Centaurium erythraea, an early-successional biennial herb, occurring in a peri-urban forest of Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Forest succession stage had a significant impact on C. erythroea population size and on its temporal fluctuation. Populations in closing vegetation (evolving to late-succession stages) showed small population sizes and a low number of recruits compared to populations from stable early-succession vegetation and clearcuts. The number of recruits was the highest after clearcutting, which can be related to the expression of the soil seed bank. Populations showed year to-year variation in size (flowering individuals and recruits), even in stable (over three years) early-succession forest vegetation. in the absence of disturbance changing succession stage, population size is expected to depend on seed set of the previous years and subsequent seedling recruitment, which can be affected by environmental stochasticity. Opening gaps in the herbaceous vegetation may stimulate seedling recruitment, also in unoccupied patches where "cryptic" seed populations are present in the soil. Forest path and road verges, despite their potential negative impact on forests, can constitute refuge habitats for early-successional forest plant species. Their management should involve the preservation of these species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Do heat and smoke increase emergence of exotic and native plants in the matorral of central Chile?	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We studied the effect of heat shock and wood-fueled smoke on the emergence of native and exotic plant species in soil samples obtained in an evergreen shrubland of central Chile, located on the eastern foothills of the Coastal Range of Lampa. Immediately after collection samples were dried and stored under laboratory condition. For each two transect, 10 samples were randomly chosen, and one of the following treatments was applied: 1) Heat-shock treatment. 2) Plant-produced smoke treatment. 3) Combined heat-and-smoke treatment. 4) Control, corresponding to samples not subjected to treatment. Twenty-three species, representing 12 families, emerged from the soil samples. The best-represented families were Poaceae and Asteraceae. All of the emerged species were herbs, 21 were annuals, and 14 were exotic to Chile. Fire-related triggers used in this study did not increase the emergence and/or abundance of exotic species with respect to natives in soil samples. Interestingly, this study provides evidence that heat-shock can increase the emergence of native herbs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS, All rights reserved.

Plant species richness in ephemeral and perennial reaches of a dryland river	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Ephemeral reaches are common along desert rivers but are less well studied than those with perennial stream flow. This study contrasted riparian plant species richness and composition (extant vegetation and soil seed bank) between stream reaches with different low-flow conditions (perennial vs. ephemeral flow) but similar flood patterns and similar watershed-derived species pools. Data were collected at Cienega Creek (Arizona, USA) over a 2 year period spanning drought conditions and wetter conditions. Consistent with expectations relating to water limitation effects on diversity, species richness in the riparian zone was lower at ephemeral-flow sites during a season with minimal precipitation and no overbank flooding; under these conditions, the more permanent water sources of the perennial-flow sites sustain the larger number of species. During seasons with greater precipitation and elevated stream flows, in contrast, species richness at ephemeral-flow sites increased to levels at or slightly above those of perennial-flow sites. For values pooled across two wet seasons of a calendar year, year-round richness was greater at the two ephemeral-flow sites (total of 92 vascular plant species) than at the two perennial-flow sites (68 species). This greater year-round richness was a combination of multiple factors: greater light, space, and bare ground, a diverse soil seed bank (with the seed banks equally species-rich among hydrologic types), and moderately abundant precipitation and flooding sufficient to stimulate establishment of opportunistic species (mainly annuals) during the bimodal wet seasons. These results indicate that long-term patterns of site water availability, by influencing woody plant cover, mediate the diversity response to episodic water pulses in dryland rivers. The results also have implications for riparian conservation efforts, which to date have focused primarily on perennial stream reaches: ephemeral reaches of spatially intermittent rivers harbor many riparian plant species, and warrant conservation efforts, as well.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				MAR	2009	18	3					663	677		10.1007/s10531-008-9532-z							WOS:000263352200011

Plant Sci. 89: 379-404. Setaria faberi, commonly known as giant foxtail, is an annual graminaceous weed that is native to eastern China, has colonized eastern North America and is expanding its range westward. This species is primarily self-pollinated and the only mechanism of reproduction is by seed. Adult plants may reach 2 in in height and produce over 2000 seeds per panicle. Seeds may possess non-deep physiological dormancy when freshly produced, and can form small persistent seed banks. If not controlled, S. faberi populations can cause severe yield reductions in corn and soybean crops. Several herbicides are available to provide chemical control;, however, resistance to some modes of action, (ALS, ACCase, and Photosystem II) have been identified in Canada and the United States. Leaves and seeds of this species provide a food source to several species of mammals, birds, and insects.																	0008-4220					MAR	2009	89	2					379	404		10.4141/CJPS08042							WOS:000265275400023

FLORISTIC COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF TWO SEASONAL DECIDUOUS FOREST PATCHES IN ALTO-URUGUAI, SC	CIENCIA FLORESTAL												In two forest remnants located in Seasonal Deciduous Atlantic Forest of Alto-Uruguai region of Southern Brazil, the plots (MP) and point-centered-quarter (MQ) methods were used aiming to characterize the floristic richness and structural composition. 91 species were identified, 52 of them were classified as understory species (without timber value), being the most abundant Sorocea bonplandii, Gimnanthes concolor and Trichilia claussenii species. The others were classified as timber species, being the most abundant Apuleia leiocarpa, Nectandra megapotamica, Cabralea canjerana, and Holocalyx balansae. The species of higher density and basal area were practically the same in both forest patches, independently from the inventory method used. The MP detected a higher number of species diversity as well as the higher value for plant density by area, comparatively to MQ, although both methods detected different species. The simultaneous use of MQ and MP resulted in a higher coverage of species diversity in both areas, with a reduction in time to perform the inventory. In both methods, sampling error above of the expected value was detected, but the smaller these values, the greater the similarity among the results provided by both methods. Unfortunately, the species richness occurring in the FED contrasts with the small number of remaining patches in this ecosystem. It is important to highlight that these patches are the last repositories for seed to be used in colonizing degraded areas as well as for conservation, improvement and it? situ seed bank program with native plant species.

Seed Bank and Vegetation Development of Sandy Grasslands After Goose Breeding	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												Four hypotheses were tested using long-term observations of vegetation development (12 years) and present-day seed bank data in a sandy grassland area overgrazed by domestic geese: i) Gap regeneration is crucial in maintaining species richness; thus, closed vegetation of the lower sites prevents continuous establishment of short-lived species. ii) Short-lived, early successional species comprise most of the seed banks and late successional perennials have at most sparse seed banks. iii) Composition of seed banks is more similar to pioneer vegetation than to later successional stages. iv) The similarity is higher between vegetation and seed banks in the upper-positioned plots than in the closed, lower-positioned ones. Two sites, located in the upper part of dune slopes, and another two, positioned on the lower part, were studied. In each site five 2 x 2 m permanent plots were surveyed between 1991 and 2002. Percentage cover was estimated three times a year. In the last study year, soil seed banks were sampled. Two vertical segments (0-5, 5-10 cm) were separately analyzed. The seedling emergence method was applied on concentrated samples. We found that the vegetation developed from open, annual dominated weedy assemblages to grasslands dominated by perennial graminoids. In the lower-positioned sites perennial clonal grasses (Cynodon dactylon, Poa angustifolia and P. pratensis) formed more closed vegetation, which was accompanied by lower species richness compared to the upper-positioned sites. Seed density varied between 10,300 and 40,900 seeds/m(2). Significantly higher seed densities were found in upper sites than in the lower ones. Annuals and short-lived perennial dicots comprised most of the seed bank. The dominant perennial graminoids also built up dense seed banks. We found a low to medium similarity between vegetation and the seed bank; similarity was the highest with the vegetation of the 1994-1998 period. In the upper sites the similarity between seed bank and the vegetation of the last studied years was also high. The vertical position had a significant effect on regeneration after overgrazing. The large cover of grasses in lower sites decreased species richness and it also decreased the seed density preventing the seed bank formation of annuals and short-lived perennials. Here, further management practices are needed to increase the species richness.

J	Orellana, MR; Blanche, C; Simon, J; Bosch, M				Renee Orellana, Maria; Blanche, Cesar; Simon, Joan; Bosch, Maria			Genetic Diversity Within and among Disjunct Populations of the Mediterranean Island Endemic Delphinium pictum and D. requienii (Ranunculaceae)	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												Allozyme diversity was assessed in 13 populations of Delphinium pictum and D. requienii, two short-lived and closely related insular Mediterranean endemics. While D. pictum has scattered distribution in Corsica, Sardinia and Majorca, D. requienii is found in a few small populations restricted to the Hyeres Archipelago. Eleven enzyme systems were assayed, and 15 loci were resolved. Both species harboured moderate levels of genetic diversity, comparable to the values expected for endemic plants. All genetic parameters suggested higher diversity in D. pictum (A= 1.93, P= 40, H-e= 0.106) than in D. requienii (A= 1.30, P= 26.7, H-e= 0.096); F-IS values revealed higher inbreeding in D. requienii. Although the two species did not harbour species-specific alelles in the surveyed loci, the UPGMA dendrogram based on Nei's genetic similarity index supported divergence between them. These results, together with significant morphological similarity and evidence of successful hybridization between the species, support the hypothesis of a recent speciation event. The moderate levels of both genetic variability and population divergence observed for D. pictum are likely attributable to its ability to establish seed banks. Given that the allozyme variation detected for D. pictum was significantly partitioned among islands, we suggest the implementation of conservation programs throughout its distribution range, and not only in Corsica as it occurs nowadays. Management strategies are also desirable for D. requienii to maintain population size and control inbreeding.

(Swamp Paperbark): environmental triggers for seed release	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Aerial seed banks are potentially the main source of sexual recruitment for woody wetland plants. Whilst the importance of soil seed banks for the persistence and recruitment of wetland plants has been examined in many studies, the role of aerial seed banks has been largely neglected. We used seed traps and the seedling emergence technique to quantify the seed rain from aerial seed banks of the Swamp Paperbark Melaleuca ericifolia Sm. (Myrtaceae) in Dowd Morass, a Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetland in south-eastern Australia. Nine plant species germinated from material collected in seed traps over 2004-2005, but emergents were dominated (80-97%) by M. ericifolia. The mean number of M. ericifolia emergents ranged from < 1 to < 100 seedlings m(-2) day(-1), and showed a peak in the summer-autumn period. Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (r (2) = 0.738) between the number of M. ericifolia emergents and water depth. Water depth and salinity were negatively correlated (r (2) = 0.819), and increases in the number of M. ericifolia emergents as water levels fell were also associated with high salinities. Increasing air temperature and vapour pressure deficit also stimulated seed release during periods of drying. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the importance of aerial seed banks for sexual recruitment in woody wetland plants and the release of seed in relation to environmental factors. Aerial seed banks warrant consideration alongside soil seed banks for the establishment and long-term survival of woody plants in wetlands.

Factors controlling the regenerative cycle of Thymus funkii subsp funkii in a semi-arid gypsum steppe: A seed bank dynamics perspective	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We researched the soil seed bank dynamics of Thymus funkii subsp. funkii, a gypsovag shrub endemic to the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, to determine possible reasons for low recruitment in isolated populations growing on crusted gypsum soils. Recruitment-restriction hypotheses involving main factors in the seed bank dynamics were analysed, and a diagrammatic dynamics model drafted from a population perspective. Viable seed production averaged 362 per plant. Seed shadows resulting from primary dispersal were concentrated under the mother plant. There were two thyme-seed predators: coleopteran larvae (pre-dispersal phase) and Messor bouvieri ants (pre- and post-dispersal phases), which predated 16.4% and 3.8% of population yield, respectively. However, ants may simultaneously contribute to the spatial secondary dispersal, since they lost a small fraction of seeds they harvested. Seeds showed innate physiological dormancy to high summer temperatures, although this disappeared rapidly. The response of germination to other temperature x light conditions was wide and rapid. No permanent seed bank was detected in the soil. Seeds buried in the upper soil layer (2 cm) germinated highly and fast. In contrast, a significant fraction of seeds buried deeply (8 cm) remained viable for over one year. Germination in the field accounted for only 1.0% of the seed output, and seed death due to pathogen attack and aging was also low (3.0%). Seedling emergence was confined to autumn and showed a high correlation with total plant cover, irrespective of plant species. Seedling survival was very low. The small spatial correspondence between primary dispersal and seedling emergence patterns may reflect the importance of secondary dispersal in T funkii seed bank dynamics. Hypotheses and consequences of such horizontal seed movements for conservation management are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured horizontal vegetative mobility (VM) of 48 herbaceous understory species and estimated small-scale species richness in early and late successional boreonemoral herb-rich coniferous forests in central Estonia. VM of erosulate growth forms was significantly higher than that of hemi-rosette and rosette growth forms. Erosulate species exhibited higher mobility in young stands, but their relative and total cover was considerably higher in old stands. Local plant richness (in 1 x 1 m plots) correlated positively with the variability of VM of species in a plot-larger differences in VM resulted in a higher number of coexisting species. Our results thus suggest that species differences in VM can contribute to small-scale coexistence by providing different ways to colonise empty space.

Does post-fire plant regeneration mode affect the germination response to fire-related cues?	OECOLOGIA												Vegetative resprouting, soil or canopy-stored seed banks, post-fire seed dispersal and germination are the major strategies by which plants regenerate after fires. Post-fire regeneration modes of plants are commonly based on the presence or absence of post-fire recruitment as well as the presence or absence of post-fire resprouting. High temperatures, smoke and ash are characteristics of fire and the post-fire environment. We hypothesized that heat, smoke, ash and pH will have differential effects on seed germination depending on species' post-fire regeneration strategies: serotinous vs. nonserotinous (which may have soil seed banks) and resprouters vs. nonresprouters (which may be obligate seeders). Here we examined the effects of these factors on the germination of 27 common east Australian species. Most serotinous species supported our hypothesis by showing no effect or reduced germination in response to heat. However, contrary to our prediction, all nonserotinous nonresprouting species also showed no effect or reduced germination in response to heat. Smoke, contrary to our hypothesis, had a negative or no effect on all serotinous and nonresprouting species, but no clear directional effect on serotinous and resprouting species. Supporting our hypotheses, ash and high pH showed positive or nonsignificant effects on the germination of all serotinous resprouting species, and a negative or no effect on nonserotinous resprouting species. However, contrary to our prediction, it had a negative or no effect on the serotinous nonresprouting species and no clear effect on nonserotinous nonresprouting species. We also discovered large differences in germination responses between conspecific populations that varied in their degree of resprouting. Although our data confirmed several of our predictions, the overall conclusion is that the responses of seeds to heat, smoke, ash and pH are not tightly associated with post-fire regeneration functional types.

Macroclimate associated with urbanization increases the rate of secondary succession from fallow soil	OECOLOGIA												To examine the impact of projected climate changes on secondary succession, we exposed the same fallow soil with a common seed bank to an in situ gradient of urban to rural macroenvironments that differed in temperature and CO2 concentration ([CO2]). This gradient was established at three locations: Baltimore city center (urban), a city park on the outskirts of Baltimore (suburban), and an organic farm 87 km from the Baltimore city center site (rural). Over a five-year period, the urban site averaged 2.1A degrees C warmer and had a [CO2] that was similar to 20% higher than at the rural location, indicating that this gradient was a reasonable surrogate for projected changes in those variables for this century. Previous work had demonstrated that other abiotic variables measured across the transect, including tropospheric ozone and nitrogen deposition, did not differ consistently. The first year of exposure resulted in (two- to threefold) greater aboveground biomass in the urban relative to the rural site, but with uniform species composition across sites. Simple regression of abiotic variables indicated that temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the best predictors of plant biomass among locations. Stepwise multiple regressions were also performed to analyze the effect of more than one macroenvironmental variable on total plant biomass. The combination of daily CO2 concentration and nighttime temperature explained 87% (P < 0.01) of the variability in total biomass between sites. After five years, the species demography of the plant communities had changed significantly, with a greater ratio of perennials to annuals for the urban relative to the rural location. Greater first-year biomass and litter accumulation at the urban site may have suppressed the subsequent seed germination of annual species, accelerating changes in species composition. If urban macroenvironments reflect future global change conditions, these data suggest a faster rate of secondary succession in a warmer, higher [CO2] world.				wolf, julie/I-6829-2012; wolf, julie/O-5357-2019	wolf, julie/0000-0002-1437-982X; wolf, julie/0000-0002-1437-982X												0029-8549	1432-1939				MAR	2009	159	3					637	647		10.1007/s00442-008-1238-0							WOS:000263418800016	19085013

Microspatial population genetic structure of the Mediterranean shrub Fumana thymifolia	PLANT BIOLOGY												Fumana thymifolia (Cistaceae) is an insect-pollinated, gravity-dispersed evergreen shrub, which is a common component of fire-prone Mediterranean shrubland ecosystems. Despite the availability of basic knowledge on its ecology, little is known of its breeding system and no information is available on its population genetic structure. We explored the within-population genetic structure of this species using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) molecular markers and related this to predictions based on its breeding system, pollen and seed dispersal. Existing information on the reproductive ecology of F. thymifolia was supplemented by artificial pollination experiments. We determined that self-fertilisation can occur in F. thymifolia but results in reduced fruit set. Significant genetic structuring was detected within the population, a likely consequence of localised seed dispersal in combination with a mixed mating system. In a study site covering approximately 0.5 ha, amova revealed that approximately 9% of genetic variability was distributed among population subsamples. Significant spatial genetic structure was detected, with kinship coefficients being significantly elevated above the null expectation in the first six distance classes (maximum 5 m), and a value of Sp of up to 0.0342, comparable with species having similar ecological characteristics. Weak isolation by distance at the plot scale was detected, suggesting that insect-mediated pollen flow is non-random, despite being more extensive than seed dispersal. Fumana thymifolia provides a promising model for the investigation of both short- and long-term population dynamics in relation to fire frequency within this plant community.

Twenty-eight taxa were recorded in the soil seed bank and 83 taxa (70 taxa in plots of seed bank sampling) in the above-ground vegetation. The dominant tree species and many woodland species found in the above-ground vegetation were absent from the soil seed bank. Similarity between the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation decreased with grazing, and grazing led to a decrease of species richness in above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank. Beta diversity of vegetation among grazed and among non-grazed plots did not differ, but was significantly higher between grazed and non-grazed areas. Beta diversity of the soil seed bank declined with grazing. When applying classification tree and logistic regression analyses, non-grazed forest sites are clearly differentiated by the presence of Phillyrea latifolia, Euphorbia amygdaloides and Brachypodium sylvaticum. PCA ordination of above-ground species composition reflected a gradient from sites grazed by ruminants to non-grazed sites, but no clear structure was detected in the seed bank.

J	Trubina, MR				Trubina, Marina R.			Species richness and resilience of forest communities: combined effects of short-term disturbance and long-term pollution	PLANT ECOLOGY												Recovery of the species richness of plant communities after experimental disturbances of various severities were studied in spruce forests polluted by atmospheric entry of SO2 and heavy metals from a copper smelter. In the three toxic load zones (impact, buffer, and background), 60 experimental "pit-and-mound" complexes (sized 1 m x 2 m, 20 complexes in each zone) were created. Colonization of disturbed areas by vascular plants was observed during a 6-year period after the disturbance. The results showed that the recovery processes were affected by disturbance severity and that the recovery differed significantly among the communities. In all of the zones, species richness increased rapidly after mild disturbance. In degraded communities, levelling of differences in the rate of colonization after mild and severe disturbances was observed. The highest colonization rate was found in the communities of background zone, while the lowest was found in the heavily degraded communities of impact zone. The disturbances significantly increased the species diversity of communities in all zones and caused a certain reversion of degraded communities to previous stage of anthropogenic succession. Mild disturbance promoted the greatest increase in the diversity indices. The study results indicate that recovery rate of species richness of plant communities is determined by the duration of negative effect of disturbances. Recovery also depends significantly on the magnitude and endurance of positive effect of disturbances. The studied communities differed significantly in these parameters. The study results also suggest that short-term disturbances can significantly modify the process of transformation of plant communities by atmospheric pollution. On the other hand, long-term pollution can considerably modify the response of forest communities to disturbances. The results also conclude that the resilience of communities does not exclusively depend on their species richness.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				MAR	2009	201	1					339	350		10.1007/s11258-008-9558-z							WOS:000263175800025

Factors Associated with Succession of Abandoned Agricultural Lands along the Lower Missouri River, USA	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The 1993 flood of the Missouri River led to the abandonment of agriculture on considerable land in the floodplain. This abandonment led to a restoration opportunity for the U.S. Federal Government, purchasing those lands being sold by farmers. Restoration of this floodplain is complicated, however, by an imperfect understanding of its past environmental and vegetative conditions. We examined environmental conditions associated with the current placement of young forests and wet prairies as a guide to the potential successional trajectory for abandoned agricultural land subject to flooding. We used Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression to examine the effects of flood frequency, soil drainage, distance from the main channel, and elevation on whether a site was in wet prairie or in forest. Study site was included as a random effect, controlling for site-specific differences not measured in our study. We found, after controlling for the effect of site, that early-successional forest sites were closer to the river and at a lower elevation but occurred on drier soils than wet prairie. In a regulated river such as the lower Missouri River, wet prairie sites are relatively isolated from the main channel compared to early-successional forest, despite occurring on relatively moister soils. The modeled results from this study may be used to predict the potential successional fate of the acquired agricultural lands, and along with information on wildlife assemblages associated with wet prairie and forest can be used to predict potential benefit of these acquisitions to wildlife conservation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sequential applications of nicosulfuron and chlorpyrifos on the emergence of seedlings of the seed bank in the soil, the basal CO2 emission rate, and the microbial biomass carbon (MBC) of soil. Sequential applications of nicosulfuron (doses from 0 to 64 g ha(-1)) with or without chlorpyrifos (0 and 240 g ha(-1)) were performed. At 20, 40 and 60 days after application (DAA) of the products, the species of all seedlings that emerged from the seed bank were identified, and the frequency, density and abundance estimated, as well as the importance value IV. Sixty DAA the CO2 emission rate and CBM were were also determined, and based on the relationship between the accumulated CO2 and total soil MBC the metabolic coefficient (qCO(2)) was estimated. The application of nicosulfuron rates of over 20 g ha(-1) severely affected the seedling dry weight and number of species. In the presence of the herbicide, the species with highest IV were Boehavia diffusa and Commelina bengalensis. There was a decrease in the basal soil respiration rate with increasing nicosulfuron doses, in the presence as well as in the absence of the insecticide chlorpyrifos. There was a linear decrease in MBC in all cases regardless of the chlorpyrifos application, although the reduction was 4.5 times greater in soil that received the combined application of the insecticide and nicosulfuron. The qCO(2) confirmed the negative effect of the application of insecticide and herbicide. It was concluded that the application of chlorpyrifos + nicosulfuron causes a negative impact on the seeds in the soil and the soil microbial activity.

Modelling of the population dynamics of Phalaris brachystachys Link under various herbicide control scenarios in a Mediterranean climate	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												The weed Phalaris brachystachys Link (short-spiked canarygrass) severely affects cereal production ill regions with a Mediterranean climate. A mathematical model for simulating the Population dynamics of this weed was constructed using previously reported data and new information. The model was used to describe the long-term dynamics of the Population in the absence of control practices and to predict the effect of various control strategies based on the annual application of herbicides at 50%, 75% and 100% of the standard rate in winter wheat. Without control the seed bank population would reach all equilibrium level at a density of 21,244 seeds m(-2) after six years. Annual application of herbicides at 50%, 75% and 100% of the standard rate resulted in reductions in the equilibrium position of the population of only 5.44%, 12.27% and 26.14%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicated that seedbank dynamics was particularly sensitive to fecundity, seed bank mortality and seed losses, and that new control strategies should target these population parameters. The current model has highlighted the fact that herbicide tactics are not able to stabilize or decrease short-spiked canarygrass populations in winter wheat in the longer-term. Integration of herbicide applications and agronomic practices may be required to attain effective reductions of P. brachystachys populations.

Trials using seven herbicides and three application methods (foliar, basal bark, and cut stump) were undertaken at a site in north Queensland (158 700 hiptage plants ha(-1)). The foliar-applied herbicides were only effective in controlling the hiptage seedlings. Of the foliar herbicides trialed, dicamba, fluroxypyr, and triclopyr/picloram controlled > 75% of the treated seedlings. On the larger plants, the cut stump applications were more effective than the basal bark treatments. Kills of > 95% were obtained when the plants were cut close to ground level (5 cm) and treated with herbicides that were mixed with diesel (fluroxypyr and triclopyr/picloram), with water (glyphosate), or were applied neat (picloram). The costings for the cut stump treatment of a hiptage infestation (85 000 plants ha(-1)), excluding labor, would be $A14 324 ha(-1) using picloram and $A5294 ha(-1) and $A2676 ha(-1), respectively, using glyphosate and fluroxypyr. Foliar application using dicamba for seedling control would cost $A1830 ha(-1). The costs range from 2-17 cents per plant depending on the treatment. A lack of hiptage seeds below the soil surface, a high germinability (> 98%) of the viable seeds, a low viability (0%) of 2 year old, laboratory-stored fruit, and a seedling density of 0.1 seedlings m(-2) 12 months after a control program indicate that hiptage might have a short-term seed bank. Protracted recolonization from the seed bank would therefore be unlikely after established seed-producing plants have been controlled.

J	El-Keblawy, A; Al-Hamadi, F				El-Keblawy, Ali; Al-Hamadi, Fatima			Assessment of the differential response of weeds to soil solarization by two methods	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The efficacy of solarization in weed control under field conditions of the United Arab Emirates was evaluated by two methods: on-farm weed assessment and a seed germination test. In the on-farm weed assessment method, the weed frequency, density, and dry weight were compared in the solarized and non-solarized plots that were cultivated with cabbage. Prior to solarization, the soil was artificially infested with the seeds of 10 weeds. Generally, the densities of seven species and dry weights of five species were significantly lower in the solarized plots as compared to the control. Launea mucronata, Capsella bursa-pastoris, and Echinochloa colona were very sensitive to solarization, as they did not appear in the solarized plots. However, Portulaca oleracea and Melilotus indica were not significantly affected by soil solarization. In the second method, the germination was assessed for the seeds of four weedy species buried at three depths for different durations of solarization. The results confirmed the great sensitivity of L. mucronata and C. bursa-pastoris seeds to solarization, as all had not germinated after 15 days of solarization, even at the 15 cm depth. The seeds of E. colona, however, were less sensitive after 15 days of solarization, especially at 7.5 cm and 15 cm, respectively. The seed germination method confirmed the resistance of the P. oleracea seeds to solarization. The results emphasized the importance of the germination test to provide accurate predictions about the spatial and temporal changes of the soil seed bank in solarized farms. This would help to determine the optimal duration of solarization in each farm, depending on the kind of weeds infesting the farm.

Goatsrue (Galega officinalis) Seed Biology	WEED SCIENCE												Goatsrue is an introduced perennial plant which has proven to have great invasive potential, leading to its classification as a noxious weed in many states and at the federal level. Very little research has been done on its basic biology. Physical dormancy of mature goatsrue seed was tested through scarification with sulfuric acid for up to 60 min resulting in 100% germination. Comparison of dormancy for 26-yr-old and 6-mo-old goatsrue seed indicated that aged seeds had reduced dormancy levels compared to newly harvested seeds. Maximum germination was similar among the 6-mo old and 26-yr-old seed lots, suggesting no loss of viability had occurred in seed stored dry for 26 yr. Goatsrue seedling emergence was inversely related to burial depth, and decreased as burial depth increased. Emergence of seed buried at 0.5 to 3.0 cm soil depth was 93 to 87%, respectively, and no emergence occurred from 12 and 14 cm. When the soil seed bank of five goatsrue-infested areas was sampled, the largest density of seeds found was 74,609 seeds m(-2) while the lowest was 14,832 2 seeds m(-2). Viability and dormancy of seeds recovered from the soil seed bank survey ranged from 91 to 100% and 80 to 93%, respectively. Management, which reduces the soil seed bank and controls emerging seedlings, is as essential as control of mature goatsrue plants in order to avoid seedling establishment and reinvasion of a location.

Living Boundaries: Tracking Weed Seed Movement with Nondormant Seed	WEED SCIENCE												Synthetic seed banks are a useful tool for tracking how weed populations change over time. By sowing a known number of seeds of a given species within a quadrat with defined boundaries, an investigator can measure the number remaining and thereby calculate demographic rates (e.g., mortality). The alternative is to use in situ seeds and estimate their initial population density via sampling. To make a synthetic seed bank approach useful within an agricultural system subjected to soil disturbances Such as tillage, one would need a way to account for seeds leaving the initial quadrat (i.e., a way to follow how the area encompassing the sown seeds changes over time). Without accounting for the change in location/extent of the synthetic seed batik, any field operation moving soil will create additional uncertainty in population size. Depending on the aggressiveness" of specific field operations and the initial size of the quadrat, this effect might be negligible or so large as to be intractable. Here, we describe a method for following a synthetic seed bank over time using a "living boundary" of nondormant seeds, which effectively play the role of tracers used in the study of dynamics in other scientific disciplines. Study quadrats in East Lansing, MI, and Arlington, WI, were sown with giant foxtail and velvetleaf at a rate of 2,000 seeds m(-2). The study quadrats were marked on the perimeter and diagonals using nondormant seeds of three marker species: kale, radish, and rye. The areas were then subjected to tillage and planting operations. Spatial coordinates of seedling locations for the marker and weed species were obtained through digital image processing. A nonparametric comparison of the spatial displacement of marker and weed species indicated that their empirical spatial distributions did not differ. The marker species quadrats described by the 50th, 90th, and 99th quantiles of movement contained all velvetleaf seedlings in Wisconsin, all velvetleaf seedlings in Michigan, and all giant foxtail seedlings in Michigan, respectively. The results suggest a simple rule for applying the method to Field demography studies: after the original quadrat is deformed and seedlings have emerged, flag the polygon containing all marker seedlings to obtain the expanded quadrat containing the study weed population.

These models are available for multiple-species weed Communities in a single season of several crops. Growers also rely on crop rotation for weed control, yet theory and models of weed population dynamics have not led to similar tools for planning of crop rotations for cost-effective weed management. Obstacles have been the complexity of modeling the dynamics of multiple populations of weed species compared to a single species and lack of data. We developed a method to use limited, readily observed data to simulate population dynamics and crop yield loss of multiple-species weed communities in response to crop rotation, tillage system, and specific weed management tactics. Our method is based on the general theory of density dependence of plant productivity and extensive use of rectangular hyperbolic equations for describing crop yield loss as a function of weed density. Only two density-independent parameters are required for each species to represent differences in seed bank mortality, emergence, and maximum seed production. One equation is used to model crop yield loss and density-dependent weed seed production as a function of crop and weed density, relative time of weed and crop emergence, and differences among species in competitive ability. The model has been parameterized for six crops and 15 weeds, and limited evaluation indicates predictions are accurate enough to highlight potential weed problems and solutions when comparing alternative crop rotations for a Field. The model has been incorporated into a decision Support tool for whole-farm management so growers in the Central Great Plains of the United States can compare alternative crop rotations and how their choice influences farm income, herbicide use, and control of weeds in their fields.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				MAR-APR	2009	57	2					175	186		10.1614/WS-08-036.1							WOS:000264489000007

Population Ecology and Management of Rigid Brome (Bromus rigidus) in Australian Cropping Systems	WEED SCIENCE												Rigid brome is a problematic weed of southern Australian cropping systems. Increased knowledge about the ecology of rigid brome and the influence of management strategies on its seedbank dynamics could facilitate development of more effective weed control programs. A Field study was undertaken to investigate seedbank persistence and the influence of different management strategies on rigid brome control at Lock in South Australia during 2003 to 2005. Seeds of rigid brome were found to persist in the soil for up to 3 yr, with > 20% of the seedbank persisting from one season to the next. Therefore, a single year management program against this weed species is likely to be ineffective and could result in rapid buildup in weed infestations. However, management strategies that combined effective herbicides (Clearfield (TM) technology) and crop competition over consecutive years provided effective control of this troublesome weed. Such cropping systems reduced rigid brome density (1 to 10 plants m(-2)) and seed production (8 to 160 seeds m(-2)) in the final crop of the 3-yr cropping sequence as compared to common grower practice of trifluralin and triasulfuron mixtures (138 plants m(-2); 1,866 seeds m(-2)). These treatment combinations were able to deplete the initial seedbank (1,748 seeds m(-2)) to manageable levels (< 5 seeds m(-2)) within 3 yr. The results of this Study should provide growers with confidence that severe rigid brome infestations can be managed effectively without compromising crop productivity.																	0043-1745					MAR-APR	2009	57	2					202	207		10.1614/WS-08-121.1							WOS:000264489000010

REGENERATION OF COASTAL MARSH VEGETATION IMPACTED BY HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA	WETLANDS												The dynamics of plant regeneration via seed and vegetative spread in coastal wetlands dictate the nature of community reassembly that takes place after hurricanes or sea level rise. The objectives of my project were to evaluate the potential effects of saltwater intrusion and flooding of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on seedling regeneration in coastal wetlands of the Gulf Coast. Specifically 1 tested hypotheses to determine for species in fresh. brackish and salt marshes of the Gulf Coast if 1) the pattern of seed germination and seedling recruitment differed with distance from the shoreline, and 2) seed germination and seedling recruitment for various species were reduced in higher levels of water depth and salinity. Regarding hypothesis 1. seedling densities increased with distance from the shoreline in fresh and brackish water marshes while decreasing with distance from the shoreline in salt marshes. Also to test Hypothesis 1, I used a greenhouse seed bank assay to examine seed germination from seed banks collected at distances from the shoreline in response to various water depths and salinity levels using a nested factorial design. For all marsh types, the influence of water level and salinity on seed germination shifted with distance from the shoreline (i.e., three way interaction of the main effects of distance nested within site, water depth, and salinity). Data from the seed bank assay were also used to test Hypothesis 2. The regeneration of species from fresh. brackish, and salt marshes were reduced in conditions of high salinity and/or water, so that following hurricanes or sea level rise, seedling regeneration could be reduced. Among the species of these coastal marshes, there was some flexibility of response, so that at least some species were able to germinate in either high or low salinity. Salt marshes had a few fresher marsh species in the seed bank that would not germinate without a period of fresh water input (e.g., Sagittaria lancifolia) as well as salt water species (e.g., Avicennia germinans, Salicornia bigelovii). Nevertheless, the species richness of seeds germinating from the seed bank of freshwater marshes was reduced more than in salt marshes, indicating that freshwater marsh regeneration may be more affected by hurricanes and/or sea level rise that salt marshes. From the perspective of short-term seed germination and recruitment following hurricanes, species recruitment is dependent on the post-disturbance conditions of water and salinity.

EFFECTS OF HURRICANE KATRINA ON TREE REGENERATION IN TAXODIUM DISTICHUM SWAMPS OF THE GULF COAST	WETLANDS												Regeneration by seedling recruitment may be important in the long-term patterns of species composition in Taxodium forests, and most Studies suggest that seedling recruitment may increase episodically following hurricanes. This Study investigates the nature of regeneration in Taxodium swamps With various levels of damage by wind following Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall in August 2005 in Louisiana and Mississippi. All sites had a fairly similar range of percent canopy cover following the storms (78.9 to 92.1% canopy cover). At Cat Island, the timing of the hurricane May have contributed to low recruitment of Taxodium distichum seedlings in the growing season following the hurricanes, as based oil long-term presence data from 2003 to 2007. Sites at Pearl River had the highest total tree seedling density of the three locations. Jean Lafitte had the lowest level of tree seedling and sapling density and species richness. and may have been flooded more than the other sites. The invasive species, Triadica sebifera was recruited from the seedling into the sapling class at Jean Lafitte and Pearl River during the study. Overall, the patterns of tree recruitment following the hurricane were variable and depended on location. canopy cover. and flooding.

EPHEMERAL WETLANDS ALONG A SPATIALLY INTERMITTENT RIVER: TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT	WETLANDS												Dryland rivers arc characterized by high spatio-temporal variability ill water resources, With alternating wet and dry reaches and fluctuating stream flow rates. To investigate response to this dynamic. riparian plant communities from perennial, temporally intermittent. and ephemeral-flow reaches of the Hassayampa River and an ephemeral tributary (southwestern USA) were characterized over a three year period. and soil seed banks (emergence method) were assessed. Variance through time in cover and diversity of wetland (hydric) species was lowest at perennial sites and highest at ephemeral flow sites. Wetland plants established along the active channel of the ephemeral reach Following a 10-year recurrence interval flood, and compositional similarity between perennial and ephemeral sites was high during this wet year. About half of the wetland species growing at ephemeral flow sites were present ill floodplain soil seed banks. Wetland species emerged from soils of the ephemeral Hassayampa River (but not of the ephemeral tributary) but their density Mid diversity declined with distance downstream of the perennial reach. Wetland species ill the seed banks of ephemeral-flow sites were a nested subset those at wetter sites, raising the possibility of dispersal from upstream sites. These results indicate that wetlands develop episodically oil ephemeral reaches of spatially intermittent rivers of the Sonoran Desert following high winter runoff, and suggest that the wetland plants arise from local seed banks and off-site sources. The study also suggests that riverine restoration success is sensitive to location within a stream network: upon re-watering, sites closer to perennial reaches will have greater capacity to self-assemble wetland plant communities.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2009	29	1					330	342		10.1672/08-124.1							WOS:000265294500033						
J	Lin, LX; Cao, M				Lin, Luxiang; Cao, Min			Edge effects on soil seed banks and understory vegetation in subtropical and tropical forests in Yunnan, SW China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Human-induced forest edges are common in many forest landscapes throughout the world. Forest management requires an understanding of their ecological consequences. This study addressed the responses of three ecological groups (non-forest species, secondary forest species and primary forest species) in edge soil seed banks and edge understory vegetation, and explored the relationship between the invasion of non-forest species in edge understory vegetation and the accumulation of their seeds in edge soil seed banks. The soil seed banks and understory vegetation were sampled along transects established at the edges of a continuous subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest tract (Lithocarpus xylocarpus forest) bordering anthropogenic grasslands and three tropical seasonal rain forest fragments (Shorea wantianshuea forest) bordering fallows. Species composition in both soil seed banks and understory vegetation showed great difference among edge sites. In soil seed banks, the dominance (relative abundance and relative richness) of each ecological group did not change significantly along the edge to interior gradient. In understory vegetation, the invasion of non-forest species concentrated on the first several meters along the edge to interior gradient. The dominance of secondary forest species decreased with distance from the edge, while the dominance of primary forest species increased with distance from the edge. In forest edge zones, the invasion of a majority of non-forest species in understory vegetation lags behind the accumulation of their seeds in soil seed banks. Forest edges do not act as a good barrier for the penetration of non-forest species seeds. The lack of non-forest species in understory vegetation must then be due to conditions that are not appropriate for their establishment. Therefore, to prevent germination and survival of non-forest species further into the forest, management should focus on maintaining interior forest conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We collected vegetation data (species and their percentage cover) by using quadrat sampling: 10 m x 10 m for swamp forests and 5 m x 5 m forgrassland and sand dunes. We estimated the density of viable seeds of species in the seed bank by counting germinants from soil cores in a germination chamber. Species richness and composition of both aboveground vegetation and the soil seed banks differed significantly among habitats. We identified a total of 23 species from the soil seed bank. Of these, two were true mangrove species and the remaining were non-mangrove species, including halophytic grasses, herbs and mangrove associate species. Our results confirm that mangrove species do not possess a persistent soil seed bank. The presence of high-density non-mangrove and associated mangrove species in the soil seed bank implies that after frequent catastrophic disturbances which limit incoming propagules from adjacent forest stand, large canopy gaps can easily become invaded by non-mangrove and mangrove associate species. This would result in the formation of a cover of non-mangrove species and cryptic ecological degradation in mangrove habitats. We suggest that forest managers should actively consider gap plantations with mangrove species in the large canopy gaps created after catastrophic disturbances to counteract the invasion of non-mangrove species and cryptic ecological degradation.

Seed dynamics of Themeda triandra in the montane grasslands of South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Seed production, viability, dispersal, predation and seed banks of Themeda triandra were determined to assess the potential of the seeds of this indigenous species in the re-establishment of degraded grassland. Annual seed production of T. triandra increased with length of burning rotation, ranging from 21 seeds m(-2) in the annual winter burn to 757 seeds m(-2) in the five-year burn. High predation of seeds (70-98%) and low viability (37% in 15-month-old seeds) contributed to the poor representation of T. triandra in the seed bank (< 1.2%) when compared to the above-ground vegetation (< 29.2%). These attributes, together with its poor dispersal (< 1.75 m), indicate that seed dynamics of T. triandra will play a limited role in the restoration of grasslands in degraded areas.

Soil seed bank evaluation along a degradation gradient in arid rangelands of the Somali region, eastern Ethiopia	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The potential and regeneration capacity of soil seed banks in three eastern Ethiopian rangeland ecosystems (Asbuli grassland or arid grassland, Aydora open savanna or and bush/grassland and Hurso closed savanna or and bush land) were determined over a degradation gradient. Soil samples from 0.09 m 2 blocks (100 mm deep) were spread evenly in plastic containers in the greenhouse and studied over a 1-year period. The aboveground species composition was also compared. Sampling was from rangelands in excellent, good, moderate and poor conditions for each ecosystem. A total of 122 plant species were identified in the soil seed banks, with 32% in the Asbuli grassland, 35% in the Aydora open savanna and 33% in the Hurso closed savanna. Seedlings emerging from soil samples were in the order of decreasing number, grasses, forbs, woody plants, weeds and legumes. Seedling density decreased (P < 0.05) in the soil seed bank with rangeland degradation in all ecosystems. Grass species richness was poorer in the degraded Asbuli grassland ecosystems, but increased in the Aydora open savanna and Hurso closed savanna. The grass species Tragus berteronianus and woody plant Crotolaria albicaulis dominated the botanical composition of the seed bank for all ecosystems with rangeland degradation. Eragrostis cilianensis and Eriochloa nubica were the dominant grass species in the soil seed bank of all ecosystems, regardless of rangeland degradation. There is no adequate evidence to prove that severe degraded rangelands in eastern Ethiopia maintain adequate soil seed banks that would improve the condition of it through restoration. Application of efficient management systems and long-term conservation planning in future is therefore important for sustainable use of the natural recourse and livestock production systems in arid ecosystems.

J	Miao, SL; Zou, CB				Miao, ShiLi; Zou, Chris B.			Seasonal variation in seed bank composition and its interaction with nutrient enrichment in the Everglades wetlands	AQUATIC BOTANY												In the Florida Everglades, nutrient enrichment from agricultural outflow and the change in hydrology have collectively contributed to the expansion of cattails (Typha spp.). To assess the effectiveness of prescribed fire in controlling cattails and to predict vegetation dynamics after the fire, it is important to understand the seasonal variation of the soil seed bank and how the seed bank is affected by nutrient enrichment and fire. This paper investigates the effects of season, nutrient enrichment, and fire on soil seed bank species composition, richness, and density along a nutrient gradient in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA 2A) of the Florida Everglades. Species richness was significantly affected by nutrient enrichment and season but not their interaction. Total seed density, however, was significantly affected by the interaction between nutrient enrichment and season. Yet, at species level, the relationship between seed density, nutrient enrichment and season varied. The highest seed density of cattail occurred in summer at highly enriched sites, but that of sawgrass occurred in fall regardless of enrichment; the seed density of water lily was very low regardless of season and nutrient enrichment, and the highest Amarathus seed density occurred at highly enriched sites year round. Moreover, germination timing differed greatly among species. While cattail seeds had a short incubation period and started to germinate 2-3 days after initiation of the germination assay, sawgrass seeds generally started to germinate 4 weeks later. Further, both the prescribed summer fire at the highly enriched site and the natural winter fire at the moderately enriched site reduced the seed density of cattail but not of sawgrass. Our results suggest that fire application for vegetation recovery in WCA 2A would benefit from explicitly considering seasonal dynamics of the seed bank. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Eckstein, RL; Danihelka, J; Otte, A				Eckstein, Rolf Lutz; Danihelka, Jiri; Otte, Annette			Variation in life-cycle between three rare and endangered floodplain violets in two regions: implications for population viability and conservation	BIOLOGIA												We studied the demography of Viola elatior, V. pumila, and V. stagnina, three rare and endangered Central European floodplain species, to (i) analyse variation in life-cycles among congeners and between regions (Dyje-Morava floodplains, Czech Republic; Upper Rhine, Germany), (ii) to define sensitive stages in the life-cycles, and (iii) to identify possible threats for population viability and species conservation. Matrix models were based on the fate of marked individuals from a total of 27 populations over two years. We analysed population growth rate (lambda), stage distribution, net reproductive rate (R (0)), generation time, age at first reproduction, and elasticity and calculated a life table response experiment (LTRE). Most populations were declining and lambda did not differ between species or regions during the observed interval. Despite higher probabilities for survival and flowering in the Dyje populations, R (0) was higher in the Rhine populations. Also other demographic traits showed consistent differences between regions and/or species. Complex life-cycles and large variation in lambda precluded unequivocal identification of sensitive stages or vital rates for conservation. Variation between regions may be a consequence of differences in habitat quality. Our results suggest that deterministic processes such as reduced management, succession, habitat destruction, and lack of disturbance through reduced or eliminated flooding present the strongest threat for the viability and persistence of populations of the three floodplain violets as compared with stochastic processes. However, the persistent seed bank of the species may buffer populations against environmental variation and represents a reservoir for recovery after resumption of suitable land-use management.

Soil seed bank compositional change constrains biodiversity in an invaded species-rich woodland	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Relationships between plant invasion and the soil seed bank in highly diverse fire adapted mediterranean woodlands are poorly understood, yet critical for that ecosystem's conservation. Within the biodiversity hotspot of southwest Australia we investigated the composition and diversity of the Banksia woodland soil seed bank in good condition (GC), medium condition (MC) and poor condition invaded by the South African perennial species Ehrharta calycina (PCe) and Pelorgonium capitatum (PCp). The investigation assessed three questions: (1) Do soil seed banks of invaded sites have fewer germinants of native species and more germinants of introduced (non-native) species than sites with minimal invasion? (2) Do soil seed banks show shifts in ecological functional types with invasion? (3) Is the soil seed bank of introduced species persistent? Native species germinants, mainly shrubs and perennial herbs, were highest in GC sites and least in poorer condition sites suggesting a reduction in their numbers had occurred over time. Introduced germinants were dominated by perennial and annual grasses, and annual herbs. E. calycina had the greatest seed density (8328 germinants m 2). More introduced than native germinants occurred in the litter. Rapid germination of introduced species (30% in week 1) compared to native species (4% in week 1) provides the capacity for their early dominance. A limited native soil seed bank and dominant persistent introduced soil seed bank represent great challenges for the structural and functional conservation and restoration of woodland ecosystems. This study provides key new knowledge, applicable to a wide range of ecosystems, to help formulate conservation protocols to control dominant introduced species and conserve and restore biodiverse-rich woodlands.

J	Schmiede, R; Donath, TW; Otte, A				Schmiede, Ralf; Donath, Tobias W.; Otte, Annette			Seed bank development after the restoration of alluvial grassland via transfer of seed-containing plant material	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In the attempt to ensure long-term-conservation of flood meadows along the northern Upper Rhine transfer of seed-containing plant material was successfully applied since 2000. In this highly dynamic habitat, many typical plant species rely on a persistent seed bank for re-establishment after disturbance. But in contrast to the re-established above ground vegetation, seed bank composition remains unknown. Thus the main aims of the study were to elucidate the current seed bank composition and to assess patterns of seed and species traits. To this end we sampled above ground vegetation and seed bank on plant material plots and on control plots left to natural recruitment. Although the seed bank was still dominated by agrestal and ruderal plant species, it already contained seeds of transferred species. Analyses revealed that on the plant material plots seed density of plant material species declined significantly with soil depth, just as similarity between above ground vegetation and seed bank declined. In contrast, the seed bank on control plots comprised significantly lower numbers of transferred species. We found a vertical pattern of seed bank composition: in general, the upper seed bank layer comprised more elongated and large seeds of long-lived, competitive species able to build up transient seed bank. The lower soil layer was dominated by seeds of short-lived, agrestal and ruderal species, producing small, round and long-term persistent seeds. The present study shows that the build up of a seed bank typical of flood meadows is a time-consuming process. Thus restorative management in the early phase of vegetation development should focus on fostering high seed production of transferred species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Moore, KA				Moore, Kara A.			Fluctuating patch boundaries in a native annual forb: the roles of niche and dispersal limitation	ECOLOGY												Abiotic, biotic, and dispersal constraints jointly control the spatial distributions of species, but few studies have directly evaluated how these forces interact and vary over time to create dynamic spatial distributions. Through three years of observation and two years of field manipulation, I investigated simultaneous constraints on the spatial distribution of Lupinus nanus, a native annual legume that grows in dense patches in California grasslands. I transplanted L. nanus across its own patch boundaries, yet within apparently suitable habitat, and assessed the demographic success of naturally occurring and seeded plants in plots with and without competitor removal in years that varied in temperature and rainfall. Core sites were defined as those consistently densely occupied, whereas peripheral sites were densely occupied only during some years, and exterior sites were consistently unoccupied or very sparsely occupied. Site types (core, periphery, and exterior) differed in soil moisture, P, and NO3. Competition limited emergence in all site types in the dry/warm year and in patch peripheries in the wet/cool year. Population fitness (seeds produced per seed added) was >1.0 in cores during all years. Peripheral sites had fitness near replacement in the wet/cool year, which was greatly increased by competition removal. Exterior fitness was <1.0 in both experimental years, regardless of seed addition and competitor removal. Seed addition did not increase site-specific fitness, and a seed bank was found to be present in all site types. Herbivory was greater in patch cores and peripheries than in exteriors. Soil variation exerted the most consistent control over patch limits, while competition played an intermittent role in excluding Lupinus from patch peripheries. The dynamic distribution of L. nanus is the product of temporal variation in specific abiotic and biotic niche axes, primarily soil characteristics and competition, rather than dispersal limitation.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				FEB	2009	90	2					378	387		10.1890/07-1753.1							WOS:000263570800013	19323222

A different model to explain delayed germination	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Goal: To provide an alternative to the usual bet-hedging explanation for delayed germination, one that takes account of known facts about germination in stable, Fine-grained environments. Context: Small patches with local environmental conditions (microhabitats) such that seedlings can establish themselves are customarily called safe sites. Key assumptions: We locus on a single species. Its safe sites become available randomly. Seeds that germinate Outside safe sites all die as seedlings. All seeds are equal, i.e. their probability of dying over the year and probabilities to germinate when the right season is there do not depend on their age or my other aspect of their individual history. Moreover, we make the standard assumption of ESS theory that the population is genetically homogeneous but for the occasional mutant 'testing the ESS'. There is a trade-off between the germination probability in safe sites and the probability not to germinate outside safe sites. For germination strategies close to the ESS, the environment does not fluctuate. Procedure: Start with a simple population model, in which the yearly seed survival and the fraction of the area covered by safe sites are fixed quantities. For this model, derive an optimization principle that finds the Evolutionarily Steady Strategy vector consisting of the probabilities to germinate in safe sites and elsewhere. Using this optimization principle, analyse the effect of various trade-offs using Levins' fitness set technique. Analyse how the results extend to ESSs for general life histories and community dynamics subject only to the key assumptions. Conclusion: Seeds in safe sites should not all germinate on the first opportunity if the relationship between the probability to germinate in safe sites and the probability to germinate elsewhere is accelerating and has a sufficiently steep slope at the highest germination probabilities.

Vegetation heterogeneity in Monte Desert ecosystems: A multi-scale approach linking patterns and processes	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We review the current state of research on vegetation heterogeneity in the Monte Desert at scales varying from landscape to intra-patch. Different factors are related to vegetation heterogeneity at every scale. At a coarse scale (i.e. landscapes and communities) vegetation heterogeneity is commonly determined by abiotic factors, whereas biotic interactions usually influence fine scale (patch, intrapatch) heterogeneity. Communities are distributed at the landscape scale according to differences in precipitation, topography and soil attributes. On the other hand, there is evidence that the spatial pattern of plant patches within communities is determined by runon -runoff processes, although biotic influences such as grazing can induce changes in the spatial pattern of patches when plant cover is strongly reduced. In the same way, at patch and intrapatch scales, biotic interactions (i.e. plant-plant interactions, grazing) determine the size and the species composition of plant patches as well as the distribution of species inside plant patches. However, the mechanisms operating behind such biotic interactions at small scales are commonly related to plant-induced changes in the physical environment. We also found evidence of cross-scale interactions, feedbacks, and non-linear effects such as those induced by grazing disturbance. Our analysis showed some regional differences in patterns and processes related to vegetation heterogeneity along the Monte Desert which can be ascribed to climatic and taxonomic variation among areas. Although information about vegetation heterogeneity and its causes and consequences in the Monte Desert is abundant, some areas where knowledge is scarce are detailed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Biological interactions at different spatial scales in the Monte desert of Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In this review, we compiled published results on biological interactions at different spatial scales in the Monte desert of Argentina and identified gaps in current knowledge, We presented evidence of competitive and facilitative plant-plant conspecific and heterospecific interactions, and plant-soil-microbes interactions in relation to the abiotic environment at the fine patch-scale. We also showed evidence of animal-animal interactions and plant-animal interactions at the community scale through study cases involving both native and introduced herbivores. Moreover, we identified bottom-up and top-down forces governing the interactions between granivores (birds, ants, and small mammals) and seed availability/production at the community scale. At the landscape scale, we discussed feedbacks between domestic grazers and the spatial patterns of resources and their interrelationships with processes occurring at other scales. We concluded that research has steadily increased during the last 6 years but knowledge on biological interactions in the Monte desert is still scarce, particularly at a landscape scale.

Propagule pressure and resource availability determine plant community invasibility in a temperate forest understorey	OIKOS												Few field experiments have examined the effects of both resource availability and propagule pressure on plant community invasibility. Two non-native forest species, a herb and a shrub (Hesperis matronalis and Rhamnus cathartica, respectively), were sown into 60 1-m(2) sub-plots distributed across three plots. These contained reconstructed native plant communities in a replaced surface soil layer in a North American forest interior. Resource availability and propagule pressure were manipulated as follows: understorey light level (shaded/unshaded), nutrient availability (control/fertilized), and seed pressures of the two non-native species (control/low/high). Hesperis and Rhamnus cover and the above-ground biomass of Hesperis were significantly higher in shaded sub-plots and at greater propagule pressures. Similarly, the above-ground biomass of Rhamnus was significantly increased with propagule pressure, although this was a function of density. In contrast, of species that seeded into plots from the surrounding forest during the growing season, the non-native species had significantly greater cover in unshaded sub-plots. Plants in these unshaded sub-plots were significantly taller than plants in shaded sub-plots, suggesting a greater fitness. Total and non-native species richness varied significantly among plots indicating the importance of fine-scale dispersal patterns. None of the experimental treatments influenced native species. Since the forest seed bank in our study was colonized primarily by non-native ruderal species that dominated understorey vegetation, the management of invasions by non-native species in forest understoreys will have to address factors that influence light levels and dispersal pathways.

COMPOSITION OF THE SEED BANK IN DRAWDOWN AREAS OF NAVIGATION POOL 8 OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												In an effort to enhance aquatic plant production and habitat diversity on the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), resource managers considered water level reduction as a management tool to increase the area of emergent and submersed aquatic vegetation by natural seed germination. To quantify the availability of seed, we assessed the potential seed bank of selected areas of Navigation Pool 8 of the UMR from substrate samples collected in spring 2000. We tested these samples for viable seed content under four hydrologic conditions: dry, moist, shallow flooded and submerged. Forty-seven species were identified in the seed bank, including 27 obligate wetland, 10 facultative wetland and 7 upland species. Dominant taxa within the seed bank included Sagittaria spp., Lindcrnia dubia. Zosterella dubia, Cyperus spp., Eragrostis spp. and Leersia oryzoides. Of the four hydrologic treatments, moist substrates had the greatest species diversity and were the most productive, yielding an average density of 1420 seedlings m(-2). Emergent and submersed aquatic species were widely distributed, each type occurring in more than 90% of the samples. Timing of seedling germination varied among species and has implications for scheduling drawdowns to promote establishment of desired species. Seed bank results were correlated with the vegetation response on substrates exposed during a reduction of water levels of Pool 8 during summer 2001. Experimentally determining the composition and viability of seed banks from drawdown areas provides information useful in predicting the types of vegetation that may develop on exposed substrates. Further, these findings provide resource managers a better understanding of the potential					Kenow, Kevin/0000-0002-3062-5197												1535-1459					FEB	2009	25	2					194	207		10.1002/rra.1118							WOS:000263489200007						
J	Schmidt, I; Leuschner, C; Molder, A; Schmidt, W				Schmidt, Inga; Leuschner, Christoph; Moelder, Andreas; Schmidt, Wolfgang			Structure and composition of the seed bank in monospecific and tree species-rich temperate broad-leaved forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												How tree species diversity affects ecosystem functioning is a topic of intensive research. This study compares monospecific and species-rich broad-leaved forests under similar bedrock and climate conditions for the size and composition of their seed bank. We tested the hypotheses that (i) the actual herb-layer vegetation has an only weak influence on the composition of the seed bank, (ii) the species diversity of the seed bank increases with tree-layer diversity, and (iii) tree species forming a more persistent litter layer reduce the number of germinating seeds, The number of seeds and their species composition were investigated in soil cores taken from three soil depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm; n = 4, with each 6 sub-samples) in 9 study plots differing in tree species diversity (3 monospecific Fagus plots, 3 plots with Fagus, Fraxinus and Tilia, and 3 plots with Fagus, Fraxinus, Tilia, Carpinus and Acer). Tree species diversity had a much stronger influence on the size and composition of the seed bank than herb-layer diversity or composition, the latter revealing only a low similarity to the corresponding seed bank. The number and species diversity of emerging seedlings decreased significantly with the amount of acidifying Fagus litter, but increased with litter mass of Tilia and other trees with nutrient-rich, rapidly decomposing litter. We conclude that tree species diversity does not influence the seed bank through effects on herb-layer composition, but mostly through differential disturbance histories of the stands and litter quality effects on germination and soil chemistry. From the contrasting effects of Fagus and Tilia leaf litter, it appears that effects of tree species identity are more relevant than influences of tree species diversity itself.

Land-Use Sequence Optimiser (LUSO): A simulation model for analysing strategic and tactical decisions regarding 'break crops' in agricultural rotations	18TH WORLD IMACS CONGRESS AND MODSIM09 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: INTERFACING MODELLING AND SIMULATION WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES					Combined IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation	JUL 13-17, 2009	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	IMACS, MSSANZ, CSIRO, Australian Math Sci Inst, Griffith Univ, eWater Cooperat Res Ctr, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, HEMA Consulting, Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat, Int Council Ind Appl Math, Int Soc Grid Generat, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Japan Soc Simulat Technol, Pacific Rim Math Assoc, Rutgers, State Univ New Jersey				To grow beans, or not to grow beans, that is the question! Or in other words: how should I use this piece of land in front of me? This paper presents a preliminary design and implementation of a model called Land-Use Sequence Optimiser (LUSO). The model was designed to be a tool for finding optimal land-use sequences, with a particular focus on analysing the role of break crops within these optimal sequences. The model can also be used to analyse the sensitivity of optimal land-use sequences and the place of various break crops in these sequences to changes in model parameters. The focus of this paper is on describing the design concept and modelling approach used for LUSO and on showing how it can be used for analysing a problem, rather than giving details on parameterisations or results for particular cases. LUSO can be thought of as a state-and-transition model for valuing land-use sequences. It incorporates representations of weed biology and population dynamics, plant disease burden, soil nitrogen status, and a range of crop and management options. The model must be provided with a list of possible land-uses, each defined by a set of parameter values, and another set of 'general' parameter values that are not specific to a particular land-use. It is based on a one-year time step and assumes that every year is an 'average' year. The current version of the model represents a single land-use area, such as a paddock, and simulates how the state of this land-use area changes from year to year according to different land-uses. This model state includes representations of the number of seeds in the weed seed bank, and measures of disease burden and soil nitrogen status. The state is then used to predict the production and cost of the land use, which then provides an over-all long-term value for the land-use sequence. Several other routines and methods have been added to the basic land-use simulation - including optimisation and sensitivity analysis routines. The optimisation routines can be used to find answers to longer-term strategic questions, such as what is the optimal long-term sequence of crops to grow, or short-term tactical decisions, such as whether to harvest the crop that is currently being grown. The sensitivity analysis routines can be used to analyse how sensitive these answers are to various model parameters, which in turn allows an analysis of what factors are most important in choosing between tactical and strategic options. To illustrate these ideas, an example problem involving a tactical decision is presented; a farmer is faced with the decision between either harvesting a crop for immediate profit or sacrificing the crop and the immediate profit for longer-term benefits. A description of how LUSO was applied to analysing this problem is provided, together with sample output. I conclude the paper by pointing out that the strength of the LUSO modelling approach is its relative simplicity, transparency and efficiency. This means that it is relatively easy and quick to both adapt the model to address a new question, and then use the model to carry out the analysis. I also point out some directions where this approach could be usefully extended in future.

(Pentaphylacaceae) from a Restinga Forest	ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA												(Germination of Ternstroemia brasiliensis Cambess. (Pentaphylacaceae) from a Restinga Forest). The main purpose of this work was to study the germination of Ternstroemia brasiliensis seeds both in laboratory and field conditions in order to contribute to understanding the regeneration ecology of the species. The seeds were dispersed with relatively high moisture content and exhibit a recalcitrant storage behaviour because of their sensitivity to dehydration and to dry storage. The germinability is relatively high and is not affected either by light or aril presence. The absence of the dormancy and the low sensitivity to far red light can enable to seeds to promptly germinate under Restinga forest canopy, not forming a soil seed bank. The constant temperatures of 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C were considered optimum for germination of T. brasiliensis seeds. Temperature germination parameters can be affected by light conditions. The thermal-time model can be a suitable tool for investigating the temperature dependence on the seed germination of T. brasiliensis. The germination characteristics de T. brasiliensis are typical of non pioneer species, and help to explain the distribution of the species. Germination of T. brasiliensis seeds in Restinga environment may be not limited by light and temperature; otherwise the soil moisture content can affect the seed germination.

DURING XEROTHERMIC GRASSLAND OVERGROWING	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The study aimed to determine the long-term changes of the Senecio macrophyllus M.BIEB. population traits: the abundance, reproduction mode, individual fecundity, seed rain and recruitment of new genets in the course of xerothermic grassland overgrowing. The study had also the applied goal: to estimate the chances of 'special care' species to survive in the changing environment without management regime for the maintenance of grassland. The model object was the island population of large-leaved ragwort on Biala Gora (the White Mountain) near Tomaszow Lubelski, South-East Poland. To achieve these aims I used the following sets of data: phytosociological releves made in plant communities in an interval of 16-18 years; repeated elaboration of the numbers and life-stage structure of the population, both by non-surface and surface method; observation of plants' life cycle in 50 labelled genets; population reproduction and seed rain amounts. The area of an open xerothermic grassland decreased due to the process of overgrowing by bushes which was accompanied by the increasing coverage of forest and meadow herbs as well as monocotyledons, mainly Brachypodium pinnatum and Calamagrostis epigejos. The abundance of the S. macrophyllus population noticable diminished. The flowering mode has been changing during years from an oscillation to a chaotic type which caused the significant decreasing of the individual fecundity, population reproduction and seed rain. In last years it was reflected in the interruption of juveniles' recruitment.																	0001-6977						2009	78	3					247	256		10.5586/asbp.2009.032							WOS:000270599600011

EFFECT OF PERIOD OF CULTIVATION ON THE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF WEED SEEDS IN THE SOIL PROFILE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												An experiment was laid down in the greenhouse to determine the distribution of weed seeds at different soil depths and period of cultivation on the distribution of weed seed bank in the soil profile in Muzarabani. Soil samples from different depth levels (0-10, 10.1-20, 20.1-30 cm) were collected soon after harvesting from three different sites namely Gutsa, Mufudzi and Muringazuva of Muzarabani district. The soil samples were put in trays in the greenhouse and watered after every two days to field capacity. Weed seedlings were identified, counted, recorded and discarded for a period of 3 months. Soil samples were disturbed every week to allow more germination of dormant weeds. Depth (P=0.000) and site (P=0.005) had highly significant effects on the total number of weeds that emerged from the soil samples. The 0-10 cm of the soil had the highest weed seedlings that emerged. There was an equal weed seed distribution in the 10-20 cm and the 20-30 cm of the soil. Gutsa had the largest seed bank and there was no significant difference in seed bank size between Mufudzi and Muringazuva.

To serve such purpose, the Danjiangkou Reservoir Dam will be increased from its present 162.0 m to 176.6 m, and its regular water level from 157 m to 170 m above mean sea level. Vegetation development in the new reservoir margins is therefore one of great environmental concerns. To explore the potential origin of species in the present reservoir margin vegetation, we investigated and quantified the composition in the soil seed banks and established vegetations of the reservoir margins and its upstream- and downstream-wetlands. In both existent vegetation and seed banks, most species and seedlings were found in upstream wetlands, followed by reservoir margins and downstream wetlands. Seedling density of downstream wetlands was reduced by 75-80% compared to upstream wetlands and reservoir margins. This suggests that presence of the dam reduced the diversity and abundance of downstream propagules. Sorensen's coefficient and the comparisons of rare species indicated that the seed bank composition of reservoir margins was evidently associated with upstream wetlands. It implies that hydrochorous transport of seeds from the upstream catchment is critical for plant colonization of the reservoir margins. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seed Reserves Diluted During Surface Soil Reclamation in Eastern Mojave Desert	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Surface soil reclamation is used to increase the re-establishment of native vegetation following disturbance through preservation and eventual replacement of the indigenous seed reserves. Employed widely in the mining industry, soil reclamation has had variable success in re-establishing native vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions. We tested whether variable success could be due in part to a decrease of seed reserves during the reclamation process by measuring the change in abundance of germinable seed when surface soil was mechanically collected, stored in a soil pile for 4 months, and reapplied upon completion of a roadway. Overall seed reserve declines amounted to 86% of the original germinable seed in the soil. The greatest decrease in seed reserves occurred during soil collection (79% of original reserves), compared to the storage and reapplication stages. At nearby sites where stored surface soil had been reapplied, no perennial plant cover occurred from 0.5 to 5 years after application and1% cover after 7 years compared to 5% cover in nearby undisturbed areas. The reduction in abundance of germinable seed during reclamation was primarily due to dilution of seed reserves when deeper soil fractions without seed were mixed with the surface soil during collection. Unless more precise techniques of surface soil collection are utilized, soil reclamation alone as a means for preserving native seed reserves is a method ill-suited for revegetating disturbed soils with a shallow seed bank, such as those found in the Mojave Desert.																	1532-4982	1532-4990					2009	23	1					1	13	PII 907831561	10.1080/15324980802598698							WOS:000262476000001

Using hierarchies of cause to inform conservation of a naturally rare but critically endangered shrub Lasiopetalum pterocarpum (Malvaceae s.l.)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Understanding the causes of rarity and ways of managing populations of rare species is essential for their successful conservation. The present study applies the conceptual model of a hierarchy of causes to Lasiopetalum pterocarpum E. M. Benn. & K. Shep. (a critically endangered species) to understand better its reproductive and ecological attributes, possible reasons for its rarity and to determine whether this model assists in developing management strategies. L. pterocarpum subpopulations from Serpentine National Park were censused to record abundance, plant health, phenology, flower and fruit production and the presence of any seed bank. These characteristics were matched to criteria in the hierarchies of cause model. There was no evidence of recent seedling recruitment at any subpopulation. Hand-pollination produced a flower-to-fruit conversion proportion similar to that found in the field and self- and cross-pollinations produced virtually the same fruit set. Seed store in soil from beneath the native subpopulations and at a translocation site showed seed was patchily distributed and infrequent. L. pterocarpum is an obligate seeder, killed by. re and dependent on disturbance to break seed dormancy. However, smoke has no effect on germination. Seed production does not constrain population growth, because seedling regeneration after. re in 1999 was prolific at sites where plants had been growing. In the hierarchies of cause framework, the main causes of rarity for this species are taxon ecology, life-history strategy and stochasticity. Thus, concentrating active management on factors related to life history such as mosaic patch burning, fencing after. re to exclude vertebrate grazers, weed control and establishment of translocated populations will aid the preservation of this species in the wild.

Germinability of seeds stored in capsules on plants of two myrtaceous shrubs: differences among age cohorts and between species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Canopy-stored seed banks are a common trait among members of several plant families in sclerophyllous woodlands of Australia and South Africa, with their fruits usually opening in response to damage or fire. Unknown is whether the degree of dormancy and of germination differs among age cohorts in seeds stored on the mother plant. We examined the extent and speed of germination from two intensely serotinous myrtaceous species, Callistemon glaucus and Calothamnus quadrifidus, for seed held in capsules for up to 9 years. Germination of both species differed significantly among age cohorts (P < 0.0001). However, no consistent increase in germination over a range of temperatures with storage was found, suggesting that no after-ripening occurred and that seeds were non-dormant at maturity. Differences among cohorts may be due to pre-conditioning. Significant (P <= 0.0214) differences occurred between the small-seeded Callistemon and the large-seeded Calothamnus. Germination was (1) optimum at >= 20 degrees C for Callistemon but at < 20 degrees C for Calothamnus, (2) 9-12 days earlier for Callistemon than for Calothamnus, and (3) higher in light than in darkness for Callistemon but equal in both light conditions for Calothamnus. While germination of the species differed in important features, we would expect synchronous germination of all age cohorts to occur following fire and the onset of regular rainfall.

Long-term changes in understorey vegetation in the absence of wildfire in south-east dry sclerophyll forests	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Wildfire has shaped historic and contemporary vegetation assemblages in Australia. Ecological research has generally focussed on the effects of frequent. re on plant assemblages, with less attention given to the changes that occur in the absence of wild. re. Here we examine changes in understorey assemblages in dry sclerophyll forest catchments where wild. res have not occurred since 1973 and 1979 to determine if the initial floristics model applies. Understorey species (< 2m height) richness peaked approximately 5 years after fire with an average of 22.7 +/- 0.4 (s.e.) species per 10 m(2). These values declined throughout the study period resulting in an average of 13.4 +/- 0.5 (s.e.) species per 10 m(2) 33 years after fire. Similarly, significant shifts in the understorey community composition were seen with increasing time since wildfire. These changes were attributed to a decrease in 40 species (24 resprouters, 16 obligate seeders) and an increase in 11 species (10 resprouters, 1 obligate seeder). Large shrub species richness (> 2m height) and stem density increased steadily until 10-15 years post-wildfire at which point they remained stable at similar to 3.2 species per 100 m(2). In the absence of wildfire, these forests undergo significant changes in understorey/large shrub communities consistent with the initial floristics model.

J	Panetta, FD				Panetta, F. Dane			Seed persistence of the invasive aquatic plant, Gymnocoronis spilanthoides (Asteraceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Seed persistence of Gymnocoronis spilanthoides (D. Don) DC.; Asteraceae (Senegal tea), a serious weed of freshwater habitats, was examined in relation to burial status and different soil moisture regimes over a 3-year period. Seeds were found to be highly persistent, especially when buried. At the end of the experiment, 42.0%, 27.3% and 61.4% of buried seeds were viable following maintenance at field capacity, water logged and fluctuating (cycles of 1 week at field capacity followed by 3 weeks' drying down) soil moisture conditions, respectively. Comparable viability values for surface-situated seeds were similar to 3% over all soil moisture regimes. Predicted times to 1% viability are 16.2 years for buried seed and 3.8 years for surface-situated seed. Persistence was attributed primarily to the absence of light, a near-obligate requirement for germination in this species, although secondary dormancy was induced in some seeds. Previous work has demonstrated low fecundity in field populations of G. spilanthoides, which suggests that soil seed banks may not be particularly large. However, high levels of seed persistence, combined with ostensibly effective dispersal mechanisms, indicate that this weed may prove a difficult target for regional or state-wide eradication.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2009	57	8					670	674		10.1071/BT09187							WOS:000274317400005						
J	Albrecht, H; Auerswald, K				Albrecht, Harald; Auerswald, Karl			Seed traits in arable weed seed banks and their relationship to land-use changes	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Recent studies have shown that relatively undisturbed plant communities, such as woodland and pasture, have generally low seed persistence, while seed longevity in frequently disturbed habitats, such as arable fields, is high. In addition, seed mass and shape were found to be closely linked to the living conditions of plants. The objective of the present study was to show how farming practice modifies these seed traits in the arable weed seed bank. On 67.4 ha of arable land at the Scheyern Research Station in Germany, conventional arable use was converted to organic farming, to a reduced-tillage system and to set-aside. During the six subsequent years, seed bank data were collected at 283 sampling points to analyse the effects of (1) the farming systems (long-term effects), (2) individual crops (short-term effects) and (3) vegetation cover. Set-aside arable land favoured a disk- or needle-like seed shape, greater mass and reduced seed longevity. Similarly, organic farming significantly increased seed mass and decreased longevity. Therefore, both types of land use reduced the selection for small and persistent seeds with a spherical shape. By contrast, an increasing persistence under reduced tillage suggested a higher selection pressure. The most consistent effect was that seed longevity increased with tillage frequency, independent from the farming system. Both high seed masses and a compact seed shape were frequently associated with a high crop cover. The results prove that beyond the properties of living plants the arable farming practice also significantly impacts the seed traits in the soil seed bank. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Controlling encroachment by grazing is the most promising prospect at this time, but the impact of small domestic ruminants on the population dynamics of dominant shrubby species is still poorly understood. To control the rapid densification of dominant shrub populations means that we have to focus on the early stages of shrub colonisation. In this paper, we present a modelling approach that includes deterministic matrix modelling to understand demography strategy at the very beginning of shrub Population growth and to identify potential targeted life stages for control. We collected demographic data over a period of 5 years on the European dominant shrub, Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom; Fabaceae), which is often part of the heathlands that establish themselves on former permanent grasslands in Europe. Our results reveal a very high variation in flowering frequency between years and a large contribution of the seed bank to the total number of seedlings that emerge each),car. Modelling shows that population growth is very vigorous and is not stopped by repeated "bad years" for seed production. Sensitivity analyses indicate that early life stage survival (seedling, juvenile) has the greatest impact on population growth. These results make it possible to identify juveniles as one of the best targets for control since they combine a high degree of sensitivity in terms of population demography, good palatability for domestic herbivores and easy accessibility within a management schedule.

However, ancient land use has been recently identified to affect plant communities within ancient forests. An ancient holloway, i.e., a U-shaped sunken road, embedded in the Meerdaal forest was used to establish whether microtopographical changes brought about by the former road use would structure the forest vegetation and seed bank. Seven transects were set out perpendicular to the holloway over a one kilometer stretch, to test whether the sunken road would locally shape the patterns in abiotic conditions, vegetation and seed bank. Soil pH was significantly higher within the holloway, which was reflected in a higher plant cover, ancient forest and overall species richness. Vegetation composition was altered by the road microtopography, though secondary to a prevailing fertility gradient with distance along the holloway. While seed bank characteristics did not differ between road and non-road plots, seed bank composition did vary according to the microtopography. However, the extant vegetation caused the observed seed bank pattern. The holloway shapes understory community patterns in vegetation and seed bank. As the sunken road cuts into deeper calcareous soil layers at the bottom of the road, this gave way to differential acidification (different buffer ranges) in function of the microtopography, allowing the persistence of favorable growth conditions within the holloway. Hence, these conditions allow the survival of ancient forest species within the road in a forest matrix made increasingly unsuitable through severe acidification.

In restoring degraded forests, the first step is to quantify the actual and potential levels of natural regeneration, examining the role of soil seed banks as propagule donors. In this study, we assessed the composition, density and spatial distribution of the soil seed bank and seedling populations in dry deciduous and gallery forests of the Chacocente Wildlife Refuge in Nicaragua. A total of 17 species were found in the soil seed bank of the deciduous forest, with a viable seed density of 466 seeds/m(2). In the gallery forest, a total of 24 species were found in the soil seed bank with a viable seed density of 1257 seeds/m(2). The spatial analysis of the soil seed bank revealed clumped and uniform distributions in both forests, depending on the species. The total seedling density in the deciduous and gallery forests was 62 50 and 6600 individuals/ha, respectively. The spatial distribution of seedling populations varied from clumped to uniform depending on the species. The similarity between the soil seed bank, seedling layer and above-ground vegetation was low in both forest sites. It may be concluded that the number of seed bank species and the quantity of soil-stored seeds are relatively low. Regeneration was abundant in some species, but poor in many others. The natural regeneration process should therefore be assisted through direct seeding, planting seedlings and manipulation of the site to improve environmental conditions for seedling establishment and growth.																	0006-579X	1777-5760					2009		299					49	62									WOS:000266156700005

To suppress weeds, it is suggested to sow high diversity seed mixtures composed by non-weedy disturbance tolerant and generalist members of the biological flora. Available seed ecological knowledge on these species is more or less satisfactory regarding seed weight, seed shape and dispersal type, however, more research needed to learn their soil seed bank types, germination and seed storage requirements. To determine exact composition of multi-species seed mixtures applicable in practice, case studies should be conducted under major climatic and soil conditions.

The detection of spatial structure in populations and communities: An empirical case study	ECOSCIENCE					Symposium on Natural Hazards and Natural Disturbances in Mountain Forest - Challenges and Opportunities for Silviculture	SEP 18-21, 2007	Trento, ITALY					The presence of spatial autocorrelation in abundance and richness patterns has been recognised for some time. Evaluation of the tools to quantify patterning often uses simulated data that may be unrealistic or empirical field data where the presence and cause of structuring are unknown. We examine the efficacy of spatial pattern analysis for detecting pattern in empirical data at a fine scale using a field-based mesocosm experiment of a Drosophilidae community associated with decaying fruit. The mesocosm comprised 2 microclimate treatments that generated a particular expected spatial pattern in abundance and species richness. The magnitude of Moran's autocorrelation coefficients (I) was < 0.3 (i.e., low). However, the detected pattern was unaffected. Low Moran's I values did not result from low sample sizes, neither was the significance of Moran's I falsely inflated by large sample sizes. Examination of published I values revealed that autocorrelation values between 0.1 and 0.3 are common in empirical data, particularly at fine (lag distance <= 1 m) spatial scales. Pooling temporal samples strengthened the detected output without affecting the form of spatial pattern. We conclude that "weak" responses provide a valuable basis for mechanistic hypothesis generation, especially at fine spatial scales, and that the strength of spatial structure is likely to be determined by the spatial scale of the study.

J	Yu, SL; Bell, D; Bar Kutiel, P				Yu, Shunli; Bell, Dorothy; Bar Kutiel, Pua			Impact of microhabitats on the heterogeneity of seedling emergence in a Mediterranean coastal sand dunes community	ECOSCIENCE												Seedling emergence and establishment was monitored in 3 microhabitats during growing seasons in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune community in Poleg Stream Nature Reserve, Israel. Seedling emergence varied temporally among the 3 microhabitats, with a delay in the timing of seedling emergence in shrub understoreys due to lower soil average temperatures and lower irradiance. In contrast, seedling emergence on trails was advanced because of more intense irradiance and higher soil temperatures on their more exposed soil surfaces. Microhabitats showed significant differences in individual densities, species diversity, and species richness of total seedlings (P < 0.0001). Open areas generally possessed significantly greater total seedling densities, species diversity, and species richness compared to shrub understoreys and trails. Twelve key species and 5 functional groups showed significant microhabitat preferences. Seedling patterns indicated that emergence responses could account for observed patterns of variation in the 5 functional groups and dominant species populations. In this semi- arid ecosystem, negative interactions between the shrub canopy species (white weeping broom) and its understorey occurred for seedling establishment because of lower seed densities in the seed bank, a larger amount of litter on the soil surface, and the dense woody canopy. On the trails, trampling decreased plant diversity and discouraged the establishment of most functional groups and key species except annual grasses and Polycarpon succulentum and Cutandia philistaea. The variability in seedling response patterns for the different microhabitats will assist in understanding the patchy regeneration strategies of this coastal sand dune community and provide a basis for vegetation management.

J	Ghermandi, L; Gonzalez, S				Ghermandi, Luciana; Gonzalez, Sofia			Diversity and functional groups dynamics affected by drought and fire in Patagonian grasslands	ECOSCIENCE												During 1998-1999 a severe drought occurred in northwestern Patagonia that provoked an extensive wildfire. We monitored vegetation cover and the soil seed bank to study the diversity and functional group gap dynamics in burned and unburned sites. Species were grouped into 3 functional groups: forbs, fugitive species, and annual grasses. Post-drought vegetation recovered quickly due to a rainy spring in the second year but decreased after a dry and warm spring in the third year. These patterns underline the close relationship that exists between phenological phases and meteorological variables. Drought decreased richness but did not affect the presence of stress-tolerant species, whereas fire increased richness by allowing the establishment of fugitive species. Species in the fugitive functional group may be fire adapted and depend on seed accumulation in the seed bank (storage effect) to coexist with other gap species. Forbs exhibited their highest vegetation cover and seed bank density in the unburned site. Global climate change suggests an increase in the frequency and amplitude of El Nino/Southern Oscillation phenomena that, in northwestern Patagonia, are related to the occurrence of drought, fire, and changes in vegetation dynamics.																	1195-6860	2376-7626					2009	16	3					408	417		10.2980/16-3-3264							WOS:000270372000014

Ecology and health in risk analysis of polluted soils	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISK V	WIT Transactions on Biomedicine and Health				5th International Conference on Impact of Environmental Factors on Health	2009	Wessex Inst Technol, New Forest Campus, New Forest, ENGLAND		Wessex Inst Technol, New Forest Campus			Risk analysis can be used as a scientific tool for addressing the health of ecosystems. Here we describe a protocol for characterizing risks in the ecosystems of several polluted soil scenarios in the Madrid Community (Central Spain). Our starting hypothesis was that to recover the health of degraded ecosystems that could affect public health, an ecotoxicological diagnosis of each site is required. The sites we considered were industrial and urban solid waste landfills and abandoned mines. This diagnosis revealed many interacting processes that need to be assessed if we are to realistically address the issue of restoring impacts on ecosystems affected by soil pollution. These processes are: 1) Geo-edaphic processes, requiring the analysis of geomorphologic factors; 2) Chemical-physical processes occurring in the soils, such as the release of anions or cations; 3) Erosion-pollution processes that require an understanding of the autoecology of plant species that could be used for remediation in scenarios with this dual problem; 4) Bioaccumulation-biodegradation processes, requiring the integration of microbiology and plant biology tools to assess any toxic effects on soil and plant subsystem populations; 5) Edaphic-bioavailability processes, since different ecotypes show a varying response to a given soil; 6) Population-ecopathology development processes, essential for both cultivated and native plant species comprising trophic networks; 7) Secondary-primary ecological succession processes, a commonly observed mechanism in old landfills sealed with soils from the surroundings-ecological knowledge of reference communities is essential for a good ecotoxicological diagnosis.; 8) Climate change-global warming processes, of utmost importance for revegetating polluted soils since success will depend both on the soil seed bank and on stochastic processes.

An experimental seed bank study of Atriplex tatarica (Chenopodiaceae)	FLORA												Atriplex tatarica is an annual, early successional, facultative halophilic species of frequently disturbed human-made habitats in Central and Eastern Europe. We investigated to what extent the plants grown from seeds extracted from soil seed bank differed genetically to mature aboveground plants in experimental populations of A. tatarica over two successive years. At each of five plots 50 aboveground plants and 50 plants extracted from seeds stored in soil were assayed for allozyme analysis in 2003 and 2004. At the start of experiment, we introduced 1000 seeds of the study species into each of five experimental plots. While the species dominated in all of the experimental plots in the first year, the second year A. tatarica coverage decreased dramatically. Overall allele frequencies of soil seeds and mature plants showed significant differences between life history stages in both years, but not within years in soil seeds as well as mature plants stages. While mature plants showed a significantly greater amount of single and multilocus heterozygosity in both consecutive years, comparison between years did not yield any significant differences. In the same way, despite a relatively large seed bank the species population genetic parameters, i.e. allelic richness (A), observed heterozygosity (H-o), gene diversity (H-s), inbreeding coefficient (F-IS) and fixation index (F-ST), did not change over years between as well as within life history stages. The soil seeds and mature plants significantly differed in H-o, H-s and F-IS, while the A and F-ST were not significantly different between life history stages. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) How large are soil seed banks along the successional gradient? (2) Do the seed banks reflect the actual standing vegetation or do they remember earlier successional stages or do they represent already the next successional stage? Soil samples were collected in late spring and a germination experiment was performed. The differences in seed bank size between succession stages and soil layers were proved by a two-way ANOVA. Similarities between seed bank and standing vegetation were tested by the Morisita-Horn index. Our results indicated that seed bank size significantly increased along the chronosequence, from 273 seedlings/m(2) in the pioneer stage, 820 seedlings/m(2) in the early successional stage, to 3527 and 3674 seedlings/m(2) in the late and old successional stage, respectively. The seed bank size was correlated with the vegetation cover along the successional gradient. The early succession stages were more similar to the standing vegetation as the later stages. A persistent soil seed bank has been found all along the successional gradient; however, size and composition changed from the pioneer to the old successional stage. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Twenty-eight taxa were recorded in the soil seed bank and 83 taxa (70 taxa in plots of seed bank sampling) in the above-ground vegetation. The dominant tree species and many woodland species found in the above-ground vegetation were absent from the soil seed bank. Similarity between the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation decreased with grazing, and grazing led to a decrease of species richness in above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank. Beta diversity of vegetation among grazed and among non-grazed plots did not differ, but was significantly higher between grazed and non-grazed areas. Beta diversity of the soil seed bank declined with grazing. When applying classification tree and logistic regression analyses, non-grazed forest sites are clearly differentiated by the presence of Phillyrea latifolia, Euphorbia amygdaloides and Brachypodium sylvaticum. PCA ordination of above-ground species composition reflected a gradient from sites grazed by ruminants to non-grazed sites, but no clear structure was detected in the seed bank.

B	Trubina, MR		VanderValk, AG		Trubina, Marina R.			Species richness and resilience of forest communities: combined effects of short-term disturbance and long-term pollution	FOREST ECOLOGY: RECENT ADVANCES IN PLANT ECOLOGY												Recovery of the species richness of plant communities after experimental disturbances of various severities were studied in spruce forests polluted by atmospheric entry of SO2 and heavy metals from a copper smelter. In the three toxic load zones (impact, buffer, and background), 60 experimental "pit-and-mound" complexes (sized 1 m x 2 m, 20 complexes in each zone) were created. Colonization of disturbed areas by vascular plants was observed during a 6-year period after the disturbance. The results showed that the recovery processes were affected by disturbance severity and that the recovery differed significantly among the communities. In all of the zones, species richness increased rapidly after mild disturbance. In degraded communities, levelling of differences in the rate of colonization after mild and severe disturbances was observed. The highest colonization rate was found in the communities of background zone, while the lowest was found in the heavily degraded communities of impact zone. The disturbances significantly increased the species diversity of communities in all zones and caused a certain reversion of degraded communities to previous stage of anthropogenic succession. Mild disturbance promoted the greatest increase in the diversity indices. The study results indicate that recovery rate of species richness of plant communities is determined by the duration of negative effect of disturbances. Recovery also depends significantly on the magnitude and endurance of positive effect of disturbances. The studied communities differed significantly in these parameters. The study results also suggest that short-term disturbances can significantly modify the process of transformation of plant communities by atmospheric pollution. On the other hand, long-term pollution can considerably modify the response of forest communities to disturbances. The results also conclude that the resilience of communities does not exclusively depend on their species richness.																			978-90-481-2794-8				2009							339	350		10.1007/978-90-481-2795-5_25	10.1007/978-90-481-2795-5						WOS:000271018900025

ON TWO CHILEAN BACCHARIS SPECIES AT DIFFERENT LIFE-CYCLE STAGES	GAYANA BOTANICA												Several studies have revealed a variety of mechanisms of invasion of alien plant species. However. little is known oil how those mechanisms and their associated effects oil native species change across different life-cycle stages. Under controlled conditions, we assessed the interactions between the alien invasive species Centaurea solstitialis L. (Asteraceae)and two pioneer native species to the Chilean matorral; Baccharis linearis (Ruiz et Pav.) Pers. and B. paniculata DC. (Asteraceae). Competitive effects of the invader oil natives were evaluated by combining different life-cycle stages: seed-seed, plant-seed, and plant-plant. Seed germination of C solstitialis was explosive and much faster than that of the native species. The presence of C solstitialis (individuals or seeds) did not affect negatively the seed germination of the two Baccharis species. However. the presence of C. solstitialis plants significantly decreased the total biomass of Baccharis plants. Thus. the effect of C solstitialis oil Baccharis species depended oil the life-cycle stage at which the interactions occurred. In the Chilean matorral, the early emergence of C solstitialis Could be an important invasion mechanism, enabling established plants to competitively displace late emerging seedlings of Baccharis species. The huge abundance of C. solstitialis in some disturbed matorrals suggests that seedling establishment of these two pioneer species Could be limited.

B	Perez-Camacho, L; Rebollo, S		VanderValk, AG		Perez-Camacho, Lorenzo; Rebollo, Salvador			Are irrigation and grazing effects transferred, accumulated, or counteracted during plant recruitment?	HERBACEOUS PLANT ECOLOGY: RECENT ADVANCES IN PLANT ECOLOGY												How do effects from perturbations such as irrigation and grazing that have an impact at one stage of the recruitment process (e.g., seedling) affect performance at later stages (e.g., adult)? Such effects may be transferred to later stages without any further change (transferred effects), reinforced by a similar effect so that their importance increases (accumulative effect), or counteracted at later stages by an opposite effect (counteractive effect). We analysed the predominance of transferred, accumulative, and counteractive effects depending on (1) organization level (community, functional group, and species levels), (2) life cycle stage (seeds, seedlings, and adults), (3) grass/forb functional group (forbs versus grasses), and (4) seed mass (small-seeded species, medium-seeded species, and large-seeded species). The study was conducted in Alcala de Henares, central Spain. During one annual cycle, we counted the number of readily germinable seeds (3,909 seeds: 2,156 forbs and 1,753 grasses), emerged seedlings (2,126 seedlings: 1,238 forbs and 888 grasses), and surviving seedlings up to reproductive adult status (917 adults: 217 forbs and 700 grasses) of all species (74 species) in a factorial field experiment under three different simulated rainfall and three seasonal sheep grazing regimes in a natural Mediterranean annual plant community composed of forbs (dicotyledonous herbs) and grasses (monocotyledonous herbs). Our main results were: (1) the proportion of transferred and counteractive effects was similar between the three studied organization levels (community, functional group, and species levels); (2) we detected many more counteractive effects in the seedling stage than in the adult stage; (3) we did not find more counteractive effects in forbs versus grasses, but transferred effects were more frequent in grasses; and (4) we found more counteractive effects with decreasing seed mass and more transferred effects with increasing seed mass. Our main conclusions were that the prevalence of counteractive effects reduces the sensitivity of the whole recruitment process and enhances the relative importance of the final stage (adults). The prevalence of transferred effects makes the recruitment process more predictable and more dependent on the early stages (seeds and seedlings).

The aim of this study were to describe the composition of seed batik from a relictic area of Espinal, to classify the seed batik according to the persistence of the seeds within, to compare between the seed batik and established vegetation of the area and to present pictures of the seeds that were found. According to our results, there are 44 species in the seed batik, representing 18 families. The best represented families arc Poaceae with 12 species, and Asteraceae with seven species. When the comparison between the seed bank and established vegetation was carried out, We found that the occurrence of exotic species was great in the prior, being Chenopodium album the most frequent species and it also has the highest density. We also found 19 species in the transient seed bank, 14 species in the short-term persistent seed batik and I I in the long-term persistent seed batik. The majority of species that comprise the persistent banks arc native. The high frequency of native species in the persistent banks could be all important factor during the regeneration of the area.																		2446-8231				JAN-JUN	2009	64	1					93	100									WOS:000270848400010

CHARACTERIZING THE LITTER IN POSTFIRE ENVIRONMENTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR SEEDLING RECRUITMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Litter accumulation after fire influences the magnitude of seed predation and seed germination. How litter accumulation and patchiness influence postfire seedling recruitment is poorly known. Species with persistent seed banks have seeds available for germination in the immediate postfire period. In contrast, plants with transient seed banks must flower after fire to place seeds in the postfire habitat. In southeastern Australian sclerophyll forests, most seedling recruitment occurs within 3 yr after fire. We found that less litter had accumulated in sites < 6 mo postfire than in those 2-3 yr postfire. Seedlings of species with persistent seed banks therefore encounter postfire environments with large areas covered by little or no litter. Among these species there is great variation in seed mass, including some species with very light seeds. In contrast, the seed mass of transient seed bank species is less variable, with the lightest species more than 70 times heavier than the lightest persistent seed bank species. These seeds arrive 1-3 yr postfire and encounter habitats with more litter and fewer bare patches. This pattern suggests that litter accumulation after fire has influenced the evolution of seed mass either directly, by affecting germination and seedling survival, or indirectly, by affecting seed predators.

Sulfur Cinquefoil (Potentilla recta) Seed Ecology: Seed Bank Survival and Water and Salt Stresses on Germination	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Sulfur cinquefoil, a perennial invasive weed of many different habitats in the United States, reproduces and spreads predominately through seed production, making seed bank survival and successful germination essential steps in the invasive process. To evaluate its potential to invade water-stressed environments, field and growth chamber studies were conducted in two areas of sulfur cinquefoil seed ecology: (1) monitoring the seed bank population and (2) determining the effect of salt and water stresses on germination of two sulfur cinquefoil seed populations differing in site characteristics of precipitation, temperature, and soil conditions. Field sampling demonstrated that a 2-yr average seed rain of 73,700 seeds m(-2) resulted in an average 26,600 seeds m(-2) annual increase in the seed bank. Regression analysis showed seed rain accounted for only 7 and < 1% of the variation in seedling density in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Seeds from the two populations showed a difference in the level of decrease in germination in response to increasing water and salt stresses. Managers should be aware that some populations of sulfur cinquefoil may be able to survive under drier or saltier conditions than previously thought. It appears that several years of control of mature sulfur cinquefoil would dramatically reduce the sulfur cinquefoil seed bank.

J	Volis, S				Volis, Sergei			Seed-related traits and their adaptive role in population differentiation in Avena sterilis along an aridity gradient	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Four populations of the annual grass Avena sterilis distributed along an aridity gradient in Israel (Mount Hermon, Northern Galilee, Shefela, and the Negev Desert), were studied to (1) reveal a general pattern of seed dormancy and persistence in the soil seed bank in this species; (2) compare seed size and demography of reciprocally introduced seeds and seedlings; and (3) test the adaptive nature of the observed patterns. The steep aridity gradient in Israel represents two parallel clines of environmental productivity (annual rainfall) and predictability (variation in amount and timing of annual rainfall). The four populations examined represented the following environments: (1) desert-low productivity and predictability, drought stress; (2) semi-steppe batha-moderate productivity and predictability; (3) grassland-high productivity and predictability; and (4) mountain-high productivity and predictability but with severe frost stress. The highest proportion of dormant seeds, most sequential germination of the first and the second florets of a spikelet over three years, and highest importance of desiccation tolerance were found at the desert location, consistent with bet-hedging buffering against unpredictability of rainfall and high probability of drought in this environment. Significant population origin by environment interactions were observed for yield and reproductive biomass, but no advantage of local ecotype was detected for these two traits. However, another fitness component, seedling survival, showed not only the interactive effect of origin and locality, but also the superiority of the local ecotype and decreasing fitness rank from indigenous ecotype towards the most environmentally dissimilar ecotype, suggesting local ecotype adaptation of seedlings. There was a genetically determined decrease in seed mass with increase in aridity without concomitant effect of frost. The selective forces that may differentially affect seed size along the aridity gradient are competition, predation intensity, importance of dispersal distance, and bet-hedging against rainfall unpredictability. Further experiments are needed to determine the precise nature of aridity-related evolution of seed size in A. sterilis.																	0792-9978						2009	57	1-2					79	90		10.1560/IJPS.57.1-2.79							WOS:000271354400008						
J	Dorman, M; Melnikov, P; Sapir, Y; Volis, S				Dorman, Michael; Melnikov, Pavel; Sapir, Yuval; Volis, Sergei			Factors affecting dormancy of Oncocyclus iris seeds	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Oncocyclus irises (Iridaceae) are endangered plants in Israel, yet with high potential for cultivation as ornamental flowers. However, their high seed dormancy level prevents fast development of germplasm for horticultural reproduction. In this paper we describe in-vitro and in-vivo germination experiments with seeds of Oncocyclus irises from Israel. We examined the effects of (1) mechanical scarification and different growing media on in-vitro seed germination; and (2) soil type, covering, and water amount on in-vivo germination. Seeds showed high dormancy, as hardly any seed germinated in the first year after sowing, and only in the second growing season the germinating fraction was considerable (up to 37%), still only under high humidity conditions. We also report an effective in-vitro forced germination protocol, which employs seed scarification. Following these results for in-vivo germination, and based on the protocol developed for in-vitro germination, we recommend two methods for artificial seed germination. For fast germination, good results from a modest quantity of seeds can be obtained by an in-vitro forced germination. For mass seed propagation, when time is not a limiting factor, the in-vivo procedure can be used, using an artificial soil seed bank and treating those seeds during (at least) two seasons under shade and continuous watering.

Pre- and post-dispersal seed loss and soil seed dynamics of the dominant Bulnesia retama (Zygophyllaceae) shrub in a sandy Monte desert of western Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In deserts and semi-deserts dominant plants seldom rely on a persistent seed bank to ensure their recruitment from sexual reproduction, which is generally based on the seeds produced in the last reproductive event. We studied pre- and post-dispersal seed loss of Bulnesia retama, a dominant shrub of the sandy Monte deserts (western Argentina). We hypothesised that pre- and post-dispersal seed depletion in B. retama regulate soil seed density and in turn decrease soil seed reserves. We also hypothesised that spatial patches induced by standing vegetation and other microsites additionally affect post-dispersal seed loss and soil seed density. We observed that as much as half the total seed production was lost due to pre-dispersal seed predation. Seed dispersal plus predation showed a negative exponential function with 61% of seeds falling during the first 28 days, and 99% after 90 days, when 34% of the seeds remained inside excluded branches. A significant patch effect was observed on soil seed density and seed dynamics, with a greater number of seeds and increased seed depletion rates below B. retama shrubs. However, spatial patches did not affect seed germination although they increased with burial time, from 22% to 70% after 75 and 276 days, respectively. Likewise, a similar trend was found in potential seed germination; seeds collected directly from mother plants had a low germination rate (less than 25%), which increased to 75% after 276 days of soil burial. About 15% of the dispersed seeds should persist to the next rainy season, thus contributing to a low-density but persistent seed bank. The delay in seed germination and temporal decrease in soil seed density that we observed for B. retama suggest that a set of mechanisms have been developed promoting germination events whenever soil water is available, at any moment of the year.

The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands: Croton punctatus N. von Jacquin	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Croton punctatus N. von Jacquin is a New World tropical and subtropical dioecious, rhizomatous, subshrub or herb with apetalous flowers that is common on coastal beaches. Herein, we present a review of the biology of this important pioneer species. Large colonies of C. punctatus promote embryonic dune formation in belts parallel to the shoreline. Colonies act to intercept wind-transported sand. Colony success is related, in part, to a large seed bank and a relatively high germination potential. Other factors contributing to successful colonization include tolerance of sand scouring, salt spray deposition, burial, high substrate temperatures, and low levels of soil nutrients. Its northern distribution limits appear to be determined by the frequency, duration, and severity of freezing temperatures. Transplanted seedlings have relatively high survival rates. Therefore, C. punctatus has been useful in stabilizing sandy dredged material.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2009	25	1					23	29		10.2112/07-0933.1							WOS:000262698900003

A number of experimental studies have supported the hypothesis that diversity increases invasion resistance, but several mechanisms were proposed to explain this relationship. We studied spontaneous invasion in experimental grasslands varying in species richness (1-16 (60)) and plant functional group richness and identity (1-4; grasses, legumes, tall herbs small herbs) during the first 3 years after establishment on large-area plots of 20 x 20 m size. 2. Invader species number, biomass and density decreased with increasing community species richness. The identity of successful invaders changed through time as the relative importance of external invaders (= species not belonging to the experimental species pool) decreased, while internal invaders (= species belonging to the experimental species pool) became more important. The presence of legumes increased, while the presence of grasses in the plant communities decreased density, biomass and species number of external invaders and biomass of internal invaders in the second and third year after establishment. 3. Analyses of viable seeds in the topsoil, a higher invasion in communities with more potential invaders in adjacent plots and an edge effect with a higher invader density and species number at the margin of the plots suggested recruitment limitation of internal invader species in contrast to external invader species that were more strongly limited by community characteristics. 4. Resource availability, in particular percentage cover of resident species, root length density and soil nitrate, and propagule availability had significant effects on invasibility. However, statistical analyses revealed that these variables did not completely control for effects of community species richness and the presence of grasses and legumes respectively on invasion resistance. 5. Separate analyses of frequent invader species showed that the invasion success of individual species varied in response to biodiversity and resource niches. 6. Synthesis. Our results confirm that a more complete use of available resources in plant communities of increasing species richness generally decreases invasibility. However, the overall positive effects of biodiversity on invasion resistance are dependent on species identity of the invader species. Thus, mechanisms at species level are important to understand community invasion resistance.

Metapopulation dynamics - the recurrent extinction and colonization in spatially discrete habitats - is expected to strongly affect within and between population genetic diversity. So far, however, accounts of true plant metapopulations are extremely scarce. 2. We monitored the colonization and extinction dynamics of an assemblage of populations of the annual Erysimum cheiranthoides on stony river banks during three consecutive years. Each year, winter flooding drives some populations to extinction, while vacant banks may become colonized. We describe the dynamics of these ephemeral populations using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to quantify changes in the metapopulation genetic structure over time, and assessing the direction and relative amount of migration and colonization events. 3. Average extinction and colonization rates were high (0.39 and 0.34, respectively). While population genetic differentiation (F-ST) tripled from 0.06 in 2005 to 0.17 in 2007, total metapopulation genetic diversity remained fairly constant through the years. Genetic assignment analyses allowed assigning more than 50% of the genotyped individuals to populations extant the year before. Colonizing individuals originated from different source populations (phi << 1) and there was considerable evidence of upstream seed dispersal. 4. The degree and pattern of spatial genetic structure varied between years and was related to variation in the flooding intensity of the Meuse River through the years. Possibly, activation of the soil seed bank also played a role in structuring the genetic make-up of the populations. 5. Because migration and colonization events were qualitatively equal, and colonizing individuals originated from different sources, the increase in F-ST was in agreement with previous theoretical work. Very high migration and colonization rates, and the short monitoring period, may explain why there was no loss of genetic diversity from the metapopulation through recurrent extinction and colonization events. 6. Synthesis. This study gives one of the first accounts of the dynamics of a true plant metapopulation. Temporal monitoring of genetic variation gave evidence of extensive and bidirectional seed dispersal, highly variable and increasing genetic differentiation, and rather constant within population genetic diversity. An important suggestion from this research is to include a dormant seed stage in further theoretical work on (meta) population genetics.

Vegetation response to a short interval between high-severity wildfires in a mixed-evergreen forest	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Variations in disturbance regime strongly influence ecosystem structure and function. A prominent form of such variation is when multiple high-severity wildfires occur in rapid succession (i.e. short-interval (SI) severe fires, or 're-burns'). These events have been proposed as key mechanisms altering successional rates and pathways. 2. We utilized a natural experiment afforded by two overlapping wildfires occurring within a 15-year interval in forests of the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon (USA). We tested for unique effects of a SI fire (15-year interval before 2002 fire) by comparing vegetation communities 2 years post-fire to those following a long-interval (LI) fire (> 100-year interval before 2002 fire) and in mature/old-growth (M/OG) stands (no high-severity fire in > 100-year). 3. Nearly all species found in M/OG stands were present at similar relative abundance in both the LI and SI burns, indicating high community persistence through multiple high-severity fires. However, the SI burn had the highest species richness and total plant cover with additions of disturbance-associated forbs and low shrubs, likely due to a propagule bank of early seral species that developed between fires. Persistence of flora was driven by vegetative sprouting, on-site seed banks, and dispersal from off-site seed sources. Several broadly generalizable plant functional traits (e.g. rapid maturation, long-lived seed banks) were strongly associated with the SI burn. 4. Sprouting capacity of hardwoods and shrubs was unaltered by recurrent fire, but hardwood/shrub biomass was lower in the SI burn because individuals were smaller before the second fire. Conifer regeneration densities were high in both the SI and LI burns (range = 298-6086 and 406-2349 trees ha(-1), respectively), reflecting similar availability of seed source and germination substrates. 5. Synthesis. SI severe fires are typically expected to be deleterious to forest flora and development; however, these results indicate that in systems characterized by highly variable natural disturbances (e.g. mixed-severity fire regime), native biota possess functional traits lending resilience to recurrent severe fire. Compound disturbance resulted in a distinct early seral assemblage (i.e. interval-dependent fire effects), thus contributing to the landscape heterogeneity inherent to mixed-severity fire regimes. Process-oriented ecosystem management incorporating variable natural disturbances, including 'extreme' events such as SI severe fires, would likely perpetuate a diversity of habitats and successional pathways on the landscape.

Seed germination of Richnus communis in predicted settings after autochorous and myrmecochorous dispersal. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 136: 84-90. 2009.-Seeds of Ricinus communis are primarily dispersed by autochory and secondarily dispersed by ants, which are attracted to their lipid-rich elaiosome. The aim of this study was to determine how the conditions to which Ricinus seeds are submitted after these two types of dispersal affect their germination. We examined the germination responses of freshly harvested and one-year-old seeds to combinations of light (present or absent), temperature (alternating or constant), and elaiosome (present or absent). We also checked the soil for persistent seed banks. The seeds presented different germination responses but germinated in all conditions to which they were submitted. More specifically, germination of fresh seeds was higher in the environmental conditions to which they are submitted after being dispersed by ants, although seeds with elaiosome germinated in greater number. Germination of old seeds was not enhanced in alternating temperatures and/or presence of light, as would be expected for seeds that make up persistent soil seed banks. This, and the fact that we found only a few viable seeds in the soil, indicates that Ricinus does not form seed banks. Nevertheless, we observed massive seedling emergence after soil disturbance and, therefore, the existence or not of seed banks is not yet clear and deserves further investigation. This study shows that the generalist germination behavior of Ricinus seeds guarantees that they germinate under various environmental conditions.

LISTY CUKROVARNICKE A REPARSKE												Euphorbia helioscopia occurs on the whole area of the Czech Republic, mostly in lower altitudes. It reproduces only generatively, each plant can produce several hundreds of seeds which are dormant. It germinates during the whole vegetation period (April-October), for the emergence the most suitable are depths between 5-20 mm. Seed longevity in the soil is relatively high, they can survive in soil seed bank for more than 20 years. E. helioscopia is a heliophilous species, thus most frequently can be found in crops that do not create dense caopies (root crops, vegetables). It is not able to compete with well established canopies of cereal crops. In sugar beet stands, high efficacy on this weed can be reached using herbicides with active ingrediences quinmerac, triflusulfuron, and in early growth stages also desmedipham. In potatoes, good efficacy in pre-emergent applications is shown by linuron, for post-emergent applications rimsulfuron or metribuzin can be used. Pedimethalin show good efficacy in vegetable stands.

Evidence for persistent seed banks in dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii in the German Wadden Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The intertidal dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii is a dominant species in the Dutch and German Wadden Sea. Although numerous studies of its reproductive ecology have been conducted, few have examined the importance of seeds and seed banks for meadow maintenance. We investigated the contribution of a seed bank (size, genetic potential and persistence) to annual recruitment of dwarf eelgrass in the German Wadden Sea using temporal sampling of seeds from the sediment and genetic assignment tests of seedlings to populations of adult shoots from previous years. Annual sediment seed density (SD) was 487.5 m(-2) (269.4) and 367.3 m(-2) (95.5) in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and distribution of seeds in the sediment was highly aggregated. The proportion of over-wintering seeds that germinated under laboratory conditions was 16 to 25%, and field-germination revealed a 12% survival to the seedling stage. Nearly 20% of all shoots present in May 2004 were seedlings. Using 9 microsatellite loci, seedlings sampled in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were compared with adults sampled in 2002, 2003 and 2004; results revealed that 7 to 33% of seedlings could be assigned to the local adult population in Current or previous years. Although new recruitment plays an important role in the maintenance of these meadows, considerable new recruitment comes from within the meadow., itself. Seeds are viable for at least 3 yr, thereby forming a relatively short-term, but persistent, seed bank.

Remnant Oak Savanna Acts as Refugium for Meadow Fescue Introduced During Nineteenth Century Human Migrations in the USA	MOLECULAR BREEDING OF FORAGE AND TURF					5th International Molecular Breeding of Forage and Turf	2007	Sapporo, JAPAN	Natl Agr Res Ctr Hokkaido Reg, Natl Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci				In 1990, an unknown forage grass was discovered growing in the shade of a remnant oak savanna in southwestern Wisconsin. Over 12 years, the practice of feeding mature hay on winter pastures spread this grass onto over 500 ha via seedling recruitment. Analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers on 561 plants, compared to a diverse sample of wild European collections of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds. = L. pratense (Huds.) Darbysh.), and tall fescue (F. arundinacea Schreb.), identified a highly diverse population that was more closely allied with F. pratensis than the other species, based on genetic distances. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), using both Lolium- and Festuca-specific probes, led to effective hybridizations by only the Festuca-specific probes and gave indications of close homology to the F. pratensis genome. Similarly, genetic distance analysis using PCR-based Lolium expressed sequence tag (EST) markers on a subset of genotypes, compared to the four control species, clearly identified F. pratensis as the closest relative. Sequence analysis of the trnL intron of cpDNA distinguished the unknown plants from F. arundinacea, but not from Lolium. Additional survey work has identified this grass on 12 other farms within an area of about 20,000 ha. Soil samples accompanying plant samples indicated no seed banks and most farm records indicate no commercially introduced seeds during the twentieth century. We hypothesize that seeds of meadow fescue may have arrived with some of the earliest European immigrants to Wisconsin and spread along the historic Military Ridge Trail, a network of frontier U.S. Army forts connected by a major thoroughfare.

To assess the long-term implications for native forest regeneration in sites where bone-seed is present, we selected four study sites around Wellington, New Zealand, where bone-seed was abundant. We compared seed bank composition in bone-seed-invaded sites with nearby native forest patches, and monitored bone-seed and native seedling recruitment with and Without control of mature bone-seed plants. We also tested the potential effects of fire on bone-seed recruitment in these communities by heating seeds prior to germination. Bone-seed, gorse (Ulex europaeus), and native species emerged from seed bank samples taken from bone-seed-invaded sites, but only native species and (less) gorse emerged from seed bank samples taken from native forest patches. Gorse germination was strongly promoted by heat but bone-seed germination was less affected by heat. Bone-seed seedling abundance increased dramatically following canopy removal, whereas native seedling abundance decreased dramatically. This suggests that disturbance of any form is likely to favour recruitment of bone-seed (and gorse) over native species, although in the long term, native seedlings can establish beneath the canopy of mature bone-sced plants. It is not yet known if, in the absence of further disturbance, regenerating native vegetation will eventually replace bone-seed in New Zealand.																	0110-6465						2009	33	1					72	82									WOS:000265945000007

Anecic earthworms are increasingly recognised as important dispersers and predators of plant seeds. In contrast, the rote of the usually more abundant endogeic earthworms which live and feed in the soil on plant seeds is largely unknown. We tested whether (A) endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea rosea, Allolobophora chlorotica, Octolasion tyrtaeum, Aporrectodea caliginosa) ingest and digest grassland plant seeds (Phleum pratense, Bellis perennis, Trifolium repens, Poa trivialis, Plantago lanceolato, Medicago varia), (B) the passage of seeds through the gut of endogeic earthworms modifies seed germination, and (C) excreta (mucus and casts) of endogeic earthworms modify seed germination. As a reference effects of the well-studied anecic species Lumbricus terrestris were determined. Endogeic earthworms ingested and digested all of the studied plant seeds; however, both ingestion and digestion were earthworm and plant species specific. Moreover, passage through the gut of endogeic earthworms and their excreta modified plant seed germination (gut passage: B. perennis; excreta: Ph. pratense and Pl. lanceolato). The results indicate that endogeic earthworms may strongly impact the composition of the soil seed bank and, consequently, plant community assembly via direct and indirect effects on plant seeds. Since post-dispersal seed predation is a key factor for the structure of plant communities, with the effect on seed survival potentially exceeding that of pre-dispersal predation, seed predation and changes in germination of seeds by endogeic earthworm species is likely to drive plant community composition.

Archaeophytes: Decline and dispersal - A behavioural analysis of a fascinating group of species	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												While some archaeophytes have become virtually extinct on a continental scale within Europe, many others have enjoyed great success and have expanded their ranges considerably. Some behaviours and strategies (flowering, pollination, dispersal, duration in the seed-bank, Grime functional strategies, habitats) and correlations are analysed with reference to the extinction, decline and spread of the 206 species chosen. For archaeophytes in rapid expansion, results show that their behaviour, with reference to their use of space, is the same as that of neophytes. Therefore, both groups can be used as indicators of environmental deterioration.																	1126-3504	1724-5575					2009	143			1			S46	S55		10.1080/11263500903192159							WOS:000274415200007

Heat increases germination of water-permeable seeds of obligate-seeding Darwinia species (Myrtaceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												We examined the response of seeds to heat in four geographically restricted and one widespread species of shrubby Darwinia from the fire-prone region of southeastern Australia. These shrubs are killed by fire and rely on seed germination after a fire to maintain populations. We replicated the germination trials across several sites and several fruiting seasons for most species. Seeds had a high level of viability and were largely dispersed in a dormant state, except in D. glaucophylla, where seed dormancy varied significantly across fruiting seasons. The indehiscent fruit of all species readily imbibes moisture when wet and seeds are not considered to be 'hard-seeded'. All species had increased seed germination in response to a limited range of heating temperatures (generally 80-100 degrees C). Higher temperatures killed increasing proportions of seeds. This pattern was broadly consistent across species, population and seasons, although the proportion of seeds whose germination was promoted by heat varied from high (D. diminuta, D. fascicularis, D. glaucophylla) to moderate (D. biflora, D. procera). Our work highlights the importance of heat as a mechanism for influencing germination in species that are not hard-seeded. Consequently, soil temperatures during a fire should strongly influence post-fire germination levels in Darwinia. The roles of other cues that promote germination, i.e. smoke, seasonal temperatures and their interactions with heat, remain to be investigated.

Seed Emergence of Bidens pilosa at Different Sowing Depths	PLANTA DANINHA												Bidens pilosa is one of the major weeds in annual and perennial crops in mid-southern Brazil. High seed production is one of its most important survival strategies and the knowledge of the fundamental conditions for seedling germination and emergence is essential to establish prediction models of its population growth and to elaborate management models for control and prevention of herbicide resistant populations. This research aimed to understand the importance of B. pilosa seed depth in the soil profile to enhance its germination and seedling emergence potential. Thus,,four assays were carried out under greenhouse conditions and the seeds were sown at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm from the soil surface. The emergence of B. pilosa seedlings was reduced as sowing depth was increased, with drastic reduction from two centimeters. This reproductive biology feature presented by B. pilosa is very important for the formation of dense seed banks in soils submitted to conventional tillage system.

However, the pasture seed bank makes,forage art important weed in soybean growing areas. This study aimed to quantify the effects of different B. brizantha emergence periods in relation to soybean on macro, and micronutrient accumulation by both species. This study was conducted under greenhouse conditions, with the following seven emergence periods of B. brizantha being evaluated in relation to soybean:: -21, -14, 7 days, emergence periods of the B. brizantha before the emergence of soybean (DB), 0, simultaneous emergence of soybean and B. brizantha: 7, 14 and 21 dulls, emergence periods of B. brizantha after soybean. (DA) plus two controls (soybean or B. brizantha alone), in a randomized complete design, with four replications. The nutritional evaluation of both species was performed when soybean. reached full flower stage. In. the simultaneous emergence of both species, B. brizantha presented greater N, P, K, S, My and Fe accumulation while soybean accumulated more Ca, Zn and B. When forage emergence occurred about 7 DA, soybean plants showed greater accumulation of all nutrients, reaching maximum accumulation with B. brizantha emergence at 21 DA.																	0100-8358	1806-9681				JAN-MAR	2009	27	1					49	56		10.1590/S0100-83582009000100008							WOS:000264534500008

Weed Seed Banks in Cassava Cultivations in Central Amazon	PLANTA DANINHA												This study aimed to evaluate seed density and number of species in a weed seed bank collected from four different cassava family farms. ne farms were located on highway AM-070 in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Four plots were established in each cassava crop, from which 20 15 x 15 cm samples. (0.0225 m(2)) at 0-5 cm depth level and three samples at 5-10 and 10-30 depth levels were collected, totalizing 104 samples. For seed counting and identification, plantlet emergence technique under greenhouse conditions was used. The plantlets were initially identified by morphotype and when possible, even by species. Monitoring was conducted during 9 months. A significant difference in seed density was found among the plots (Kruskal Wallis, 5%: p<0.05) and an average of 5.113 seeds m(-2) at 0-5 cm depth. At the depth of 5-10 cm, the cassava crops presented an average of 1.111 seeds m(-2), while at the 10-30 cm depth, the average was 285 seeds m(-2). The seed banks of the cassava crops were basically herbaceous species typical of agricultural lands and disturbed environments. Weed cut once a year was not sufficient to control weed plants and reduce negative weed interference intensity. Thus, therefore, greater care is necessary during the periods before flowering and seed production, according to labor availability.

After escaping from cultivation it has become wide spread during last decades of the 20(th) century. Nowadays, it covers large areas especially on sandy soils, and its further appearance is expected on dry, deforested and degraded areas. Two neglected fields and one abandoned vineyard were selected. For sampling two quadrates of size 4 m(2) were used at each stand. The stands were characterized by the following variables: density of stems, percentage of reproductive stems, average number of inflorescences, average number of fruits, fruits per all inflorescences on a stem, pods per fruited inflorescences on a stem, average number of seeds per fruit. In the same quadrates the soil seed bank was studied at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm). The results showed that the density of stand, percentage of reproductive specimens and average number of fruits were significantly higher on the neglected fields than on the abandoned vineyard. In the neglected fields large number of seeds were detected in the upper soil-layer (2.7-18.6 x 10(3) seeds m(-2)), but in the lower sod-layer much fewer seeds were found and only in one of the fields. Common milkweed seeds were almost completely missing from both soil layers of the abandoned vineyard. However, the seeds recovered from the soils practically did not germinated, indicating that seeds of earlier years sets have lost viability, i.e. the studied stands of A. syriaca did not form a persistent soil seed bank. Nevertheless, the fresh seed production of the neglected field populations, that can reach 7-10 thousands seeds m(-2), may cause a very strong propagulum load not only in the site but also on the surrounding areas.

Demography of three perennial grasses in a central Queensland eucalypt woodland	RANGELAND JOURNAL												The population dynamics of the palatable, perennial grasses Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C.E.Hubb. (desert Mitchell grass), Chrysopogon fallax S.T.Blake (golden beard grass) and Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. (black speargrass), were studied in an extensive grazing study conducted in a eucalypt woodland within the Aristida-Bothriochloa pasture community in central Queensland between 1994 and 2000. Treatments were three grazing pressures based on light, medium and heavy utilisation of forage available at the end of summer and two timber treatments (trees intact and trees killed). Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was generally favourable for plant growth with no severe drought periods. Grazing pressure had a greater overall impact on plant dynamics than timber treatment, which had minimal impact. Grazing pressure had a large impact on H. contortus dynamics, an intermediate impact on B. ewartiana and no impact on C. fallax. Fluctuations in plant density of both B. ewartiana and C. fallax were small because both species were long lived with low levels of seedling recruitment and plant death, whereas fluctuations in H. contortus density were relatively high because of its relatively short life span and higher levels of both recruitment and death. Heavy grazing pressure increased the recruitment of B. ewartiana and H. contortus in some years but had no impact on that of C. fallax. Heavy grazing pressure reduced the survival of the original plants of both B. ewartiana and H. contortus but not of C. fallax. For H. contortus, the size of the original plants was larger where trees were killed than where trees were left intact and plants of the 1995 seedling cohort were larger in 1998 at heavy compared with those at light and medium grazing pressure. Grazing had a minor negative impact on the soil seed bank of H. contortus. Populations of all three species remained stable throughout this study, although the favourable seasonal rainfall experienced and the short duration of this study relative to the life span of these species may have masked longer term, deleterious impacts of heavy grazing pressure.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2009	31	4					427	437		10.1071/RJ09035							WOS:000272172900007						
J	Shaw, P				Shaw, Peter			Soil and Fertilizer Amendments and Edge Effects on the Floral Succession of Pulverized Fuel Ash	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Plots of fresh pulverized fuel ash (PFA, an industrial waste) were inoculated with soils from existing PFA sites and fertilizers in a factorial design, then left unmanaged for 12 years during which time the floral development and soil chemistry were monitored annually. For the first 3 years, the site supported a sparse mix of chenopods (including the scarce Chenopodium glaucum) and halophytes. As salinity declined, ruderals, legumes, and grasses plus the fire-site moss Funaria hygrometrica colonized, followed by Festuca arundinacea grassland (NVC community MG12) and Hippophae rhamnoides scrub. Dactylorhiza incarnata (orchidacea) appeared after 7 years, but only in plots that had received soil from existing orchid colonies. Four years later, a larger second generation of Dactylorhiza appeared, but only in the central zone of the site where vegetation was thinnest. By year 12, the site was dominated by coarse grasses and scrub, with early successional species persisting only in the sparsely vegetated center, where nitrate levels were lowest. This edge effect is interpreted as centripetal encroachment, a process of potentially wider concern for the conservation of low-fertility habitat patches. Overall, seed bank inoculation seems to have introduced few but desirable species (D. incarnata, Pyrola rotundifolia, some halophytes, and annuals), whereas initial application of organic fertilizer had long-lasting (>= 10 years) effects on cover and soil composition.

Five sites were naturally restored 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 years ago and four sites were aerially seeded 1, 2, 5, and 7 years ago. In total, 36 species were recorded in the seed bank and 41 species in the aboveground vegetation for all NRS, whereas the numbers were 17 and 19, respectively, for ASS, indicating that the NRS can support higher diversity of species than the ASS. During the initial 2 years of restoration, introduced alien shrubs by aerial seeding dominated the vegetation of ASS, although there were indigenous pioneer species in the seed bank which failed to establish in the community. In contrast, indigenous species were dominant components in both the seed bank and the vegetation at the NRS. These findings suggest that the establishment of introduced species might have restricted the germination of certain indigenous pioneer species. Seed bank density of NRS significantly increased with time from 459 +/- 76 seeds m(-2) at NRS2 to 3,351 +/- 694 seeds m(-2) at NRS15, showing that the seed bank in degraded grassland is large enough to allow natural restoration. It is not always necessary to actively introduce seeds to enhance vegetation diversity.

Our hypothesis is that C. oncocalyx presents higher fruit density in areas with higher adult density, once it's fruit, although proper for wind dispersal, but not being dispersed though long distances. The low density, result of unproper sample size and methodology used during analyses. To test these hypothesis, a caatinga area was selected in the end of the dry season a hectare was chosen and in it's inside thirty 100 m(2) squares were selected to count the adult trees and thirty 1m((sic)) squares to count the fruit bank among the leaf litter. Our results showed a fruit density of 67,5 +/- 90,17 fruits/m(2) and 2 +/- 2 trees/100m(2). The predation rate was 20%, value similar to the ones found in arid and semiarid systems. A positive correlation was found between the adult tree density and i) the fruit density (rs = 0,5836, p < 0,05) and ii) the proportion of predated fruits (rs = 0,3665, p < 0,05).

The soil samples were then tested for their ability to initiate germination after periods of 0, 4, 8 and 12 months. Storage duration Was found to be the only factor significantly affecting fungal Survival, with the ability to initiate germination declining steadily over the 12 month period.

Moisture content and the longevity of seeds of six Euphorbia species in open storage	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Seeds from six Kenyan Euphorbia species were placed into experimental storage under open conditions (i.e. not hermetically scaled) over a range of relative humidities (between 25 and 75%) at 45 degrees C. Viability during storage was assessed at pre-determined intervals and seed viability equation constants estimated. The constants Cw, which quantifies the relative effect of change of moisture content on longevity, and K(E). which quantifies inherent longevity were variant between species. Similarly the constants describing the relative effect of change in rh on longevity differed between species. The highest estimate of K(E) was 10.2 for E. quinquecostata followed by 10.1 for E. pseudoburuana, 8.9 for E. heterochroma, 7.4 for E. heterophylla and 7.3 for E. bussei. The reverse order of the species was observed in the estimates for C(w) which ranged from 3.96 for E. bussei to 8.09 for E. quinquecostata. These viability constants were used to predict seed longevity following recommended Seed Banking protocols. Longevity was also predicted for seeds stored under ambient conditions at two Kenyan cities., Nairobi and Kisumu. with and without refrigeration at 5 degrees C. These predictions show how even basic refrigeration can improve the longevity of seed stocks destined for short-term storage, for example those required to Support academic teaching in universities. Seed stocks destined for long-term conservation should be dried and stored at conditions prevailing in standard gene bank facilities.

Seed dormancy and germination ecology of Lamyropsis microcephala: a mountain endemic species of Sardinia (Italy)	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Lamyropsis microcephala only occurs in a very restricted area in the Gennargentu massif (CE-Sardinia, Italy) at 1450-1700 m a.s.l. This rare species has been inserted in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red Lists under Critically Endangered. In this study, the effect of a pre-chilling period (90 days at 5 degrees C) on germination was investigated as well as the ability of this species to form a soil seed bank. L. microcephala seeds exhibited type 2 non-deep physiological dormancy. Pre-chilling increased the final germination percentages, the germination speed and the temperature range at which high levels of germination were observed. The high optimal germination temperatures (ca. 70% germination at 30 degrees C) demonstrate that this species is well adapted to a temperate climate kind the lack of a persistent soil seed bank represents a rarity trait that likely exacerbates the threats to the survival of this species.

J	Kim, DH; Han, SH; Ku, JJ; Lee, KY				Kim, Du Hyun; Han, Sim Hee; Ku, Ja Jung; Lee, Kab Yeon			Effects of Cryoprotectants and Post-storage Priming on Seed Germination of Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don)	SILVAE GENETICA												Among the ex situ methods for the preservation of forest tree germplasm, conventional seed banking is considered the most efficient method for the majority of species whilst cryopreservation has an important role in long-term conservation. The influence of cryoprotectants prior to liquid nitrogen (LN) storage and osmoconditioning priming treatments with polyethylene glycol (PEG) after LN storage were evaluated for germination (%), germination value (GV) and mean germination time (MGT) in seeds of Cryptomeria japonica. Sugi seeds were treated with two cryoprotectants (DMSO and PVS2) before immersion into LN and stored for three days. Although the C. japonica seeds survived liquid nitrogen treatment, their viability was reduced from 25% of intact seeds to 17% in LN. The seeds treated with 35% DMSO showed higher germination (28%) as compared with seeds directly-immersed in LN without cryoprotectant treatment. In contrast, PVS2 pretreated seeds decreased germination (13%). Two concentrations of PEG priming treatments were carried out. Osmoconditioning treatment in -0.4 MPa PEG solution after removal from LN enhanced the subsequent germination percentage and decreased MGT. PEG treatments at both -0.4 and -1.2MPa to PVS2 pretreated seeds before cryopreservation partially alleviated the negative effect of PVS2. DMSO pretreated seeds immersed into LN and treated with -0.4MPa PEG maintained the 28% of germination obtained in the control conditions and reduced the mean germination time (MGT). It can therefore be summarized that pretreatment with 35% DMSO was suitable for the cryopreservation of C. japonica seeds whilst the PEG priming treatment circumvented imbibitional damage after LN exposure.																	0037-5349	2509-8934					2009	58	4					162	168		10.1515/sg-2009-0021							WOS:000271256100003

Seed-Mediated Gene Flow in Wheat: Seed Bank Longevity in Western Canada	WEED SCIENCE												Development of genetically modified (GM) wheat has raised concerns about the movement and persistence of transgenes in agroecosystems and the ability of growers to segregate GM from conventional wheat. Wheat as a crop has been studied extensively but the population biology of volunteer wheat is not well characterized. Artificial seed bank studies were conducted in western Canada to provide baseline data on volunteer wheat seed persistence. Seed from two cultivars of Canadian western red spring wheat, 'AC Splendor' and 'AC Superb', were buried in mesh bags at three depths (0, 2, and 15 cm) in two different environments in the fall of 2003 and 2004. In addition, in 2004, 'AC Superb' seed were separated into small and large seed lots and buried with a medium seed lot to examine the influence of seed size on seed bank persistence. Seeds were withdrawn at intervals to assess seed germination and viability and regression analysis conducted on the viable seed at each sample period, after burial. Seed viability was variable within years and sites, and declined exponentially over time. In the spring, approximately 6 mo after initiation, viable seed ranged from 1 to 43%. With the exception of a single sire and year, seeds on the soil surface persisted significantly longer than buried seeds and increasing burial depth accelerated loss of viability. The maximum viability of wheat seeds at 0, 2, and 15 cm depth in the spring following planting was 43, 7, and 2%, respectively. The extinction of viability for 99% (EX99) of the seed was estimated from regression analysis. The EX99 values of seeds buried at 0, 2, and 15 cm ranged from 493 to 1,114, 319 to 654, and 175 to 352 d after planting (DAP), respectively, with the exception of one site in 2003 where burial depths were not different and all had an EX99 value of 456 DAP Seed size and cultivar did not significantly affect persistence, with the exception of one site in 2003 where the difference in EX99 values was 20 DAP The rapid loss of seed viability limits temporal gene flow via Volunteers in years following a wheat crop. Results provide data on spring wheat biology to aid in Canadian environmental biosafety assessments of GM wheat and will be incorporated into a mechanistic model to predict wheat gene flow on the Canadian prairies.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				JAN-FEB	2009	57	1					124	132		10.1614/WS-08-099.1							WOS:000262497500021						
J	Lenssen, AW				Lenssen, Andrew W.			Effect of Land Rolling on Weed Emergence in Field Pea, Barley, and Fallow	WEED TECHNOLOGY												In the northern Great Plains, fields are land rolled after the planting of annual pulse and forage crops to push rocks back into the soil to prevent damage to harvest equipment. Field trials were conducted in 2004 and 2005 to determine if land rolling influenced weed density or biomass associated with Field pea, forage barley, and summer fallow. The experiment included two planting dates, conventional and delayed, for both barley and pea. Separate fallow plots were included with each planting date. Preplant tillage was conducted with a field cultivator for all treatments. Across years, crops, and planting dates, land rolling approximately doubled densities of tumble mustard, Russian thistle, kochia, and redroot pigweed shortly after crop emergence and at harvest compared with nonrolled. Land rolling increased density of early-emerging green foxtail but density at harvest was not affected. Wild oat densities were not influenced by rolling. Weed biomass at harvest was greater after land rolling than nonrolled. Land rolling after planting decreased subsequent pea yield by 330 kg/ha, but did not influence water use or water use efficiency. Land rolling is advantageous by hastening depletion of soil broadleaf weed seed banks in forage barley, but may increase problematic broadleaf weeds in pea.																	0890-037X	1550-2740				JAN-MAR	2009	23	1					23	27		10.1614/WT-08-023.1							WOS:000264473400005						
B	Honda, Y		Harris, JD; Brown, PL		Honda, Yukio			ECOLOGY OF SOIL SEED BANK IN CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF ENDANGERED PLANTS	WILDLIFE: DESTRUCTION, CONSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY	Wildlife Protection Destruction and Extinction											Soil seed banks have specific roles in conservation and restoration of plants. Material from a seed bank is less influential on the genotypes of local populations, since it pools the local endemic genotypes. In addition, a seed bank is expected to increase the genetic diversity of subdivided populations of endangered plants. In populations which have already disappeared due to habitat loss, the seed bank is the only hope to restore the populations. Hence, sound information on soil seed banks is essential to enhance the success of conservation and restoration in plant species. Recently, I showed that seed dormancy, which has been considered the mechanism of a seed bank formation, is not essential for the persistence of the seed bank for at least 5 years (criterion of long-term persistence). Many plants avoid germination under dense vegetation or in too deep soil because of the lowest competitive ability of seedlings in their whole life cycle and the limitation of nutrient reserves in seeds. Temperature fluctuations and/or light quality and quantity work as reliable gap-surface signals for many plants. Using such signals, many plants actually germinate at gap-surface with dexterity. Reversibility in the state of phytochrome (P(r) and P(fr)) must ensure the dexterous gap-surface detection in germination. Although some types of dormancy such as physical dormancy contribute to the persistence of a seed bank, dormancy mainly operates the temporal timing in germination. Thus, seeds avoid germination and form a seed bank under spatially and temporally unfavorable conditions where it can not expect reproductive success. Since seeds of many plants can perceive the favorability in surrounding environments, the seed bank of a target species in the restoration may be accumulated in an unfavorable environment where reproductive success is not expected. For example, seeds of hygrophilous plants were actually sampled from dry soils of past wetlands. This trend holds true not only to target species in the restoration but also invasive plants. Surface soil may be polluted by invasive species seeds compared with deep soil. Restoration using a seed bank at surface soil actually raised an invader species rather than endangered plants in some cases. Samplings of a seed bank for restoration have been collected randomly in the local habitat. However, sampling design of a seed bank considering the unfavorability for both growth of the target species and invasive species will increase the success of the restoration using a seed bank. Several old fruits of lotus Nelumbo nucifera were recovered from a peat deposit at Kemigawa (Chiba Prefecture) in Japan. This lotus is currently called 'Ohga lotus' (Picture 1). Unfortunately, because all of the fruits were germinated, none was left for radiocarbon dating. However, wood from an old boat found at the same level in the peat deposit was dated roughly 3000 years old. Although this was not necessarily the age of the fruits, the recovery of the Ohga lotus is a symbolic occurrence indicating that a soil seed bank has the potential to restore past plant species that have disappeared from standing vegetation.

(Asteraceae), an Endangered Herb Endemic to Florida Scrub	CASTANEA												Seed source, absence of favorable microhabitat conditions, and presence of competitors, predators or allelochemicals are among the many factors that may limit the germination of viable seeds. We conducted six field, growth chamber, and veranda experiments to investigate the effects of seed source, physical or chemical presence of co-occurring species, and litter presence on germination percentages of the Florida scrub endemic Liatris ohlingerae. This perennial herb produces many seeds but recruits few seedlings. Germination percentages were similar when seeds from scrub and roadside habitats were sown into their own and the contrasting habitat. We found no evidence of chemical inhibition from a co-occurring terrestrial lichen or from the allelopathic Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), the dominant shrub in the habitat preferred by L. ohlingerae. However, germination was higher in shallow than in deep litter, and was suppressed by litter from oaks and pines compared to litter from Florida rosemary. In one experiment, higher levels of post-sowing seed predation closer to Florida rosemary shrubs limited germination. Germination of intact G. ohlingerae seeds generally exceeded 60% under a range of field and lab conditions. High field germination percentages within a few weeks of sowing suggest that l.. ohlingerae does not maintain a sizeable persistent seed bank. Low seedling recruitment in this endangered plant is not likely caused by poor seed germination.																	0008-7475					DEC	2008	73	4					235	250		10.2179/0008-7475-73.4.235							WOS:000264037500001

The application of bio-insecticides in half of the plot was evaluated. The rest was kept without application, as control area. The effectiveness of the product was determined through random samplings, in which adult chrysomelids and the associated were captured Besides, 100 young folioles were randomly collected to determine the degree of infestation provoked by the chrysomelids, according to the method of lesions. For the data analysis, the fulfillment of statistical assumptions was verified through the test of normality chi(2) and of homogeneity of Kendall. Also, the non-parametric test of contrast Friedman was used to know the effect of the application on the decrease of the foliole intake. The presence of five chrysomelid species from different genera (Diabrotica, Colaspis, Odionychus, Cryptocephalus and Epitrix) was proved. They were the main phytophagous organisms associated Diabrotica sp had the highest index, 1 2 individuals/m(2). The bioinsecticide showed reprellent effect since the second sampling week by decreasing drastically the populations from 18 to 7 adults/plot. This decline propitiated the reduction of harms of the treated plot from 33 to 12 % of infestation It was proved the presence of bioregulator organisms. Among them, the arachnids and hymenoptera had the highest proportion. It is concluded that CubaNim SM, provoked the decrease of the chrysomelid propulations at non-harmful levels, not affecting the bioregulator species; thus, this product is a viable and ecological alternative in the pest regulation.																	0864-0408	2079-3480				DEC	2008	42	4					399	403									WOS:000272694300015						
J	Pagel, J; Fritzsch, K; Biedermann, R; Schroder, B				Pagel, Joern; Fritzsch, Katrin; Biedermann, Robert; Schroeder, Boris			ANNUAL PLANTS UNDER CYCLIC DISTURBANCE REGIME: BETTER UNDERSTANDING THROUGH MODEL AGGREGATION	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In their application for conservation ecology, "classical'' analytical models and individual-based simulation models (IBMs) both entail their specific strengths and weaknesses, either in providing a detailed and realistic representation of processes or in regard to a comprehensive model analysis. This well-known dilemma may be resolved by the combination of both approaches when tackling certain problems of conservation ecology. Following this idea, we present the complementary use of both an IBM and a matrix population model in a case study on grassland conservation management. First, we develop a spatially explicit IBM to simulate the long-term response of the annual plant Thlaspi perfoliatum (Brassicaceae), claspleaf pennycress, to different management schemes (annual mowing vs. infrequent rototilling) based on field experiments. In order to complement the simulation results by further analyses, we aggregate the IBM to a spatially nonexplicit deterministic matrix population model. Within the periodic environment created by management regimes, population dynamics are described by periodic products of annual transition matrices. Such periodic matrix products provide a very conclusive framework to study the responses of species to different management return intervals. Thus, using tools of matrix model analysis (e. g., loop analysis), we can both identify dormancy within the age-structured seed bank as the pivotal strategy for persistence under cyclic disturbance regimes and reveal crucial thresholds in some less certain parameters. Results of matrix model analyses are therefore successfully tested by comparing their results to the respective IBM simulations. Their implications for an enhanced scientific basis for management decisions are discussed as well as some general benefits and limitations of the use of aggregating modeling approaches in conservation.

Tropical dry forests in Venezuela: assessing status, threats and future prospects	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Tropical dry forests may be among the world's most threatened ecosystems, but few studies have objectively quantified their status and threats. This study analysed Venezuelan dry forests at multiple scales, assessing status, present threats and the policy context shaping their future. Historical and current dry forest cover at both national and local scales were contrasted, and a set of quantitative risk assessment criteria applied. While dry forests were vulnerable nationally, in northern-central locations they were endangered. Clearing for cattle ranching and for intensive and subsistence agriculture were the principal factors driving dry forest loss at the national scale, while at a local level, urbanization and fire seemed to be the primary threats. The analysis emphasized the separation of risk assessment from the very different task of establishing conservation priorities; high risk areas may not necessarily be the highest priority for investment, and policy makers may become explicitly aware of the spatial scale at which their policies are implemented, as well as how these policies may affect or be affected by the status of ecosystems beyond their area of influence. The main challenge to future dry forest conservation is a paucity of explicit policies for management and use. However, scientifically-based management can support positive dry forest policies in many ways, including identifying locations and protocols for ecological restoration, maintaining seed banks, quantifying baseline conditions, and monitoring genetic diversity and other indicators.

Impact of an exotic earthworm on seed dispersal of an indigenous US weed	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Ambrosia trifida L. (giant ragweed), an aggressive weed of US grain crops and indigenous to North America, colonizes no-tillage crop fields and undisturbed soils despite its large seed size and susceptibility to seed predation. Secondary seed dispersal is critical to seed survival and seedling establishment, yet mechanisms of secondary dispersal are poorly understood for such large-seeded weedy species. 2.Field experiments were conducted to determine how seed foraging by the European exotic burrowing earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L., affected A. trifida seed burial and seedling recruitment, and to determine seed selectivity by L. terrestris. 3. Earthworms collected and buried over 90% of A. trifida seeds placed on the soil surface at a rate eightfold faster than abiotic seed burial. There was a sixfold higher concentration of seeds in burrows than in surrounding soil and a mean of 127 A. trifida seeds per burrow after a single season of A. trifida seed dispersal. 4. Earthworms buried A. trifida seeds from 0.5 to 22 cm deep and reduced recruitment by 37% compared to seeds buried abiotically and protected from predators, due to burial of some seeds below emergence depth limits. However, seedling biomass was increased by 30%. 5. Earthworms foraged selectively among seeds of 11 large-seeded species and collected more seeds of A. trifida than of other species. The earthworms buried small (8.5 mm) A. trifida seeds more deeply and reduced their emergence more than large (11.5 mm) A. trifida seeds. 6. Synthesis and applications. The novel interaction of L. terrestris and A. trifida increases seed bank formation of A. trifida. Burrows of L. terrestris provide safe sites for seeds of A. trifida that may increase seedling establishment in environments with a high risk of seed predation. Control measures to prevent reproduction by A. trifida should be increased where L. terrestris is present due to the earthworms' ability to bury and protect weed seeds. Selective seed caching by this widely distributed earthworm species may change plant community composition in agricultural and natural areas in North America and influence the evolution of seed traits. Land managers should consider the effects of L. terrestris on seedling regeneration of native and exotic plant species in areas undergoing colonization by L. terrestris.																	0021-8901	1365-2664				DEC	2008	45	6					1621	1629		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01489.x							WOS:000260257800008

Long-term dynamics of a semiarid grass steppe under stochastic climate and different grazing regimes: A simulation analysis	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We built a grid-hased spatial explicit stochastic model that simulates grazing events and basic processes like seedling establishment, growth or mortality of the dominant species in the grass steppes of Patagonia. After evaluating the model with field data, we performed simulation experiments aimed to explore the interaction of precipitation and grazing regimes on vegetation dynamics. Grazing generated a reduction in tussock density which results in a decline in aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Both response variables presented a non-linear behavior including high temporal variability and delay effects, which may prolong for decades. There was a clear threshold in the response of the variables to stock density, though changes become evident only when a highly selective grazing Scenario Was Used. Under high stock density conditions, precipitation Use efficiency (PUE) was 82% lower than the values for non-grazed runs. The inter-annual variability of precipitation was more important than the grazing regime in explaining differences in tussock density. Simulation results highlight important issues regarding rangeland management: grazing regime might be as important as stocking density as a degradation agent, temporal lags might obscure degradation processes for decades, the definition of monitoring variables need to consider their response time constants.

J	Bossuyt, B; Honnay, O				Bossuyt, Beatrijs; Honnay, Olivier			Can the seed bank be used for ecological restoration? An overview of seed bank characteristics in European communities	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Can seeds in the seed bank be considered as a potential source of material for the restoration of European plant communities including forest, marsh, grassland and heathland? Methods: This study reviews seed bank studies (1990-2006) to determine if they provide useful and reliable results to predict restoration success. We formally selected 102 seed bank studies and analyzed differences between four plant community types in several seed bank characteristics, such as seed density, species richness and similarity between seed bank and vegetation. We also assessed the dominant genera present in the seed bank in each plant community. Results: We observed remarkably consistent trends when comparing seed bank characteristics among community types. Seed density was lowest for grassland and forest communities and highest in marshes, whereas species richness, diversity and evenness of the seed bank community was lowest in heathland and highest in grassland. Similarity between seed bank and vegetation was low in forest, and high in grassland. There was a lot of overlap of the dominant genera of seed bank communities in all studies. Conclusions: The absence of target species and the high dominance of early successional species, in particular Juncus spp., indicate that restoration of target plant communities relying only on seed germination from the seed bank is in most cases not feasible. The exceptions are heathland and early successional plant communities occurring after temporally recurring disturbances. Restoration of plant communities composed of late successional species, such as woody species or herbaceous species typical of woodland or forest rely mainly on seed dispersal and not on in situ germination.

We hypothesize that seed bank and aboveground vegetation are closely and sequentially linked at small spatial and time scales. We conducted a field spatially explicit investigation to explore the spatial and temporal relationship between both compartments. Abundance, composition and spatial structure at different small-scales of seed bank and aboveground vegetation were analysed through 100 permanent plots during two consecutive (dry and wet) periods of growth. Following a conceptual transition path model, we analysed changes in correlation values in composition and spatial aggregation between both compartments along time including seasonal variations of seed bank. Shape of spatial structures were evaluated using partial Mantel correlograms. Annuals and perennials guilds were studied separately. During the wet year, annuals increased their aerial spatial aggregation and cover, whereas the opposite happened for perennials. Density and spatial aggregation of the seed bank increased for both guilds in the two seasons following the rain period, especially in annuals. The clumped structure of the transient seed bank is a consequence of the addition of spatial structure of extant vegetation and the persistent seed bank. Expression of the persistent seed bank is much lower during the dry period for the annual guild. In spite of the strong yearly variability, the community maintained a highly structured spatiotemporal pattern. The mechanisms promoting this stability differed for annual and perennial guilds. Temporal persistence in perennials relied mainly in established plants longevity, whereas annual guild persistence depended solely on seed bank. This tight structure was coherent with the existence of successional dynamics in the community, although persistent seed bank could moderate the pace. Longer term studies of seed bank-standing vegetation dynamics are required to fully understand this process.

Postfire seed bank dynamics in semiarid grasslands	PLANT ECOLOGY												We evaluated the combined effects of fire after drought on the seed bank composition and its role in the postfire recovery of NW Patagonia grasslands. During three years, we monitored the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation. Species were arranged in functional groups and Detrended Correspondence Analysis was used to separate sites according to species and functional groups. Similarity between aboveground vegetation and seed bank was calculated with Sorensen Index. In the first year, the seed density was similar in the control and burned sites and was lower than following years in all the sites. The species that survived the high temperatures were all annuals with the exception of the perennial species Fabiana imbricata and Rumex acetosella. In the second postfire year, the diversity and seed density increased due to the contribution of fugitive species (rare in the community) and exotic annual species. Seed bank of perennial species was the most affected by fire and just recovered in the third year. Drought did not affect the similarity between the seed bank and vegetation. Fire had low impact on the total seed bank, probably due to the heat buffering nature of the soil, whereas drought reduced significantly seed bank size and richness. Seed bank contributes to grassland richness maintenance.																	1385-0237					DEC	2008	199	2					175	185		10.1007/s11258-008-9422-1							WOS:000260514400003

EFFECTS OF WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS ON Vallisneria nana IN THE BURNETT RIVER IN SOUTHEAST QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Changes in aquatic macrophyte populations in the Burnett River in southeast Queensland, Australia are described with respect to the effects of water level fluctuations and possible impact on the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). This protected fish relies on macrophyte beds as spawning and nursery areas. Studies were conducted prior to, during and following construction of a new weir on the river. Comparative results of impounded and non-impounded sites were conducted to investigate seasonal and inter-annual changes in macrophytes and the effects of both a rapid rise in water level when the impoundment first filled and a decline, on new plants in shallow water. Macrophyte communities in newly inundated areas were studied to determine the time taken for seedlings to emerge and reach a cover sufficient to represent spawning habitats for the lungfish. Vallisneria nana dominated the macrophyte beds, which were scoured from the river by a large flow event in May 1998, the effects of which persisted for at least 1 year. Most newly emerging seedlings of Vallisneria perished following a small decline of 7 cm in water level. Decrease in plant biomass and death of established plants in highly turbid water resulted within 6-9 weeks following larger water level rises of 4.0-5.5 m in the new impoundment.

J	Schutte, BJ; Regnier, EE; Harrison, SK				Schutte, Brian J.; Regnier, Emilie E.; Harrison, S. Kent			The association between seed size and seed longevity among maternal families in Ambrosia trifida L. populations	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												In temperate plant communities, seed size is often inversely related to seed longevity at the species level. We tested if the inverse relationship between seed size and seed longevity holds among individuals within populations of Ambrosia trifida L. (Asteraceae), a summer annual agricultural weed in the eastern United States Corn Belt that typically emerges in two successive flushes: one before 1 May and one after 1 May. The effects of maternal phenotype on seed morphology, seed weight, late emergence (emergence after 1 May) and seedbank persistence were determined in two 1-year experiments. All seeds were collected from individuals at weekly intervals for 3 weeks. Sixty seeds per collection were used in the analysis. Despite fluctuating environmental conditions during seed development, seed weight within maternal families remained constant for different maturation times. Differences among families constituted 69% of total variation in seed weight, whereas differences within maternal families composed 31% of the variation in seed weight. Percentage late emergence and percentage seed-bank persistence varied among maternal families. In four maternal families, either 0% or 100% of seedlings emerged after 1 May, but a majority of other maternal families produced seedlings both before and after 1 May. Seed-bank persistence rates ranged from 1 to 51% among maternal families. Percentage late emergence and percentage seed-bank persistence were inversely related to maternal-family mean seed weight in 2006, but not in 2005. These results suggest that the inverse relationship between seed size and seed longevity occurs among individuals of a population, but is affected by the environment.																	0960-2585					DEC	2008	18	4					201	211		10.1017/S0960258508082974							WOS:000262430900003						
J	D'Souza, LE; Barnes, PW				D'Souza, Lana E.; Barnes, Paul W.			WOODY PLANT EFFECTS ON SOIL SEED BANKS IN A CENTRAL TEXAS SAVANNA	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												We studied germinable seed banks in soil associated with grasslands, relatively young (<40 years) juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper), and long-established Quercus virginiana var. fusiformis (plateau live oak) patches of woody plants in a central-Texas savanna to ascertain the degree to which Ashe juniper alters the seed bank of sites previously inhabited by grassland vegetation, and to assess how seed banks differ beneath two common types of patches associated with woody plants in this savanna ecosystem. Across all habitats and over an annual growth cycle, 3,364 seedlings representing 116 species emerged from these seed banks. Annual forbs were the dominant life form in all habitats (62% ofseedlings). The fraction of perennial forb and graminoid seedlings was comparable (19 versus 18%, respectively), and seedlings of woody plants were rare. Density, diversity, and species composition of seed banks varied significantly among the three habitats. Seed banks in grassland and live oak were most dissimilar, and seed banks of Ashe juniper were intermediate in species composition. Early-to-mid-successional species present in grasslands were absent from seed banks of Ashe juniper. Late-successional species of grasses were either absent or few in the seed bank in all habitats. Results indicate that occupation of grasslands by Ashe juniper alters seed banks after a relatively short time, and these changes are distinct from patches of woody plants that have a long-term history of occupation of sites. Approaches to restoration of grasslands that involve removal of Ashe juniper alone cannot rely on the soil seed bank for rapid reestablishment of climax grassland communities.																	0038-4909	1943-6262				DEC	2008	53	4					495	506		10.1894/JB-01.1							WOS:000261752100010

Grazing management influences the dynamics of populations of Stylosanthes hippocampoides (Oxley fine stem stylo)	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS												This paper describes a study to identify those factors which control the persistence of the Subtropical legume Stylosanthes hippocampoides, formerly S. guianensis cv. Oxley (fine stem stylo). The dynamics of S. hippocampoides populations was recorded in permanent quadrats at 2 stocking rates in a grazing study conducted between 1987 and 1992 in south-eastern Queensland. Density of mature plants fluctuated between 10 and 60 plants/m(2) during the 5 years with the major contributing factors being variations in seedling recruitment and survival, which, in turn, reflected the size of the soil seed bank and seasonal rainfall. Plant density was consistently higher at the lower stocking rate of 1 beast/1.5 ha compared with 1 beast/1 ha; however, the effect of stocking rate was minor compared with fluctuation due to seasonal variation in rainfall. The maximum life span of the original plants exceeded 5 years, while the survival of seedling cohorts was strongly impacted by seasonal rainfall. Total exclosure from grazing during summer increased the size of the soil seed bank although a precise time period during summer was not identified, while grazing at the lower stocking pressure produced the same outcome. It was concluded that the large seasonal variation that occurs in S. hippocampoides density is driven by large seasonal variation in seedling recruitment, which, in turn, is influenced by the size of the soil seed bank.																	0049-4763					DEC	2008	42	4					193	201									WOS:000263654200001

J	Kahmen, S; Poschlod, P				Kahmen, Stefanie; Poschlod, Peter			Effects of grassland management on plant functional trait composition	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Semi-natural grasslands are threatened in Central Europe by intense fertilisation, afforestation or abandonment due to changes in agricultural practice during the last decades. Nature conservation but also management within the EU agri-environmental schemes (cross compliance with national good farming practices) seek to maintain these grasslands by management. The study presented here investigated the effects of different management treatments on grassland vegetation of various vegetation types. The treatments were low-intensity grazing, mulching once and twice a year and burning in winter. We investigated plant functional trait responses to the treatments aiming to identify dominant or differentiating processes of the treatments ruling trait responses. We assume that the processes 'selective removal of the phytomass by grazing', 'small scale soil disturbances', 'treatment frequency', 'nutrient conditions', 'vertical defoliation' and 'timing of the treatment' are associated with the response of the plant functional traits 'life form','plant height', 'canopy structure', 'specific leaf area', 'storage organs','lateral spread','plant persistence', 'seed bank longevity', 'start of flowering','duration of flowering' and 'seed mass'. All treatments maintained grassland vegetation by regular phytomass removal with hemicryptophytes and perennials with clonal growth being dominant. Grazing encouraged woody life forms through selective removal of the phytomass and species with small seeds and persistent seed bank. A relation to soil disturbances was discussed. Mulching treatments were especially characterised by increasing dominance of ground-layer species through regular vertical defoliation close to the ground. Burning in winter benefited species with storage capacities for nutrients withdraw. The traits 'plant height' and 'SLA', associated with treatment frequency and nutrient conditions, as well as the phenological traits 'start' and 'duration of flowering', associated with the timing of the treatments, did not respond differently among the treatments. The study shows that the grasslands show a convergent response to management treatments from a functional point of view although they may be floristically divergent. Therefore, a functional approach is useful not only to understand the mechanisms behind changes in vegetation after applying certain management treatments but also to predict changes.

Recovery of Alpine Plants after a Severe Human Disturbance in the Andes of Central Chile	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Disturbance is likely to affect Multiple life stages and may be most critical in seedling germination and establishment through indirectly affecting soil properties. Following disturbance, plants establish from seeds that either exist on the site or that disperse onto the site. Here, A,c examined the effects of a I-year-old severe human disturbance (approx. 1 ha) on alpine vegetation recovery in the Andes of central Chile (33 degrees S. 60 degrees W) at 2800 in a.s.l. during two growing seasons (2006-2007). Particularly, we assessed the effects of soil properties and seed rain on post-disturbance seedling emergence using two sets of denuded slopes of different exposure (South and northwest, respectively) and two appropriate control areas. The disturbed area oil the south-facing slope was drier than its respective control. while the opposite was observed on the disturbed area on the northwest-facing slope, The differences in soil water content between both slopes coincided with the results of seedling recruiting. The south-facing slope, with a more humid undisturbed area, showed a greater number of emerging seedlings than the disturbed slope. Conversely, on the northwest-facing slope, the Main recruiting of seedlings was observed on the disturbed area, while the undisturbed area showed practically no emergence of new individuals. In addition, our results indicate that seedling recruitment Occurred from a persistent seed bank constituted mostly by species with long-lived and deeply viable seeds, though in this particular Study. we could not corroborate it empirically. Although long-term Studies are desirable to make more definitive Conclusions, our results provide the First step to understanding the capacity for vegetation recovery after I Severe human disturbance in the Andes of central Chile, where seed banks and soil moisture seem to play a pivotal role.

The combination of different primer pairs and nested PCR steps revealed an unexpectedly rich archaeal community. Overall, 140 samples were analyzed, yielding 169 different 16S rRNA gene sequences spread over 14 Crenarchaeota (109 sequences) and six Euryarchaeota phylogenetic clusters. Most of the Crenarchaeota (98% of the total crenarchaeotal sequences) affiliated within the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeota Group (MCG) and were related to both marine and freshwater phylotypes. Euryarchaeota mainly grouped within the Deep Hydrothermal Vent Euryarchaeota (DHVE) cluster (80% of the euryarchaeotal sequences) and the remaining 20% distributed into three less abundant taxa, most of them composed of soil and sediment clones. The largest fraction of phylotypes from the two archaeal kingdoms (79% of the Crenarchaeota and 54% of the Euryarchaeota) was retrieved from the anoxic hypolimnion, indicating that these cold and sulfide-rich waters constitute an unexplored source of archaeal richness. The taxon rank-frequency distribution showed two abundant taxa (MCG and DHVE) that persisted in the water column through seasons, plus several rare ones that were only detected occasionally. Differences in richness distribution and seasonality were observed, but no clear correlations were obtained when multivariate statistical analyses were carried out.

J	Abrahams, C				Abrahams, Carlos			Climate change and lakeshore conservation: a model and review of management techniques	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Climate change is expected to cause significant changes to the hydrology of lakes, reservoirs and other wetlands. In particular, there will be an increase in the level of disturbance produced by water-level fluctuations. This may have adverse consequences for biodiversity, water quality and human uses. Strategies to cope with these climate change impacts are currently poorly developed. This article proposes the use of Grime's CSR theory as a framework to understand the potential impacts of climate change on shoreline vegetation. It is also used to recommend a series of practical management techniques that will contribute to the adaptation capacity of shoreline ecosystems. Four key areas are highlighted: hydrological controls, substrate conditions, shoreline topography and vegetation establishment.

The effect of microhabitats on vegetation and its relationships with seedlings and soil seed bank in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune community	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We examined species composition and diversity of vegetation and soil seed bank associated with different microhabitats in Mediterranean semiarid sand dune conimunity, to identify which functional groups or species benefit from trampling, and to provide a basis for management. In this community microhabitats were found to significantly influence species abundance and biomass of dominant functional groups and dominant species. The open patches generally have the greatest species richness, diversity and productivity. The highest value of similarity occurred during June to September and the lowest value occurred in April when seedling emergence stopped but before new seeds dispersed. Shrubs did not benefit their understorey plant functional groups except for perennial forbs and Apiaceae due to their denser canopy and larger litter amount. Trampling decreased the species diversity of vegetation and did not facilitate the establishment of herbaceous plants, but was beneficial for some functional groups such as Apiaceae and Brassicaceae as well as some species such as Polycorpon succulentum. A positive relationship was found between productivity and diversity in this community and on the trail, but the relationship in the open area and shrub understorey was not significant. This work can provide a deeper understanding of small-scale vegetation processes and mosaic patterns of distribution. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies on the soil seed bank of the environmental weed Rumex vesicarius (Fam.: Polygonaceae) at a rehabilitated mine site in semi-arid Western Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Long-term control of the weed Rumex vesicarius (Fam.: Polygonaceae) (common name: Ruby Dock) in rehabilitated mine sites in semi-arid areas of Western Australia requires knowledge of the total size of the seed bank and its properties (longevity and germination of the seeds). Ruby Dock seeds are polymorphic (light and dark of various colour shades) and of high potential viability. At the Plutonic mine site near Meekatharra (Western Australia) areas heavily infested with Ruby Dock were characterised by large numbers of fruits, which contained numerous viable, dark seeds. Intact, light seeds were found in only a small percentage of the recovered fruits. Experiments in the greenhouse demonstrate that a large number of potentially viable Ruby Dock seeds remained in the soil after three germination seasons. A high proportion of the seeds, which germinated produced seedlings during the first germination season, soon after watering commenced. The application of herbicides at seedling stage, removal of fruit mats (which consist of large numbers of fruits intermingled with decaying plant material from previous seasons) and increase in competition through native plants currently appear to be the most efficient measures to control the size of the seed bank in rehabilitated mine sites.

The species-trait matrix comprises referenced information under the control of an editorial board, for ca. 3000 species of the Northwest European flora, combining existing information and additional measurements. The data base currently contains data on 26 plant traits that describe three key features of plant dynamics: persistence, regeneration and dispersal. The LEDA-Traitbase is freely available at www.leda-traitbase.org. 3. We present the structure of the data base and an overview of the trait information available. 4. Synthesis.

Genetic change following fire in populations of a seed-banking perennial plant	OECOLOGIA												Disturbances such as fire have the potential to remove genetic variation, but seed banks may counter this loss by restoring alleles through a reservoir effect. We used allozyme analysis to characterize genetic change in two populations of the perennial Hypericum cumulicola, an endemic of the fire-prone Florida scrub. We assessed genetic variation before and 1, 2, and 3 years after fire that killed nearly all aboveground plants. Populations increased in size following fire, with most seedlings likely recruited from a persistent seed bank. Four of five loci were variable. Most alleles were present in low frequencies, but our large sample sizes allowed detection of significant trends. Expected heterozygosity increased, and allele presence and allele frequencies showed marked shifts following fire. The post-fire seedling cohort contained new alleles to the study and one new allele to the species. Population differentiation between the two study sites did not change. Our study is the first to directly documents genetic changes following fire, a dominant ecological disturbance worldwide, and is also one of the few to consider shifts in a naturally recruiting post-disturbance seedling cohort. We demonstrate the potential of seed banks to restore genetic variation lost between disturbances. Our study demonstrates that rapid genetic change can occur with disturbance and that fire can have positive effects on the genetics of rare species.

Since temperate calcareous grasslands contain several thermophilous species typical of fire prone habitats, heat shock can be expected to break dormancy of target species for calcareous grassland restoration. We tested the effect of heat shock on the estimated density and species richness of seeds in soil samples. Heat shock treatments between 70 and 110 degrees C resulted in both a higher estimated seed density and estimated species richness, in particular of specialist calcareous grassland species. Moreover, 25 species germinated exclusively from the heat-treated samples. This indicates that several species would have been missed by handling soil seed bank samples following the standard germination protocol, resulting in an underestimation of the restoration potential.

J	Denham, AJ				Denham, Andrew J.			Seed predation limits post-fire recruitment in the waratah (Telopea speciosissima)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seed predation may reduce recruitment in populations that are limited by the availability of seeds rather than microsites. Fires increase the availability of both seeds and microsites, but in plants that lack a soil- or canopy-stored seed bank, post-fire recruitment is often delayed compared to the majority of species. Pyrogenic flowering species, such as Telopea speciosissima, release their non-dormant seeds more than 1 year after fire, by which time seed predation and the availability of microsites may differ from that experienced by plants recruiting soon after fire. I assessed the role of post-dispersal seed predation in limiting seedling establishment after fire in T. speciosissima, in southeastern Australia. Using a seed-planting experiment, I manipulated vertebrate access to seeds and the combined cover of litter and vegetation within experimental microsites in the 2 years of natural seed fall after a fire. Losses to vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators were rapid and substantial, with 50% of seeds consumed after 2 months in exposed locations and after 5 months when vertebrates were excluded. After 7 months, only 6% of seeds or seedlings survived, even where vertebrates were excluded. Removing litter and vegetation increased the likelihood of seed predation by vertebrates, but had little influence on losses due to invertebrates. Microsites with high-density vegetation and litter cover were more likely to have seed survival or germination than microsites with low-density cover. Recruitment in pyrogenic flowering species may depend upon the release of seeds into locations where dense cover may allow them to escape from vertebrate predators. Even here, conditions suitable for germination must occur soon after seed release for seeds to escape from invertebrate predators. Seed production will also affect recruitment after any one fire, while the ability of some juvenile and most adult plants to resprout after fire buffers populations against rapid declines when there is little successful recruitment.

J	Cavallin, N; Vasseur, L				Cavallin, Nadia; Vasseur, Liette			Potential for red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) establishment from natural seed dispersal in old fields adjacent to forest stands	PLANT ECOLOGY												Red spruce can establish on abandoned agricultural land only from seed, unlike in logged environments where red spruce forests can establish from seedlings that survived the harvest. In this study we collected seeds from the seed rain and from soil cores to examine the abundance and distribution of the red spruce seed rain and the seed bank along a gradient from the forest interior to adjacent old fields in Greenwich, Prince Edward Island National Park (PEINP), Canada. In addition, we examined the temporal abundance and distribution of the seed rain through the seed-fall season. We subsequently tested the germination potential of red spruce seeds from the forest portion of our sites. Because red spruce seeds are usually viable for only one year, we expected the seed bank to be either very small or non-existent. We found 39 red spruce seeds in the seed bank, distributed over 13.1% of the sampled area; 37 of these seeds were definitely nonviable. From the seed rain, we collected 224 red spruce seeds, distributed over 29.4% of the sampled area; 213 of these seeds were definitely nonviable. Nearly all of the red spruce seed rain fell within the forest; differences in abundance among collection dates were not statistically significant. Our seeds had a low germination rate of 0.004%, in part because red and black spruce commonly hybridise in our study area. Despite the low rates of red spruce seed dispersal and viability, the presence of red spruce saplings in our two longest-abandoned fields shows that the species is able to slowly colonise some old fields in PEINP.																	1385-0237					NOV	2008	199	1					33	41		10.1007/s11258-008-9409-y							WOS:000259483700004						
J	Sebastia, MT; Puig, L				Sebastia, Maria-Teresa; Puig, Laura			Complex vegetation responses to soil disturbances in mountain grassland	PLANT ECOLOGY												We studied vegetation responses to disturbances originated by ants and voles in subalpine grasslands in the Eastern Pyrenees. We compared the effects of these small-scale disturbances with those of a large-scale disturbance caused by ploughing. We wanted to know if these soil disturbances promoted species richness through the existence of a specific guild of plants colonizing these areas, and if this guild was the same for all soil disturbances, independently of their extent. In general, grassland vegetation seemed to recover relatively quickly from soil-displacement disturbances, and the effects could be scaled up in time and space in terms of species richness and composition. Vole mound composition was similar to that in the surrounding grassland, suggesting that mounds were rapidly colonized by the neighbouring vegetation. Vegetation composition differed between the grassland and the ant mounds. Grasses and erect dicots coped well with repeated disturbance, while rosette-forming species and sedges were very sensitive to it. Landscape processes could be important to understanding recolonization. Species from xeric grasslands were found in mesic grasslands when disturbed by ploughing and on the tops of active ant mounds. Furrows in mesic grasslands recovered well, but decades after disturbance showed long persistence of some xeric species and increased species richness compared to terraces, while xeric grasslands showed decreased richness. This suggests that, because of those disturbances, within-habitat diversity was increased, although landscape diversity was not. However, specific disturbances showed idiosyncratic effects, which could enhance the species richness globally. In ant-affected areas, the grassland itself showed the highest plant species richness, partially associated to the presence of some species with elaiosomes not, or only rarely, found in adjacent grasslands without ant mounds. Therefore, soil disturbances occurring at different spatial scales contributed to complexity in vegetation patterns in addition to abiotic factors and grazing.				Sebastia, M.

Forty soil samples of 0.5 x 0.5 m were collected to the depth of 5.0 cm. The soil samples were maintained in nursery for four months, half in shading of 11.5% (light), and half in shading of 60% (shade). Seed germination was compared under the two shade conditions (11.5% and 60%), utilizing the t test for independent samples. Thirty-six species belonging to 17 botanical families were sampled. The families with the largest number of species were Asteraceae with 9, Rubiaceae with 5, and Poaceae with 4. Most of the species sampled (66.7%) were herbaceous. The most abundant species were the herbaceous Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster, Cenchrus sp. and Eragrostis sp., and the shrub Leandra niangaeformis Cogn. Among the tree species, Luehea grandiflora Mart. and Trema micranta (L.) Blume presented the largest number of individuals. The largest density of the herbs originating from the disturbed surrounding areas indicates a low resilience of the vegetation in the degraded area, in case a severe disturbance occurs.																	0100-6762					NOV-DEC	2008	32	6					1081	1088		10.1590/S0100-67622008000600013							WOS:000265798000014

Inferences were made whether this indicator reflects future sustainability, given the seed bank's potential for revegetating degraded sites. Its floristic composition was compared with indices obtained in other similar seed bank studies. The specific site is located at the Mata da Garagem woods, a 40-year old forest fragment covering a low ridge parallel to a campus roadway. Twenty seed bank samples were collected from randomly selected points, each sample consisting of four subsamples. The experiment was installed on the campus nursery using 20 wooden boxes (50x50x15cm). After 90 days, 508 individual plants were counted, and 38 species were identified, as belonging to 34 genera distributed among 22 families. The diversity index (H') is 2.11; whereas the equability (J) value of 0.67 is considered high compared to other seed bank studies. Cecropia hololeuca (28.9%) and Solanum erianthum (18,7%) are indicated as the most important species within the forest regeneration process. Results suggest that the seed bank studied indeed has the potential for promoting and guaranteeing an ecological succession process dynamics on degraded lands of similar ecosystems.

J	Chauhan, BS; Johnson, DE				Chauhan, Bhagirath S.; Johnson, David E.			Germination Ecology of Chinese Sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis) in the Philippines	WEED SCIENCE												Chinese sprangletop is a grass weed that has the ability to grow in both flooded and upland conditions, which makes it a widespread and abundant weed in rice and many other crops. Experiments were conducted to study the germination of this weed in the Philippines. Germination was strongly stimulated by light and warm fluctuating temperatures, suggesting high emergence of Chinese sprangletop on bare ground such as a crop seedbed. A high level of germination (95%) immediately after seed hat-vest Suggests that the soil seed bank of this species could be depleted by stale-seedbed strategies. Seed burial depth in soil strongly influenced emergence of this weed, and no seedlings emerged from seeds buried at depths of >= 0.5 cm. Maximum emergence (80%) from seeds placed on the soil surface suggests that no-till practices would enhance the emergence of seedlings. Seedling emergence from surface-sown seeds was similar (80 to 82%) between saturated and aerobic-moist soil, demonstrating that this weed does not require a saturated soil and that it can emerge from a moist soil. Flooding, even though nor continuous or deep, had a suppressive effect on the emergence and dry matter of Chinese sprangletop. Germination responses to light and seed burial depth were different between our study in the Philippines and the study conducted with seeds of an Italian Population, suggesting that Chinese sprangletop might be polymorphic. The implications of this information for weed management strategies are discussed.

J	Torra, J; Recasens, J				Torra, Joel; Recasens, Jordi			Demography of Corn Poppy (Papaver rhoeas) in Relation to Emergence Time and Crop Competition	WEED SCIENCE												Twenty-clay cohorts of corn poppy were grown in the presence or absence of barley, and seedling survival, biomass accumulation and allocation, plant reproduction, and seed dormancy were measured. Seedling survivorship and biomass accumulation differed strongly among cohorts and were influenced by crop competition. In the absence of crop competition, plants from the first three cohorts (emerging October to January) had 900% higher biomass and 160% more seeds per plant than later cohorts (emerging January to April). Crop competition reduced cohort fitness; for example, in 2003 to 2004, corn poppy biomass was reduced 57 to 96%, and seed production 77 to 97%. Seeds collected from plants that had emerged in spring were less dormant, and thus, germination and emergence of these seeds were higher (25% higher and 200 to 600% higher, respectively) than those for seeds collected from other cohorts. Environmental factors at the time of seed formation may be responsible for the observed differences in dormancy. Cohort-dependent emergence, growth, reproduction, and dormancy have relevant implications for corn poppy management and demography in agricultural systems in northeastern Spain. The dormant seeds produced by autumn to winter cohorts will be the main contributors to the seed bank and weed population shift in subsequent generations. For efficient corn poppy management, the control of cohorts emerging before or with the crop in a cereal Field is essential.

Reducing Persistent Seed Banks of Invasive Plants by Soil Solarization-The Case of Acacia saligna	WEED SCIENCE												An important factor in controlling invasive plant infestations is frequently the acceleration of the deterioration of their persistent seed bank, which is often associated with physical dormancy mechanisms. We hypothesized that breaking dormancy by heat would enhance the vulnerability of the nondormant seeds to hydrothermal stresses. The aim of the present Study was to examine the effect of soil solarization treatments (heating the soil by means of polyethylene mulching) on buried Australian Acacia seeds, with emphasis on Acacia saligna L. The results of three Field experiments indicate that soil solarization treatments caused an almost complete eradication of buried seeds of Acacia saligna and two other Australian Acacia species, Acacia murrayana and Acacia. sclerosperma. The killing mechanism of solarization was further,Studied in laboratory experiments. We observed two phases of the heat-induced deterioration of seed persistence: breaking the dormancy of the seeds and exposing the "weakened seeds" to lethal temperatures. From an ecological perspective of conservation, the present Study shows for the first time the possible utilization of solar energy, by means of soil solarization, for reducing persistent seed banks of invasive woody plants.

W.; Scheu, Stefan			Animal Ecosystem Engineers Modulate the Diversity-Invasibility Relationship	PLOS ONE												Background: Invasions of natural communities by non-indigenous species are currently rated as one of the most important global-scale threats to biodiversity. Biodiversity itself is known to reduce invasions and increase stability. Disturbances by ecosystem engineers affect the distribution, establishment, and abundance of species but this has been ignored in studies on diversity-invasibility relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined natural plant invasion into 46 plots varying in the number of plant species (1, 4, and 16) and plant functional groups (1, 2, 3, and 4) for three years beginning two years after the establishment of the Jena Experiment. We sampled subplots where earthworms were artificially added and others where earthworm abundance was reduced. We also performed a seed-dummy experiment to investigate the role of earthworms as secondary seed dispersers along a plant diversity gradient. Horizontal dispersal and burial of seed dummies were significantly reduced in subplots where earthworms were reduced in abundance. Seed dispersal by earthworms decreased with increasing plant species richness and presence of grasses but increased in presence of small herbs. These results suggest that dense vegetation inhibits the surface activity of earthworms. Further, there was a positive relationship between the number of earthworms and the number and diversity of invasive plants. Hence, earthworms decreased the stability of grassland communities against plant invasion. Conclusions/Significance: Invasibility decreased and stability increased with increasing plant diversity and, most remarkably, earthworms modulated the diversity-invasibility relationship. While the impacts of earthworms were unimportant in low diverse (low earthworm densities) and high diverse (high floral structural complexity) plant communities, earthworms decreased the stability of intermediate diverse plant communities against plant invasion. Overall, the results document that fundamental processes in plant communities like plant seed burial and invader establishment are modulated by soil fauna calling for closer cooperation between soil animal and plant ecologists.

Three sites were sampled, each of which had two of the following levels of fire severity: combusted crown, scorched crown and unaffected crown. Viable seed rain was closed related to the canopy cone bank and stand serotiny level. Soil burn severity also favoured seed dispersal. Relative germination success increased with soil burn severity whereas initial and final seedling density depended on both the canopy cone bank and soil burn severity. A positive influence of fire severity on the final/initial seedling density and final density/total seed dispersal ratios was also observed. Different post-fire management options were used at each experimental site following local operational routines. Harvesting and slash logging resulted in significantly higher seedling mortality. However, at the end of the study period, seedling density in all stands was sufficient to ensure re-establishment of A pinaster forest. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Potential application of Hyptis spicigera for biological control of Striga hermonthica infestation	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Food situation has remained insecure and unpredictable in sub-Saharan Africa leading to high levels of cyclic famine and poverty. This has been exacerbated by perennial pest problems, which cause substantial pre- and post-harvest food grain losses. Production of cereal crops is threatened by Striga hermonthica weed known to infest an estimated 46000 ha of land in the traditional food producing areas in western and coastal Kenya. It is against this background that this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Hyptis spicigera-maize cropping systems on S. hermonthica infestation and maize grain yield and, generate a recommendation compatible with the target farmer dormains. Results showed that Striga counts were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced where maize was following fallow with H. spicigera. This was most effective in reducing S. hermonthica incidence and increased maize yield from 2.2 to 3.4 T/Ha. Intercropping maize and H. spicigera in the same plot at the same time negatively affected maize growth resulting in reduced maize yields. Indications were that root cuttings of H. spicigera stimulated Striga seed germination while their stubble (stem and leaves) reduced Striga seed bank in the soil. Striga seed bank analysis showed that Striga seed depletion increased with increase in Hyptis bushes with critical Hyptis seeding rate of 3 kg/Ha for maximum reduction in Striga seed bank. The findings of this study have implications for plant protection against S. hermonthica and improvement of cereal crop production in Striga-prone environments.																	1991-637X					OCT	2008	3	10					747	752									WOS:000266203100013

Freshly matured seeds were placed in small nylon bags and were buried in pots filled with soil collected from a wetland along the Lower Havel River. The pots were subjected to different winter/spring flooding treatments (30, 60, 120, and 180 days) and to drought for up to 3 years. Every year in spring, after drawdown, the seeds were exhumed, counted and tested for germination. Seed mortality of flooded seeds was low, except for C. dubium. Flooding did not affect germination of seeds of J. atratus. Flooding of seeds of C dubium and G. officinalis had inconsistent, but no beneficial effects on germination of either. The year of harvest and the interannual variability of weather are found to be the main factors affecting germinability of C. dubium and G. officinalis in the course of the three consecutive years.																	0304-3770					OCT	2008	89	3					283	291		10.1016/j.aquabot.2008.03.001							WOS:000258054500002

The Resurrection Initiative: Storing Ancestral Genotypes to Capture Evolution in Action	BIOSCIENCE												In rare circumstances, scientists have beers able to revive dormant propagules front ancestral populations and rear them with their descendants to make inferences about evolutionary responses to environmental change. Although this is a powerful approach to directly assess microevolution, it has previously depended entirely upon fortuitous conditions to preserve ancestral material. We propose a coordinated effort to collect, preserve, and archive genetic materials today for future studies of evolutionary change--a "resurrection paradigm." The availability of ancestral material that is systematically collected and intentionally stored using best practices will greatly expand our ability to illuminate microevolutionary patterns and processes and to predict ongoing responses of species to global change. In the workshop "Project Baseline," evolutionary biologists and seed storage experts met to discuss establishing a coordinated effort to implement the resurrection paradigm.

A seed bank pathogen causes seedborne disease: Pyrenophora semeniperda on undispersed grass seeds in western North America	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE												The generalist pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda is abundant in seed banks of the exotic winter annual grass Bromus tectorum in semiarid western North America and is also found in the seed banks of co-occurring native grasses. In this study. we examined natural incidence of disease caused by this pathogen on undispersed host seeds, that is, seeds that were never directly exposed to inoculum in the seed bank. We determined experimentally that at least 90% of undispersed B. tectorum seeds exhibiting the disease were likely infected after maturity by conidia borne Superficially on the seed-covering structures. The fraction of undispersed seeds exhibiting disease under optimum conditions for infection in the laboratory varied from 0% to 22% for three grass species. Relatively high disease incidence on undispersed seeds for this dry-sporulating fungus was significantly correlated with low mean annual rainfall, dry conditions during the conidial dispersal period in early summer, and high concentrations of soilborne inoculum as evidenced by the presence of high densities of killed seeds bearing fungal stromata in the seed bank. These three variables explained 66% of the variation in seedborne disease incidence for B. tectorum seed collections made in 2005. By dispersing conidia onto host seeds while seeds are still on the plant, this pathogen achieves the potential for targeted dispersal along with seeds of its host. This may be particularly advantageous for P. semeniperda, which has large conidia (phragmospores) that may not be efficiently dispersed beyond the grass canopy boundary layer.																	0706-0661					OCT-DEC	2008	30	4					525	533		10.1080/07060660809507552							WOS:000265282100003

SECONDARY SUCCESSION DYNAMICS IN ESTUARINE MARSHES ACROSS LANDSCAPE-SCALE SALINITY GRADIENTS	ECOLOGY												Secondary succession plays a critical role in driving community structure in natural communities, yet how succession dynamics vary with environmental context is generally unknown. We examined the importance of seedling and vegetative recruitment in the secondary succession of coastal marsh vegetation across a landscape-scale environmental stress gradient. Replicate bare patches were initiated in salt, brackish, and oligohaline marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, and allowed to recover unmanipulated or with colonizing seedlings or vegetative runners removed for three years. Seed dispersal and seed bank studies were conducted at the same sites. We found that rates of recovery were 3-10 times faster in brackish and oligohaline marshes than in salt marshes. The fast pace of recovery in oligohaline marshes was driven by seedling colonization, while recovery was dominated by vegetative runners in brackish marshes and by both seedlings and runners in salt marshes. Seed and seedling availability was much greater in oligohaline marshes with up to 24 times the seed bank density compared with salt marshes. In contrast to the facilitated succession generally found in salt marshes, oligohaline marshes follow the tolerance model of succession where numerous species colonize from seed and are slowly displaced by clonal grasses whose recovery is slowed by preemptive competition from seedlings, contributing to the higher species diversity of oligohaline marshes. These findings reveal fundamental differences in the dynamics and assembly of marsh plant communities along estuarine salinity gradients that are important for conceptually understanding wetlands and for guiding the management and restoration of various types of coastal marshes.																	0012-9658					OCT	2008	89	10					2889	2899		10.1890/07-1527.1							WOS:000259995100023	18959326

Fifty-four plant species were identified growing in containers or germinating from the soil, and included Canada thistle-a prohibited weed in Alaska-and nine other species listed as invasive in Alaska. The number of species and estimated seed bank were very low for soil from vegetable starts/herbs and herbaceous bedding plants (<2 seedlings/L soil), but was greater for soil from containers containing woody plants, especially balled and burlapped ornamentals (20 seedlings/L soil). Container alien plant seed bank size was strongly related to type of soil. Potting (soil-less) soil contained 1.2 germinating seeds/L, soil-based soil 5.5 seeds/L, and mineral soil 18.7 seeds/L. Growers and vendors were variables that also influenced the size of the container seed bank, suggesting that weed management practiced during production and at the point of sale can greatly influence seed banks of ornamental containers.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				OCT	2008	1	4					331	336		10.1614/IPSM-08-063.1							WOS:000208507200001

Differential soil seed bank longevity of Paederia foetida L., an invasive woody vine, across three habitats in Florida	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Liu, H.

Differential soil seed bank longevity of an invasive woody vine (Paederia foetida L.) across three habitats in Florida. J. Torrey Bet. Sec. 135: 491-496. 2008.-Knowledge on seed bank longevity is especially important in understanding population dynamics of invasive species and critical in determining the intensity and length of control efforts. In this Study we determined the soil seed bank longevity of Paederia foetida across three main natural habitats that P. foetida occur in Florida (the interior of a mixed mesic forest, a forest edge, and an open grassland). A native of eastern Asia, P. foetida is invasive in natural and human created habitats in the southern United States and Hawaii. We placed multiple bags with known number of fruits (diaspores) in four stations on the soil surface in each habitat and retrieved the bags once a year for three years. Our data demonstrated that P. foetida forms a short term persistent seed bank and seeds may remain viable for more than one year in the soil seed bank. The decline of soil seed bank was significantly slower in the forest interior than in forest margin and grassland. In the forest interior, 38% of the seeds remained viable for one year, but only 2% remained viable in the forest edge and open grassland habitats. The percentages of viable seeds dropped to 4.7%, 0.4%, and 0% after two years in the soil seed banks in the forest interior, the forest edge, and the open habitat, respectively. After three years, only 0.3%, 0.1%, and 0% of seeds were found viable in these three habitats, respectively. Even though very small proportions of seeds survived three years, given that the annual fruit production of P. foetida is typically large and that it only takes a minimum of two viable seeds to start a new reproducing population for this self-incompatible species, we recommend post adult plant elimination monitoring for two years in open habitat, but up to four years in forest areas.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				OCT-DEC	2008	135	4					491	496		10.3159/08-RA-048R.1							WOS:000261747800004

(Chenopodiaceae) on the active sand dunes of northeastern Inner Mongolia, China	PLANT AND SOIL												The seed banks of active sand dunes are critical for the adaptation of psammophytes to unstable habitats. However, existing reports have failed to effectively elucidate the spatiotemporal structure of these seed banks and the factors regulating them. The seed bank pattern of the annual psammophyte Agriophyllum squarrosum Moq. in active sand dunes was studied by taking into consideration the time, the depth of the soil profile, dune positions, and seed bank type (released seed bank, belowground and aboveground canopy seed banks). Most canopy-stored seeds were unburied before the following March of the maturation year; however, they were buried from March to May. The seed bank mainly comprised the aboveground canopy-stored seeds from September of the year of seed maturation to the following March. The seed bank was concentrated in the surface soil layers (0-10 cm) from March of the year following seed maturation to June and was concentrated in the deep soil layers (10-50 cm) after June. The seed bank in the lower leeward slope tended to be larger than those in the other dune positions. The canopy-stored seed:released seed ratio differed between dune positions. The findings of this study are: (1) sand burial and wind erosion play key roles in shaping the spatiotemporal pattern of the seed banks of active sand dunes, and (2) delayed seed release may be a major factor regulating the spatiotemporal pattern of the seed banks of certain psammophytes.																	0032-079X					OCT	2008	311	1-2					97	107		10.1007/s11104-008-9661-x							WOS:000259042800009

Germination and seed bank biology in some Iberian populations of Anagyris foetida L. (Leguminosae)	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												In Anagyris foetida, the fruits are disseminated by fall under gravity. No dispersing agent is as yet known, so that the fruits are located near the mother plant. The species presents an important seed bank that differs between the two populations studied, probably due to their different production of seeds/individual and to the livestock pressure. The germination of control seeds was found to be null or very low, with no improvement following exposure to high temperatures, but reaching high values following scarification in all the populations studied. This indicates that the failure in germination must be attributed to the hardness of the testa, with the seeds presenting physical dormancy. Also, the browsing of sheep on ripe fruit increases germination to 48% due to mechanical scarification, with this being the only positive effect those animals have on these plants. There were differences in germination after scarification between populations and years which could have been due to intrinsic characteristics.

SEED BANK FROM SOIL OF COFFEE PLANTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GREVILLEA TREES	PLANTA DANINHA												This study aimed to study the composition and dynamics of seed bank from soil of coffee plantations associated with grevilea trees in the experimental fields of the Southwest Bahia State University. on Vitoria da Conquista campus. The experiments were carried out from September 2006 to May 2007. The coffee trees (Coffea arabica) were sown at three x one 171 spacing, associated with grevillea trees (Grevillea robusta) and maintained at densities of 277, 139. 123, 69, 62 and 31 plants ha(-1), under direct sunlight. One hundred grams of soil were taken from. each treatment with four repetitions and later identified and Counted with a I Ox maynifying glass. To determine seedling emergence,four soil samples of 1000 g were collected from each experimental field and transported to the greenhouse. Seedling emergence was observed by counts after 15, 30 and 45 days. The experimental design was randomized blocks o seven treatments (soil from different tree densities) and four replicates; the experimental unit consisted of a plastic tray (0, 30 x 0.22 x 0.06 m) containing 1.000 g of soil. The variables utilized to characterize the bank and its dynamics were: relative frequency, relative density, relative abundance, importance index and species diversity (Shannon-Weaver index). Increased number of monocotyledon seeds and sprouts Were verified in the treatments maintained under full sunlight.

Weed Seedbank and its Correlation with the Established Flora in No-Bum Sugarcane Area	PLANTA DANINHA												To set suitable weed management programs. one the most important parameters is knowing the specific composition of the seedbank and its correlation with the established flora. Such information is fundamental to guide the control strategy to be adopted and the herbicide choices. Mechanical harvest of no-burn sugar-cane maintaining a layer of straw on the soil surface promoted important changes in weed seed germination and seedling survival. Lack of soil mobilization and the lack of sugarcane burning are two additional factors influencing weed flora composition and population densities. Field sampling was conducted in twenty-eight no-burn sugarcane areas to evaluate (i) seedbank composition and seedpopulation densities and later (ii) weed Community composition and population density. A predominance of broad-leaf weeds was foud in the seed bank mainly Amaranthus spp., as well as species of the families Euphorbiaceae and Convuluvlaceae. The traditional gramineous seeds were not profuse in the seedbanks of the Studied areas. The correlation between the seedbank and the weed community compositions was small, regardless of the harvesting time, seedbank quantification methodology and weed species.

Interference Periods of Brachiaria plantaginea in Corn Crops in Southern Rio Grande do Sul	PLANTA DANINHA												Weed controlperiod have great influence on plant growth and crop productivity. The objective of this work was to determine the competition periods. both previous to interference and critical interference prevention of B. plantaginea on corn crop in Southern Rio Grande do Sul. The trial was conducted in a completely randomized block design, under conventional tillage system, with four replications. The treatments consisted of maintaining the culture of corn in the presence and absence of B. plantaginea for 0, 7,14,21, 28,35 and 42 days after crop emergence (DAE). B. plantaginea emerged from the soil seed bank, with an average population of 312 plants m(2). Ten corn plants Were sampled and analyzed in each experimental assay to obtain the following variables: Plant and ear insertion height (cm), ear length (cm), number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, number of grains per ear. Grain productivity was determined by collecting three central lines of the useful area in each experimental unit. Considering a 5% tolerance in production reduction, it was concluded that the total period of interference prevention was 27 DAE, the period preceding interference was 11 DAE and the critical period of interference prevention was 11 and 27 DAE.

Weed Biology and Management in No-Tillage Areas	PLANTA DANINHA												Some important aspects of weed biology and control under no tillage are described to show that the viability of this system depends on weed control efficiently performed. Some of the weeds infesting this cropping system are present in Much greater density under the conventional system, this being probably due to the little soil disturbance under no tillage systems, Where the occurrence of perennial weeds is more feasible, and changes in the temperature and light incidence on the soil surface influence dormancy of some weed species. Adequate strategy or Weed control under the no tillage system requires knowledge on weed seed bank dynamics and must integrate methods of weed control in order to reduce the use of herbicides. The release of alellopathic compounds by some of the cover crops and the suppressive effects of crop residue cover-arcimportant measures in order to integrate the chemical control of weeds. However, it is important to be aware of the negative impacts over certain cultivated species of plants. Studies on weed biology and alellopathy of cover crops, associated to herbicide application technology and precision agriculture may contribute to weed control optimization in areas under no tillage system.

J	Mayen, CD; Gibson, KD; Weller, SC				Mayen, Carlos D.; Gibson, Kevin D.; Weller, Stephen C.			A Comparison of Threshold Strategies in Tomatoes and Soybean	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Weed control strategies based on conserving crop yields rather than preventing weed seed production may result in increased weed densities and management costs over the long-term, particularly in less competitive crops such as tomatoes. The effect of crop, tillage, and duration of weed control on weed seed batik size and composition was examined from spring 2001 to spring 2003 near Lafayette, IN. Main plots in 2001 and 2002 contained soybean or tomato planted in rotation (soybean-tomato, tomato-soybean). Subplots were managed with either conventional or no-till practices. Subsubplots contrasted threshold strategies in which weeds were either controlled for four to six weeks (period threshold, PT) or throughout the growing season (no-seed-threshold, NST). Seed banks were sampled annually in the spring. Emergent weeds were counted at four and twelve weeks after planting (WAP) in 2001 and 2002. Weed seed banks did not significantly change in the NST plots in any year. However, seed bank densities increased substantially following tomatoes in PT plots. In contrast, weed seed batik densities decreased following soybeans in PT plots. The difference in seed banks and emergent weeds between soybean and tomatoes could be attributed primarily to greater suppression of giant foxtail by the soybean canopy. Giant foxtail control was greater in PT soybeans than in PT tomatoes in both years and giant foxtail comprised most of the PT tomato seed batik in 2002 and 2003. Tillage did not affect weed seed banks in any year. This study highlights the need to control later emerging weeds in tomatoes to prevent large increases in the weed seed batik.																	0890-037X	1550-2740				OCT-DEC	2008	22	4					729	735		10.1614/WT-07-155.1							WOS:000262239600027

Risk Assessment of Weed Resistance in the Canadian Prairies	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Agricultural practices, other than herbicide use, can affect the rate of evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds. This study examined associations of farm management practices with the occurrence of herbicide (acetyl-CoA carboxylase or acetolactate synthase inhibitor)-resistant weeds, based upon a multi-year (2001 to 2003) random Survey of 370 fields/growers from the Canadian Prairies. Herbicide-resistant weeds Occurred in one-quarter of the surveyed fields. The primary herbicide-resistant weed species was wild oat, with lesser occurrence of green foxtail, kochia, common chickweed, spiny sowthistle, and redroot pigweed. The risk of weed resistance was greatest in fields with cereal-based rotations and least in fields with forage crops, fallow, or where three or more crop types were grown. Weed resistance risk also was greatest in conservation-tillage systems and particularly low soil disturbance no-tillage, possibly due to greater herbicide use or weed seed bank turnover. Large farms (> 400 ha) had a greater risk of weed resistance than smaller farms, although the reason for this association Was unclear. The results of this study identify cropping system diversity as the foundation of proactive weed resistance management.

J	Turner, PJ; Scott, JK; Spafford, H				Turner, Peter J.; Scott, John K.; Spafford, Helen			The ecological barriers to the recovery of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides (L.) Druce) infested sites: Impacts on vegetation and the potential increase in other exotic species	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												To protect native biodiversity from environmental weeds, the impacts that these weeds cause need to be known before weed control commences. Asparagus asparagoides (L.) Druce (bridal creeper) (Asparagaceae) is a serious environmental weed and has been selected for biological control in Australia. To predict the responses of plant communities to the control of bridal creeper, a prerelease baseline of the impacts of bridal creeper on native plant communities was undertaken. Plant assemblages in areas invaded by bridal creeper were compared with reference areas that contained little or no bridal creeper. Areas invaded by bridal creeper contained 52% fewer native plant species when compared with nearby reference areas. However, there was no difference in the number of other exotic plant species between areas. Similar trends were found for the germinable seed bank. Although a greater number of exotic species were present in the seed bank compared with the vegetation surveys, there was still no difference between areas with and without bridal creeper. In a glasshouse trial, exotic species germinated more frequently compared with native species. This could indicate that as bridal creeper density decreases following control, exotic species have an advantage over native species when colonizing areas left vacant by bridal creeper. Second, as bridal creeper areas contained reduced native species richness and cover, they may be susceptible to further weed invasion after bridal creeper is removed. Therefore, simply reducing the presence of bridal creeper may not guarantee successful restoration of invaded areas and additional restoration efforts will be needed to ensure the ultimate goal of protecting native biodiversity is reached.

J	Cox, RD; Allen, EB				Cox, Robert D.; Allen, Edith B.			Composition of soil seed banks in southern California coastal sage scrub and adjacent exotic grassland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Soil seed banks are important to many plant communities and are recognized as an important component of management plans. Understanding seed bank composition and density is especially important when communities have been invaded by exotic species and must be managed to promote desirable species. We examined germinable soil seed banks in southern California coastal sage scrub (CSS) that is heavily invaded by exotic grasses and in adjacent exotic grassland. Soils from both communities had similar seed banks, dominated by high densities of exotic grass and forb species. Up to 4,000 exotic grass seeds and at least 400 exotic forb seeds/m(2) were found in most soils, regardless of aboveground vegetation type. Native forbs averaged 400 seeds/m(2) in grass-dominated areas and about 800 in shrub-dominated soils. Shrub seed density was < 1 and < 10 seeds/m(2) in grass- and shrub-dominated areas, respectively, indicating that the shrub seed bank is not persistent compared to annuals. We also compared pre- and post-burn soil seed banks from one location that burned in October 2003. Late-season burning in both grass- and CSS-dominated areas disproportionately reduced exotic grass seed densities relative to native seed densities. The similarity of the seed banks in adjacent grass and shrub communities suggests that without intervention, areas currently dominated by CSS may become more similar to grass-dominated areas in terms of aboveground vegetation. In such areas, the first growing season following a wildfire is a window of opportunity for increasing native diversity at a time when density of exotic grass seeds is low.																	1385-0237					SEP	2008	198	1					37	46		10.1007/s11258-007-9383-9							WOS:000258093000004

Spatial patterns of the germinable soil seed bank of coexisting perennial-grass species in grazed shrublands of the Patagonian Monte	PLANT ECOLOGY												We compared the size and spatial pattern of the germinable soil seed bank (GSB) of the three dominant perennial-grass species in the arid Patagonian Monte of Argentina. These species differ in plant functional traits, seed morphology, and in their preference by grazers. During three consecutive years, we sampled the soil seed bank at 1 m intervals and the intercepted diameter of perennial-grass species and shrub patches along 50-m linear transects at three sites with different grazing pressure. Soil samples were incubated at field capacity during 12 weeks and emerged seedlings counted. The largest-seeded and most xerophytic Stipa speciosa did not form a GSB. The other two grass species with more mesophytic traits and smaller seeds than S. speciosa formed different GSB. Poa ligularis formed a smaller and more heterogeneous GSB than Stipa tenuis. Grazing had not effect on GSB size of P. ligularis but increased the proportion of seeds under dense shrub canopies. In contrast, grazing reduced the size and also increased the proportion of the GSB of S. tenuis under shrub canopies. We conclude that the size and the spatial pattern of the GSB of the dominant perennial-grass species in the arid Patagonian Monte were related not only to seed and plant traits but also to the spatial distribution of grass plants and their exposure to grazers.																	1385-0237					SEP	2008	198	1					111	120		10.1007/s11258-007-9389-3							WOS:000258093000010

The objetive of this research was to evaluate the structure of regeneration of the arboreal species in two natural remainders, in three areas reforested with native species and in a Eucalyptus robusta settlement located in a floodplain of Mogi-Guacu river in Luiz Antonio County (21 degrees 31 'S and 47 degrees 55 'W), Sao Paulo, Brazil. Sampling was collected in 40 subplots of 2 m(2) in of each natural remainder and each eucalyptus sub-forest, as well as 60 subplots of 3.5 m(2) in each area reforested. All individuals with height 3 10 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5.0 cm were measured and analyzed separately in four height classes according to floristic diversity, similarity, density, frequency, dominance, importance value and natural regeneration. A total of 2,010 individuals were identified, belonging to 24 families, 46 genera and 51 species. The species with greater importance values were Cabralea canjerana, Psidium cattleyanum, Nectandra megapotamica, Acacia polyphylla and Syzygium cumini, well represented in the four height classes. Reforestation with native species in a degraded Mogi-Guacu River floodplain promoted natural regeneration with more biodiversity than in natural remainders submitted to border effect, and contributed to the forest ecosystem restoration process. The 20-year-old Eucalyptus robusta plantation promoted the regeneration of climax and secondary species.

The impact of local extinction on genetic structure of wild populations of lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica: consequences for the conservation of plant genetic resources	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Plant populations may experience local extinction and at the same time new populations may appear in nearby suitable locations. Species may also colonize the same site on multiple occasions. Here, we examined the impact of local extinction and recolonization on the genetic structure of wild populations of lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. We compared genetic diversity from the samples taken from the populations before and after extinction at 13 locations using microsatellite markers. Locations were classified according to the occurrence of extinction episodes during the previous five years into three groups: 1) populations that experienced extinction for more than one year, and were later recolonized (recolonized), 2) populations that did not experience local extinction (control), and 3) populations that did not experience local extinction during the study, but were cut to experimentally simulate extinction (experimental). Our data did not show a clear tendency in variation in allele frequencies, expected heterozygosity, and effective number of alleles within and between groups of populations. However, we found that the level of genetic differentiation between samples collected at different times at the same location was different in the three groups of populations. Recolonized locations showed the highest level of genetic differentiation (mean (Fst) = 0.2769), followed by control locations (mean F-st = 0.0576) and experimental locations (mean F-st = 0.0189). Similar findings were observed for Nei's genetic distance between samples (d(i,j) = 0.1786, 0.0400, and 0.0037, respectively). Our results indicate that genetic change in lima beans depends on the duration and frequency of local extinction episodes. These findings also showed that control populations are not in equilibrium. Implications of these results for the establishment of conservation strategies of genetic resources of lima beans are discussed. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (3): 1023-1041.

In this study, we investigated soil seed banks of riparian zones of contrasting condition in an agricultural landscape and evaluated their potential to influence riparian restoration. We examined the composition and structure of germinable soil seed banks along lateral gradients from stream channels in both cleared and wooded riparian zones of three lowland creeks within the Goulburn Broken catchment in temperate southeastern Australia. Environmental correlates of soil seed bank characteristics and similarity to extant vegetation were also examined. We found an abundant and species-rich soil seed bank mostly comprising propagules of perennial rushes and sedges and annual and perennial grasses with many species of annual forbs. While the majority of identifiable germinants and species were native, exotic species were common at all locations. Soil seed bank composition was relatively homogeneous among streams and along lateral gradients from the channel. Riparian condition (i.e. cleared or wooded). however. had a strong,, influence on soil seed bank composition and structure with cleared reaches containing more species, more germinable annual grasses and higher total numbers of germinable seeds. Soil seed bank Composition was correlated with site openness suggesting that extant vegetation structure plays ail important role in soil seed hank dynamics.

EFFECTS OF A SPRING PRESCRIBED BURN ON THE SOIL SEED BANK IN SAGEBRUSH STEPPE EXHIBITING PINYON-JUNIPER EXPANSION	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla-Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands are expanding into shrubsteppe ecosystems in western portions of the Great Basin. Often, highly competitive trees displace the understory, and prescribed fire is increasingly use(] as a restoration tool. To inform management decisions about post-fire recovery, we examined immediate and long-term (i.e., 2 growing seasons) responses of the germinable seed bank to a spring prescribed fire. One week before and 1 week after a May 2002 prescribed burn, soil samples were taken tinder P. monophylla trees, under Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana shrubs, and from interspace microsites. Two growing seasons after the prescribed burn, soil samples were taken from the same microsites and from similar microsites in an adjacent unburned area. Prior to the burn, the germinable seed bank tinder shrubs contained the highest seed density and the highest species richness followed by interspace and tree microsites. Shrub litter was consumed by the burn, causing complete loss of the seed bank front that microsite and depleting the A. tridentata seed bank. Interestingly, the density of germinable seeds in soil tinder P monophylla trees increased immediately following the burn; 70% of that increase originated from the annual forb Descurainia pinnata. Two growing seasons following the prescribed burn, no overall differences in germinable seed density between burned and unburned plots were observed, but seed bank species composition differed, with seed banks in the prescribed burn having a greater abundance of Eriogonum elatum, E. microthecum, and Gayophytum diffusion compared to unburned plots, which had a greater abundance of A. tridentata, Lappula occidentalis, and Descurainia pinnata. Our results indicate that rapid restoration to prefire vegetation cannot rely upon the soil seed bank.

Propagule banks: Potential contribution to restoration of an impounded and dewatered riparian ecosystem	WETLANDS												The Agua Fria River in Arizona's Sonoran Desert was impounded and diverted more than 70 years ago. Immediately below New Waddell dam there are semi-permanent pools, but water has been released into the channel only during rare wet years. To determine whether a propagule bank exists below the dam, and whether it could contribute to the revegetation of the Agua Fria riparian ecosystem should flow be restored to the dewatered reach, we collected 45 soil cores from four plant associations. We examined species in the samples in a growth chamber using the seedling emergence method. A total of 74 species (mostly herbaceous) and an abundance of individuals were present in propagule banks. The propagule banks were similar to those of a free-flowing reference river despite considerable differences in extant vegetation. Riparian species were present in propagule banks of all four associations and were the dominant type in three (Tamarix forests, Tamarix-Salix forests, and Baccharis-Bebbia shrublands). Propagule distribution varied with soil depth in three of the associations (Tamarix forests and the two xerophytic shrublands) with riparian species more prevalent in deep sediment and upland species more prevalent in surf ice soil and litter. Collectively these patterns suggest that a riparian legacy is present in Agua Fria propagule banks. However, riparian propagule density was low in the Hymenoclea-Bebbia shrublands, reflecting xerification of the riparian corridor. Given the physical barrier of the dam, continued diversion of stream flow, and rare flood releases, local inputs from xerophytes will dominate propagule bank dynamics in the future. Although propagule banks could contribute to redevelopment of the herbaceous component of the vegetation should stream flows be restored to this river reach, the riparian legacy likely will decline over time as riparian propagules reach the end of their lifespan while propagules of xerophytes continue to be replenished.

WETLANDS												In Central Mexico, wetland plants are harvested for weaving, fodder, and fertilizer. To test whether harvesting alters plant diversity, we compared the effects of harvesting all vegetation once, follow-up harvesting of Typha domingensis Pers. one or three more times, and a non-harvested control, using two sites differing in water depth in an annually burned wetland near Morelia, Mexico. After one year, harvesting treatments increased species richness at both the plot (14-m(2)) and wetland scales, increased the Shannon diversity index at the plot and subplot (1-m(2)) scales, and changed plant community composition (measured by Bray-Curtis distance) relative to control plots. Response among harvesting treatments was similar, and increased Typha harvesting did not have additive effects on Typha or on community composition. Grasses and short forbs (< 0.5-m tall) significantly increased in importance value in harvested plots, as did five individual forb species that were capable of vegetative spread. Uncommon species were significantly more likely to be found only in harvested plots than only in control plots, and new species (not initially present at the site) tended to recruit in harvested plots. Most new species were perennials that could likely tolerate additional harvesting. All harvesting treatments reduced Typha height, density, and rhizome starch reserves after five months, and responses were significantly affected by site, water depth, flowering ramet density, and pre-treatment values. Typha recovered in all harvested plots after one year, even when harvested four times, although flowering-ramet density declined in the wetter site. Community composition was more highly correlated with water depth and litter cover than with harvesting in an NMS ordination including both sites. Within sites, harvesting, light availability, leaf area index. and litter cover correlated similarly with variation in community composition. Given that our treatments reflect a subset of actual local management practices, harvesting could provide a sustainable and economically attractive management strategy for biodiversity conservation in this system, while the cessation of harvesting could lead to species loss.

The long agricultural history of maize in Mesoamerica has imposed selection regimes that adapted native weeds to maize farming systems. These native weeds are expected to exhibit stable or increasing populations under traditional maize culture where herbicides are not used. In this paper, we study the population dynamics of major weeds occurring in a rain-fed maize field in the Valley of Mexico. Eighteen species were recorded in the seed bank that showed a seasonal variation from 24 169 to 135 770 viable seeds m(-2). The four most abundant species represented 93% of the total seed bank and exhibited contrasting patterns of emergence that represented 2.2 to 3.1% of the initial seed bank. The first cohort was eliminated by mechanical cultivation while the second exhibited greater survivorship and fecundity than those emerging later. Weed species exhibited a wide spectrum of variation in finite rates of population increase (0.6-9.17): populations of Lopezia racemosa (lambda=7.02), Galinsoga parviflora (lambda=9.17) and Salvia tiliifolia (lambda=1.81) exhibited values greater than one while Acalypha indica var. mexicana showed values less than one (lambda=0.60). We argue that variation in population increase is associated with emergence patterns and with the maize monoculture and maize-alfalfa rotation system.				Espinosa-Garcia, F.

Interaction between seed dormancy-release mechanism, environment and seed bank strategy for a widely distributed perennial legume, Parkinsonia aculeata (Caesalpinaceae)	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Parkinsonia aculeata (Caesalpinaceae) is a perennial legume with seeds that have hardseeded (physical) dormancy and are potentially very long-lived. Seed dormancy is a characteristic that can both help maximize the probability of seedling establishment and spread the risk of recruitment failure across years (bet-hedging). In this study, dormancy-release patterns are described across the diverse environments in which this species occurs in order to test whether wet heat (incubation under wet, warm-to-hot, conditions) alone can explain those patterns, and in order to determine the likely ecological role of physical dormancy across this species distribution. Methods A seed burial trial was conducted across the full environmental distribution of P. aculeata in Australia (arid to wet-dry tropics, uplands to wetlands, soil surface to 10 cm deep). Key Results Wet heat explained the pattern of dormancy release across all environments. Most seeds stored in the laboratory remained dormant throughout the trial (at least 84%). Dormancy release was quickest for seeds buried during the wet season at relatively high rainfall, upland sites (only 3% of seeds remained dormant after 35 d). The longest-lived seeds were in wetlands (9% remained dormant after almost 4 years) and on the soil surface (57% after 2 years). There was no consistent correlation between increased aridity and rate of dormancy release. Conclusions The results suggest that physical dormancy in P. aculeata is a mechanism for maximizing seedling establishment rather than a bet-hedging strategy. However, seed persistence can occur in environmental refuges where dormancy-release cues are weak and conditions for germination and establishment are poor (e.g. under dense vegetation or in more arid micro-environments) or unsuitable (e.g. when seeds are inundated or on the soil surface). Risks of recruitment failure in suboptimal environments could therefore be reduced by inter-year fluctuations in microclimate or seed movement.				van Klinken, Rieks D/B-1772-2009	van Klinken, Rieks D/0000-0002-7578-8977												0305-7364					AUG	2008	102	2					255	264		10.1093/aob/mcn087							WOS:000257786300010	18558626

Location: Nine study sites were located on an Urbanisation gradient in the city of Rennes, France. Methods: Three Urbanisation levels were defined: urban areas (high grey/green ratio,), suburban (medium grey/green ratio) and periurban (low grey/green ratio). For each urbanisation level. nitrates and ammonium stocks were quantified; the herbaceous vegetation was surveyed as well as the soil seed bank (using the seedling emergence method). Results: Nitrate concentration increased with Urbanisation (the nitrate level in urban plots was twice the concentration in periurban ones) whereas the ammonium level was higher in periurban areas than in urban areas. In urban plots, the vegetation and the seed bank were more nitrophilous, whereas the nitrogen requirement was lower for periurban species. The relationship between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation was not significant. Conclusions: The higher nitrate concentration in the urban area appeared to be related to higher concentrations of atmospheric pollutants found in this area and lower ammonium levels may be related to the higher temperature in urban areas (leading to higher nitrification rates). The shift in the composition of the seed bank and vegetation appeared to be a consequence of higher nitrate stocks. The dissimilarity between the seed bank and vegetation may be caused by enhanced emergence of nitrophilous species in urban areas.

Location: Nakoudojima Island, Bonin Archipelago (Ogasawara Shoto). Japan. Methods: Soil samples were collected at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cut depths from seven plots in forests. grasslands, artificially matted areas and bare land. Soil seed banks were assessed using the seedling emergence method Followed by the hand-sorting of Ungerminated seeds. We determined the size and composition of the seed banks in tipper soil layers of plots and compared the seed banks to the standing vegetation, Results: A total of 12 220 seedlings belonging to 42 species front 20 families germinated. Total mean seed density (0-5 cm depth) was low in all plots within forest, grassland, and heavily degraded vegetation types (34.7 +/- 8.6 to 693.5 +/- 123.6. 58.6 +/- 7.8 to 107.1 +/- 10.0, and 1,1 +/- 0.5 to 7.2 +/- 2.3 seeds/m(2), respectively). Forbs and graminoids dominated the seed banks of grassland and forest plots including Cyperus brevifolius, Gnaphalium pensylvanicum, Oxalis corniculata and Solanum nigrum, and these alien species comprised 90% of the density of the seed bank. There was little correlation between seed banks and standing vegetation of the island (Sorensen similarity coefficient values 0.26 to 0.45). Conclusions: If natural regeneration occurs from the seed bank of the island, future vegetation will not move toward the original forest community, because the seed bank is dominated by non-native herbaceous grassland species. Though isolated, a few forest remnants with low species richness could be an important source for the natural re-establishment of forest on the island; however, seed availability may be limited by either poor dispersal or pollination so that woody species will probably recover very slowly on this goat-impacted island.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				AUG	2008	11	3					355	364		10.3170/2008-7-18458							WOS:000263168800008

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: What is the relative role of the bud bank, seed and various species traits in the regeneration Of urban plant communities after severe disturbances'? Do invasive and exotic species, highly abundant in disturbed communities, regenerate better than native species after disturbance? Methods: Hand tilling was applied to three urban plant communities with and Without additional herbicide treatment to exclude regeneration from the bud bank. Plant traits were determined from the literature and databases. Species responses to the treatments were evaluated with RDA analyses ill CANOCO. Linear models were applied to identify traits that Could predict the responses of species to disturbance. Results: The bud bank played a key role in regeneration in the plots without herbicide. In the plots with herbicide treatment, the seed bank was important in re-establishing vegetation after disturbance. Exclusion of the bud bank by using herbicide allowed the establishment of small annuals, whereas biennials and perennials were Successful in plots where the bad bank was not inhibited by herbicide. Exotic species with a long residence time in the local flora were Successful in plots where regeneration from the bud batik was excluded, whereas species with short residence times or that were invasive were Suppressed by both types of disturbance. Conclusion: In response to various types of disturbance, species with different regeneration strategies (either seeds or bud bank) were promoted. Exotic species were suppressed primarily by disturbance, which suggests that factors other than just regenerative capability contributed to the high abundance of exotics in urban communities.

The case of dune slacks	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Does the increased atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, which can have major effects on the established vegetation of nutrient-poor habitats, also impact germination from the soil seed bank? Location: Coastal dune slacks at Newborough Warren. Wales, UK. Methods: The effects of nitrogen addition (15 kg.ha(-1).a(-1)) on seed germination from the soil seed bank were investigated using the seedling emergence method between September 2004 and February 2005. Results: More seedlings emerged from fertilised samples than unfertilised controls. Most species showed enhanced germination after fertilisation with nitrogen. with seedling numbers statistically significantly greater in nitrogen addition samples in a quarter of species abundant enough for analysis. Species that responded positively to fertilisation were species with low Ellenberg indicator values indicative of infertile sites. Conclusions: Most species showed increased germination after fertilisation with nitrogen, including early successional species normally growing in nutrient-poor conditions. This suggests that the increased atmospheric deposition of nitrogen probably not only impacts on established vegetation, but also has the potential to alter seed bank dynamics.

Maximus, each with very few individuals (typically < 10 per population). A limited number of named Clianthus cultivars of indeterminate origin are commonly grown as ornamentals. Genomic DNA from individual Clianthus plants was extracted for genetic diversity analysis using a range of molecular markers, including amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Data were analysed by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA), the generation of Neighbor-joining trees, and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA). Genetic distance between wild populations of C. Maximus was highly correlated with geographical distance between populations. Sequencing of intron 2 of a putative partial homologue of the floral meristem identity gene LEAFY (CmLFY) revealed a 7 bp deletion that was exhibited homozygously in the more northern populations of C. Maximus, and in all individuals tested from the sole population of C. puniceus. This deletion was not exhibited in more southern populations of C. Maximus. Further, one geographically intermediate population contained some plants that were heterozygous for the deletion. Parallel analyses of cultivated Clianthus genotypes, more than half of which were also homozygous for the 7 bp deletion, showed that these were not representative of the broad, but threatened, diversity remaining in the wild. It is argued that wild populations of C. Maximus are unlikely to have arisen from the escape of plants from cultivation. Conservation effort should focus on the protection and study of the extant plants in these wild populations, rather than on the introduction of disturbance regimes to uncover potential seed banks.

Restoration of Calluna vulgaris on grass-dominated moorlands: The importance of disturbance, grazing and seeding	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Calluna vulgaris-dominated heaths and moorlands are habitats of international conservation importance. Degradation has occurred throughout their range with Calluna typically being replaced by grass species. The cessation of grazing is often impractical and rarely results in the recovery of Calluna abundance when it is initially present at low cover. Thus the development of restoration methods is required; these should be practical at a large-scale, in remote areas and create suitable conditions for Calluna germination and establishment, whilst still allowing grazing to occur. A replicated field experiment was established on Nardus stricta and Molinia coerulea-dominated moorlands to test the efficacy of different grazing regimes and intervention techniques aimed at establishing Calluna. Disturbance (rotavation and trampling by animals) to create bare ground increased Calluna establishment. On the Nardus site, Calluna establishment was equally successful on rotavated and trampled plots, but rotavation was more successful on the Molinia site. Seeding with Calluna increased Calluna establishment irrespective of whether a seed-bank was present. At the Nardus site, 0.5 cow/ha for two months in summer led to Calluna establishment and growth similar to that of ungrazed plots and was more successful than a mixed grazing regime (1 ewe/ha plus 0.5 cow/ha for 2 months) or a sheep only regime (1.5 ewes/ha). The creation of small patches of bare ground, seed addition and low intensity grazing enabled the rapid establishment of Calluna on grass-dominated moorlands; such techniques may also be applicable in other habitats where restoration requires the addition of a single/few species and minimal intervention.

Influence of woody invader control methods and seed availability on native and invasive species establishment in a Hawaiian forest	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS					International Symposium on Biology, Ecology and Management of Worlds Worst Plant Invasive Species	DEC 14, 2006	Univ Delhi, Ctr Environm Management Degraded Syst, Delhi, INDIA		Univ Delhi, Ctr Environm Management Degraded Syst			When invasive woody plants become dominant, they present an extreme challenge for restoration of native plant communities. Invasive Morella faya (fire tree) forms extensive, nearly monospecific stands in wet and mesic forests on the Island of Hawai'i. We used logging, girdling, and selective girdling over time (incremental girdling) to kill stands of M. faya at different rates, with the objective of identifying a method that best promotes native forest re-establishment. We hypothesized that rapid canopy opening by logging would lead to establishment of fast-growing, non-native invaders, but that slower death of M. faya by girdling or incremental girdling would increase the establishment by native plants adapted to partial shade conditions. After applying the M. faya treatments, seed banks, seed rain, and plant recruitment were monitored over 3 years. Different plant communities developed in response to the treatments. Increased light and nitrogen availability in the logged treatment were associated with invasion by non-native species. Native species, including the dominant native forest tree, (Metrosideros polymorpha) and tree fern (Cibotium glaucum), established most frequently in the girdle and incremental girdle treatments, but short-lived non-native species were more abundant than native species. A diverse native forest is unlikely to develop following any of the treatments due to seed limitation for many native species, but girdling and incremental girdling promoted natural establishment of major components of native Hawaiian forest. Girdling may be an effective general strategy for reestablishing native vegetation in areas dominated by woody plant invaders.																	1387-3547					AUG	2008	10	6					805	819		10.1007/s10530-008-9237-y							WOS:000257367400004

Managing beyond the invader: manipulating disturbance of natives simplifies control efforts	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Invasive plants have negative impacts on ecosystems worldwide. Several ecological studies have identified disturbance as a causative mechanism of plant invasions. Changes to natural disturbances and/or newly imposed disturbances can favour an invader over native species especially those that are better adapted to prior conditions. 2. To link the disturbance ecology of invasives to their management, we investigated the benefit of incorporating actions that manipulate disturbance (natural or imposed) into control efforts. We developed a simple model that describes the dynamics of an invader whose establishment is preferentially favoured by disturbance. 3. The model includes the probability of disturbance differentially affecting sites occupied by natives and invaders. Invaded sites are disturbed by alternative control measures, which act to kill and/or remove above-ground biomass and reduce the seed bank. We couched the model in a decision theory tool, stochastic dynamic programming, and applied it to the management of Mimosa pigra, a pan-tropical invasive perennial shrub. 4. We found that targeting the above-ground biomass of the invader (current population) was optimal when the probability of disturbance of native sites and the invader seed bank size were low to moderate. When both the rate of disturbance of native sites and invader seed banks were high, the best measure was that with the highest probability of reducing the seed bank (future populations). This measure was optimal despite its trade-off of having the highest probability of reinvasion. 5. Synthesis and applications. Manipulation of disturbance regimes in both native and invaded sites can simplify control efforts. If there is a high probability that native vegetation will be disturbed, then management efforts should focus on future populations by attempting to reduce the size of the invader seed bank. This complicates control, as seed bank size is difficult to measure and reducing it requires intensive actions, which are likely to also negatively affect the seed bank of native species. If, however, the probability of disturbance of native sites can be reduced, practitioners can shift control from future populations to the current population, which is more straightforward to implement and monitor.

Invasion of Pinus halepensis Mill. following a wildfire in an Argentine grassland nature reserve	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Ernesto Tornquist nature reserve is a relict of native Pampas vegetation in Argentina. Alien trees were introduced to the reserve in the 1950s, mainly to "improve" the natural landscape, resulting in the arrival of a totally new life form. In 1987, a fire affected an area planted with Pinus halepensis resulting in its massive expansion. In 1999, we removed trees from 17 circular plots of 10 m diameter placed systematically within the area that was colonized after the fire. Trunks were cut 20 cm from the ground and growth rings were counted. We studied the age structure of the population in order to reconstruct the colonizing events after the fire. We found that recruitment occurred throughout this period, except in the three years after the disturbance. We suggest that this delay in recruitment might be caused by low seedling survival under water stress conditions due to low rainfall, combined with scarce vegetation cover after fire. This could have been associated with an initial reduction in propagule pressure due to the scarcity of surviving trees in the vicinity and with the fact that fire occurred after the peak of seed release, during an extremely dry summer, probably killing a great number of seeds that were already in the soil. In the following years, recruitment was probably aided by pioneer trees and later by seeds shed from established pines. Alien trees had been allowed to reach maturity due to wildfire prevention and control in the years preceding the fire and the accumulated dry matter resulted in increased fire intensity that reduced the ability of grasses to re-sprout. As a consequence, the invasion window that allowed the expansion of pines remained open for at least 12 years.

J	Luzuriaga, AL; Escudero, A				Luzuriaga, Arantzazu L.; Escudero, Adrian			What determines emergence and net recruitment in an early succession plant community? Disentangling biotic and abiotic effects	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How do different regeneration scenarios shape species composition at two stages of plant community establishment ( emergence and net recruitment) in an early succession? Location: Northern Spain. Methods: In a recently ploughed field, we created eight regeneration scenarios with light, water and nitrogen availability ( five replicates each). Seedlings of all species were monitored from emergence to death during one year. Abiotic and biotic variables were measured per quadrat, i. e. soil texture, nutrient contents, seed bank densities and composition, neighbour plant species densitiy and cover. We used partial ordination methods in order to separate the effect of each environmental variable on species composition during emergence and adult net recruitment. Results: Light treatment determined annual plant density at time of emergence and recruitment, while water addition controlled the recruitment of perennials. Resource levels explained the emerged species composition; this effect was not translated into the recruited species composition. N- addition and N + water addition were strongly associated to species abundances at the time of emergence. Seedling composition in summer was correlated with seed abundance of Cerastium spp. Neighbour species density and cover ( mainly Arrhenatherum bulbosum, Agropyron repens and Picris echioides) explained significant fractions of species composition in the emergence and recruitment of the different cohorts. Interactions between species seem to vary in intensity among cohorts and in the key plant species that determined species abundance along succession. Conclusions: Our scenarios exerted contrasting and multilevel effects on the development of our early succession community. Resource availability differently affected plant density and species composition at different life stages. It is relevant to consider different life stages in plant community studies. However, regeneration conditions and other abiotic factors are not enough to explain how community composition varies.

J	Li, FR				Li, Feng-Rui			Presence of shrubs influences the spatial pattern of soil seed banks in desert herbaceous vegetation	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Do shrubs influence the spatial pattern of soil seed banks in herbaceous vegetation and are these effects influenced by wind direction, sampling position ( windward vs leeward sides of the shrub) and distance from the shrub? Location: Horqin desert in eastern Inner Mongolia, China. Methods: A pioneer shrub, Artemisia halodendron, occurring in a mobile sandy habitat was used as a case study. Species composition and abundance of the seed bank and established herbaceous vegetation around six target shrubs were sampled along transects aligned to the four main wind directions and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.5 and 6 m from the shrub base on both windward and leeward sides of a transect. Results: The presence of shrubs significantly modified the spatial pattern of seed deposition, but effects varied with wind direction, sampling position and distance from the shrub. More seeds were deposited on the leeward side than on the windward sides in all four transects, especially on transects with the most prevailing wind directions. Shrubs also caused a marked variation in seed deposition across sampling locations; this effect was more pronounced on the leeward side of transects with the most prevailing wind directions, suggesting the mean range of the shrub's influence is within ca. 2 m. Conclusions: The study shows clear evidence of shrubs as a source of spatial heterogeneity in seed availability in the herbaceous layer. Shrub presence effects were strongly influenced by complex interactions between wind direction, sampling position, and distance from the shrub.																	1100-9233					AUG	2008	19	4					537	548		10.3170/2008-8-18404							WOS:000255199200011

Variation in soil seed bank species composition of a dry coniferous forest: spatial scale and sampling considerations	PLANT ECOLOGY												In order to assess the effects of disturbance on soil seed bank spatial structure, variation in seed bank species composition was analyzed at two spatial scales in mature (undisturbed) and recently disturbed stands of Interior Douglas-fir forest in south-central British Columbia. Coarse-scale analysis among stands 10-100 km apart using Multi-Response Permutation Procedures showed that individual mature stands were mainly characterized by unique seed bank species compositions. Disturbance had an homogenizing effect on seed bank species composition at the coarse scale-there was less variability among stands following disturbance by both low and high severity fires, and by non-salvage logging. In contrast, finer scale analysis among sampling units c. 10 m apart showed that heterogeneity in seed bank species composition was greater on severely burned and logged sites, commensurate with greater levels of soil disturbance, than on lightly burned and undisturbed sites. Despite the high intensity of seed bank sampling (sixty 25 cm(2) soil samples from each of 16 sites), species-area curves leveled off only when infrequent species were removed from the dataset. The number of seed bank samples required to account for the common species ranged from 84 on severely burned sites, to 196 on undisturbed sites; more than the 240 samples collected per disturbance class in this study would have been required to account for the remaining infrequent species. Overall, this study highlights the importance of sampling intensively within multiple stands to capture the variation in species composition inherent to these dry coniferous forest soil seed banks.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				AUG	2008	197	2					173	181		10.1007/s11258-007-9368-8							WOS:000256913700002						
J	Burmeier, S; Jensen, K				Burmeier, Sandra; Jensen, Kai			Is the endangered Apium repens (Jacq.) Lag. rare because of a narrow regeneration niche?	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												The conservation of rare plant species is an important aspect of global biodiversity protection, but in many cases these species and the reasons why they are rare are poorly understood. The perennial umbellifer Apium repens is generally regarded to be a rare species all over its European range. We hypothesized that its rarity might be caused by a restricted regeneration niche, that is, highly specific requirements for sexual regeneration, low seed dispersal potential and low endurance capacity of seeds in the ground. We conducted several experimental investigations on its germination ecology, hydrochorous dispersal potential and soil seed bank properties. Apium repens showed high germination success under a variety of abiotic conditions. Either light or cold-wet stratification was necessary to stimulate germination. Seeds were able to float for more than 50 days when protected from precipitation, and soil seed bank sampling revealed that at least some seeds of A. repens were contained in soil depths of up to 10 cm. Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the rarity of A. repens is caused by highly specific requirements for its sexual regeneration. Nonetheless, its germination ecology should be considered when designing conservation measures for this endangered species.

Release of seeds encased in serotinous cones is induced either by fire (pyriscence, serotiny or bradychory) or by drying (xeriscence). Morphological differences in serotinous and non-serotinous cones in natural populations of P. halepensis in Southeastern Italy were analyzed. Relationships between tree size (diameter class) and serotiny were checked by counting and sampling serotinous and non-serotinous cones. The macro and microscopic characteristics that could affect cones' opening were measured in sampled cones. Protection against high temperatures offered by wood scales was also evaluated by applying different temperatures and time exposures, and following the inner thermal raise. Results showed that non-serotinous cones had bigger resin ducts and more separate scales. Also it was highlighted that ovuliferous scales of serotinous cones were bigger and thicker. These scales had more lamellated (multilayered) sclereid cells, and were significantly thinner with a shorter lumen diameter. Continuous temperature-monitoring heat tests inside cones showed that temperatures close to the cone axis were rather low, so seed germination was not influenced. Results confirm that serotinous cones are more compact, rigid and consistent than non-serotinous cones. These characteristics explain the lower insulation, seed protection and the ease opening of non-serotinous cones as well. In conclusion, opening mechanism of pinecone scales under the effect of fire or dry conditions seem related to anatomic differences and it provides seeds with an efficient protection against heat.

I. Optimisation and efficacy of various mowing schemes	AGRARFORSCHUNG												Common Ragweed is becoming an increasing source of concern in Switzerland, notably because of the allergenic nature of its pollen. As a result, the control of this species is not simply targeted at arable land but indeed at every single invaded site. Thus, it is necessary to develop techniques that break the life cycle of this plant in order to stop any further seed production. This article describes and discusses results from experiments using mowing solely. This approach is particularly suitable for sites where the application of herbicides is not to be desired, like road verges, gravel pits, nature reserves, and river banks. While for certain years a single mowing at the beginning of September was sufficient to break the life cycle of the plant, for others it was not efficient enough. Thus, a single mowing strategy clearly proves to be inefficient if aiming at the long term clearing of invaded sites. Actually, even the implementation of two mowings cannot guarantee a totally successful break of the plant's life cycle; however, it considerablely reduces the seed production. On the basis of the best results obtained, it is recommended to carry out a first intervention mid-August, followed by a second mowing end of September.																	1022-663X					JUL	2008	15	7					308	+									WOS:000257588400002

The long agricultural history of maize in Mesoamerica has imposed selection regimes that adapted native weeds to maize farming systems. These native weeds are expected to exhibit stable or increasing populations under traditional maize culture where herbicides are not used. In this paper, we study the population dynamics of major weeds occurring in a rain-fed maize field in the Valley of Mexico. Eighteen species were recorded in the seed bank that showed a seasonal variation from 24 169 to 135 770 viable seeds m(-2). The four most abundant species represented 93% of the total seed bank and exhibited contrasting patterns of emergence that represented 2.2 to 3. 1 % of the initial seed bank. The first cohort was eliminated by mechanical cultivation while the second exhibited greater survivorship and fecundity than those emerging later. Weed species exhibited a wide spectrum of variation in finite rates of population increase (0.6-9.17): populations of Lopezia racemosa (lambda= 7.02), Galinsoga parviflora (lambda=9.17) and Salvia tiliifolia (lambda=1.81) exhibited values greater than one while Acalypha indica var. mexicana showed values less than one (lambda=0.60). We argue that variation in population increase is associated with emergence patterns and with the maize monoculture and maize-alfalfa rotation system.				Espinosa-Garcia, F.

J	Clarke, PJ; Dorji, K				Clarke, Peter J.; Dorji, Kinzang			Are trade-offs in plant resprouting manifested in community seed banks?	ECOLOGY												Trade-offs in allocation to resprouting vs. seedling regeneration in plants are predicted to occur along. re disturbance gradients. Increased resprouting ability should be generally favored in plant communities with a high probability of crown. re return. Hence, communities dominated by resprouters are predicted to have smaller seed banks than those dominated by species killed by. re. We tested whether there were trait shifts in resprouting ability among growth forms (short-lived herbaceous vs. ground-dwelling perennials vs. shrubs) and among communities (rocky outcrop vs. sclerophyll forest) with contrasting probabilities of crown. re return. Resprouting was more common in ground-dwelling perennials and in the sclerophyll forest community with a high probability of crown. re. Soil seed banks were sampled in rocky outcrop and sclerophyll forest communities in recently burned (18 months) and long-since-burned (12 years) locations at interspersed replicated sites. Collected seed banks were treated with orthogonal treatments of. re stimuli or no stimuli, and seedling emergence was measured in controlled conditions. Seed bank composition reflected the pattern of extant vegetation, with resprouting species being more common in the community with a higher probability of crown. re. Overall, however, resprouting species were poorly represented in the seed bank compared to those species killed by. re. Predicted shifts in allocation to seed production were strongly manifested in community seed banks across the disturbance gradient. Fewer species, seedlings, and seedlings per adult emerged from seed banks in the sclerophyll forest. This suggests that the dominance of resprouting species influences recruitment at the community scale. Community patterns in the seed bank also reflected predicted trade-offs with plant size and growth rate. Short-lived species that are killed by. re dominated the seed bank on rocky outcrops, while longer-lived resprouting species were found in low abundance. Life history trade-offs in persistence and regeneration strongly contribute to coexistence patterns between and within communities with contrasting probabilities of. re return.

J	Nzegbule, E; Nwachi, E				Nzegbule, Emmanuel; Nwachi, Egwu			Soil seed bank characteristics of Canarium schweinfurthii (Engl.): implications for its natural regeneration	FRUITS												Introduction. Canarium schweinfurthii, a tree species in the rainforest of Nigeria whose fruits are intensively gathered and eaten, is seriously endangered because of poor seed germinability and usage. Our study examined the pattern of seed distribution of C. schweinfurthii in the soil from the stem base of the parent plant and through the soil profile, and it assessed the seed level of germinability. Materials and methods. Four stands of C. schweinfurthii were selected from a study area in Southeastern Nigeria. Soils were collected from six distances from each trunk base (1 m, 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 25 m) and at four soil depths (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm); then seeds of C. schweinfurthii were isolated from the cores. Moreover, the percentage of viability and germinability of the seeds collected from each distance and depth were determined. Results. The maximum number of seeds occurred at 1 m from the trunk base (82.3 seeds . 30 cm(-2)), which was 55% of the total collected seeds, and no seed occurred beyond 20 m from the trunk base. The mean number of C. schweinfurthii seeds occurring at 0-5 cm soil depth was 51.3 seeds . 30 cm(-2), which was the highest from any profile. No seeds occurred below 20 cm. Sixty-seven percent of the total 148 seeds collected were considered viable, with about 80% of them occurring at the 0 5 cm soil depth. Even with the pre-sowing treatment (cutting the hard endocarp), only 30.8% of viable seeds collected from 0-5 cm soil depth were able to germinate, while 10% of those collected from 5-10 cm depth germinated. Conclusion. The localization of over 80% of C. schweinfurthii seeds within a 5-m radius from the stem base and 65% within 0-5 cm soil depth encourages easy fruit gathering by local sellers and leads to depletion of the seed bank. Seedling multiplication, protection of stands and domestication need to be initiated to lift C. schweinfurthii out of endangered status, considering the demand for the fruit and poor seed germination due to the hard endocarp.																	0248-1294					JUL-AUG	2008	63	4					219	225		10.1051/fruits:2008015							WOS:000258176900004

Reconciling Seed Dispersal and Seed Bank Observations to Predict Smooth Brome (Bromus inermis) Invasions of a Northern Prairie	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The importance of dispersal in the establishment and proliferation of exotic populations make this life history stage critical in the prediction and management of biological invasions. We observed the dispersal of seeds by patches of smooth brome invading northern fescue prairies and applied an inverse power function model to explore its potential invasion patterns. Based on our observations of two northern fescue prairies in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada, patterns of potential invasion were contingent upon the dispersal of seeds as individual florets or aggregated within spikelets and panicles. For example, although the majority of dispersed seeds were intercepted within one meter, inside and outside the margins of invading patches, slopes of the log-log plots of seed number against their dispersal distance were steeper for seeds dispersed as spikelets than individual florets. Despite the observed aggregation of seeds along the margins of invading patches, the number of dispersed seeds was poorly correlated with that germinated from the seed bank. The shallow dispersal gradient of individual florets and spikelets, combined with the steeper gradient of panicles suggest that smooth brome is capable of simultaneously invading along dense fronts and by establishing isolated foci. Although low correlations between the number of dispersed seeds and their recruitment from the seed bank might suggest postdispersal transport of seeds, other mechanisms, including seed predation and pathogens, remain unexplored. Conservation and restoration of northern fescue prairies must include efforts to control the dispersal of smooth brome seeds and reduce opportunities for their establishment.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JUL	2008	1	3					279	286		10.1614/IPSM-08-066.1							WOS:000208507100005

Progress towards the Eradication of Mikania Vine (Mikania micrantha) and Limnocharis (Limnocharis flava) in Northern Australia	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												To eradicate a weed invasion, its extent must be delimited and each infestation must be extirpated. Measures for both of these criteria are utilized to assess the progress of current eradication programs targeting mikania vine and limnocharis in northern Australia. The known infested area for each species is less than 5 ha and has remained largely static for the last 3 or more years against a backdrop of refined and enhanced detection methods. This suggests that delimitation has been approached, if not achieved. Different methods of detection have their places, relative to the stage of the program and the spatial distribution of infestations. Although all known infestations of both species are effectively monitored and controlled, ongoing emergence from persistent seed banks limits progress towards the extirpation of infestations to a slow, but measurable, rate.																	1939-7291					JUL	2008	1	3					296	303		10.1614/IPSM-08-067.1							WOS:000208507100007						
J	Levine, JM; McEachern, AK; Cowan, C				Levine, Jonathan M.; McEachern, A. Kathryn; Cowan, Clark			Rainfall effects on rare annual plants	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Variation in climate is predicted to increase over much of the planet this century. Forecasting species persistence with climate change thus requires understanding of how populations respond to climate variability, and the mechanisms underlying this response. Variable rainfall is well known to drive fluctuations in annual plant populations, yet the degree to which population response is driven by between-year variation in germination cueing, water limitation or competitive suppression is poorly understood. 2. We used demographic monitoring and population models to examine how three seed banking, rare annual plants of the California Channel Islands respond to natural variation in precipitation and their competitive environments. Island plants are particularly threatened by climate change because their current ranges are unlikely to overlap regions that are climatically favourable in the future. 3. Species showed 9 to 100-fold between-year variation in plant density over the 5-12 years of censusing, including a severe drought and a wet El Nino year. During the drought, population sizes were low for all species. However, even in non-drought years, population sizes and per capita growth rates showed considerable temporal variation, variation that was uncorrelated with total rainfall. These population fluctuations were instead correlated with the temperature after the first major storm event of the season, a germination cue for annual plants. 4. Temporal variation in the density of the focal species was uncorrelated with the total vegetative cover in the surrounding community, suggesting that variation in competitive environments does not strongly determine population fluctuations. At the same time, the uncorrelated responses of the focal species and their competitors to environmental variation may favour persistence via the storage effect. 5. Population growth rate analyses suggested differential endangerment of the focal annuals. Elasticity analyses and life table response experiments indicated that variation in germination has the same potential as the seeds produced per germinant to drive variation in population growth rates, but only the former was clearly related to rainfall. 6. Synthesis. Our work suggests that future changes in the timing and temperatures associated with the first major rains, acting through germination, may more strongly affect population persistence than changes in season-long rainfall.

Little is known about the long-term persistence of these impacts on vegetation but especially on the seed bank. This study assessed whether soil characteristics remain altered 1,600 years after human occupation and if this yielded persistent differences in forest plant communities and their seed bank in particular. Compiegne forest is located in northern-France and has a history of continuous forest cover since the end of Roman times. Twenty-four Gallo-Roman and 24 unoccupied sites were sampled and data were analysed using paired sample tests to investigate whether soil, vegetation and seed bank still differed significantly. The soil was persistently altered on the Gallo-Roman sites resulting in elevated phosphorus levels and pH (dependent on initial soil conditions) which translated into increased vegetation and seed bank species richness. Though spatially isolated, Gallo-Roman sites supported both a homogenized vegetation and seed bank. Vegetation differences were not the only driver behind seed bank differences. Similarity between vegetation and seed bank was low and the possibility existed that agricultural ruderals were introduced via the former land use. Ancient human occupation leaves a persistent trace on forest soil, vegetation and seed bank and appears to do so at least 1,600 years after the former occupation. The geochemical alterations created an entirely different habitat causing not only vegetation but also the seed bank to have altered and homogenized composition and characteristics. Seed bank differences likely persisted by the traditional forest management and altered forest environment.

Patterns of invasion: Trends in abundance of understory vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank from forest edge to interior	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Non-native species are often abundant in the vegetation of forest edges, decreasing in abundance with distance into the forest interior. Regenerative strategies such as the seed rain and seed bank were expected to exhibit a similar pattern of decrease from the edge to the interior; however, this has been rarely investigated. Trends in abundance of the understory vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank of both native and non-native plant species from forest edge to interior at three different natural areas bordered respectively by a crop, a hay field, and a forest access road were quantified. Three 90 m transects were established perpendicularly across each of the three edge types into the forest interior. Twelve 3.14 m(2) circular plots 5 m apart for the first 20 m and 10 m apart thereafter were established along each transect. We compared the abundance of all vascular plant species in the vegetation, seed rain, and the soil seed bank in these plots. Species richness of the vegetation, the seed rain, and the seed bank (native and non-native species combined) decreased from the forest edge into the interior. Sixteen non-native species were observed and were limited to 30 m from the forest edge. Out of these 16 non-native species, > 50% were found only in the seed bank. We observed different trends in abundance of native and non-native vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank for some species. Our study suggests that removing aboveground biomass of non-native species may not be the only thing to consider in non-native species management because of the high frequency of additional non-native species in the seed bank that are absent from the existing vegetation. In order to minimize non-native species, managers should eradicate seedlings of non-native species along forest edges before they mature and produce seed.																	0885-8608					JUL	2008	28	3					228	239		10.3375/0885-8608(2008)28[228:POITIA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000258114800004

Baker is a potential agroforestry species endemic to Ethiopia. No documented information exists about genetic variation in this species, thus baseline information is needed to initiate improvement program. Here, we quantified variations in seed size, germination and seedling growth at nursery stage based on seeds collected from six sites across the natural range of distribution of the species in Ethiopia. All seed- and seedling-related traits exhibited highly significant differences among seed sources (P < 0.01), and the magnitude of genetic variation was substantially higher (77-99%) than the environmental variation. The genetic advance as percent of the mean was higher for germination capacity (69.4%) and seed weight (31.7%) than for other traits, suggesting that the population means for these traits may be changed considerably by selecting the superior 5% of the genotypes. There were strong phenotypic (r(p) = 0.81) and genotypic (r(g) = 0.89) correlations between seed width and seed weight, so also between seedling height and root collar diameter (r(p) = 0.95 and r(g) = 1.00). In conclusion, the results reveal the existence of substantial genetic variation, which can be utilized to initiate tree improvement program of the species and for gene conservation in seed banks.

Linking seed dispersal, germination and seedling recruitment in the invasive species Berberis darwinii (Darwin's barberry)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seedling recruitment is a multi-phased process involving seed production, dispersal, germination, seedling establishment and subsequent survival. Understanding the factors that determine success at each stage of this process is of particular interest to scientists and managers seeking to understand how invasive species spread and persist, and identify critical stages for management. To understand the factors and processes influencing recruitment of the invasive species Berberis darwinii Hook. (Darwin's barberry), temporal and spatial patterns of seed dispersal, germination and seedling establishment were examined. Seed dispersal from a large source population was measured over two fruiting seasons, and subsequent patterns of seedling emergence and survival within each cohort were measured. Seed longevity was tested under both natural and artificial conditions. Seeds were widely dispersed by birds, up to 450 m from the source population. Dispersal was essential to seedling establishment, as few seedlings survived beneath the parent canopy. Seeds were relatively short-lived in the soil under both field and glasshouse conditions, with few surviving for more than 1 year. Patterns of newly emerged seedlings largely reflected patterns of seed rain, but seedling survival was significantly affected by distance from source population, seedling density and light environment. These results suggest that recruitment of B. darwinii is dependent on dispersal of seeds to favourable microsites. Management priorities should include the removal of fruiting plants, and seedling control in highlight areas.

Effect of light and temperature on Alternathera tenella, Conyza bonariensis and Digitaria ciliaris germination	PLANTA DANINHA												The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of light and temperature on the germination of three common Brazilian weed species: Alternathera tenella, Conyza bonariensis and Digitaria ciliaris. The influence of four temperature variations (15/25, 20/30, 20/35 and 30/40 degrees C) with and without light was tested on germination percentage and germination velocity rate (GVR). The seeds were collected in experimental seedbeds to allow sample homogenization. Fifty seeds of each species were placed in gerbox type boxes, previously prepared with humidified "germitest" germination double layer paper. The boxes were stored in temperature-controlled BOD type vertical germinators. The temperatures were maintained at the ratio of 16/8 hours day and night, respectively. Evaluations started three days after incubation, with the seeds displaying roots equal or over I mm being considered to have germinated. A significant light effect on germination was confirmed fort all the species, mainly D. ciliaris. A. tenella, presented high germination at all temperatures tested, even though 30/40 degrees C restricted C. bonariensis germination. The treatments also affected GVR, whose behavior was similar to the germination percentage. with the highest effect being confirmed in D. ciliaris.

Seed bank and abovegroud weed	PLANTA DANINHA												A study was carried out in Pedra Petra-MT aiming to study the relation between seed bank and posterior aboveground weed in annual crop fields under no-till and tillage systems. The seed bank and weed flora were assessed in fifty contiguous 1 m(2) cells. under both cultivation systems. The seed bank was determined from soil samples from 4% of the area of each cell at 05 cm depth using the flotation technique. The aboveground weed vegetation was evaluated by six successive surveys until November 2004, carried out in the total area of each cell, with removal of the individuals from the area after each evaluation. These data were used to calculate the phytosociological parameters and the correlation between the seed bank and aboveground weed. The similarity between the bank seed and the aboveground vegetation was low for both systems. Only Amaranthus deflexus and Eleusine indica showed to have significant correlation between bank seeds and the aboveground weed vegetation. For A. deflexus, the correlation was significant in both cultivation systems, while for E. indica, only under no-till.																	0100-8358	1806-9681				JUL-SEP	2008	26	3					521	530		10.1590/S0100-83582008000300007							WOS:000259176000007

Weed seed dormancy as a survival mechanism - Brief review	PLANTA DANINHA												The high production of seeds in constantly disturbed environments is one of the main mechanisms of weeds survival. These seeds have usually some dormancy mechanism which constitutes weed species perpetuation in the crops. Seed dormancy can be characterized by temporally absence of the germination capacity, even though the seeds have satisfactorily conditions to germinate, thus allowing species survival under adversities, mainly those that make it difficult or hinder vegetative and reproductive growth. The causes of dormancy stern from two basic mechanisms: the first is related to inner seed events (embryo) and the second to outer characteristics in the seeds (tegument, endosperm or fruit barriers). Conceptually, dormancy can be classified as primary dormancy (when the mechanisms occur in plants-mother) and secondary dormancy (when the mechanisms causing dormancy occur after seed dispersion). These types of dormancy occur normally in weeds. Their alternation or cycling ensures germination flow these species, which depends on the characteristics occurring at the initial stages of seed formation (primary dormancy), and later, on the environmental conditions (secondary dormancy). However, many mechanisms coordinate dormancy, with the differences among them being still controversial. Thus, this study aimed to approach some of the main concepts and mechanisms in weed dormancy, in order to contribute and stimulate research which is still scarce in this area.

Factors affecting Bromus tectorum seed bank carryover in western Utah	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) is a winter annual weed that presents a serious obstacle to rangeland restoration in the Intermountain West. The objective of this study was to evaluate factors regulating the size and persistence of cheatgrass carryover seed banks on semiarid sites in western Utah. We prevented current-year seed production in each of four habitats, then tallied emerging seedlings over the next 4 yr. Two iterations of the study were conducted during consecutive years. One year before initiation of each iteration, we estimated seed rain at each site. Above-average precipitation in 1998-1999 resulted in relatively high seed rain (13 942 seeds . m(-2)) for the first iteration, whereas seed rain for the second iteration averaged only 3567 . m(-2) because of drought conditions in 1999-2000. Mean total number of seedlings emerging from carryover seeds for the first and second iterations were 1304 and 270 seedlings . m(-2). Seedling emergence from carryover seed was positively correlated with production-year seed rain (R-2 = 0.69). The fraction of seed rain that carried over tended to be lower when precipitation the year following production favored fall emergence of the transient seed bank. First-year emergence of carryover seeds averaged 96% of total emergence, whereas third-year emergence averaged < 1% and was zero for six of eight cases. Carryover seeds persisted somewhat longer at the xeric black greasewood site than at more upland sites. Our study shows that cheatgrass seeds rarely persist beyond the second carryover year even on semiarid sites. Emergence from the carryover seed bank can be predicted from site attributes and precipitation patterns in previous years.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				JUL	2008	61	4					430	436		10.2111/07-035.1							WOS:000257809400009

Breaking life cycle of Common Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) to exhaust seed bank. II. Efficiency of herbicides, used singly or in combination with mowing	REVUE SUISSE D AGRICULTURE												The agricultural, environmental and public health concerns due to Common Ragweed justify a drastic control strategy wherever this invasive species establishes. One such strategy is to deplete the seed bank reserve by inhibiting seed production and thus breaking the plants life cycle. The key time of year to achieve this is during seed development and maturation (end of August to the beginning of October). This article describes the efficacy of several herbicides, used either singly or in conjunction with mowing. Glyphosate is one of the most efficient herbicides for controlling Common Ragweed, however it fails to satisfactorily break the plant life cycle with a single application, especially where populations are dense. In such cases, an initial mowing mid July to limit pollen production followed by an application of glyphosate in August can be recommended. Nevertheless, glyphosate drawbacks, notably regarding water pollution and the development of herbicidal resistance, make it advisable to identify alternative tools as well. Promising results were also obtained with glufosinate and various other herbicides containing 2,4-D, bromoxynil, ioxynil, florasulam, fluroxypyr, and mecoprop-P.

Riparian vegetation recovery after invasive alien tree clearance in the Fynbos Biome	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The Working for Water programme is tasked with the important role of controlling invasive alien plants with an assumption that indigenous vegetation will recover naturally. This study assessed vegetation composition and structure following alien clearance in closed-stand invasion of riparian areas and a minimum of two years' passive recovery. Three initial clearing treatments - Fell Only, Fell & Remove and Fell & Burn were compared to uninvaded Reference conditions. The aim was to ascertain the nature of vegetation recovery, as well as to determine which clearing treatment was most successful in promoting recovery. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed that the Fell & Remove treatment most closely approached the Reference condition while Fell Only and Fell & Burn plots had altered composition and structure. All clearing treatments had significantly lower vegetation cover than the Reference and species composition was altered by invasion and clearance. Important growth forms, such as small (3-10 in) trees were suppressed by felled slash and burning. Although burning was the best method to reduce woody alien species, secondary invasion by alien herbaceous species occurred where natural riparian vegetation did not re-establish. The Fell & Remove treatment is recommended as the best to use in promoting indigenous vegetation recovery, and together with continued alien follow-up control, is able to minimize alien re-invasion of riparian ecosystems. Managers are advised to consider active restoration measures in areas where recovery is likely to be protracted. (C) 2008 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Evidence from the Western Cape, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Riparian zones are complex disturbance-mediated systems that are highly susceptible to invasion by alien plants. They are prioritized in most alien-plant management initiatives in South Africa. The current practice for the restoration of cleared riparian areas relies largely on the unaided recovery of native species from residual individuals and regeneration from soil-stored seed banks. Little is known about the factors that determine the effectiveness of this approach. We need to know how seed banks of native species in riparian ecosystems are affected by invasion, and the potential for cleared riparian areas to recover unaided after clearing operations. Study sites were selected on four river systems in the Western Cape: the Berg, Eerste, Molenaars and Wit Rivers. Plots were selected in both invaded (> 75% Invasive Alien Plant (IAP) canopy cover) and uninvaded (also termed reference, with < 25% IAP canopy cover) sections of the rivers. Replicate plots were established at two elevations (mountain stream and foothill) and in three moisture regimes (dry, wet and transitional bank zones). Soil samples were taken, surveys were done of the aboveground vegetation, and comparisons were made between invaded and non-invaded sites. Seed bank communities were clearly defined by the state of the river (reference or invaded) and moisture regimes (wet and dry bank zones). Comparisons at a landscape scale showed no clear pattern, as the composition of both aboveground and seed bank species assemblages were strongly influenced by site history, especially the extent of invasion and fire frequency. Even after heavy and extensive invasion, riparian seed banks have the potential to initiate the restoration process. However, not all riparian species are represented in the seed bank. Based on these results, restoration recommendations are outlined for alien-invaded riparian zones. (c) 2008 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Composition of the soil seed bank in alien-invaded grassy fynbos: Potential for recovery after clearing	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Indigenous soil seed banks play a very important role in facilitating the natural recovery of indigenous fynbos vegetation after clearing invasive alien vegetation. In densely invaded areas, there is a reduction in fynbos cover and seed production, and these ecosystems rely heavily on the remaining soil seed bank as a reservoir of plant propagules. This study used the seedling emergence approach to assess recovery potential based on the soil seed banks of riparian and hillslope grassy fynbos communities that had been densely invaded for three decades, with Acacia longifolia as the dominant alien species. Forty-eight species (of which five were aliens), representing 30 genera and 18 families, emerged from the soil seed bank, with Asteraceae and Cyperaccae being best represented. The mean density of indigenous seedlings for the study area was 1582 seedlings/m(2). Senecio rigidus exhibited the highest density, with 274 seedlings/m(2), followed by Chironia baccifera (151 seedlings/m(2)) and Rumohra adiantiformis (136 seedlings/m(2)). Forbs were the most numerous growth form. Two other alien species exhibited comparable seedling densities, i.e. Solanum nigrum (181 seedlings/m(2)) and Conyza canadensis (98 seedlings/m(2)). A. longifolia seed densities of up to 4528 seeds/m(2) were found by sieving the soil. Results revealed that alien-invaded grassy fynbos had a diverse and viable soil seed bank with relatively high seed densities. Pioneer species were well represented, as well as graminoids in the riparian zone. Species representing some guilds were missing; e.g. serotinous species from the genera Leucadendron and Protea, and few geophytes were present in the hillslope soil seed bank, although ericoid shrubs were well represented. Riparian species such as Cliffortia graminea and common Cyperaccae and Restionaceae species were also not represented in the seed bank. It would appear from this data that the soil seed bank would be adequate to enable a functional cover of indigenous vegetation to re-establish after clearing. In order to improve vegetation structure and composition, the addition of some missing guilds would facilitate restoration, provided that post-clearing follow-up treatments do not prevent or hinder the establishment of these indigenous species.

Viability of alien and native seed banks after slash and burn: Effects of soil moisture, depth of burial and fuel load	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Invasion by alien woody species is a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function in the Fynbos and Grassland Biomes of South Africa, and riparian areas are particularly affected. Large stands of the Australian Acacia longifolia have been cleared in catchments in the grassy fynbos of the Eastern Cape. After clearing mature stands of A. longifolia, the dead material is usually stacked, left to dry and eventually burned. There is concern that this results in very high fire intensities to the detriment of native seed banks, and it has been suggested that smaller slash stacks or burning when soils are damp could reduce this impact. We examined the effects of soil moisture (moist vs. dry), depth of burial (2 vs. 4 cm below soil surface) and fuel load (small vs. large slash stacks of the kind typically constructed during clearing operations) on soil temperatures and seed viability of A. longifolia and four common native plant species, viz. Hermannia hyssopifolia, Psoralea pinnata, Senecio chrysocoma and Virgilia divaricata. In the field, an experimental burn of two slash piles was performed to determine the soil temperature during fire. Soil temperatures were found to be higher in dry soils, at shallower depth and under higher fuel loads, with the effect of moisture being the most pronounced. Temperatures in dry soils under large stacks exceeded 330 degrees C at 2 cm depth. A laboratory experiment showed that A. longifolia and P. pinnata had higher germination in moist soils and at lower soil temperatures while V divaricata showed the opposite response. S. chrysocoma had low germination in all treatments and H. hyssopifolia did not show a consistent response to the treatments. Heat treatment increased germination in all species, and seeds of all species could withstand maximum temperatures of up to 160 degrees C and sustained temperatures exceeding 100 degrees C for more than 20 min. The results show that seed banks of these species can survive fires under slash stacks but stacking slash in smaller piles, or burning when soils are moist, reduces the risk of losing seeds in the upper soil layers to extreme soil temperatures.

Seed production, seed bank dynamics, resprouting and long-term response to clearing of the alien invasive Solanum mauritianum in a temperate to subtropical riparian ecosystem	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Solanum mauritianum Scopoli (Solanaceae; 'bugweed') is a major weed of natural vegetation and plantations in the eastern higher rainfall regions of South Africa. This study assessed the aerial cover and density of S. mauritianum, prior to and after Working for Water (WfW) clearing on the Sabie River, in both higher altitude grassland and lower altitude savanna reaches, using 40, 50 x 20 in (modified Whittaker) plots. Clearing of woody plants involves both cutting the stem and then applying herbicide to the cut stump. Despite clearing, S. mauritianum aerial cover rapidly recovered in the initial 1996/7 study period, and overall densities remained similar in 1996/7 (873 plants/ha) and 2005 (838 plants/ha). The study then focussed on the regeneration capacity of S. mauritianum within these sites. Although seed bank densities in 1996/7 were highly variable, mean densities between the 8 treatment combinations (biome, invasion intensity, cleared vs. uncleared) were high throughout (47-554 seeds/m(2)), showing that the invasion potential remained high despite clearing. Seed densities were higher in savanna than grassland (P=0.0001), and under high- compared to low invasion intensity (P=0.0046). Particularly noteworthy was the lack of a significant clearing effect, or any significant interactions. High proportions of cut S. mauritianum resprouted after clearing (40-80%). Cutting lower on the stem increased mortality substantially, with cutting lower than 18 cm resulting in 100% mortality, while cutting above 50 cm resulted in 100% resprouting recovery. Variation in basal stem (stump) diameter of cut plants had no effect on survival. Therefore the effectiveness of WfW clearing of S. mauritianum can be significantly improved. Seed production occurs on plants of >= 1.50 m tall, and increases linearly with increasing plant height, reaching in the order of 100000-200000 seeds/plant per annum for plants of 3.3 in in height. Seed persistence increased with depth of burial and was higher under canopy shade versus 'open' in the field. Seed half life ranged 11-16 months. Hence seedling emergence from the dense relatively long-lived seed bank is a considerable challenge. More thorough and frequent follow-up treatments will be essential to maintain the improved situation after clearing. Exploring a tighter integration of clearing efforts with (a) the restoration of the tall indigenous riparian canopy tree species at some sites, (b) a more strategic application of follow-up clearing to target newly emerging seedlings after major disturbances such as severe floods, and (c) a more strategic application of biological control, should be pursued.

Initial response of riparian plant community structure to clearing of invasive alien plants in Kruger National Park, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Recovery of indigenous species subsequent to the clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is crucial for ecosystem recovery to occur. However, cleared sites are often just left in the hope that revegetation will occur naturally. In riparian areas of Kruger National Park (KNP), the Working for Water (WfW) Programme has cleared IAPs on a regular basis, but little post-clearance monitoring has taken place. Thus investigating short-term effects of IAPs and IAP clearing on plant community diversity and vegetation recovery provided an ideal opportunity to assess feasible targets of natural ecosystem recovery in similar areas. Vegetation was sampled from twelve transects along the Sabie River in and adjacent to the KNP, before (March/April 2006) and after (March 2007) the annual clearing of IAPs by WfW. Rarefied species richness, alpha diversity and evenness of distribution of species all declined with increasing density of IAPs (P < 0.05). There was a mean reduction in IAP density of 80% (S.E +/- 6%) (P=0.002) through the clearing by WfW. After clearing of IAPs, indigenous vegetation densities increased, with herbaceous growth forms showing the largest increase in transects that were previously heavily invaded. Thus, in this system, which is relatively undisturbed by human activities, initial recovery of indigenous vegetation can occur without further restorative interventions. This process is more than likely aided by the continuous clearing of IAPs by WfW as this acts to deplete alien seed banks and maintain IAPs at acceptable and manageable levels. (C) 2008 SAAB.

Impacts of clearing invasive alien plants from 1995 to 2005 on vegetation structure, invasion intensity and ground cover in a temperate to subtropical riparian ecosystem	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The impacts of invasive alien plants (IAP) and their subsequent clearing by the Working for Water Programme (WfW) on (a) overstorey (woody plant) vegetation structure, (b) invasion intensity (overstorey aerial cover of woody alien plants) and (c) ground cover, in a temperate to subtropical riparian ecosystem were studied in 1996/7 and again in 2005, in order to provide a longer-term perspective on the effectiveness of WfW clearing. Forty 1000 in 2 plots were surveyed and resurveyed, comparing between (a) higher altitude Grassland and lower altitude Savanna, (b) high (> 50% invasion intensity) versus low (< 50% invasion intensity) alien invasion sites, and (c) WfW cleared versus uncleared sites (the three 'treatments'). Pre-clearing estimates from cut stumps in 1996/7 indicated high alien invasion intensities of 72 +/- 8% in Grassland and 69 +/- 11% in Savanna. From 1996/7 to 2005 there was a large decrease in aerial cover of alien trees of > 5 m and to a lesser extent 2-5 m in height, and a large increase in alien plants of < 2 m. Hence WRV was initially successful, with the original tall Eucalyptus grandis tree layer largely removed. However, total invasion intensity remained unchanged over the first decade (30.4 +/- 4.6% in 1996/7, 31.9 +/- 3.2% in 2005). From 1996/7 to 2005, grass and herbaceous cover decreased, while bare soil and litter increased, indicating reduced surface stability. This was in response to (a) the major flood event of February 2000, (b) the effects of IAP invasions and (c) WfW clearing. Total ground vegetation cover was negatively related to alien aerial cover in both biome reaches in 1996/7 and 2005. By 2005, there were no longer any differences in the aerial cover of woody alien plants in response to the original 1996/7 invasion intensity or clearing 'treatments', and hence progressive homogenization of LAP cover. Aerial cover of woody indigenous plants also responded negatively to increasing alien aerial cover in 1996/7 and 2005 in both Savanna and Grassland. In conclusion, the nature of the IAP problem has changed from dealing largely with relatively few large E. grandis trees in the mid-90s, to the present large Suite of invasive species with numerous smaller individuals. This has implications for the time needed for clearing. This is one of few studies to have assessed the initial and longer-term (1995-2005) effectiveness of WfW clearing operations. It shows that improved IAP clearing protocols are needed. More follow-up treatments are recommended to 'capture' alien resprouts and new seedlings before they establish and reproduce. Secondly, integrating clearing with restoration of the tall indigenous riparian canopy tree species in heavily invaded sites would help to shade out many alien recruits. (C) 2008 SAAB.

Guidelines for improved management of riparian zones invaded by alien plants in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												This paper reviews the results of recent research on riparian vegetation recovery following the clearance of invasive alien plants. In Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna Biomes, riparian ecosystems were found to have relatively-high ecological resilience to invasion by alien plants, except in some situations of closed alien stands (75-100% aerial cover). Where alien invasion is the primary disturbance at a site, and invasion intensity is low (< 75% cover, with some indigenous species present), the recovery of riparian vegetation structure and functioning is a realistic goal through alien clearance alone. Careful clearance of the aliens to avoid damage to indigenous species, while ensuring a high kill rate for resprouting alien species, is sufficient action to ensure ecosystem recovery. However, it is important that alien follow-up control is maintained at a sufficient frequency and that adaptive management is exercised to deal with unplanned events, such as fire or a high rainfall year, that may stimulate renewed alien recruitment. In closed alien stands, clearance may be sufficient to restore ecosystem structure and functioning in some situations, but not in others. To be realistic, restoration goals must take into account the planned future use of the riparian zone and the current ecological condition of the surrounding catchment area. Where ecological integrity of the catchment is low (highly transformed, fragmented), restoration of natural riparian vegetation structure or composition is untenable in most cases. A more realistic goal will be to restore basic ecosystem functions through providing a vegetation cover, comprising non-invasive (preferably indigenous) species, that is resilient to flood events and re-invasion by alien plants. The functions restored should include the buffering of the aquatic ecosystem through erosion control, and a return to more natural hydrological flows. In less-transformed catchments, restoring riparian ecosystem structure and composition is a realistic goal where closed alien stands are cleared by the "Fell & Remove" treatment. Seed banks provide indigenous herb and shrub species, but where recruitment is poor, especially after fire, active restoration is beneficial in facilitating vegetation recovery and suppressing alien recruitment. However, the costs and benefits of active restoration need to be further investigated. Simple decision trees with accompanying information boxes and species lists are presented to assist managers. Because of the complexity of the decision process, it is recommended that specialists assist project managers in drawing up site-specific restoration plans that dovetail with alien-clearing plans. This synthesis of research findings, on riparian restoration in alien-invaded riparian zones, provides guidelines for improved management, drawing mainly on papers in this Special Issue.

J	Davis, AS				Davis, Adam S.			Weed seed pools concurrent with corn and soybean harvest an Illinois	WEED SCIENCE												At the time of grain harvest, weed seeds can be classed into one of four pools on the basis of dispersal status and location: (1) undispersed, remaining on the mother plant; (2) dispersed in the current year, on the soil surface; (3) dispersed in the current year and collected by harvest machinery; and (4) dispersed in a previous year and persisting within the soil seed bank. Knowledge of the relative sizes of these seed pools for different weed species under different crop environments will be useful for determining the best way to reduce the size of inputs to the soil seed bank. In fall 2004 and fall 2005, four randomly selected commercially managed corn and soybean fields in east-central Illinois were sampled to quantify weed seed pools at time of crop harvest. Thirty randomly located 0.125-m(2) quadrats were placed within each field, the four seed pools mentioned above were sampled for each quadrat, and the species composition and abundance of each seed pool was determined. The magnitude of the weed seed rain varied among species and between years and crops. Twenty-six weed species were found to contribute to at least one of the four seed pools. However, the weed seed pools were consistently dominated by six species: velvetleaf, Amaranthus complex (redroot pigweed and waterhemp), ivyleaf morningglory, giant foxtail, prickly sida, and common cocklebur. For each of these species, the ratio of undispersed seeds to seeds in the soil seed bank at harvest time was >= 1 in at least one crop during one of the two experimental years, indicating a potential for the soil seed bank to be completely replenished or augmented by that year's seed rain. This analysis demonstrates the urgent need for techniques to limit weed seed inputs to the soil seed bank at the end of the growing season.

Seed persistence in the field may be predicted by laboratory-controlled aging	WEED SCIENCE												Weed management is complicated by the presence of soil seed banks. The complexity of soil-seed interactions means that seed persistence in the field is often difficult to measure, let alone predict. Field trials, although accurate in their context, are time-consuming and expensive to conduct for individual species. Some ex situ techniques for estimating seed life expectancy have been proposed, but these fail to simulate the environmental complexity of the field. Also, it has been questioned whether techniques such as the controlled aging test (CAT) are useful indicators of field persistence. This study aimed to test the validity of the standard CAT (seed aging at 45 C and 60% relative humidity) in use at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, U.K., for predicting field seed-persistence. Comparison of seed persistence and CAT data for 27 northwest European species suggested a significant positive correlation of 0.31. Subsequently, 13 species of emerging and common weeds of Queensland were assessed for their seed longevity using the CAT. The seed longevity data of these species in the CAT were linked with field seed-persistence data according to three broad seed-persistence categories: 1 yr, 1 to 3 yr, and 3 yr. We discuss the scope for using the CAT as a tool for rapid assignment of species to these categories. There is a need for further studies that compare predictions of seed persistence based on the CAT with seed persistence in the field for a larger range of species and environments.

Germination ecology of the boreal-alpine terrestrial orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica (Orchidaceae)	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												In order to reveal some of the germination requirements of the boreal-alpine terrestrial orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica, several experiments were carried out on seeds collected from the Solendet nature reserve, central Norway. Seeds were sown in seed packets made of nylon cloth and deployed in situ vertically in the peat in order to study the temporal pattern of seed germination and determine if the seeds became part of the soil seed bank. In vitro germination experiments were carried out varying the growth media, fungal partner and chilling treatment, in order to study the effect of a fungal symbiont on germination and early protocorm development, and the possibility of a physiological seed dormancy. A high rate of germination a short time after sowing in the in vitro experiments together with a very low survival after deployment in the in situ experiments (0.2% after three years) indicate that D. lapponica seeds are not part of a long-lived soil seed bank. In vitro experiments also demonstrated that a fungal symbiont was not required for germination. Seeds sown in situ had very low germination rate (11%-12%) and lack of available nutrients is suggested as a possible explanation. Presence of a fungal symbiont clearly enhanced the early development of protocorms in vitro, and is probably necessary for the seedling to grow beyond the earliest protocorm stages under natural conditions. The results indicate that recruitment is highly variable and very low relative to population size, indicating that survival of established plants is crucial to the fate of a population.

GeneSys-Beet: A model of the effects of cropping systems on gene flow between sugar beet and weed beet	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												A weedy form of the genus Beta, i.e. Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris (hence "weed beet") frequently found in sugar beet is impossible to eliminate with herbicides because of its genetic proximity to the crop. It is presumed to be the progeny of accidental hybrids between sugar beet (ssp. vulgaris) and wild beet (ssp. maritima), or of sugar beet varieties sensitive to vernalization and sown early in years with late cold spells. In this context, genetically modified (GM) sugar beet varieties tolerant to non-selective herbicides would be interesting to manage weed beet. However, because of the proximity of the weed to the crop, it is highly probable that the herbicide-tolerance transgene would be transmitted to the weed. To evaluate the likelihood of gene flow from GM varieties to weed beet and to propose cropping systems that reduce this likelihood, a model of the effects of cropping systems on population dynamics and gene flow in weed beet was developed, based on the existing spatio-temporal framework GENESYS and on field experiments for parametrising the life-cycle of weed beet. The resulting GENESYS-Beet model consists in simulating every year the life-cycle of weed and crop beet in each field of a given region. During flowering, the various life-cycles connect, leading to pollen exchanges which depend on field areas, shapes and distances. The life-cycle consists of a succession of life-stages for which both densities and genotype proportions are calculated. The relationships between the various stages depend on the Crop grown in the field, the stage and genotype of the modelled crop relative, as well as the cultivation techniques (tillage tools and dates, sowing date and density, herbicides, mechanical and manual weeding, harvest date) used to manage the crop. Simulations of GM spread in different farms and regions and of the effects of weed management on the advent of GM beet were carried Out to illustrate the possible uses of the model and the consequences of co-existing GM and non-GM crops.

Biodiversity of the bacterioplankton in the surface waters around Southern Thule in the Southern Ocean	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Seven independent clone libraries were constructed to study the biodiversity of the bacterioplankton in the surface waters around Southern Thule, South Sandwich Islands, in order to identify the species present, to determine the sample effort required to estimate the total diversity, and to determine whether the surface waters around Southern Thule represented a highly specialized local anomaly or a subset of the marine meta-community. In total, 672 clones generated 629 useable sequences. These 629 clones matched 278 different sequences deposited in the 16S rDNA sequence databases. The majority of the clones were related to marine microorganisms, many of which had been previously detected in permanently cold Arctic and Antarctic marine environments. Each clone library generated an average of 35.8 new sequence matches. 346 clones covered two-thirds of the total estimated diversity, while 438 clones covered three-quarters of the total estimated diversity. Above this number, the coverage tended to stabilize and a relatively large number of additional clones were required to improve coverage significantly, increasing at the rate of about one new sequence match per 100 new clones. Comparing the different clone libraries, eight matches occurred in each of the seven libraries, whilst fifty-five occurred in only one, suggesting that there might be a relatively small number of common dominant ubiquitous species, with a much larger underlying diversity or 'seed bank' from which this dominant diversity is drawn. This study suggests that the dominant bacterioplankton in the surface waters around Southern Thule represent a subset of the marine meta-community, whilst sub-dominant diversity appears to be a highly specialized local anomaly.

J	Lambrinos, JG; Bando, KJ				Lambrinos, John G.; Bando, K. Jun			Habitat modification inhibits conspecific seedling recruitment in populations of an invasive ecosystem engineer	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive species that strongly modify their physical habitat are a particular management concern. Theoretical models predict that habitat modification could speed spread rates or allow invasion of sites that would otherwise resist invasion. There are few empirical tests of this hypothesis, however. We tested whether habitat modification by invading Spartina alterniflora populations facilitates conspecific seedling recruitment and spatial spread in Willapa Bay, WA, USA. Established S. alterniflora individuals strongly modified their local physical environment. Hydrologic flow, porewater salinity, and light availability were decreased while sediment NH4 increased with increasing S. alterniflora stem density. The S. alterniflora seed bank was greater and spring seedlings were denser within meadows of S. alterniflora than on unvegetated tideflats. However, almost all seedling recruitment after 1 year occurred on tideflats or on meadow edge plots where the above ground S. alterniflora biomass had been removed. Instead of facilitating invasive spread, ecosystem engineering in this system appears to create conditions that inhibit local seedling recruitment. These results suggest that the influence of ecosystem engineering on invasive spread is highly contingent on the relative spatial scales of habitat modification, environmental heterogeneity, and propagule availability. Control activities could change these spatial relationships, however, inadvertently promoting invasive recruitment.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				JUN	2008	10	5					729	741		10.1007/s10530-007-9165-2							WOS:000256080000012

Conserving the gene pool of Far Eastern plants by means of seed cryopreservation	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Cryotolerance of seeds has been studied in 103 plant species of 33 families from five regions of the Russian Far East. In 89.1% of these species, seed viability has not decreased in the course of cryogenic storage. Six species have shown interpopulation variation in the seed response to extremely low temperature (-196C). Freezing in liquid nitrogen, which results in deep anabiosis, can be used as a means for long-term seed storage. A preliminary assessment of genetic diversity at the population level provides for the maximum possible mobilization of the species gene pool. The results of this study contribute to the development of a scientific basis for creating a seed bank of the Far Eastern flora with the purpose to conserve and restore biological resources of the region.

Integrating population demography, genetics and self-incompatibility in a viability assessment of the Wee Jasper Grevillea (Grevillea iaspicula McGill., Proteaceae)	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Grevillea iaspicula is an endangered shrub known from only eight small populations (< 250 individuals) in south-eastern Australia. The species is threatened by combined ecological and genetic factors, e.g. land conversion, weed invasion, low recruitment and low gene flow among populations. The populations also show large variance in male fitness and limited mate availability which are thought to arise as a consequence of gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI). This study has used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to explore the interaction between GSI and mate limitation in this species, as well as its effect on long-term population viability. The model was parameterised with demographic and genetic data obtained from 2 years of population monitoring. Simulation results identified extremely low establishment rates as the most critical factor currently influencing the persistence of G. iaspicula populations and indicated that the extant populations are at serious risk of extinction in the near future unless this is altered by, at very least, an order of magnitude higher. SI was shown to affect the magnitude of variation in establishment but this effect was masked when establishment was critically low. Disassortative mating, owing to low allelic richness at the S-locus, had the negative demographic effect of restricting mating to relatively few compatible plants. Restricted mate availability imposed additional limitations to the viability of populations but, given a 20-fold increase in establishment rate, population fluctuations stabilised. The long-term viability of G. iaspicula is bleak without artificial augmentation of the populations but management planning must also consider genetic processes, including SI, to ensure such strategies optimise the benefits gained.

Lawrence			Photosynthetic resource-use efficiency and demographic variability in desert winter annual plants	ECOLOGY												We studied a guild of desert winter annual plants that differ in long-term variation in per capita reproductive success (lb, the product of per capita survival from germination to reproduction, l, times per capita reproduction of survivors, b) to relate individual function to population and community dynamics. We hypothesized that variation in lb should be related to species' positions along a trade-off between relative growth rate (RGR) and photosynthetic water-use efficiency (WUE) because lb is a species-specific function of growing-season precipitation. We found that demographically variable species have greater RGR and greater leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta, a proxy inversely related to WUE). We examined leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic characteristics and found that, in this system, variation in Delta is a function of photosynthetic demand rather than stomatal regulation of water loss. The physiological characteristics that result in low Delta in some species may confer greater photosynthetic performance during the reliably moist but low temperature periods that immediately follow winter rainfall in the Sonoran Desert or alternatively during cool periods of the day or early growing season. Conversely, while species with high Delta and high RGR exhibit low leaf N, they have high biomass allocation to canopy leaf area display. Such trait associations may allow for greater performance during the infrequent conditions where high soil moisture persists into warmer conditions, resulting in high demographic variance. Alternatively, high variance could arise from specialization to warm periods of the day or season. Population dynamic buffering via stress tolerance (low RGR and Delta) correlates negatively with buffering via seed banks, as predicted by bet-hedging theory. By merging analyses of population dynamics with functional trait relationships, we develop a deeper understanding of the physiological, ecological, and evolutionary mechanisms involved in population and community dynamics.

Sediment characteristics and vegetation dynamics as indicators for the potential rehabilitation of an estuary salt marsh on the arid west coast of South Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The Orange River estuary is a Ramsar site that has been placed on the Montreux Record following the degradation of 300 ha of salt marsh. The groundwater and surface sediments are hypersaline and above the tolerance range of the dominant plant Sarcocornia pillansii. This study measured the sediment characteristics in 2005 (dry conditions) and in 2006 (flood and high rainfall). The sediment EC ranged from 120.9 +/- 4.7 mS cm(-1) in 2005 to 52.5 +/- 4.8 mS cm(-1) in 2006 with sediment moisture content sufficient for the germination of seed during both years (9.7 +/- 0.7%). The small areas of remaining S. pillansii have the potential to produce 40 billion seeds, which would be sufficient to revegetate the desertified marsh, but due to hypersaline sediment conditions the successful establishment and survival of the seedlings remain low, Many seeds (3616 m(-2)) and seedlings (1296 m(-2)) were found in drift lines in 2006. Microhabitats created by the adult vegetation also provided favourable conditions for seed germination. Laboratory studies indicated that seeds of S. pillansii germinate best in freshwater (40% at 0 psu compared to 5% at 35 psu). Exposure to hypersaline conditions (70 psu) decreased the viability of the seeds, The potential of the marsh to rehabilitate naturally therefore depends on sufficient freshwater entering the marsh.

In terms of growth rates and survival, this form of rejuvenation may be more successful than recruitment via seed rain or dormant seeds in the seed bank. For this reason, resprouting could play in important role in the tree canopy and forest microclimate recovery and forest succession. To assess whether coppice growth of African wild olive (Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata) should be considered for restoration of dry Afromontane forest, this study investigated olive coppice densities and characteristics in a 100-ha grazing exclosure in northern Ethiopia using random samples and systematic samples along transects. The response to pruning, expected to reactivate it leading shoot and thus contribute to faster tree habit and canopy recovery, was tested its a secondary objective. Olive coppice wits more numerous than seedlings, especially along the natural drainage line of the landscape. While pruning yielded longer top shoots, it did not reactivate leading shoots. On the contrary, it triggered the formation of numerous long shoots on the pruning surface. Its high densities make olive coppice an interesting starting point for forest restoration, but due to its 'quantity-driven' coppicing strategy and tendency for lateral expansion, coppice management to reduce the number of shoots and to restore a tree habit in persistent Olea may be needed. To optimize the value of coppice in exclosures, further research on coppicing strategies and responses to various pruning techniques of both the pioneer and climax species is needed.

Cattail invasion of sedge/grass meadows in Lake Ontario: Photointerpretation analysis of sixteen wetlands over five decades	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Photointerpretation studies were conducted to evaluate vegetation changes in wetlands of Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River associated with regulation of water levels since about 1960. The studies used photographs from 16 sites (four each from drowned river mouth, barrier beach, open embayment, and protected embayment wetlands) and spanned a period from the 1950s to 2001 at roughly decadal intervals. Meadow marsh was the most prominent vegetation type in most wetlands in the late 1950s when water levels had declined following high lake levels in the early 1950s. Meadow marsh increased at some sites in the mid-1960s in response to low lake levels and decreased at all sites in the late 1970s following a period of high lake levels. Typha increased at nearly all sites, except wave,exposed open embayments, in the 1970s. Meadow marsh continued to decrease and Typha to increase at most sites during sustained higher take levels through the 1980s, 1990s, and into 2001. Most vegetation changes could be correlated with lake-level changes and with life-history strategies and physiological tolerances to water depth of prominent taxa. Analyses of GIS coverages demonstrated that much of the Typha invasion was landward into meadow marsh, largely by Typha x glauca. Lesser expansion toward open water included both T. x glauca and T. angustifolia. Although many models focus on the seed bank as a key component of vegetative change in wetlands, our results suggest that canopy-dominating, moisture-requiring Typha was able to invade meadow marsh at higher elevations because sustained higher lake levels allowed it to survive and overtake sedges and grasses that can tolerate periods of drier sod conditions.

J	Boudell, JA; Stromberg, JC				Boudell, Jere A.; Stromberg, Juliet C.			Flood pulsing and metacommunity dynamics in a desert riparian ecosystem	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: 1. Does flood pulsing drive metacommunity dynamics and provide insurance against catastrophic flooding in desert southwestern riparian ecosystems? 2. Do upland and wetland species in the floodplain differ in their dynamics? Location: Southwestern USA. Methods: We sampled vegetation and propagule banks in four communities along a floodplain hydrogradient. Plant species were classified as wetland or upland and community wetland indicator scores were calculated. ANOVA tested for differences between data categories amongst communities ( extant vegetation and propagule banks) and soil depths. Sorensen's similarity coefficient was calculated to determine compositional similarity between vegetation and propagule banks. Results: Community propagule banks had high similarity indicating broad dispersal by flood waters. Wetland propagules were present in soils from channel bars to floodplain edges, despite declines in wetland vegetation with distance from channel. Wetland communities in propagule banks were dissimilar from those in vegetation except on channel bars. Upland species ( vegetation and propagule banks) increased with distance from channel. Propagules of upland species were most abundant in the litter, and were compositionally similar to upland species in most communities. Conclusions: Flood pulsing is one mechanism that drives spatiotemporal metacommunity dynamics in dynamic desert riparian ecosystems. The homogenized regional propagule bank created by flood pulsing provides wetland species with a mechanism to escape local extinction by allowing for recolonization after flooding creates suitable establishment conditions. Upland species are able to germinate from in-situ sources after small-scale flooding or rainfall moistens soil. In fluctuating environments, these dynamics sustain biodiversity in the face of ongoing environmental change.

Cryopreservation allows storage of the germplasm of some recalcitrant seeded species, but application to a wide range of plant diversity is still limited. The present work aimed at understanding the stresses that accompany the first steps in cryopreservation protocols, wounding and desiccation, both of which are likely to lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Extracellular ROS production was studied in isolated embryonic axes of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). Axis excision was accompanied by a burst of superoxide (O(2)(.-)), demonstrated by a colorimetric assay using epinephrine, electron spin resonance and staining with nitroblue tetrazolium. Superoxide was immediately produced on the cut surface after isolation of the axis from the seed, with an initial 'burst' in the first 5 min. Isolated axes subjected to variable levels of desiccation stress showed a decrease in viability and vigour and increased electrolyte leakage, indicative of impaired membrane integrity. The pattern of O(2)(.-) production showed a typical Gaussian pattern in response to increasing desiccation stress. The results indicate a complex interaction between excision and subsequent drying and are discussed with a view of manipulating ROS production for optimisation of cryopreservation protocols.

J	Nurse, RE; Cavers, PB				Nurse, Robert E.; Cavers, Paul B.			The germination characteristics of Scrophularia marilandica L. (Scrophulariaceae) seeds	PLANT ECOLOGY												Investigations on seeds of Scrophularia marilandica L. were undertaken to determine their germination requirements. Seeds were collected from three naturally occurring sites and one greenhouse-grown population in London, Ontario in September and October of 1997. Some were set to germinate immediately after collection; others were stored in or on soil outside and/or under controlled laboratory conditions before testing. Germination was assessed under two light/temperature regimes (35 degrees C 14 h light, 20 degrees C 10 h dark and 25 degrees C 14 h light, 10 degrees C 10 h dark), in continuous darkness, and in the presence of two germination-promoting chemicals (GA(3) and KNO(3)). Fresh seeds germinated best at 35/20 degrees C, while stored seeds germinated best at 25/10 degrees C. No differences in percent germination were found among three seed-maturity stages. All chemical treatments, except 0.01 M KNO(3,) increased percent germination. Significant differences were found both among and within sites for most chemical treatments, but exposure to 3 x 10(-4) M GA(3) caused almost every seed to germinate. When compared to the control, both the gibberellic acid and the soil-storage treatments contributed to faster germination. Exposure of seeds to naturally prevailing conditions on the soil surface followed by testing under the 25/10 degrees C regime produced the highest percent germination. No seeds germinated in the dark. In summary, seeds of S. marilandica exhibit physiological dormancy, which can be alleviated by exposure to light, after-ripening and/or cold stratification. It is probable that the differences in germination response among sites can be attributed to differences in environmental conditions during seed production. These experiments indicate that the seeds of S. marilandica must be buried shortly after dispersal in order to form a persistent seed bank.																	1385-0237					JUN	2008	196	2					185	196		10.1007/s11258-007-9343-4							WOS:000255197400003						
J	Honda, Y				Honda, Yukio			Ecological correlations between the persistence of the soil seed bank and several plant traits, including seed dormancy	PLANT ECOLOGY												It was empirically showed that seed size and life history correlate with the formation of a soil seed bank. Although no empirical data are available that indicate a close relationship between seed dormancy and the soil seed bank, dormancy has been considered essential to the formation of a soil seed bank. I have considered the formation of the soil seed bank and survival of seeds for more than a year in the soil, and the persistence and survival of the seed bank for more than 5 years. These periods were derived from the definition of a persistent seed bank and the criterion for seed banks of long-term persistence. Plant traits that are closely related to the formation or persistence of a seed bank and their relationships to dormancy were analysed using two pre-existing databases of seed longevity in soil and comparative ecology. The integrated database comprised 18 plant traits and seed bank formation or persistence data. This approach was used to identify more reliable general empirical rules. The results of a regression tree analysis and common statistical tests of plant traits indicated that only life history and seed size were closely related to seed bank formation, and dormancy was not essential for the formation and persistence of a seed bank. However, the contribution of dormancy differed slightly between dormancy types. Scarification or dry storage requirements to break dormancy slightly enhanced the formation and persistence of a seed bank, whereas a chilling requirement decreased the formation and persistence of a seed bank. In contrast, fluctuating temperature requirements clearly contributed to the formation and persistence of a seed bank.																	1385-0237					JUN	2008	196	2					301	309		10.1007/s11258-007-9360-3							WOS:000255197400013						
J	Montenegro, AL; Vargas, O				Lucia Montenegro, Alba; Vargas, Orlando			Vital traits of woody species in High Andean forest edges of the Cogua Forest Reserve (Colombia)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The Cogua Forest Reserve was studied throughout eight months to detect the existence of functional species-groups associated with edge wood forest. A second goal was to determine which species were the most successful in edge areas and their particular vital traits. The regeneration and growth of the forest patches to the adjacent matrix depends on the establishment of these species and their tolerance to both habitats. Three types of High Andean edge forest were studied. Two forest patches were chosen for each of the three edge types: Chusquea scandens edge, "paramune" and old-edge; the name of the latter was given because of its advanced successional state. In each patch, the vegetation was evaluated in two 60 m transects perpendicular to the edge and along the matrix-edge-interior gradient of the forest. All woody species were identified and counted to determine their abundance. A total of nine species were chosen as representative of High Andean forest edges in the reserve, because of their high abundance in this environment, their presence in both patches of each edge type and their ability to colonize the adjacent matrix. Each species was evaluated using 20 vital attributes of individual, leaf, and reproductive traits. Six species groups were found through a Correspondence Analysis. However, all nine species have high variation and plasticity levels for the attributes, even inside the groups. This trend suggests that while they arc not clearly differentiated functional groups, they probably are representing different strategies within a single functional group of great plasticity. Tibouchina grossa and Pentacalia Pulchella are found in all edge and matrix types; the other species are found in all edge types, except by Gaiadendron punctatum and Weinmannia tomentosa, absent in the Chusquea scandens edge. All nine species are important elements in the restoration of forest edges, mainly where they are more abundant, evidencing their success in the particular conditions of an edge type. Miconia ligustrina and M. squamulosa arc the most relevant species in the Chusquea scandens edge and matrix; while G. punctatum. P. pulchella, W. tomentoso, W. balbisiana and especially Macleania rupestris, are more important in the paramune edge and matrix; Hedyosmum bonplandianum is more important in the edge than in the matrix regeneration, while T grossa is the most successful edge and matrix regeneration species, because it is the most abundant and has high levels of tolerance, vegetative reproduction and litter production. These features are related with a high rate of tissue replacement, as well as a persistent seed bank with smaller and more numerous seeds, evidence of its high fecundity.																	0034-7744					JUN	2008	56	2					705	720									WOS:000259618700023	19256438

The role of seedbanks in restoration of floodplain woodlands	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					10th International Symposium on Regulated Streams	AUG, 2006	Stirling, SCOTLAND					Plant communities on the River Murray floodplain, South Australia, are degraded by flow regulation and salinization, with up to 95% of eucalypt trees being dead or dying from water stress. This paper describes the floodplain seed bank and its capacity to respond to floods or managed 'environmental flows'. The soil seed bank contained mainly annual native species, particularly chenopods, whereas the dominant trees, river red gum and black box (Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. largiflorens), retained most of their seeds in a canopy seed bank ('serotiny'). In healthy trees, seed release peaked in summer (December-February for river red gum, October-March for black box), but variable volumes suggested cyclical patterns in seed crops. Seed release, viability and germination rates did not appear to limit recruitment. In water-stressed trees, however, seed release was up to nine-fold less. Germination requires water from floods or local rainfall. Flow regulation has reduced flood frequencies and delayed timing, so that germination now is likely to be followed by relatively hot, dry conditions (summer). Following managed watering events, seeds accumulated in high-water strandlines, where they germinated readily under a mulch of organic litter, but survival was limited. The importance of local rainfall as a complementary water source was demonstrated, and survival rates were higher for rain-triggered germinants, compared to seedlings germinating in strandlines created by managed watering. Seedling survival would be greater if environmental flows were delivered to complement local rainfall or to extend the effect of short flood events.

Variations in farmer's seed and genebank accessions of Milagro Filipino rice (Oryza sativa L.) released in Mexico in 1967	SABRAO JOURNAL OF BREEDING AND GENETICS												Particles from farmer's field plots of Milagro Filipino (MF), the miracle rice (IR8) released in Mexico in 1967, were grown to produce MF lines and field-evaluated for three years to determine the phenotypic variation and compare the derived lines with IR8 accession (PI 312627) from the gene bank. Morpho-agronomic data such as plant height, length and width of flag leaf, numbers of filled and unfilled grain, seed length and width, 1000-seed weight, awn length, and grain yield were gathered. Twenty SSR markers were used to evaluate genotypic differences among the MF lines and to compare these lines with eight IR8 accessions from the gene bank. Results showed significant variation in plant height, seed length and width, 1000-seed weight, awn length, and total grain per particle, but not for particle length, flag leaf length and width, and grain yield. Most of the MF derived lines were comparable to IR8 in several traits. The SSR markers revealed genotypic variation as six of the 20 markers detected differences in 20 MF lines genotyped. Heterozygous loci in three markers were found in two IRS accessions and in one MF line. Fingerprints of 11 MF lines were similar to the five IR8 accessions (PI 338085, PI 400151, PI 408669, PI 431424 and PI 446985) obtained from the gene bank, while the remaining nine MF lines were similar to IR8 accession PI 312627. These results indicated that after 40 years, the MF seed samples were similar to IR8 seed stock released in 1966 and 1967, and the seed producer and seed bank curators we able to maintain these variabilities. This report documents the phenotypic and genotypic status of IR8 received by a gene bank and fanner seeds after forty years since its release in 1967.

SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The seed-bank dynamics of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asteraceae), an annual invasive plant introduced from North America to Europe, were studied in nine French populations developing in field crops, set-asides or wastelands. The vertical distribution of seeds was studied in two different depth sections (0-5 cm and 5-20 cm), and the spatial horizontal pattern of distribution was analysed for two selected field-crop and set-aside populations. The proportions of dormant, non-dormant and dead seeds, as well as the changes in seed-bank dormancy overtime, were evaluated. Natural seedling recruitment and its variation under different disturbance treatments in competitive set-asides were also studied. From 536 +/- 194 to 4477 +/- 717 seeds m(-2) were found in the living seed bank (0-20cm). The majority of seeds in field crops was found in the lower soil layer, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in set-asides and wastelands. Dormant seed proportions were low (0-18%) before natural germination, but then regularly increased. The seed bank of A. artemisiifolia was spatially aggregated irrespective of the extent of soil disturbance. On average, 23 +/- 12 to 292 +/- 62 seedlings M 2 were recorded, with densities lower in set-asides than in field crops and wastelands. Seedling densities were not correlated to upper seed densities except for two field crops. Soil disturbance and the removal of vegetation had positive effects on seedling recruitment in set-asides. Seed-bank dynamics appear to be crucial in the invasive success of A. artemisiifolia, and this knowledge will provide insights for the management of the species.																	0960-2585					JUN	2008	18	2					101	114		10.1017/S0960258508974316							WOS:000256154700005						
J	Wilcox, DA; Nichols, SJ				Wilcox, Douglas A.; Nichols, S. Jerrine			The effects of water-level fluctuations on vegetation in a Lake Huron wetland	WETLANDS												The diversity and resultant habitat value of wetland plant communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes are dependent on water-level fluctuations of varying frequency and amplitude. Conceptual models have described the response of vegetation to alternating high and low lake levels, but few quantitative studies have documented the changes that occur. In response to recent concerns over shoreline management activities during an ongoing period of low lake levels in lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron that began in 1999, we analyzed a quantitative data set from Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron collected from 1988 to 1993 during a previous lake-level decline to provide the needed information on vegetation responses. Transects were established that followed topographic contours with water-level histories that differed across a six-year period, ranging from barely flooded to dewatered for varying numbers of years to never dewatered. Percent cover data from randomly placed quadrats along those transects were analyzed to assess floristic changes over time, document development of distinct plant assemblages, and relate the results to lake-level changes. Ordinations showed that plant assemblages sorted out by transects that reflect differing water-level histories. Distinction of assemblages was maintained for at least three years, although the composition and positioning of those assemblages changed as lake levels changed. We present a model that uses orthogonal axes to plot transects by years out of water against distance above water and sorted those transects in a manner that matched ordination results. The model suggests that vegetation response following dewatering is dependent on both position along the water level/soil moisture gradient and length of time since dewatering. This study provided quantitative evidence that lake-level fluctuations drive vegetative change in Great Lakes wetlands, and it may assist in making decisions regarding shoreline management in areas that historically supported wetlands.																	0277-5212					JUN	2008	28	2					487	501		10.1672/07-129.1							WOS:000256445900019						
J	Hopfensperger, KN; Engelhardt, KAM				Hopfensperger, Kristine N.; Engelhardt, Katharina A. M.			Annual species abundance in a tidal freshwater marsh: Germination and survival across an elevational gradient	WETLANDS												Annual species contribute significantly to the standing biomass of tidal freshwater marshes, but they tend to be distributed unevenly along the elevation gradient, with higher surface elevations supporting greater densities of annual species. We explored the generation of this pattern by evaluating how different life history stages of annual species are related to elevation and to each other. In 2006, we counted seedlings emerging from the seed bank under optimal greenhouse conditions, as well as seedlings and mature stems of annual species in 38 plots located at different elevations in a tidal freshwater marsh near Alexandria, Virginia, USA. Annual species seedling and mature stem density increased with elevation of the marsh surface, but seed density did not change with elevation. Seeds of annual species germinated in saturated rather than flooded conditions (4.50 +/- 0.54 versus 1.66 +/- 0.26 species/greenhouse container +/- SE). Germination and survival from seedling to mature stem affected density of annual species across an elevational gradient, but the relative importance of either process differed by species. Amaranthus cannabinus was common and frequent in the seed bank (68% of all plots), and seed density increased with elevation, but seedlings and mature stems were infrequent at any elevation (21% and 5%, respectively), suggesting that germination is limiting its recruitment to standing vegetation. In contrast, Bidens laevis was uncommon in the seed bank (18% of all plots), but was frequently observed as seedlings and mature stems (55% and 34%, respectively). We therefore conclude that B. laevis recruitment was limited by its ephemeral seed bank. Impatiens capensis density did not appear to be limited by germination or survival to maturity as density of the species was high at all life history stages. Rather, its strong positive relationship with elevation at all life stages shows that I. capensis is limited by water inundation, particularly in spring when seeds require oxygen to germinate. Overall, we show that annual species increase in density at higher elevations in a tidal freshwater marsh, but that recruitment of each species may be limited by different intrinsic and extrinsic processes.

W.; Schurr, Frank M.; Jeltsch, Florian			Assessing the importance of seed immigration on coexistence of plant functional types in a species-rich ecosystem	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Modelling and empirical studies have shown that input from the regional seed pool is essential to maintain local species diversity However, most of these studies have concentrated on simplified, if not neutral, model systems, and focus on a limited subset of species or on aggregated measures of diversity only (e.g., species richness or Shannon diversity). Thus they ignore more complex species interactions and important differences between species. To gain a better understanding of how seed immigration affects community structure at the local scale in real communities we conducted computer simulation experiments based on plant functional types (PFTs) for a species-rich, fire-prone Mediterranean-type shrub-land in Western Australia. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to explore the community dynamics of 38 PFTs, defined by seven traits - regeneration mode, seed production, seed size, maximum crown diameter, drought tolerance, dispersal mode and seed bank type - representing 78 woody species. Model parameterisation is based on published and unpublished data on the population dynamics of shrub species collected over 18 years. Simulation experiments are based on two contrasting seed immigration scenarios: (1) the 'equal seed input number' scenario, where the number of immigrant seeds is the same for all PFTs, and (2) the 'equal seed input mass' scenario, where the cumulative mass of migrating seeds is the same for all PFTs. Both scenarios were systematically tested and compared for different overall seed input values. Without immigration the local community drifts towards a state with only 13 coexisting PFTs. With increasing immigration rates in terms of overall mass of seeds the simulated number of coexisting PFTs and Shannon diversity quickly approaches values observed in the field. The equal seed mass scenario resulted in a more diverse community than did the seed number scenario. The model successfully approximates the frequency distributions (relative densities) of all individual plant traits except seed size for scenarios associated with equal seed input mass and high immigration rate. However, no scenario satisfactorily approximated the frequency distribution for all traits in combination. Our results show that regional seed input can explain the more aggregated measures of local community structure, and some, but not all, aspects of community composition. This points to the possible importance of other (untested) processes and traits (e.g., dispersal vectors) operating at the local scale. Our modelling framework can readily allow new factors to be systematically investigated, which is a major advantage compared to previous simulation studies, as it allows us to find structurally realistic models, which can address questions pertinent to ecological theory and to conservation management.

Optimal intensity and age of management in young Aleppo pine stands for post-fire resilience	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												During the last few decades, the number of forest fires has been increasing in the Mediterranean Basin due to several factors, among others global warming. Large burned areas are promoting a higher number of naturally regenerated stands which are being poorly managed in general, causing the risk of new wildfires to increase. The most important conifer in dry areas is Pinus halepensis Mill., a well-adapted species to fire-prone habitats due to its high post-fire seeding capacity. High seedling density in the regenerated areas produces high inter-specific competition, which could induce low cone production related to an insufficient amount of seeds stored in the canopy for post-fire recolonization (immaturity risk); adequate young pine tree stand management is therefore required, mainly based on thinning and pruning. In this study different thinning intensities, with and without pruning, were tested in two Aleppo pine post-fire regenerated areas at 5 and 10 years after a fire event. Significant relationships between seed and cone characteristics to site, treatment, cone age and cone type were found. Also the relatively little importance of Aleppo pine seeds in the soil seed bank was checked. The optimal management strategies for Aleppo pine forests in good site quality 5 years after fire was a final density of 1600 trees ha(-1) (plus pruning after 5 years) or 800 trees ha(-1) as well as a final density of 800 trees ha(-1) plus pruning after 10 years. In poor site quality, the best method was no treatment or thinning to 1600 trees ha(-1) 5 years after fire plus pruning after another 5 years. This management policy can produce benefits in the reproductive processes of Aleppo pine after fire regeneration, as it shortens the juvenile phase and promotes a higher amount of closed cones stored in the canopy, thus increasing the canopy seed bank and reducing the immaturity risk.

Genetic structure and genetic diversity of surface populations and diaspore bank in the liverwort Mannia fragrans (Aytoniaceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Propagule banks are assumed to be able to store considerable genetic variability. Bryophyte populations are expected to rely more heavily on stored propagules than those of seed plants due to the vulnerability of the haploid gametophyte. This reliance has important implications for the genetic structure and evolutionary potential of surface populations. A liverwort, Mannia fragrans, was used to test whether the bryophyte diaspore bank functions as a "genetic memory." If a diaspore bank is capable of conserving genetic variability over generations, the levels of genetic diversity in the soil are expected to be similar or higher than at the surface. Surface and diaspore bank constituents of two populations of M. fragrans were investigated. Genetic structure and diversity measured as unbiased heterozygosity were analyzed using three ISSR markers. Similar genetic diversities were found in the soil (H(s) = 0.067) and at the surface (H(s)= 0.082). However, more haplotypes and specific haplotype lineages were present in soil samples. The results suggest that the bryophyte diaspore bank has an important role in accumulating genetic variability over generations and seasons. It is postulated that the role of the diaspore bank as a "genetic memory" is especially important in species of temporarily available habitats that have long-lived spores and genetically variable populations.																	0002-9122					MAY	2008	95	5					542	548		10.3732/ajb.2007283							WOS:000255445700003	21632380					
J	Jarvis, JC; Moore, KA				Jarvis, Jessie C.; Moore, Kenneth A.			Influence of environmental factors on Vallisneria americana seed germination	AQUATIC BOTANY												Over the course of a growing season (April-October) water quality (water temperature, light, salinity, dissolved oxygen) and reproductive phenology (biomass, production of flowering shoots and seed pods, seed bank densities) were quantified in three Vallisneria americana beds in Nanjemoy Creek, MD, a tributary to the Chesapeake Bay. Clonal production of V americana biomass increased at all sites when water temperatures rose above 25 degrees C. Flowering occurred during peak biomass (August-September) and resulted in the production of up to 16,000 seeds m(-2) at the end of the growing season. However, observed seed bank densities represented <1% of seed production. Laboratory experiments quantified the effects of dissolved oxygen (0.29-8.00 mg l(-1)), light (0-160 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), temperature (13-29 degrees C), salinity (0.1-17.4 psu), sediment composition (3-86% sand; 0.9-8.3% sediment organic content), and burial depth (0.2-10 cm) on V americana seed germination. Germination of V americana seeds was enhanced (greater overall germination and shorter time to germination) under oxygenated conditions (8.00 mg l(-1)), temperatures >22 degrees C, salinities of <1 psu, in sediments composed of <= 3% organic content and >40% sand. Light (<160 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and burial depth (0.2-10cm) significant effects on germination. Temperatures most favorable for seed germination (>22 degrees C) occurred in June, 2 months in the growing season just prior to development of peak vegetative standing stock. Seedlings were therefore at a distinct disadvantage to plants developed from over wintering buds. A lack of viable seed retention and inadequate environmental conditions at critical times in the growing season may be limiting seed germination success and subsequent seedling establishment within V americana beds in the Chesapeake Bay. However, ungerminated seeds were found to maintain high viability, especially at salinities of 10 psu that can have significant negative effects of shoot growth survival. This suggests that seeds may serve as a source of reproductive material for bed recovery after periods of drought or other stressful conditions in estuarine systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Woody plant encroachment reduces species richness of herb-rich woodlands in southern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Woody plants have been increasing in many woodland and savanna ecosystems owing to land use changes in recent decades. We examined the effects of encroachment by the indigenous shrub Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae) on herb-rich Eucalyptus camaldulensis woodlands in southern Australia. Species richness and compositional patterns were examined under the canopy of L. scoparium and in surrounding open areas to determine the species most susceptible to structural changes. Richness was significantly lower in areas of moderate to high L. scoparium cover (> 15%), suggesting that a threshold shrub cover caused major change in this ecosystem. Shrubs were associated with a significant reduction in above-ground biomass of the ground-layer flora and a significant shift in community composition. The few species that were positively associated with high L. scoparium cover were also common in the woodland flora; no new species were recorded under the shrub canopy. Important environmental changes associated with L. scoparium cover were decreased light availability and increased litter cover, which were likely a consequence of encroachment. Leptospermum scoparium cover was also associated with greater surface soil moisture, which may be a consequence of increased shading under the shrub canopy or indicate favourable soil conditions for L. scoparium establishment. Reductions in species richness and abundance of the germinable seed bank were found in soil samples taken from under L. scoparium. With ongoing recruitment of L. scoparium and consequent increases in shrub cover, ground-layer diversity in these species-rich woodlands should continue to decline over time.

J	Chee-Sanford, JC				Chee-Sanford, Joanne C.			Weed seeds as nutritional resources for soil Ascomycota and characterization of specific associations between plant and fungal species	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												Current interest in biological-based management of weed seed banks in agriculture furthers the need to understand how microorganisms affect seed fate in soil. Many annual weeds produce seeds in high abundance; their dispersal presenting ready opportunity for interactions with soil-borne microorganisms. In this study, we investigated seeds of four common broadleaf weeds, velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), woolly cupgrass (Eriochloa villosa), Pennsylvania smartweed (Polygonum pensylvanicum), and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), for potential as sources of carbon nutrition for soil fungi. Seeds, as the major source of carbon in an agar matrix, were exposed to microbial populations derived from four different soils for 2 months. Most seeds were heavily colonized, and the predominant 18S rRNA gene sequences cloned from these assemblages were primarily affiliated with Ascomycota. Further, certain fungi corresponded to weed species, regardless of soil population. Relatives of Chaetomium globosum (98-99% sequence identity) and Cordyceps sinensis (99%) were found to be associated with seeds of woolly cupgrass and Pennsylvania smartweed, respectively. More diverse fungi were associated with velvetleaf seeds, which were highly susceptible to decay. The velvetleaf seed associations were dominated by relatives of Cephaliophora tropica (98-99%). In contrast to the other species, only few giant ragweed seeds were heavily colonized, but those that were colonized resulted in seed decay. The results showed that seeds could provide significant nutritional resources for saprophytic microbes, given the extant populations can overcome intrinsic seed defenses against microbial antagonism. Further, weed species-specific associations may occur with certain fungi, with nutritional benefits conferred to microorganisms that may not always result in seed biodeterioration.																	0178-2762					MAY	2008	44	5					763	771		10.1007/s00374-007-0259-x							WOS:000255680700009

This monocot plant produces a large number of dormant seeds in order to make a large deposit to seed bank in the soil. Under laboratory conditions, surface-sterilized X. complanata seeds are rarely able to germinate on sterilized peat moss bed; they require inoculation with either seed epiphytic or soil fungi to facilitate active seed germination. In the present study, three different genera of seed epiphytic fungi were isolated, and two common fungal genera, Fusarium sp. (strain R-1) and Penicillium sp. (strain Y-1), were found to promote seed germination of X. complanata. In sterile peat moss beds, the germination-stimulating fungi also showed growth-promoting effects on X. complanata seedlings. These results suggest that the seed germination-promoting fungi likely function as genuine partners for X. complanata in tropical open peat lands.

Impact of Formica exsecta Nyl. on seed bank and vegetation patterns in a subalpine grassland ecosystem	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												The mound building ant Formica exsecta Nyl. is widely distributed in grassland ecosystems of the Central European Alps. We studied the impact of these ants on seed bank and vegetation patterns in a 11 ha subalpine grassland, where we counted over 700 active ant mounds. The mounds showed a distinct spatial distribution with most of them being located in tall-grass, which was rarely visited by ungulates (red deer; Cervus elaphus L.). Heavily grazed short-grass, in contrast, seemed to be completely avoided by ants as only few mounds were found in this vegetation type. The species composition of the ant mound and grassland seed banks was quite similar, i.e. from 15 common plant species 12 were found in both seed bank types. We found the same proportions of myrmecochorous seeds in ant mound and grassland soil samples. In contrast, the number of seeds was 15 times higher in mound compared with the grassland soil samples. Also, the vegetation growing on ant mounds significantly differed from the vegetation outside the mounds: graminoids dominated on ant mounds, herbaceous and myrmecochorous species in the grassland vegetation. We found significant continuous changes in vegetation composition on gradients from the ant mound centre to 1 m away from the mound edge. Overall, F. exsecta was found to have a considerable impact on seed bank and vegetation patterns in the grassland ecosystem studied. These insects not only altered grassland characteristics in the close surrounding of their mounds, but also seem to affect the entire ecosystem including, for example, the spatial use of the grassland by red deer.

J	Paula, S; Pausas, JG				Paula, S.; Pausas, J. G.			Burning seeds: germinative response to heat treatments in relation to resprouting ability	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. In Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems, plant species persist and regenerate after fire by resprouting, by recruiting new individuals from a seed bank (post-fire seeding), or by both resprouting and post-fire seeding. Since species with resprouting ability are already able to persist in fire-prone ecosystems, we hypothesize that they have been subjected to lower evolutionary pressure to acquire traits allowing or enhancing post-fire recruitment. Consequently, we predict that the germination of non-resprouters is more likely to be increased or at least unaffected by heat than the germination of resprouters. 2. To test this hypothesis we compiled published experiments carried out in Mediterranean Basin species where seeds were exposed to different heat treatments. We compared the probability of heat-tolerant germination (i.e. heated seeds had greater or equal germination than the control), the probability of heat-stimulated germination (i.e. heated seeds had greater germination than the control) and the stimulation magnitude (differences in proportion of germination of the heated seeds in relation to the untreated seeds, for heat-stimulated treatments) between resprouters and non-resprouters. 3. Non-resprouters showed higher probability of heat-tolerance, higher probability of heat-stimulation and higher stimulation magnitude even when phylogenetic relatedness was considered. Differences between life-forms and post-fire seeding ability do not explain this pattern. 4. Non-resprouters appear to have a greater capacity to both (i) persist after fire by means of recruiting (greater heat-tolerance) and (ii) increase their population after fire (greater heat-stimulated germination), than resprouters. 5. Synthesis. Our results contribute to understanding the factors that condition the evolution of fire-persistence plant traits and support the hypothesis that resprouting and post-fire recruitment are negatively associated in Mediterranean Basin flora.

J	Gurnell, A; Thompson, K; Goodson, J; Moggridge, H				Gurnell, Angela; Thompson, Ken; Goodson, Joanne; Moggridge, Helen			Propagule deposition along river margins: linking hydrology and ecology	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Research has highlighted the importance of buoyancy for hydrochorous propagule dispersal, but recently the river bed has been identified as a significant store of viable propagules. 2. Over four consecutive 4-month periods, deposited propagules (predominantly seeds) and sediment were sampled at 78 river bed, bank face and bank top sites within three river reaches in two catchments. Species of deposited propagules were compared with the propagule bank and standing vegetation to identify 'new' species. 3. Forty-four percent of deposited propagule species were not present in the vegetation and the largest proportions were deposited in winter. New propagules showed a higher proportion of species that establish long-term seed banks and produce light seeds, a higher proportion of R-strategists, and a lower proportion of C-strategists than species in the vegetation. 4. Ordination of propagule species abundance data revealed differences in samples between reaches; bed and bank locations; and sampling periods. Within depositional samples there were significant positive correlations between average C scores and the proportion of species producing relatively heavy, short-lived seeds and scores on an ordination axis describing a gradient from channel bed to bank top. 5. Correlations and multiple regression models between species richness and abundance of deposited propagules (total and new), and the quantity and calibre of river-deposited sediment, demonstrated a direct link between propagule deposition and hydraulic conditions during inundation. 6. Synthesis. Riparian connectivity of river flows, varying hydraulic conditions and temporary storage of propagules are all complex components of hydrochorous propagule dispersal in the study reaches. Flood flows can transfer sediment particles and non-buoyant, viable propagules from the river into the riparian zone. Propagules can pass in and out of storage within the channel bed and margins through a variety of dispersal processes and can then settle out of the water in suitable depositional environments generating distinct spatial and temporal patterns in total propagule deposition. New propagules show greatest floristic similarity to propagule bank and bed samples. They are preferentially smaller, lighter and form longer term seed banks, making them particularly suitable for long distance transport over prolonged time periods and for widespread dispersal across river margins.																	0022-0477					MAY	2008	96	3					553	565		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01358.x							WOS:000254951400016						
J	Zang, RG; Ding, Y; Zhang, WY				Zang, Run-Guo; Ding, Yi; Zhang, Wei-Yin			Seed dynamics in relation to gaps in a tropical montane rainforest of Hainan Island, South China: (II) seed bank	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY												Spatial and temporal patterns of seed bank dynamics in relation to gaps in an old growth tropical montane rainforest of Hainan Island, South China, were studied over two consecutive years. From June 2001 to June 2003, soil seed bank sampling blocks were taken near each of the four sides of each seed trap and immediately put into a nursery for observation of seedling emergence dynamics in four seasons (each experiment in each season). The abundances of seedlings that emerged from seed banks showed the trend of vine functional group (VFG) > shrub functional group (SFG) > tree functional group (TFG) > herb functional group (HFG), but the trend in species richness of seedlings that emerged from the soil seed banks was TFG > VFG > SFG > HFG. The abundances of seedlings that emerged from seed banks in the three gap zones showed no significant differences, but significant differences did exist for the species richness. The time of sampling or seasons of experiments had significant influences on both the species richness and seedling abundances. The seedling emergence processes of each experiment all revealed the unimodal patterns. Few emergences occurred 1 year after each experiment. Compared with those under closed canopies, the recruitment rates from seed to seedlings and from seedlings to saplings in gaps were higher, but the mortality rates from saplings to big trees were also higher in the gaps.

J	Casco, H; Dias, AS; Dias, LS				Casco, Hugo; Dias, Alexandra Soveral; Dias, Luis Silva			Modeling size-number distributions of seeds for use in soil bank studies	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY												Knowledge of soil seed banks is essential to understand the dynamics of plant populations and communities and would greatly benefit from the integration of existing knowledge on ecological correlations of seed size and shape. The present study aims to establish a feasible and meaningful method to describe size-number distributions of seeds in multi-species situations. For that purpose, size-number distributions of seeds with known length, width and thickness were determined by sequential sieving. The most appropriate combination of sieves and seeds dimensions was established, and the adequacy of the power function and the Weibull model to describe size-number distributions of spherical, non-spherical, and all seeds was investigated. We found that the geometric mean of seed length, width and thickness was the most adequate size estimator, providing shape-independent measures of seeds volume directly related to sieves mesh side, and that both the power function and the Weibull model provide high quality descriptions of size-number distributions of spherical, non-spherical, and all seeds. We also found that, in spite of its slightly lower accuracy, the power function is, at this stage, a more trustworthy model to characterize size-number distributions of seeds in soil banks because in some Weibull equations the estimates of the scale parameter were not acceptable.																	1672-9072					MAY	2008	50	5					531	535		10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00659.x							WOS:000255464400003	18713420

Breaking life cycle of Common Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) to exhaust seed bank. I. Efficiency and optimisation of various mowing schemes	REVUE SUISSE D AGRICULTURE												Common Ragweed is becoming an increasing source of concern in Switzerland, notably because of the allergenic nature of its pollen. As a result, the control of this species is not simply targeted on arable land but indeed on every invaded site. Thus, it is necessary to develop techniques that break the life cycle of this plant in order to stop any further seed production. This article describes and discusses results from experiments using mowing solely. This approach is particularly helpful for sites where the application of herbicide is insuitable, like road verges, gravel pits, nature reserves, and river banks. As certain years a single mowing at the beginning of September was sufficient to break the plant life cycle, for others it was not efficient enough. Thus, a single mowing strategy clearly proves to be inefficient for long term clearing of invaded sites. Actually, even the implementation of two mowings cannot guarantee a totally successful break of the plant life cycle; however, it strongly reduces seed production. On the basis of the best results obtained, a first intervention at mid-August followed by a second at the end of September can be recommended.
